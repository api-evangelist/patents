title: Churn analysis system
abstract: A churn analysis system helps a business analyze, predict, and reduce customer churn. The system analyzes customer experiences by using an insightful block level approach to correlate customer experience with customer churn. Through the block level approach, the system is able to more accurately predict and effectively reduce future customer churn. As a result, businesses are able to reduce customer acquisition costs and improve customer retention rates.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","TECHNICAL FIELD","RELATED ART","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/529,747, filed Aug. 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.","This disclosure relates to analyzing, predicting, and reducing customer churn. In particular, this disclosure relates to analyzing customer experience, determining customer churn, and correlating customer experience with customer churn to predict and reduce future customer churn.","Customers may interact with service providers across a variety of channels, including, for example, call centers, retail stores, web sites, email, social media, and self-service technology (such as interactive voice response). A customer's experience through any one, or any combination, of these channels often affects the customer's overall satisfaction with the service provider. Customer satisfaction, in turn, determines whether the customer will look for alternative service providers, or continue to stay with the current service provider. Because the cost of retaining customers is much lower than the cost of acquiring new customers, service providers have a strong incentive to develop programs and incentives aimed at retaining customers. Service providers are constantly looking for effective tools to understand their customers, improve customer retention rates, reduce customer acquisition costs, and boost market share. Not all customers have the same propensity to churn. By identifying customers who are most likely to churn, service providers may reduce customer retention costs and develop customer retention programs and incentives that have the highest impact at the lowest cost.","Service providers need to be able to identify and address root causes of customer attrition and apply targeted treatment strategies to improve the customer experience. The root causes of customer churn can be hard to trace. The causes may lie virtually anywhere, for example buried in negative experiences associated with any one of multiple interactions. In order to improve and sustain customer retention rates over time, companies must improve the customer experience of all these interactions. But in enterprises where customers have millions of monthly interactions, across a variety of channels, it is difficult to identify all the interactions. It may be even more difficult to determine which interactions drive churn, especially when customer interaction data records are usually contained in different systems that do not communicate with one another and are collected in varying data formats.","In today's highly competitive market, customers do not hesitate to switch providers to find the most competitive pricing, the best value for their money, and high quality service. The development of social media as the ultimate word-of-mouth communication has greatly increased the speed and magnitude of influence of individual switching decisions. In other words, one customer's decision to switch providers may influence more customers and more quickly through today's many channels of social media. Moreover, in many industries, customers perceive very few barriers to switching in their constant quest for differentiated offerings.","A need has long existed to address the problems noted above and others previously experienced.","A churn analysis system collects cross-channel customer experience data, correlates cross-channel customer experience data with customer churn, and determines a customer's propensity to churn based on the correlations. The system collects customer interaction data for each customer interaction between an individual customer and a service provider. The system tracks churn data, such as date and time of churn, for the individual customer and creates customer experience blocks from the customer interaction data. The system further stores the customer experience blocks in unified service analytic records and determines correlations between customer churn and customer interaction data. Based on the correlations, the system determines customer propensity to churn based on the customer's interaction data. The system may measure propensity to churn as, for example, a Customer Churn Index (CCI). In this way, the system predicts the customer's propensity to churn before the churn occurs and identifies opportunities for retaining customers. Using the propensity to churn measure, a service provider may monitor an average or total customer churn rate to determine effectiveness of churn reduction initiatives.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","111","112","113","114","115","116","120","130","120","130","130","131","131","132","130","140","140","141","130","141","140","134","141"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","100","200","200","202","204","206","208","210"]},"A USAR may be a cross-channel customer experience data model that provides an end-to-end view of customers' experiences with a service provider. Customer experiences may include customer contacts, interactions, transactions, or other involvements with a service provider. The USAR may logically integrate data from disparate sources with clear relationships and intuitive ability to navigate. The USAR may integrate data from multiple systems into one environment. The USAR may enable determination of causal data from business results without multiple iterations of reporting requests, dramatically reducing the time required to research the true \u201cwhy\u201d of business results. The USAR may include cost data analysis, which may enable initiative prioritization based on true understanding of overall impact and costs (e.g. cost to serve, churn, etc.). The USAR may integrate cross-channel data to provide a centralized customer experience intelligence platform. The USAR may be a scaling and efficient solution to implement a customer churn index across an entire customer base, which will provide capability to automate a customer score basis.","The USAR may be a collection of one or more customer experience blocks. A customer experience block  may include a group of customer interaction data, ordered chronologically. Each customer experience block  may include a plurality of attributes describing the customer experience block and a plurality of attributes describing each of the customer interactions within the customer experience block.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","301","302","303","304","305"]},"Voluntary churn (C) may be a function of Product Quality (Q), Price Sensitivity (P), and Customer Experience (E): C=f(Q, P, E). The churn analysis system  may employ a data driven discovery approach to gain intelligence on customer pain points or dissatisfaction in their interactions with the service provider and prioritize hypotheses for pilots. Pilots may be, for example, proposed programs or initiatives designed to increase customer retention, or decrease churn. Pilots may be based, for example, on hypotheses regarding the effects of customer contacts and interactions on overall customer experience and customer propensity to churn. The system may also provide ongoing churn intelligence support to measure the effectiveness of pilots and their specific effects on voluntary churn and customer experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","130","401","402","403","401","402","403","403","404"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","130","501","502","503","501","502","504","130","505","506","506","507","508","509"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","130","130","610","130","620","130","630","650","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","130","702","702","704","706","708"]},"For example, an internet service provider may look at historical data regarding customer calls to a customer service call center to resolve internet connectivity issues. Based on the historical data, the internet service provider may determine, on average, that if a customer does not call back within 7 days regarding the same issue, the issue has been resolved. Thus, the internet service provider may determine that an issue may be considered resolved if a customer does not call back within a resolution threshold, such as 7 days, of a previous call. Then, the internet service provider may set the maximum contact intensity X to the resolution threshold of 7 days, or 168 hours.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","130","802","804","806","808"]},"Where the resolution threshold is determined as the maximum contact intensity, a Corollary of Maximum Intensity may be derived, such that every consecutive interaction within a customer experience block is within X hours from each other, chronologically or reverse chronologically.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 9","i":"a ","b":["900","901","902","903","904","905"]},"Continuing with the example in , customer experience block  has three interactions with a customer identified as CCCCCCC: an interaction on 9 Jan. 2011, which was a first contact and unresolved contact; an interaction on 12 Jan. 2011, which was a repeat contact and unresolved contact; and an interaction on 17 Jan. 2011, which was a repeat contact and resolved contact.","Customer experience blocks may be further described as follows. A customer experience block is considered \u201copen\u201d if, at a current point in time, the block does not end with a resolved contact. A customer experience block is considered \u201cclosed\u201d if, at a current point in time, the block ends with a resolved contact. A repeat customer experience block is a customer experience block with more than one contact. A first contact resolved customer experience block is a closed customer experience block with only one contact. For example, in , customer experience block  is a first contact resolved customer experience block.","The churn analysis system  may include a churn prediction model  that has predictive and analytic capabilities. The system may use statistical tools to develop predictive models that examine and uncover relationships between historical customer data, channels of interaction and customer experience block-level attributes imbedded in churned and current customer segments.","The churn analysis system  may create the churn prediction model  based on USAR attributes and USAR derived metrics, including interaction metrics and block metrics. For example, a USAR may include a plurality of unique customer experience blocks; and each customer experience block may include a plurality of unique customer interactions. USAR attributes may include properties of interactions, properties of blocks, data elements that are captured from customer interactions, and\/or metrics that are calculated or derived from the properties and\/or data elements.","Attributes may be numeric or alphanumeric, whereas metrics are generally measureable values. The churn analysis system  may calculate an interaction metric for each unique interaction (e.g., session time), independent of the other interactions in the customer experience block. A block metric may relate to all interactions in the customer experience block (e.g., number of interactions in block).","Interaction attributes and metrics may include, for example: Row Index (a unique key for every interaction in the USAR); Channel (a flag value indicating the native channel of the interaction, for example, R=retail, T=Technical Support); Session Time (calculated as a period of time equal to the end time of the interaction (generally a transaction or case session end time) minus the start time of the interaction (generally a transaction or case session start time)); Adjusted Session Time (calculated using the same logic as Session Time, but the end time portion is adjusted to account for any transactions or sessions where the end time is inaccurately captured (e.g., an agent doesn't promptly close a session after a call); and when a subsequent transaction or session is handled by the same agent, and the start time of the subsequent transaction or session is before the end time of the current session, the end time of the current session is adjusted to equal the start time of the subsequent transaction or session); Date Key (calculated as a numeric value based on the start time of the interaction (e.g., Jan. 5, 2011 would be represented as 01052011)); Month Key (calculated as a numeric value based on the start time of the interaction (e.g., Jan. 5, 2011 would be represented as 012011)); Churn 30 Day Flag (a 1\/0 flag indicating if the customer churned from the company within 30 days of the start time of the interaction); and Churn 60 Day Flag (a 1\/0 flag indicating if the customer churned from the company within 60 days of the start time of the interaction).","Block attributes and metrics may include, for example: Block Index (a unique key for every customer interaction block in the USAR); First Interaction Flag (a 1\/0 flag indicating if the interaction is the first interaction in the block, \u201cfirst interaction\u201d being defined as any interaction where there is no previous interaction from the same customer within X days); Resolved Flag (a 1\/0 flag indicating if the interaction is the last interaction in the block, \u201clast interaction\u201d being defined as any interaction where there is no subsequent interaction from the same customer within X days); Interaction Sequence Number (number indicating the location of the current interaction within the block (e.g., for a four-interaction block, the first interaction would be indicated by 1, the second would be indicated by 2, and so on); Time to Next Interaction (the amount of time until the next interaction in the block); Time Since Previous Interaction; (the amount of time since the previous interaction in the block); Next Interaction Reason (the interaction reason for the next interaction in the block); Previous Interaction Reason (the interaction reason for the previous interaction in the block); Agents In Block (the total number of distinct agents or employees involved in the block of interactions); Agent Ownership Flag (a 1\/0 flag indicating if all the interactions in the block were handled by the same agent or the same employee; for cross-channel blocks, this will generally be 0, which indicates No); Transferred Flag (a 1\/0 flag indicating if the interaction resulted in a transfer, calculated as a subsequent interaction in the same channel with a start time within five minutes of the end time of the current interaction); Interactions Per Block (the count of the total number of interactions in the block); Minutes Per Block (calculated as the sum number of minutes (from sessions time or adjusted session time) for all interactions in the block); Days Per Block (the number of days between the start date of the first interaction in the block, and end date of the last interaction in the block); Block Path (depicts the path the customer went through in the block of interactions (e.g., if the block consists of four interactions, first Retail, then Technical Support, then back to Retail twice, the Block Path would be RTRR)); Channels In Block (counts the number of unique channels the customer touched in the block); and Average Intensity (calculated as the average time between each interaction in the block).","Attributes and metrics may vary depending on the channel of interaction, industry of the service provider, or business objectives. For example, if a customer calls a customer service call center, the service provider may track the start and end time of the call, the reason for the call and the identity of the customer service representative who handles the call. If a customer purchases or exchanges a mobile phone at a retail store, the retail store may track the date and time of the transaction, a description of any purchased or exchanged devices, and the store number and sales representative who serviced the customer.","The following tables show examples of USAR attributes that the system may process.

The metrics may include, for example, Agents Per Call, Agents Per Resolution, Contacts Per Resolution, and\/or Time Per Resolution. The data collected from the USAR may vary depending on business objectives and channels of interaction. Segmenting churn pockets may comprise identifying a combination of one or more block attributes or interaction attributes, which, when analyzed together, correlate with a particularly high or low churn rate. The churn analysis system  may segment churn pockets according to other metrics or attributes disclosed, or any other metrics or attributes that may be relevant to churn analysis. The churn analysis system  may derive or calculate metrics, such as cross-channel USAR metrics, from interactions that occur through more than one channel of interaction.","The data analysis of step  may provide understanding of business problems and enable conversion of problems into statistical analysis. For example, step  may provide an understanding of subscriber-level churn drivers, interaction-level churn drivers, and block level-churn drivers. Subscriber-level churn drivers may include, for example, subscriber attributes, such as, the subscriber's age, income level, geographic location or marriage status. Interaction-level and block-level churn drivers may include, for example, interaction attributes as shown in the tables above and below.","In step , exploratory analysis may comprise correlation analysis and factor analysis. This step may comprise analyzing, based on historical data, channel-specific attribute correlations; cross-channel attribute correlations; channel-specific attribute principle components; and cross-channel attribute components. Channel-specific attribute correlation analysis may comprise determining whether independent channel-specific attributes affect churn rate. Examples of channel-specific attributes may include: number of visits to a store per block (for retail store interactions), number of calls per block (for a technical support call center), or number of views per page (for website interactions). The system may determine, for example, that the number of calls per block has a positive correlation with churn rate. The system may utilize a statistical analysis software program, such as SPSS, to determine correlations for each attribute. Cross-channel attribute correlation analysis may similarly comprise determining whether independent cross-channel attributes, such as number of interactions per block or number of agents per block, affect churn rate.","Channel-specific attribute principle component analysis may comprise determining the relative weight of each channel-specific attribute with respect to its effect on churn rate. In other words, this analysis may include comparing the effect of one channel-specific attribute to the effect of another channel-specific attribute and determining which attribute has a greater effect on churn rate. The system may use a statistical analysis software program to determine the relative effect, or the appropriate weight of each channel-specific attribute.","Cross-channel attribute component analysis may comprise determining the relative weight of each cross-channel attribute with respect to its effect on churn rate. In other words, this analysis may include comparing the effect of one cross-channel attribute to the effect of another cross-channel attribute and determining which attribute has a greater effect on churn rate. The system may use a statistical analysis software program to determine the relative effect, or the appropriate weight of each cross-channel attribute.","In step , confirmatory analysis may comprise using logistic regression, or Cox regression, to confirm the correlations determined in step . Logistic regression may comprise: classifying customers as churned or current customers; extracting data for a statistically representative sample of customers to be used as a test population (e.g., 20% of population of churned and current subscribers); extracting data for a statistically representative sample of customers to be used as a control population (e.g., 20% of population of churned and current subscribers); using USAR metrics as independent variables to predict subscriber churning status (1 or 0), as a dependent variable; performing analyses to create a best fit equation with coefficients, or independent variables, explaining customer churn, or dependent variables; verifying that the coefficients meet significance criteria, which may be 0.5 or another value determined from the type of regression used; verifying that the overall model diagnostics and statistics are within acceptance criteria, which may be subjective to the sample and nature of data. As an example, a dependent variable when predicted, will give an outcome of 0 or 1 representative of subscriber classification. As another example, a best fit equation, when created, will classify a subscriber as 1 or 0, based on the interaction and relationship with the independent variables, or metrics. The churn analysis system  may use logistic regression to predict future classification of subscribers based on the cross-channel experience attributes.","In step , model testing may comprise testing a model for accuracy and calibrating the model, which helps to ensure that the model effectively predicts customer propensity to churn, or other statistics of interest to a service provider. Key criteria are evaluated to create a measure of competency and accuracy. For example, the system  may use a Likelihood-Ratio Test to test for overall model fit at a levered significance of 0.05. Additionally or alternatively, the system  may use a Wald Test to test for the relationship between experience attributes (e.g. time to resolution) and the churn outcome at a levered significance of 0.05; or a Score Test to test for acceptance of a variable into the churn model. The system may also perform residual testing and variance analysis to test a model for accuracy and to calibrate the model. Block level metrics may be used in the correlation, regression, and churn propensity score development.","In step , refitting or model scoring involves iterations of implementing changes and influences from the model testing step to ensure model accuracy. Overall, this step predicts classification of customers as future churners or not. Churners are classified as 1 and current customers as 0. The churn analysis system may apply a best fit equation to experience attributes in the form of, for example, Log(P\/(1\u2212P))=Constant +B(x1)+B2(x2) . . . Bz(xz), where P is a value between 0 and 1 representing the log odds ratio of churning, and B, B2, . . . Bz are coefficients of the metrics. The churn analysis system  may apply metrics, including block metrics and interaction metrics, from the control population to the equation to determine whether the equation accurately classifies subscriber status. Then, the system may run analysis to create a best fit equation with coefficients explanatory of customer status based on experience attributes. As an example, the dependent variable when predicted, may give an outcome of 0 or 1 representative of customer classification. As another example, the dependent variable, when predicted, will give a log odds ratio between 0 and 1 as subscriber classification. Finally, normalizing all CCI scores from the customer base may create quartile estimates of customers at risk of churning. Model scoring may further comprise block analysis, random sample generation, testing subset designs (e.g., creating churn and active groups for testing and trending), correlation analysis (identify, verify, and refine experience drivers), hypotheses development (identify initial drivers for testing), regression analysis (validating drivers thru initial robust response analysis), and model evaluation (residual analysis and model testing).","The churn prediction model  may provide a method for evaluating a customer's propensity to churn by deriving a customer churn index (CCI) through a statistical equation. The model may comprise an optimized equation that assigns a CCI score to each individual customer, where the CCI score reflects causative interactions between churn and historical data and may also reflect churn propensity. The churn prediction model  may comprise, for example, a linear equation created by analyzing a combination of variables representing customer, channel and experience attributes. The churn analysis system may use the linear equation to assign a CCI score between 0 and 1 (a churn propensity scale where 0 and 1 are least and highest churn risks respectively) to each customer. The CCI score for an individual customer shows how the factors that affect the customer's decision to churn combine to create a greater or lesser churn propensity.","The CCI scores for individual customers may also be accumulated, averaged, and otherwise manipulated to reveal trends in the behavior of individual customers and groups of customers. This may enable a service provider, for example, to predict which customer or group of customers has a high propensity to churn. The churn analysis system may examine causative relationships underlying the predictive model to determine which attributes drive the highest CCI scores. This may provide a more targeted ownership process to addressing issues of churn.","The churn analysis system may provide customer service representatives with an individual customer's CCI score while speaking with the customer. This may alert the representative of customers with high CCI scores and allow the customer service representative to respond more appropriately to prevent the customer from churning.","The composite of CCIs for an entire population of customers may provide a method for determining the propensity to churn for the entire customer base. Therefore, an enterprise-wide CCI can provide a good measure of the overall health and effectiveness of churn prevention activities.","In an example of an implementation of the system and methods disclosed, a user may use the system to perform an iterative process of identifying, prioritizing, and testing hypotheses.

The pilot may also offer remote access set-up alternatively or in addition to device education. Device education may be provided, for example, through flyers or other printed materials, emails, web application instant messages, or websites. Implementation of the pilot may include, for example, training and branding agents as device education experts, implementation of performance management initiatives, and completing customer surveys to monitor branding, device education offer rate, and device education acceptance. Customer surveys may be provided through SMS, websites, social media or other channels of interaction.","The system may use a USAR to create a prioritization model based principle factors to measure cost of a \u201cfailure point\u201d where resolution was not achieved. Three factors may include, for example, Customer Satisfaction, Customer Sensitivity; and Impact\/Cost of Resolution. The prioritization model may continuously gauge the health of a customer retention program based on identifying which customers are satisfied, which customers are motivated to respond to a survey, and where a business fails to resolve a customer's issue.

The computer system  may also be implemented as or incorporated into various devices, such as a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile device, a palmtop computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a communications device, or any other machine capable of executing churn analysis logic that specifies actions to be taken by that machine. The computer system  may be implemented using electronic devices that provide voice, video or data communication. The system implementation may be a single computer system , or may include any collection of systems or sub-systems that individually or jointly execute a set, or multiple sets, of instructions to perform any of the churn analysis processing noted above.","The computer system  may include a processor , e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), or both. A processor may be implemented as a controller, microprocessor, digital signal processor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Moreover, the computer system  may include a main memory  and a static memory  that may communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system  may further include a display , such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED), a flat panel display, a solid state display, or a cathode ray tube (CRT). Additionally, the computer system  may include an input device , such as a keyboard, and a cursor control device , such as a mouse. The computer system  may also include a disk drive unit , a signal generation device , such as a speaker or remote control, and a network interface device .","The disk drive unit  may include a computer-readable medium  in which one or more sets of instructions , e.g. software, may be embedded. Further, the instructions  may embody one or more of the methods or logic as described herein. In a particular embodiment, the instructions  may reside completely, or at least partially, within the main memory , the static memory , and\/or within the processor  during execution by the computer system . The main memory  and the processor  also may include computer-readable media.","In general, the churn analysis logic and processing described above may be encoded or stored in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium such as a compact disc read only memory (CDROM), magnetic or optical disk, flash memory, random access memory (RAM) or read only memory (ROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) or other machine-readable medium as, for examples, instructions for execution by a processor, controller, or other processing device. The medium may be implemented as any device or tangible component that contains, stores, communicates, propagates, or transports executable instructions for use by or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device. Alternatively or additionally, the logic may be implemented as analog or digital logic using hardware, such as one or more integrated circuits, or one or more processors executing instructions that perform the processing described above, or in software in an application programming interface (API) or in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), functions available in a shared memory or defined as local or remote procedure calls, or as a combination of hardware and software.","The system may include additional or different logic and may be implemented in many different ways. Memories may be Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Flash, or other types of memory. Parameters (e.g., conditions and thresholds) and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, or may be logically and physically organized in many different ways. Programs and instructions may be parts of a single program, separate programs, implemented in libraries such as Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), or distributed across several memories, processors, cards, and systems. Although the system described here is used for churn analysis, the system may also be used to analyze, predict and optimize other values that are relevant to business strategies. For example, the system may be used to analyze operating expenses.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
