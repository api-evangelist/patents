No. 10\/814,751, entitled \u201cNetworked Printer With Hardware and Software Interfaces for Peripheral Devices,\u201d and application Ser. No. 10\/813,847, entitled \u201cStand Alone Printer With Hardware\/Software Interfaces for Sharing Multimedia Processing,\u201d.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to document printers and, more specifically, to document printers that can receive, process, and transform multimedia data from a peripheral device.","2. Background of the Invention","Cost and quality improvements in multimedia technologies have led to a proliferation of digital devices with multimedia capabilities. High-quality video cameras and cellular phones with multimedia capabilities are becoming commonplace in the home and workplace, and have proven to be useful for diverse purposes ranging from teleconferencing to managing information. Multimedia data captured by such devices are typically delivered in an unprocessed form to a medium such as a digital tape or memory card.","A conventional printer can receive multimedia data in a number of formats and then print the contents of those data in accordance with the proper format. But while conventional printers can print documents in a wide variety of formats, these printers are fundamentally limited in their ability to take in contents from multimedia devices such as video cameras and cellular phones and process the data to create a useable record. For example, it is standard technology for a printer to produce images of static text, pictures, or a combination of the two. However, creating multimedia output from a peripheral device typically involves several disparate steps, each potentially requiring considerable effort. Oftentimes, a user will have to convert and transfer multimedia data in different stages to different devices\u2014for instance transferring a video clip from a video camera, then into a summary file containing excerpts of the video file, then to a memory or output device. While the processing of a multimedia file from a peripheral device commonly involves the same repeated tasks, there is no easy way to automate them. In addition, because the multimedia data from a peripheral device are typically not printed to a paper document, they are difficult to incorporate into the existing paper-based workflow by which most offices function. Although means do exist to map multimedia data from a peripheral device to paper friendly and electronic outputs, these additional conversion steps are often not automated or performed.","Thus, there is a need for an integrated printer that can receive multimedia data from a peripheral device, process it, and deliver an output to a printed document or other media. It is further desirable that such a printer be able to perform at least some of the necessary processing itself, while some of the processing may be performed on an external device, rather than require an attached computer or other device to perform all of the processing.","The present invention overcomes the deficiencies and limitations of the prior art by providing systems and methods in which multimedia data from a peripheral device are received by a printer, the data are processed, and the printer outputs the result. In a typical hardware configuration for such a multifunction printer, a printer includes a peripheral interface that communicates with a peripheral device, a print engine that produces a paper or other printed output, and one or more electronic devices that produce a related electronic output. Together, the printed and electronic outputs provide an improved representation of the multimedia data from the peripheral device over that of a conventional paper printer.","In one embodiment, a printing system includes a network coupled to a network device and a printing system. An interface receives multimedia data from a peripheral device, and a multimedia processing system is coupled to the interface for processing the multimedia data. Based on any of a number of desired applications, the multimedia processing system determines a printed representation of the multimedia data and an electronic representation of the multimedia data. To enable sharing of the computing load, the multimedia processing system may reside at least in part on the printing system and at least in part on the peripheral device. A printed output system in communication with the multimedia processing system receives the printed representation and produces a corresponding printed output. Similarly, an electronic output system in communication with the multimedia processing system receives the electronic representation and produces a corresponding electronic output. In this way, the printer creates a representation of multimedia data from a peripheral device by producing a printed output and an electronic output.","In various embodiments, the system includes hardware and software for processing multimedia contents and various mechanisms for creating the electronic and printed outputs. For example, the interface may include a single communication interface, a network interface, a wireless interface, personal digital assistant (PDA) device, a cellular phone, a removable media storage device reader, a video input device (such as a DVD reader), an audio input device (such as a CD reader or an MP3 player), a digital video recorder (e.g., TiVO), screen capture hardware, a video and\/or audio recorder, or any of a number of different types of devices that can receive multimedia data. Similarly, the electronic output system may write the electronic representation to one or more different types of removable media storage devices, such as a DVD, a digital video recorder, a digital audio recorder, a CD, a flash card, a computer disk, an SD disk, or another computer-readable medium. The electronic output system may also include a disposable media writer, a self-destructing media writer, a video display, an audio speaker, a driver for a speaker system (such as an embedded MIDI player), or an embedded web page display. In this way, a multifunction printer can be configured to process any of a large number of multimedia data from various peripheral devices, allowing various embodiments of the printer to meet the needs of many different applications.","Because of the great many combinations of input and output devices possible for the printing system, the system may include hardware, software, or a combination thereof for performing a wide variety of different operations on the multimedia data. In this way, the system can be configured to produce various types of printed and electronic outputs based on received multimedia data to meet the needs of different applications. To solve various problems, in embodiments of the system, the multimedia processing system includes one or more of an embedded multimedia module","Moreover, the processing logic in the printing system can be configured to communicate with a peripheral device via the peripheral interface. Thus, the processing logic has the capability to operate the peripheral device and transfer data to the peripheral device.","These different tasks may be performed on the printer by the multimedia processing system, or partially on the printer by the multimedia processing system in conjunction with one or more electronic devices capable of performing some of the required processing steps. The printer can thus balance the required processing of the multimedia data between the printer and one or more connected electronic devices, such as a personal computer or an external network service. By conducting at least some of the processing on the printer, the printer relieves at least some of the processing load on external devices that the printer's additional functionality may require.","Various embodiments of a printing system with a peripheral interface enable the printing of multimedia in a useful and intelligent format. To create a representation of this multimedia data, the printing system produces a printed output and a related electronic output, which together provide a representation of the received multimedia data. Depending on the desired application, the printing system includes a multimedia module with any number of functionalities for processing the multimedia data, printing the printed output, and producing the electronic output. Therefore, a number of embodiments of the printing system are described herein to show how such a system can be configured in a wide variety of combinations to solve or address a great number of needs that exist.","System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","150","170","155","100","170","100","105","110","115","120","125","150","170","105","157","115","120","165","175"],"i":"a"},"In one embodiment, the multimedia processing system  includes a memory , a processor , and a multimedia processing module . The multimedia processing module , which is described in more detail below, may include software, hardware, or a combination thereof for implementing at least a portion of the functionality of the printing system . The multimedia processing system  is coupled to the peripheral interface  and network interface , allowing it to communicate with each. The media processing system  is also coupled to the printed output system  and to the electronic output system  for providing the appropriate commands and data to those systems.","The printing system  further includes a network interface , functionally coupled to the multimedia processing system . The network interface  allows the printing system  to communicate with other electronic devices, such as network device  and external service .

In this way, the network device  can relieve the printing system  of some of the processing load required to produce printed and electronic outputs from the multimedia data. In one embodiment, the network device  includes a user interface that allows a user to make selections about the processing of the multimedia and\/or about the format or destination of the printed or electronic outputs. In other embodiments, the user interface can be located on another attached device, or the user interface can be located on printer  itself.

No. 10\/814,500, which application is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In another embodiment, the printing system  is coupled to an external service , which includes hardware and\/or software for performing some of the processing tasks on the multimedia to be printed. In a typical embodiment, a remote service provider operates the external service . In such an embodiment, whereas the network device  may communicate with the printing system  over a local area network, the external service may communicate with the printing system  over a wide area network or over the Internet. By sharing the media processing tasks with an external service , possibly operated by a service provider, the printing system can perform tasks that are under the control of the service provider. In this way, a service can be set up around a particular form of multimedia processing, where a user pays for use of the service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","205","150","105","170","157","105","157","125","210","210","100"]},"In one embodiment, the system automatically generates a printed output or an electronic output of the multimedia data based on a predefined format and the functionality of the peripheral device  that is connected to the peripheral interface  or network interface . For example, the multimedia processing system can take a video clip from a digital video camera connected to peripheral interface  and automatically generate a printed output  containing key frames and bar codes for accessing video segments of the video file.","In another embodiment, the system  includes a user interface to allow a user to preview the generated outputs. If the user desires to refine  the processing, the user can enter commands, which the printing system  receives  by way of the user interface . Based on the user's commands, the printing system  then repeats the processing  of the media data to generate new printed and electronic outputs. This refinement process can be iterated until the user is satisfied with the printed and electronic outputs. When this occurs, the user indicates that the printing should commence, for example, by invoking a print command with the user interface . The multimedia processing system  then sends the generated printed output to the printed output system  and the electronic output to the electronic output system . The printed output system  then creates  a printed output , and the electronic output system  creates  an electronic output .","It can be appreciated that this generalized description of a multifunction printer lends itself to a great number of specific configurations and applications. Accordingly, examples of the possible configurations, applications, and particular components are further described.","Peripheral Interface","The peripheral interface  can be designed to accommodate any suitable type of multimedia peripheral device . Because of the great variety of types and formats of multimedia data, the peripheral interface  may take any number of forms to accept any devices  that a user might wish to connect to print the multimedia data.  illustrates some examples of different interfaces  by which the printer  can receive multimedia data from a peripheral device or network device. In particular implementations, system  may have only one or only a subset of these types of interfaces , and in addition may have other types of interfaces not shown.","As shown in , the printer  may include a communication interface  that allows the printer  to be communicatively coupled to another electronic device. Depending on the desired input, the interface  may allow the printer  to communicate with a wide variety of different peripheral devices  that can provide the printer  multimedia data to print. Without intending to limit the types of devices, the interface  may allow the printer  to received media data from peripheral devices  such as computer systems, computer networks, digital cameras, cellular telephones, PDA devices, video cameras, media renderers (such as DVD and CD players), media receivers (such as televisions, satellite receivers, set-top boxes, radios, and the like), digital video recorders (such as a TiVO), a portable meeting recorder, external storage devices, video game systems, or any combination thereof. The connection type for the interface  can take a variety of forms based on the type of device that is intended to be connected to the printer  and the available standard connections for that type of device. For example, the interface  may comprise a port for connecting the device using a connection type such as USB, serial, FireWire, SCSI, IDE, RJ11, parallel port (e.g., bi-directional, Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP), Extended Capability Port (ECP), IEEE 1284 Standard parallel port), optical, composite video, component video, or S-video, or any other suitable connection type.","In another embodiment, the printing system  includes a wireless interface . As illustrated, the wireless interface  allows system  to receive multimedia data from a wireless device external to system . The wireless interface  may allow the system  to communicate with any number of wireless communication systems, such as wireless components on a home or business network, cellular phones and other portable wireless devices, satellites, satellite dishes, and devices using radio transmissions.

The removable media storage reader  may be configured to accommodate any type of removable media storage device, such as DVDs, CDs, video cassette tapes, audio cassette tapes, floppy disks, ZIP disks, flash cards, micro-drives, memory sticks, SD disks, or any other suitable type of multimedia storage device. Moreover, the printing system  may have a plurality of removable multimedia storage readers  to accommodate multiple types of media storage devices.","In another embodiment, the printer  includes an embedded video recorder . In this embodiment, the external source of media data is a series of images captured by the embedded the video recorder . The video recorder , such as a camera, CCD, or other suitable mechanism for capturing a sequence of images, converts a scene into a suitable electrical format, such as that described in the MPEG, H.263, or H.264 standards. Optionally, an analog-to-digital converter  converts an image directly from the video recorder  into a digital format, which is then provided to the media processing system . In yet another embodiment, the media processing system  receives raw video data from the video recorder  and performs any necessary conversion, encoding, and compression on the video data.","In another embodiment, the printer  includes an embedded audio recorder . In this embodiment, the external source of media data is a series of sounds that are converted into an electrical format by the embedded audio recorder . The audio recorder  converts the recorded sound signal into a suitable electrical format, such as that described in MPEG-2. Optionally, an analog-to-digital converter  converts the sound directly from the audio recorder  into a digital format, which is then provided to the media processing system . In yet another embodiment, the media processing system  receives raw audio data from the audio recorder  and performs any necessary conversion, encoding, and compression on the audio data.","In another embodiment, the printer  comprises a media broadcast receiver . The media broadcast receiver  can be tuned to a media broadcast from a media broadcaster. Types of media broadcasts that can be tuned into and received include broadcasts from the Internet, cable, television, radio, and any other broadcasted media source. To tune into a particular media broadcast, a user may select the broadcast using the user interfaces , . In one embodiment, the broadcast receiver  is an embedded TV receiver, an embedded radio receiver, an embedded short-wave radio receiver, an embedded satellite radio receiver, an embedded two-way radio, an embedded cellular phone, or a combination of any of the above. However, these are not meant to be limiting, as the broadcast receiver  can be any device that is capable of tuning into a signal and receiving media data therefrom.","In another embodiment, the printer  includes an embedded event sensor  that receives a signal about or otherwise observes a real-world event. Similar to a broadcast receiver , the event sensor  may receive data about a real-world event, for example, by an embedded National Weather Service radio alert receiver or an embedded TV Emergency Alert System (EAS) alert monitor. Alternatively, the event sensor  may comprise an embedded heat sensor, an embedded humidity sensor, or another type of measuring device so that the event sensor  can directly measure the environment and generate time-based media therefrom. In this way, the printer  can be used to record events near the printer or far from it and generate meaningful time-based informational outputs based on those events.","In another embodiment, system  includes a docking station  that is built into the printer . The docking station  may be configured to accommodate any type of peripheral device, such cell phones, digital audio recorders, video camcorders, portable meeting recorders, fixed position meeting recorders, head-mounted video cameras, office-based PC experience capture systems, or any other suitable type of multimedia peripheral devices. Moreover, the printer  may have a plurality of docking stations  to accommodate multiple types of peripheral devices. Furthermore, it will be understood that a peripheral device  may also be communicatively coupled to the communication interface  via an external docking station.","In another embodiment, the printer may include video capture hardware . In one embodiment, the video capture hardware  is designed to be coupled to a computing system by a video cable thereof. The video cable from a display is attached to the printer , where the video signal is split with one signal directed to the computing system and another signal to the video capture hardware . The video capture hardware  performs a differencing between successive frames of the video signal and saves frames with a difference that exceeds a threshold on a secondary storage in the printer . This offloads such processing from the computing system, thereby improving responsiveness and user experience and providing an easily browseable record of a user's activities during the day. To take advantage of the printing capabilities of the multifunction printer, the user can choose to print selected frames captured by the video capture hardware . The printing can be generated on demand with the user interface on the printer or from the attached computing system, or automatically with scheduling software. In this way, a user can view a replay of any actions taken on the computing system. Notably, the captured content can be effectively compressed because the differences between frames are small.","In another embodiment, the video capture hardware  is coupled to a converter module , such as VGA-to-NTSC conversion hardware. Such an embodiment could be used in conjunction with a projector to capture presentations made with the projector. Audio capture could also be employed to record a speaker's oral presentation. To use the video capture hardware  in this way, a user could connect a laptop or other computing system and the projector to the printer . The printer  then captures video frames as fast as it compares them to the most recently captured frame and retains those frames that are different. A parallel audio track may also be saved. This capability could also be used in a desktop printer to record a presentation made on a computing system connected to the printer. The printer can then save the audio itself or it can be written to a digital medium, such as an SD disk that can be played from a cell phone or a PDA. The audio could also be written to a bar code on a printed representation.","In another embodiment, the printer  comprises an ultrasonic pen capture device. In this embodiment, the printer  includes an ultrasonic pen capture device hardware module  that serves as a low-cost sensor that can be coupled to a paper document. With such a device, a user can write on a paper document, and the results are saved on the printer . In one form, the captured results include the user's writing in combination with time data that indicates when the writing occurred. This time-based media data can then be printed or sent (e.g., by electronic mail) to someone else, for example showing a user's notes as well as time stamps that indicate when the notes were taken.","In another embodiment, the printer  comprises a database server . In this embodiment, the database  stores and catalogs various database files such as a music catalog, video database, movie database, a digital photo catalog, and the like. The database server  can also serve as an Internet server in communication with network . In such as an embodiment, the database can host a web search engine and allow web publishing with video and audio clip segmentation, multimedia retrieval, and map retrieval (e.g., weather map and aerial images). The database can also serve as an image search engine.","Printed Output System","The printed output system  may comprise any standard printing hardware, including that found in standard laser printers, inkjet printers, thermal wax transfer printers, dye sublimation printers, dot matrix printers, plotters, or any other type of printing mechanisms suitable for creating a printer image on an appropriate physical medium. In the example described herein, a laser printer mechanism is described; however, it should be understood that any suitable printing system can be used. The printing system  includes any necessary subsystems, as known by one skilled in the art, to print on a printable medium, such as a sheet of paper.","In one embodiment, the printed output system  comprises a media supply handler  () that receives blank paper to be printed on. The media supply handler  typically obtains the paper from a supply tray . The printer  may include multiple supply trays , allowing the printer to accommodate different sizes and types of paper as well as trays  of varying capacity. When the printer  needs blank paper for printing, the media supply handler  provides the print engine  with a sheet of blank medium.","The formatter  converts data received from the multimedia processing system  into a format that the print engine  can use to create an image on the paper. The print engine  creates an image on the paper as indicated by the formatter . A fuser  then uses high temperature and pressure to fuse the image onto the paper to fix the image thereon. Once the image is fixed, the paper is fed to the media output handler . Although not shown, it is appreciated that the printer  includes any necessary motors, gears, and diverters to cause the paper to move through the printer .","The media output handler  receives one or more printed sheets of paper and performs any requested finishing to the sheets. For example, the media output handler  may include a sorter  to sort or collate the sheets for multiple copies and a stapler  to attach the sheets together. When the finishing process is complete, the media output handler  moves the sheets to an output tray , of which there may be multiple trays  to accommodate different sizes, types, and capacities of printed output.","Electronic Output System","The electronic output system  can be designed to produce an electronic output related to the multimedia data in any desired format. Because of the great variety of types and formats of electronic outputs, the electronic output system  may take any of a number of forms for producing an electronic output desired by the user.  illustrates some examples of different embodiments of the electronic output system . In particular implementations, system  may have only one or only a subset of the various components shown, and in addition it may have other types not shown.","In one embodiment, the printer  writes the electronic output to a removable media device with a media writer . Many different types of media writers are known in the art, and the media writer  many comprise any of these. For example, the media writer  may be configured to write the electronic output to removable storage devices such as a writeable DVD or CD, a video cassette tape, an audio cassette tape, a flash card, a computer disk, an SD disk, a memory stick, or any other appropriate electronically-readable medium. Moreover, the electronic output system  may include a number of media writers  of different types to allow the printer  to print onto different electronic formats. In addition, the electronic output system  may include a number of media writers  of the same type to increase the output capacity of the printer .","The removable storage device that receives the electronic output from the printer  may be fed to the media writer directly by a user, for example by inserting a blank disk into a drive. In another embodiment, the printer  includes an electronic media handling mechanism  coupled to the media writer  that automatically provides the media writer  with an appropriate type of removable storage device. The handling mechanism  may further be configured to physically place written-to storage devices into an output tray . In one embodiment, a series of blank storage devices are fed to the printing system  by a bandolier  or other type of feeder, allowing the printer  to create a high volume of electronic output without requiring a significant amount of interaction with a human operator. The bandolier  preferably then places the written to devices into an output tray .","In another embodiment, the media writer  is a disposable media writer, configured to write electronic data to a disposable removable media storage mechanism. In another embodiment, the media writer  writes the electronic data to a self-destructing medium. In this way, a user can view the electronic data for a predetermined number of times or during a predetermined period of time, after which the electronic data are no longer viewable.","In another embodiment, the electronic output system  includes a speaker system . The speaker system  is designed to receive an audio signal from the media processing system , in response to which the audio is played from an embedded speaker  in the printer . The electronic output system  may further include a player  or audio renderer that receives an encoded audio signal from the media processing system  and converts it into an audio signal for the speaker . The player  thus takes some of the processing load off the media processing system . For example, the player  may include a MIDI player for generating the audio signal; however, many other audio renderers may be used, in either hardware or software.","In another embodiment, the electronic output system  includes a video display . The video display  is designed to receive a video signal from the media processing system , in response to which the video is played on the video display  embedded into the printer . Similarly, the video display  may receive the video signal directly from a driver to reduce the processing load on the media processing system .","In another embodiment, the printer  transmits the electronic output that is to be printed to another device as a signal. This signal can later be fixed in a tangible medium by the external device. To facilitate this, the electronic output system  includes a communication interface . The communication interface receives the electronic output from the media processing system  and sends the electronic output to the external device, which may be in communication with the printer  over a local network, the Internet, a wireless network, a direct connection, or any other suitable communication means.","In another embodiment, the electronic output system  comprises an embedded web page display . The web page display  allows a user to see a representation of the electronic output in a web-based form.","Multimedia Processing System","The multimedia processing system  of the printer  is designed to perform the specialized functionality of the multifunction printer . To send and receive messages between external devices or the user interface , the processing system  includes a processor  and a memory . In addition, the media processing system includes one or more hardware and\/or software modules that enable the printer  to create related printed and electronic outputs for different types of multimedia data. In this way, the printer  can be configured to have a wide variety of multimedia processing functionalities.","Printer  includes an embedded multimedia module  that enables the printer  to act as a multimedia server and have associated functionality. In various embodiments, the multimedia module  includes hardware and software for carrying out multimedia functionality, media processing software, and computer interface hardware and software. In this way, the printer  can act like a multimedia server, which could be shared by a work group or used as a personal printer. Various embodiments of a multifunction printer having multimedia functionality are possible applications for a printer in accordance with embodiments of this invention. A number of specific embodiments for such a printer are described in a co-pending U.S. patent application entitled, \u201cPrinter with Multimedia Server,\u201d filed Mar. 30, 2004, Ser. No. 10\/814,842, which application is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In one embodiment, as illustrated in , multimedia module  includes software and hardware to automatically detect  the coupling of a peripheral device , a module to communicate with a peripheral device , a module to process and format multimedia data , and a module to generate an output . Multimedia module  is also configured to detect the presence of and communicate with a network device  in a similar manner.","In an embodiment, as illustrated in , the device detection module  automatically detects  the docking (or communicative coupling via a network) of a peripheral device  and downloads multimedia data from the peripheral device for processing by the printer . The multimedia processor  can utilize such protocols as the Plug and Play (PnP) or Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol to automatically detect and communicate with devices that have PnP capabilities. With UPnP, devices can automatically communicate with each other directly, convey their capabilities, and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other detection methods, such as polling techniques (e.g., ), may be used to automatically detect the coupling of a peripheral device. Alternative systems for connection, such as IEEE 1394 cabling or Universal Serial Bus cabling, have equivalent standards for device and capability discovery. Alternatively, one embodiment might detect the presence of an active electrical circuit in a physical connector, such as an RS232 serial port connector, between the docked device and printer .","Once a device is docked to the printer  via peripheral interface  or network interface , the device communication module  is configured to communicate with the peripheral device . Again, PnP capabilities of a device will allow the communication module  to communicate with the device. The communication module  may be configured with specific software drivers to enable communication with specific peripheral devices. In one embodiment, the communication module  enables the printer  to operate a docked peripheral device to capture multimedia data. In such an embodiment, the printer  can also send commands to the docked peripheral device  and operate the device by controlling certain functionalities of the device. For example, the printer  could communicate with a docked cell phone to automatically bill the owner of the phone through her cell phone provider, or based on information in an XML profile on the phone. In another example, the printer  can communicate with a docked cell phone to issue commands to take pictures with the cell phone's digital camera or to call a number from the cell phone. The picture might show who is standing at the printer . That data could be transmitted to some other destination by the cell phone when it calls out. The called number could be provided in a profile stored on the cell phone, or it could be stored on the printer. Other examples are discussed below.","The communication module  sends  a request to the peripheral device for multimedia data to be downloaded to the printing system . Once the multimedia processing system  receives the multimedia data, the multimedia processing and formatting module  contains logic to format and process  the multimedia data. In an embodiment, the format may be pre-defined and configured for specific peripheral devices. In other embodiments, a user may design a layout format for the multimedia data via the user interfaces , . In yet another embodiment, a user may upload a predefined format. The multimedia processing and formatting module  provides an organized representation of the multimedia data depending on a particular peripheral device . For example, the formatter  may generate a format suitable for representation on printed output . Thus, if a video camcorder is docked directly to the printer, the format might comprise key frames with bar codes linking the key frames to different segments of a video file that may be used to replay a recorded video describing the event. Although the media processing system  is configured to perform at least some of the processing of the media data on the printer , it is preferably coupled to an external computing device that shares some of the computing burden. Network interface  allows communication with external network device  and\/or external service , which are capable of performing at least a portion of the multimedia processing functionality. The network device  may be a computer system or a dedicated media processing hardware device. In this way, the printer  relieves the source of the multimedia from at least some of the processing burden required to implement the printer's functionality, but the printer  need not shoulder the entire burden. The printer  can thus avoid slow-downs that can result from a heavy processing load, which may be especially important for shared printers.","In step , the multimedia output generator module  creates an output of the formatted multimedia data. The output may be sent to the printed output system  where it will be printed on a document, or it may be sent to the electronic output system  where an electronic output will be produced. In one embodiment, the output may also be uploaded to a web server via network .","Interactive Communication with a Printer",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"In order to allow this interaction, without modifying printer driver architecture of the underlying operating system, an extra mechanism, such as the one shown in , is constructed. A \u201cUI Listener,\u201d program  listens to a network socket, accepts requests for information , interacts with a user to obtain such data, and then sends the data back to the requester.","Once a print request  is sent by user  and notification is requested  from the UI listener , the print job is sent  by application . Here, the print job contains embedded information including the network address of the UI listener  authentication information, and the latest time that the client will be listening for requests.","If the printer  requires additional information or confirmation, it sends a request , which is detected by the UI listener  which displays a dialog box  to obtain input from the user . An example of such a request might be a request for a password or user confirmation code that the user must enter to access an application server . The users's input is included in a reply  sent to the printer. If the reply does not satisfy the printer it may ask for additional information (not shown). If the reply does satisfy the printer, it takes a next step. This step might be to perform an external action such as sending an email (not shown). The next step might also be sending a request for information  to an application server (such as a database) . In this example, application server  also sends a request for information , which is detected by the UI listener . The user  is prompted  and his response forwarded  to the application server . In this example, a reply  is then sent from the application server  to the printer . It will be understood that a particular embodiment may include either or none of requests  and  without departing from the spirit of the present invention.","A program such as that shown in  may have a fixed set of possible interactions, or may accept a flexible command syntax that allows the requester to display many different requests. An example of such a command syntax is the web browser's ability to display HTML forms. These forms are generated by a remote server, and displayed by the browser, which then returns results to the server. In this embodiment, however, the UI listener is different from a browser in that a user does not generate the initial request to see a form. Instead, the remote machine generates this request. In the described embodiment, the UI listener is a server, not a client.","Because network transactions of this type are prone to many complex error conditions, a system of timeouts preferably assures robust operation. Normally, each message sent across a network either expects a reply or is a one-way message. Messages which expect replies preferably have a timeout, a limited period of time during which it is acceptable for the reply to arrive. In this embodiment, embedded metadata includes metadata about a UI listener that will accept requests for further information. Such metadata preferably includes at least a network address, port number, and a timeout period. It can also include authentication information, designed to prevent malicious attempts to elicit information from the user. Because the user cannot tell whether the request is coming from a printer, a delegated server, or a malicious agent, prudence suggests strong authentication by the UI listener. If the printer or a delegated application server wishes more information, it can use the above-noted information to request that the UI listener ask a user for the needed information.","In one embodiment, printer  includes an interface  configured to support an image capture device. Examples of an image capture device include a digital still camera and a digital video camera. The user prints a document that contains instructions that drive the image capture device attached to the printer. The camera may be attached directly to the printer, e.g., via a cable, or may be wirelessly connected, for example using an 802.11 wireless networking connection. This allows the device to be located more remotely from the printer. The device can be instructed to take pictures or capture video immediately, or at some time in the future. The device is further instructed to print the captured pictures, either through the printed output system , the electronic output system , or both.","In various embodiments, printing system  includes a variety of peripheral interfaces  and network interfaces . For example, in one embodiment, printing system  includes an interface for a wireless keyboard. In another embodiment, a interface is included for capturing audio. In a further embodiment, an RJ-11 pass-through is included in printing system , in order to monitor telephone activity and print summary information about the calls. Attention is again drawn to U.S. patent application entitled, \u201cPrinter with Multimedia Server,\u201d filed Mar. 30, 2004, Ser. No. 10\/814,500.","Other embodiments provide interfaces with additional functionality.
