Hereinafter, information related to electricity will be described as an example of the energy information, but information related to other energy sources may be identically applied.","For example, the kind of information related to the electricity may include time-based pricing, curtailment, grid emergency, grid reliability, energy increment, operation priority, and the like.","The information may be divided into scheduled information previously produced based on previous information, and real-time information changed in real time. The scheduled information and the real-time information may be divided by whether or not predict information after the current time (in the future).","The energy information  may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the energy information  may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","The energy information  may be divided into time of use (TOU) information, critical peak pattern (CPP) information or real time pattern (RTP) information according to the change in the pattern of data with respect to time.","According to the TOU information, a data is changed step by step depending on time. According to the CPP information, a data is changed step by step or in real time depending on time, and emphasis is displayed at a specific point of time. According to RTP information, a data is changed in real time depending on time.","In a case where the energy information is time-based pricing information as an example, the time-based pricing information is changed. The time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","In a case where the specific component  receives a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal, one signal may be recognized as an on-peak signal, and the other signal may be recognized as an off-peak signal.","Alternatively, the specific component  may recognize information on at least one drive, which contains the time-based information, and may recognize an on-peak or off-peak signal by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","For example, in a case where the specific component  recognizes information divided into levels or real pricing information, it recognizes an on-peak or off-peak signals by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","In this case, the value of the information on drive may be at least one of time-based pricing, electric energy, the variation of time-based pricing, the variation of electric energy, the average of time-based pricing and the average of electric energy. The value of reference information may be at least one of an average, the average between maximum and minimum values of power information during a predetermined period of time and the reference variation of power information during the predetermined period of time (e.g., the slope of consumed electric energy per unit time).","The value of reference information may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The value of reference information may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","In a case where the specific component  (e.g., the energy consumption component) recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased. The driving scheme of the specific component may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal posterior to the start of operation.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output is maintained under an operable condition. In this case, the operable condition means that the value of the information on drive is less than a predetermined reference. The value of the information on drive may be time-based pricing, consumed electric energy, operation time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The predetermined reference may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The predetermined reference may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component  recognizes high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained or increased when the difference between a state information value and a reference value is within a predetermined range. For example, in a case where a compressor of a refrigerator is not operated in a low-cost section, the temperature of a cool chamber or freezing chamber is increased. Therefore, the compressor is necessarily turned on when the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber approaches a reference temperature. In a case where a high-cost section comes after the compressor is turned on, the compressor maintains a current output when the difference between the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber and the reference temperature is within a predetermined range. In a case where a user selects a button for cancelling power saving in the state that the specific component  recognizes the high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. However, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total output amount of the specific component during the entire drive period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level. Alternatively, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total consumed power or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire operation period may be decreased as compared that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output (change in the state of cool air that is a medium for performing the function of the refrigerator). In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated (storage of hot water that is an additional medium for performing the function of the washing machine or washer). Alternatively, in a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, cool air may be stored in a separate supercooling chamber by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","The curtailment information is information related to a mode in which the specific component is stopped or a small amount of time-based pricing is taken. As an example, the curtailment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","If the specific component  recognizes curtailment information, the output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased as described above.","The grid emergency information is information related to a power failure or the like. As an example, the grid emergency information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system. The information related to a power failure or the like has a relation with the reliability of a component using energy.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes grid emergency information, it may be immediately shut down.","The grid reliability information is information related to the supply amount of electricity supplied or information related to the quality of electricity. The grid reliability information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be determined by a component (e.g., an electric home appliance) through the frequency of AC power supplied to the component.","That is, if a frequency lower than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is small (information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied). If a frequency higher than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is large (information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied).","In a case where the specific component recognizes shortage of the amount of electricity or poor quality of electricity in the grid reliability information, an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component recognizes the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied, the output may be increased, or the operation may be converted from an off-state to an on-state.","The energy increment information is information related to a state that surplus electricity is generated because the amount of electricity used by a component is less than that of power generation. As an example, the energy increment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes energy increment information, the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component  is the energy storage component  or , the energy storage component  or  may store electricity by receiving the electricity supplied from the UAN, for example, when electricity storage cost is smaller than a predetermined value.","However, in a case where the energy storage component is connected to the energy generation component  that constitutes the HAN, it may continuously store energy generated by the energy generation component  until the electricity storage is completed. That is, the energy generated while the energy generation component  generates energy may be stored in the energy storage component .","The presence of completion of the electricity storage is determined while the energy storage component  or  stores electricity. In a case where the electricity storage is completed, the electricity supply for the electricity storage is cut off. Specifically, the presence of completion of the electricity storage may be determined using a sensor that senses the voltage, temperature or current of the energy storage component  or . The cutoff of the electricity supply may be performed using a switch (or circuit breaker) provided to a supply stage through which the electricity is supplied to the energy storage unit  or .","The electricity storage cost may be cost consumed in the electricity storage for a specific time period or electricity cost at a specific time.","As an example, in a case where the electricity storage cost is in an off-peak section (in a case where the specific component recognizes low-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity. Alternatively, in a case where an on-peak section corresponds to an allowance section (in a case where the specific component recognizes high-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store in the on-peak section. In this instance, the allowance section is a section in which a power consumption information value is less than a predetermined reference. The power consumption information value may be a electricity cost, a power consumption amount, a time range, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a predetermined cost, a predetermined power consumption amount, a predetermined time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative value or absolute value, and may be changed automatically or manually.","The energy storage component  or  may store a counter electromotive force generated when an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component is stopped (rotated).","Alternatively, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity using an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component. For example, in a case where the energy consumption component is a refrigerator, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a fan motor provided to the refrigerator is rotated (the fan motor may serve as a power generator or may be connected to the power generator). Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component is a washing machine, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor that rotates a drum for accommodating the laundry is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is a cooking appliance, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a cooling fan is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is an air cleaner, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a fan is rotated. That is, in this embodiment, in a case where a motor is provided regardless of the kind of the energy consumption component, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when the motor is rotated. Alternatively, in a case where a power generator is connected to a fan rotated by the flow of air (natural flow or forcible flow), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated by the power generator.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to one or more energy consumption components . In a case where electricity cost is higher than a reference value, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . As an example, in a case where the electricity cost is an on-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the high-cost information), the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . In a case where the electricity cost is an off-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the low-cost information) but is close to the on-peak, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. If the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  is less than a predetermined value, electricity generated in the energy generation component  is supplied to the energy consumption component. Thus, it is possible to prevent the operation of the energy consumption component from being stopped due to the cutoff of the electricity supply while the energy consumption component is operated.","In a case where the supply of electricity generated in the energy generation component  is cut off by interruption of electric power, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. In a case where the energy consumption component is an electric product, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to a communication unit or control unit provided to the electric product.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or may be supplied to a portion of a plurality of energy consumption components. As an example, the stored electricity may be supplied to an electric product such as a refrigerator required in continuous operation among a plurality of electric products. Alternatively, the stored electricity may be supplied to an energy consumption component with relatively low power among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute one electric product. It will be apparent that the stored electricity is supplied to an energy consumption component with high power. Alternatively, when a course using a relatively small amount of power is performed among a plurality of courses in which an electric product is performed, the stored electricity may be supplied. It will be apparent that the stored electricity may be supplied even when a course using a large amount of power is performed.","Meanwhile, in a case where electricity is generated and stored by a fan or motor as described above, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an energy consumption unit with relatively low power. As an example, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an LED lamp, a display, a control unit, a communication unit, a low-power heater, or the like. Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component performs a plurality of courses, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component in a course that requires low power.","The energy storage component  may be built in connected to one energy consumption component. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to a plurality of energy consumption components, respectively. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to one energy consumption component. The plurality of energy storage components  may be connected to one another to share the stored electricity.","Among the information related to energy, the on-peak information, the curtailment information and information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as high-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively expensive. In this instance, the section in which the high-cost information is recognized by the specific component may referred to as a low-cost section.","On the other hand, among the information related to energy, the off-peak information, the energy increment information and the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as low-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively cheap. In this instance, the section in which the low-cost information is recognized by the specific component may be referred to as a low-cost section.","The information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information) may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component). That is, the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component into at least two or more.","A high period means a high price time period (period of high cost) or a high pricing period and a low period means a low price time period (period of low cost) and a low pricing period.","As an example, in a case where the information related to energy is recognized as a Boolean signal, the time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component may be divided into two. In a case where the information related to energy is divided into a plurality of levels or recognized as real-time information, the time period or pricing period may be divided into three or more.","Meanwhile, the information related to energy cost corresponding to at least time may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component. That is, the information related to energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) or pricing zone (time period) into at least two or more. As described above, the divided time period or pricing period may be determined based on the kinds of the recognized information (the Boolean signal, the plurality of levels and the real-time information).","In other words, the information related to fluctuation of energy cost may be recognized by dividing a determination factor for driving the specific component into two or more, and functions on time and energy cost may be included in the determination factor.","In a case where the information related to energy cost is divided into two levels or more, the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined according to the information divided into levels.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized information related to energy cost is not divided based on a specific reference (e.g., real-time cost information), it is compared with predetermined information, and the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined based on the compared result.","Here, the predetermined information may be reference information (e.g. reference value) for dividing the information related to energy cost, and the compared result may be whether not the information related to energy cost is more or less than the reference value.","Specifically, each of the kinds of information related to energy may be divided into first information  that is raw information, second information  that is refined information, and third information  that is information for performing the function of the specific component. That is, the first information is a raw data, the second information is a refined data, and the third information is a command for performing the function of the specific component.","The information related to energy is included a signal, and the signal is transmitted. In this instance, one or more of the first to third information may be transmitted several times while the content of the information is not converted but only the signal including the information is converted.","For example, as shown in , a component that receives a signal including the first information may convert only the signal and transmit a new signal including the first information to another component.","Therefore, it is described in this embodiment that the conversion of signal is a different concept from the conversion of information. In this instance, it can be readily understood that when the first information is converted into the second information, the signal including the first information is also converted into the signal including the second information.","However, the third information may be transmitted several times in the state that the content of the third information is converted or in the state that only the signal including the third information is converted while the content of the third information is identically maintained.","Specifically, in a case where the first information is raw information on time-based pricing, the second information may be refined information on the time-based pricing. The refined information on the time-based pricing is information in which the time-based pricing is divided into a plurality of levels or analysis information. The third information is a command generated based on the second information.","The specific component may generate, transmit or receive one or more of the first to third information. The first to third information are not necessarily transmitted or received in sequence. Only a plurality of pieces of third information without the first and second information may be transmitted in sequence or parallel. Alternatively, the first and third information may be transmitted or received together, the second and third information may be transmitted or received together, or the first and second information may be transmitted or received together.","As an example, in a case where the specific component receives the first information, it may transmit the second information or may transmit the second and third information.","In a case where the specific information receives only the third information, it may generate and transmit new third information.","Meanwhile, in the relation between two pieces of information, one is a message and the other is a response for the message. Thus, each of the components that constitute the network system may transmit or receive a message. In a case where each of the components receives a message, it may respond to the message. Therefore, in the case of an individual component, the transmission of a message is a relative concept with the response for the message.","The message may include a data (first or second information) and\/or a command (third information).","The command (third information) may include a command for storing the data, a command for generating the data, a command for processing the data (including the generation of an additional data), a command for generating an additional command, a command for transmitting the additionally generated command, a command for transmitting a received command, and the like.","In this specification, the response for the received message means storage of the data, processing of the data (including generation of an additional data), generation of a new command, transmission of the newly generated command, simple transmission of a received command (including generation of a command for transmitting the received command to another component), operation, transmission of the stored information, transmission of an acknowledge message (acknowledge character or negative acknowledge character), or the like.","For example, in a case where the message is first information, the specific component that receives the first information may generate second information by processing the first information, or may generate the second information and new third information, as a response for the message.","The specific component that receives the message may provide a response related to energy. Here, the term \u201cresponse\u201d may be understood as a concept including an operation through which the specific component can perform a function. As an example, the HAN  may perform an operation related to energy by receiving a message.","The response (operation) related to energy, provided by the specific component, will be described in detail. For example, the specific component may be an energy consumption component.","The energy consumption component may be driven so that the energy cost when it is driven based on the recognition for energy information is reduced as compared with that when it is driven without the recognition for energy information.","The specific component may include a plurality of modes in which it is driven to perform its own function. The plurality of modes are a first mode and a second mode in which energy cost is relatively saved as compared with that in the first mode. The specific component may be driven in at least one of the first and second modes.","Here, the first mode may be a general mode and the second mode may be a power saving mode. Alternatively, the first and second modes may all be power saving modes.","The general mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed without recognition of energy information. On the other hand, the power saving mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed based on the recognition of energy information so as to save energy cost.","In a case where the first and second modes are power saving modes, the first mode may be specified as a driving scheme for saving energy cost and the second mode may be specified as a driving scheme in which the energy cost in the second mode is more saved than that in the first mode.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component) is driven, at least a portion is recognized in a driving scheme including at least drive time and course. In this case, an unrecognized portion may be generated so as to save energy cost, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme.","For example, at least a portion of the driving scheme may be recognized under the control of the energy management component, the control of the energy consumption component, or the like. In a case where a specific driving scheme is further required so as to save energy cost, an unrecognized portion of the driving scheme may be newly generated, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme so as to save energy.","It will be apparent that the process of generating the unrecognized portion may be omitted. In this case, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme. On the other hand, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme may be omitted. In this case, the process of newly generating the unrecognized portion may be performed.","The drive time may include a drive start time or drive end time. The course may include a drive period of the specific component and the power of the specific component.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be a scheme recommended by the specific component so as to save energy cost. Here, the specific component may be an energy consumption component (control component) or the energy management component.","As an example, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific drive time, the specific drive time may be converted into another time so as to save energy cost, and a specific course may be generated.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific course, the specific course may be converted into another course so as to save energy cost, and a specific time may be generated.","Under the control described above, a change in time or power may be made with respect to the output function of the specific component based on time.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be performed within a set range. That is, in the process of recognizing at least a portion of the driving scheme, the generation or conversion of the driving scheme may be performed within a predetermined reference in which the recognized portion appears (e.g., restriction set by a user, constraint set under the control of the energy management component or energy consumption component, or the like).","Therefore, in a case where the set range is out of the predetermined reference, it is restricted to generate the unrecognized portion or to convert the recognized portion into another scheme.","Another embodiment is proposed.","Cost information may further included in the recognized driving scheme. That is, in a case where the cost information is recognized, a portion related to the drive time or course may be generated. The generated driving scheme may be recommended.","Meanwhile, a response of the specific component based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), e.g., a power control for power saving driving, may be performed. An output decrease (including an output of zero) or output increase may be included in the output control.","It is as described above that the output is decreased or zero, maintained or increased based on the recognition for the information (on-peak or off-peak) related to energy cost.","If high-cost information is recognized, the output may be zero or decreased. Specifically, the output in the recognition of the high-cost information may be decreased as compared with that in the recognition of low-cost information. As described above, the decrease of the output may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the high-cost information is recognized posterior to the start of the operation of the specific component.","In a case where the output of the specific component is zero or decreased, the function to be performed by the specific component may be lost as compared with a normal case. Therefore, a response for restoring the lost function may be performed.","As an example, after the output of the specific component is decreased, the specific component may be controlled so that the total operation time of the specific component is increased or so that the output is increased in at least a time period.","In other words, if specific reference information related to energy information is recognized in a period after the output of the specific component is controlled, the response for controlling the output may be released. Here, the term \u201cperiod\u201d may be divided based on a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized.","The total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a specific target in the process of performing the function of the specific component. As an example, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (washing machine, drying machine, cooking appliance or the like) intermittently driven (or driven in a specific course), the total operation time may be understood as a time until a corresponding course is completed.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (refrigerator, water purifier, or the like) driven at normal times, the total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a target set for performing the function of the specific component. For example, the set target may be a target temperature, a target amount of ice produced, or a target amount of clean water in the refrigerator.","The total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time set before the output of the specific component is decreased. In a case where the output of the specific component is not decreased, the total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time of the specific component. However, although the total operation time of the specific component is increased, the specific component is controlled so that the total energy cost generated through the drive of the specific component can be saved as compared with that when the output of the specific component is not decreased.","If the high-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased.","However, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total output of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated under a normal output. Alternatively, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total power consumption or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased as compared with that when the specific component is operated under the normal output.","If the low-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the driving of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output in a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case of a specific condition (additional condition) is generated based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), the response of the specific component, e.g., the output control for power saving driving, may be limited. That is, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Here, the term \u201climitation\u201d may be understood as the release of the output control performed or not performed.","The specific condition includes a case where influence on energy cost is minute even though the output control of the specific component is not performed or a case where it is necessary to prevent a function to be performed by the specific component from being degraded when the output of the specific component is controlled.","Whether or not the influence on the energy cost is minute may be determined based on a predetermined reference (time-based pricing, power consumption or information on operation time). The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The case where the function to be performed by the specific component is degraded may be considered as a case where the specific component is a defrosting heater, for example.","In a case where it is controlled to decrease the output in a high-cost time period and to increase the output in the low-cost time period, the driving of the defrosting heater is more frequently performed than that during a normal time (setup period). In this case, the temperature of a storage room in the refrigerator is increased, and thus, the control of the output can be limited.","Meanwhile, the specific component  may include a display unit  for displaying information. In this embodiment, the term \u201cinformation display\u201d means that visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile information is known to the outside. Also, the display unit  may include a touch screen for selecting or inputting information. Alternatively, the specific component  may include a separate input unit for inputting information by cable or radio.","All the information (energy information or additional information except the energy information) described above may be displayed on the display unit . One of the energy information and additional information may be displayed, or two or more pieces of information may be simultaneously displayed. That is, two or more pieces of information may be simultaneously displayed on the display unit . As an example, in a case where two or more pieces of information are simultaneously displayed, any one of the information is selected. Then, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may be reduced. For another example, if any one of the two or more pieces of information is selected, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may be disappear. In a case where specific information is selected and the selected screen is enlarged, information more specific than the previous information or information different from the previous information may be displayed on the enlarged screen. For example, in a case where the selected information is character, graphic information may be displayed on the enlarged screen. Alternatively, two or more pieces of information may be sequentially displayed on the enlarged screen. In a case where two or more pieces of information are displayed on the display unit , two or more relative positions may be varied.","Information except energy cost information and energy cost may be displayed on the displayed unit . The energy cost information may include current cost, past cost, or estimated cost in the future. The energy cost information may include not only information on cost information in a specific period or time but also information on cost used with respect to the operation of a component, cost used in the present, cost to be used (estimation cost), or the like.","The information except the energy cost information may include information on energy reduction, emergency situation, grid safety, power generation quantity, operation priority, energy consumption, energy supply amount, information (e.g., cost change rate, average cost, level or the like) newly generated based on two or more pieces of information (one or more pieces of energy cost information and\/or information except the one or more pieces of energy cost information), and the like.

The time information may include one or more of current time information, time information related to energy, and information related to an operation of the one or more components.","In addition to the information described above, information refined based on at least one information or newly generated information may also be displayed on the display unit .","In a case where the specific component  is the energy storage component  or , the presence of use of the stored electricity, the remaining amount of the store electricity and the like may be displayed. If the remaining amount of the stored electricity is less than a predetermined value, alarm information may be displayed.","The information displayed on the display unit  may include one or more of information on number, character, sentence, figure, shape, symbol, image and light. The information displayed on the display unit  may include one or more of information on graph for each time or period, level, table. One or more of the shape, color, brightness, size, position, alarm period, alarm time of the information displayed on the display unit  may be varied.","A currently operable function (or menu) may be displayed on the display unit . Alternatively, among a plurality of functions, operable and inoperable function may be divided by size, color, position and the like, and then displayed on the display unit . Alternatively, in a case where separate input units are provided, only an input unit for selecting an operable function may be activated, or an input unit for selecting an operable function and an input unit for selecting an inoperable function may be displayed in different colors. The target or display method of information displayed on the display unit  may be set and changed by a user, or may be changed automatically.","In a case where a condition for informing the user of information is satisfied, specific information may be displayed on the display unit . It will be apparent that a portion of a plurality of pieces of information may be continuously displayed in the state that a component is turned on. The display time of the information may be changed or set automatically or manually.","If specific information (one or more pieces of information) is selected using the input unit, the selected information may be displayed. If a user contacts a portion of a component, e.g., an input unit, a handle, a display or the like, regardless of information display selection, or operates one or more buttons or knobs that constitute the input unit, a portion of the information may be displayed. In this instance, the information to be displayed may be set or changed. It will be apparent that a sensing unit for sensing a user's contact may be provided to the component. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed by installation environment or variation of outdoor environment. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed when the specific component receives new information. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed when the kind or state of the specific component is changed. As an example, if a light emitting unit is turned off in an off-peak section and an on-peak section comes, the light emitting unit may be turned on. Alternatively, the specific information may be automatically displayed when the operation or state of the component is changed. As an example, in a case where the mode of the component is changed, information related to the changed mode may be automatically displayed.","Meanwhile, the display unit  may be separably connected or fixed to the component . In a case where the display unit  is separable from the component , it may perform wired or wireless communication with the component  (or control unit of the component). In a case where the display unit is fixed to the component , it may also perform wired or wireless communication with the component .","In a case where the display unit  is separable from the component , a communication unit and an input unit for inputting or selecting information may be provided to the display unit .

On the other hand, in a case where the display unit  is not communicated with the component  or information is not included in the communication signal due to the weak intensity of the signal, the display unit may be in an unavailable state. One of the display unit  and the component  transmits a communication signal, and the other of the display unit  and the component  transmits a response signal. The presence of use of the display unit  may be determined by the presence of reception of the communication and response signals and the signal intensity. That is, in a case where any one of the display unit  and the component  does not receive a signal or the intensity of received signal is less than reference intensity, it may be determined that the display unit  is unavailable. Any one of the display unit  and the component  may increase the intensity of a transmission signal until it receives a response signal of which intensity is more than the reference intensity.","Information for informing the user of the presence of use of the display unit  may be displayed on the display unit  or the component . If it is recognized that the display unit  is unavailable, the component  may be controlled to increase its unique performance, to perform a door locking function or to limit its operation. Alternatively, the power of the component may be off while maintaining the power of a communication apparatus (modem) required for performing communication in the network system. Alternatively, the power of the component may be turned off while maintaining only a memory function for storing the state information of the component.","Meanwhile, sensors may be provided to the respective display unit  and component  so as to sense the presence of mounting of the display unit . As an example, the presence of mounting of the display unit  may be determined when the component  is operated. Each of the sensors may be a vibration sensor for sensing vibration. If the display unit  is mounted on the component , vibration generated in the operation of the component  can be transferred to the display unit . Therefore, in a case where the difference between the values of vibrations respectively sensed by the sensors is less than a predetermined value, it may be recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component . If it is recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component , the operation of the component  may be controlled so that vibration or noise generated in the operation of the component  is decreased.","As an example, in a case where the component  is a washing machine or drier, the rotation speed of a motor may be decreased. In a case where the component  is a refrigerator, the driving period of a compressor may be decreased.

The compressor  is turned on at an upper limit higher than the target temperature, and is turned off at a lower limit lower than the target temperature.","That is, the target value is between the upper limit (a first reference value) and the lower limit (a second reference value), and an actual inner temperature of the refrigerator  may be varied therebetween. A width between the upper and lower limits in the high price section may be different from a width therebetween in the low price section. The upper and lower limits or the widths therebetween may be referred to as control references.","First, an operation (a normal mode) of the compressor  in the low price section will now be described.","A target temperature of the freezer compartment in the low price section may be set, e.g., to about zero degrees Celsius (hereinafter, temperature is expressed in Celsius). In this case, the upper limit and the lower limit may be set to about 0.5 degrees and about \u22120.5 degrees, respectively. Accordingly, a width W between the upper and lower limits is about 1 degree.","While the compressor  is operated, when the freezer compartment reaches about \u22120.5 degrees, the compressor  is turned off. After that, when the freezer compartment reaches about 0.5 degrees, the compressor  is turned on. That is, the compressor  is periodically turned on and off.","Referring to , when the compressor  is turned on from an off state, current (an input value input to the compressor ) is quickly increases. After that, the compressor  is stabilized, and the current decreases. That is, when the compressor  is turned on, a current greater than a reference current (a reference value) flows therethrough, so as to increase power consumption, thereby increasing energy costs.","Thus, in order to decrease the energy costs (or the power consumption), it is needed to decrease the number of times that the compressor  is turned on (the number of times that the current is greater than the reference current).","When the control part  recognizes the high price section, at least one of the upper and lower limits may be varied in at least one portion of the high price section to decrease power consumption of the compressor  (or energy costs according to the power consumption). For example, a width between the upper and lower limits may be increased. The upper limit in the high price section may be varied to be greater than the upper limit in the low price section, or the lower limit in the high price section may be varied to be smaller than the lower limit in the low price section. Alternatively, the upper limit in the high price section may be varied to be greater than the upper limit in the low price section, and the lower limit in the high price section may be varied to be smaller than the lower limit in the low price section.","For example, when the target temperature is about zero degrees, the upper and lower limits in the high price section may be set to about 1 degree and \u22121 degree, respectively. In this case, a width W between the upper and lower limits is about 2 degrees.","While the compressor  is operated, when the freezer compartment reaches about \u22121 degree, the compressor  is turned off. After that, when the freezer compartment reaches about 1 degree, the compressor  is turned on.","Thus, referring to , an on-period (TP) of the compressor  in the high price section is greater than an on-period (TP) of the compressor  in the low price section. In other words, an off-period (TP) of the compressor  in the high price section is greater than an off-period (TP) of the compressor  in the low price section.","Thus, the number of times of on\/off of the compressor  in the high price section for a period TA is smaller than the number of times of on\/off of the compressor  in the low price section for the period TA.","As such, when the number of times of on of the compressor  is decreased in the high price section, the number of times that current applied to the compressor  exceeds the reference current is decreased, thereby decreasing power consumption and an electric charge according to the power consumption.","An increase of a width between the upper and lower limits may be varied depending on the length of the high price section. For example, an increase of a width between the upper and lower limits when the length of the high price section exceeds a reference period may be greater than an increase of a width between the upper and lower limits when the length of the high price section is shorter than the reference period.","For another example, when the control part  recognizes a plurality of differential pieces of price information (high, middle, and low price levels) in the form of schedule information or real-time information, increases of widths between the upper and lower limits may depend on price levels. For example, a width between the upper and lower limits may not be varied at the low price level. In addition, an increase of a width between the upper and lower limits at the high price level may be greater than an increase of a width between the upper and lower limits at the middle price level.","When the control part  recognizes real time pattern (RTP) information in the form of schedule information, increases of widths between the upper and lower limits may be set differently according to a plurality of differential periods.","According to the above embodiment, when a control part recognizes information for decreasing energy consumption and energy costs, power of a component that consumes energy is decreased, thereby decreasing energy consumption and the energy costs.","Accordingly, energy consumed by an electric product including the component and costs thereof may be decreased.","In addition, since an operation of a component that consumes energy is varied according to energy information such as a variable energy price, an energy source can be effectively managed.","According to the above embodiment, maintenance of a target temperature of a freezer compartment of a refrigerator is exemplified. However, the functions of electric products and components within the scope of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. In particular, a component of an electric product of may be periodically turned on\/off for a predetermined period to maintain a specific target value (including a humidity value instead of a temperature value).","For example, one or more heaters of a cooking device may be turned on\/off to maintain a cooking chamber at a temperature. Thus, an on\/off period (an upper limit and\/or a lower limit) of the heaters may be varied to maintain a target temperature according to a high price section or a low price section.","In addition, a compressor of an air conditioner may be turned on\/off to maintain a target temperature. Thus, an air conditioner may be used within the spirit of the present disclosure. In addition, a heater of a water purifier in which hot water is stored may be turned on\/off to maintain the hot water at a target temperature. Thus, a water purifier may be used within the spirit of the present disclosure. In addition, a fan motor of a dehumidifier may be turned on\/off to maintain a set humidity value. Thus, a dehumidifier may be used within the spirit of the present disclosure.","According to the above embodiment, a component is turned off at an upper limit and is turned on at a lower limit. However, a component may be turned on at an upper limit and be turned off at a lower limit within the spirit of the present disclosure.","According to the above embodiment, a component is turned on\/off based on upper and lower limits in order to maintain a target value. However, an on-time and an off-time of a component may be preset. In this case, when the component is controlled to maintain a target temperature, the on-time and\/or the off-time may be varied (increased).","According to the above embodiment, the width between upper and lower limits is varied. However, at least one of upper and lower limits may be varied without changing the width therebetween.","In the present specification, a component operated for maintaining a target value may be referred to as a power consumer unit.","Various examples of a method of operating a component as described above will be described within the spirit of the present disclosure.","First, when a start command is input using an input part, optimal driving time information for a component or time-excluded information (driving method information) is determined (an optimal driving condition is determined). The optimal driving time information or the time-excluded information is determined to decrease the cost of electricity consumed by the component or consumption of power consumed thereby. The optimal driving time information may be determined as one of immediate driving at a current time point, driving at a selected time point, and delayed driving. When an optimal driving time point is later than a user recognition time point (the current time point), notification information may be displayed on a display part. Before the start command is input using the input part, a driving method or a driving time point may be input. The input driving method or driving time point may be varied or maintained according to a result of the determination of the optimal driving time information or the time-excluded information. That is, when a specific operation condition is input using the input part, an optimal driving condition of the component may be determined based on at least energy price-related information. In this case, the component is operated under the optimal driving condition. The display part may display the optimal driving condition, particularly, information changed from the specific operation condition, or information that is not input.","In another example of the method of operating a component, when at least one portion of a high price section overlaps a driving time period of a component, the driving time period may be changed. In particular, the driving time period may be defined by a driving start time point and a driving end time point. The change of the driving time period is a change of at least one of the driving start time point and the driving end time point. When the driving time period is changed, the component may be stopped in the at least one portion of the high price section. For example, when high price-related information is recognized during an operation of the component, the component may be immediately stopped. Alternatively, when the high price-related information is recognized during the operation of the component, the component may be operated for a predetermined period and then be stopped. When the high price section ends, the stopped component may be operated again. At least one portion of the driving time period may be changed. When the driving time period is changed, the driving end time point may be a time point when the high price-related information is recognized, or a time point before the high price-related information is recognized (that is, a time point included in a low price section prior to the high price section).","Alternatively, when the driving time period is changed, the driving end time point may be included in a low price section after the high price section. Alternatively, when the driving time period is changed, the driving start time point may be included in the low price section after the high price section.","In another example of the method of operating a component, when an operation mode is selected using an input part, a display part may display energy information related to the operation mode. For example, when a specific operation mode is selected, the display part may display electricity prices per unit power according to time periods, a total electric charge corresponding to the specific operation mode, and a total power consumption amount.","The component may be operated in one of various power saving modes. That is, the component may be operated in one of power saving modes to decrease an energy consumption amount or an energy charge at least according to types of energy information. The power saving modes may include a manual mode in which information for driving the component is manually selected, and an automatic mode in which information for driving the component is automatically selected. The component may be operated not only in a normal mode and a power saving mode, but also in a time saving mode. The time saving mode may be manually selected by a user. An operation period of the component in the time saving mode is shorter than an operation period of the component in the normal mode. In this case, an energy charge (or an energy consumption amount) in the time saving mode may be equal to or greater than an energy charge (or an energy consumption amount) in the normal mode. The energy charge (or the energy consumption amount) in the time saving mode may be varied by changing a method of operating the component. An operation period of the component in the power saving mode is equal to or longer than the operation period of the component in the normal mode. The normal mode, the time saving mode, and the power saving mode may be the same or similar to one another in terms of product performance (e.g., washing performance and cooking performance).","In another example of the method of operating a component, power saving modes may include modes differentiated according to degrees of decreasing an electric charge or a power consumption amount. For example, an electric charge or a power consumption amount of a component in a first power saving mode may be smaller than an electric charge or a power consumption amount of the component in a second power saving mode. Alternatively, the power saving modes may include at least two modes sharing a common control member or method in order to save power for driving the component. The power saving modes may be manually or automatically switched to one another. The power saving modes may control the component according to different methods. That is, methods of controlling the component in the power saving modes may be different from one another.","In another example of the method of operating a component, a component may recognize prediction power information related to power that is consumed by the component or another component. The prediction power information may be at least one of current information, voltage information, power information, power amount information, and electric charge information.","A memory part of the component may store the prediction power information corresponding to operation modes of the component or operation modes of another component. In this case, the prediction power information may be stored in a table form. For example, the memory part may store power consumption information corresponding to a selected course or mode, and a prediction electric charge may be determined by multiplying power consumption and a price. Alternatively, the memory part may store power consumption information of each of energy consumer parts constituting the component, and the prediction electric charge may be determined by multiplying the sum of power consumption amounts of energy consumer parts operated in a specific mode and a price corresponding to the specific mode.","The memory part of the component may store additional information, corresponding to operation modes of the component or operation modes of another component, e.g., performance information or efficiency information. Thus, when an operation mode of the component or an operation mode of another component is recognized, the component may recognize prediction power information corresponding to the operation mode. The recognized prediction power information may be displayed on the display part of the component or a display part of the another component. Actual power consumption amount information or actual electric charge information, generated when the component or the another component is operated, may be recognized and be used to correct the prediction power information. The display part of the component may display an actual power consumption amount or an actual charge while or after the component is operated. Alternatively, while the component is operated, prediction power information may be displayed, or prediction power information and actual usage information may be simultaneously displayed. An optimal time point or an optimal price within a specific time range may be determined based on the prediction power information stored in the memory part. The optimal time point may be an operation start time point of the component. The optimal price may be an energy charge generated while the component is operated for a specific period. When energy price information is real time information, the optimal price is determined based on previous energy price information stored in the memory part. After that, when an energy charge is changed, the optimal price may be corrected according to the change of the energy charge.","A user may select conditions to constitute an operation mode of the component, and prediction power information or additional information corresponding to the operation mode including the selected conditions may be displayed on the display part of the component. In this case, the operation mode (a user preference mode) may be stored in the memory part of the component, and be selected using the input part. For example, a user may arbitrarily set an operation mode of the component by using the input part, and prediction power information and additional information of the component in the set operation mode may be determined. The user may check the prediction power information and the additional information, and determine whether to set the set operation mode to a user preference mode.","In another example of the method of operating a component, a user may select conditions for operating components, and prediction power information or additional information corresponding to an operation mode including the selected conditions may be displayed on a display part of the component. In this case, the operation mode (a user preference mode) may be stored in the memory part of the component, and be selected using the input part. For example, a user may arbitrarily set an operation mode of a refrigerator, a washing machine, a water purifier, a cooking device, and an air conditioner by using the input part, and prediction power information and additional information of the component in the set operation mode may be determined. The user may check the prediction power information and the additional information, and determine whether to set the set operation mode to a user preference mode.","In another example of the method of operating a component, when a component recognizes energy information and addition information, the component may be operated based on priority information among the energy information and the addition information. The priority of the priority information may be automatically set, or manually set or changed. According to a first priority information state, it is determined whether to consider next priority information.","For example, energy price information as energy information may be priority information, and environmental information as additional information may be next priority information. In this case, the component may be operated based on the energy price information. For another example, energy information may be priority information, and additional information may be next priority information. In this case, when the energy information includes information related to a decrease of an energy consumption amount or energy price, the component may be operated based on only the energy information. For another example, additional information may be priority information, and energy information may be next priority information. In this case, when a result of determination of the additional information requires an increase of power or operation time of the component, the component may be operated in consideration of the energy information.","The component may include a memory part that stores operation methods reflecting a plurality of types of information. In this case, when the component recognizes the types of information, one of the operation methods stored in the memory part is selected.","In another example of the method of operating a component, a component may include a memory part that stores operation methods reflecting energy information and addition information. Thus, when a plurality of types of information is recognized, one of the operation methods stored in the memory part may be selected to operate the component.","In another example of the method of operating a component, while a component is operated, when high price-related information is recognized, operation information of the component may be stored in a memory part, and the component may be turned off or be stopped. After that, when low price-related information is recognized, the component may be operated again based on the operation information stored in the memory part.","In another example of the method of operating a component, while a component is operated, when high price-related information is recognized, the operation of the component may be varied based on information related to a previous operation of the component. The information related to the previous operation may be power consumption amount information of the component, energy charge information, a mean value of target values (target temperatures, target air volumes, target humidity values, or target dehumidification amounts) set for a specific period, or information related to a resource accommodated in the component when the component is operated for a specific period. The power consumption amount information or the energy charge information may be a mean power consumption amount or a mean energy charge while the component is operated once. The resource may be water or ice. The information related to the resource may be information related to a mean resource discharge amount for a specific period (a water discharge amount or an ice discharge amount of a water purifier or a refrigerator.","For example, when high price-related information is recognized, an operation of an energy consumer part of the component may be varied such that an energy consumption amount or energy price of the component is equal to or smaller than an information value related to a previous operation of the component.","In another example of the method of operating a component, a memory part of a component may store previous operation information of the component. The display part of the component may display a specific priority in a previous driving method. For example, energy consumption amount information or energy charge information, generated when a specific course of a washing machine is performed under a first condition and a second condition, may be stored in the memory part. The second condition is different in operation condition from the first condition, and is greater than the first condition in energy consumption amount or energy charge. Priorities of the first and second conditions may be determined and displayed on the display part. The priorities of the first and second conditions may be determined according to the priorities of energy charges or the priorities of the numbers of times of uses. Then, a first priority operation condition or a second priority operation condition may be stored in the memory part, and a driving method corresponding to the stored first or second priority operation condition may be selected by a user.","In another example of the method of operating a component, when an energy consumption amount or energy charge of a component according to an operation condition input by a user exceeds a limit, the component may be forcibly controlled to decrease the energy consumption amount or energy charge to be equal to or smaller than the limit, or the display part of the component may display a driving method of decreasing the energy consumption amount or energy charge to be equal to or smaller than the limit. Information, denoting the forcible control of the component, may be displayed on the display part.","In another example of the method of operating a component, while a component is operated according to a selected driving method, when high price-related information is recognized, the selected driving method may be varied or maintained according to the characteristics of the selected driving method. For example, when a prediction power consumption amount (or a prediction energy charge) of the component operated according to a selected driving method is greater than a prediction power consumption amount (or a prediction energy charge) of the component operated according to a standard driving method, the selected driving method may be changed into the standard driving method. When the prediction power consumption amount of the component operated according to the selected driving method is equal to or smaller than the prediction power consumption amount of the component operated according to the standard driving method, the selected driving method may be maintained. The standard driving method may be set when the component is fabricated, or be manually set or changed by a user. Alternatively, the standard driving method may include a plurality of methods, a specific method of which may be selected according to the type of low price-related information.","In another example of the method of operating a component, a component or one or more energy consumer parts constituting the component may be operated to reach a target value that may be varied depending on the type of energy-related information. The target value may be one of a temperature, a humidity value, an operation speed, an operation time period, an operation rate, a power value, an accumulated amount, and an energy charge. The target value may be input by a user, or be calculated according to a load applied to the component or the energy consumer parts by a user. For example, when a refrigerator or an air conditioner recognizes high price-related information, a target temperature value may be increased. On the contrary, when a cooking device recognizes high price-related information, a target temperature value may be decreased. When a washing machine recognizes high price-related information, a target rotation speed of a motor or an operation rate of a heater may be decreased. As such, since a target value is varied, an energy consumption amount or energy charge according to an operation of a component or energy consumer part is decreased in a section where high price-related information is recognized.","In another example of the method of operating a component, selection of an energy decease degree (a power consumption amount decrease degree or an electricity price decrease degree) may be varied depending on the type or state of energy information or additional information. For example, the selection of an energy decease degree may be varied based on a level, corresponding to the energy information or additional information, or the length of a time period where a value corresponding to the energy information or additional information is greater than a reference information value. A power consumption amount decrease degree or an electricity price decrease degree, determined when the value corresponding to the energy information or additional information is greater than the reference information value, is greater than a power consumption amount decrease degree or an electricity price decrease degree determined when the value corresponding to the energy information or additional information is smaller than the reference information value. The reference information value may be set to a plurality of values. In this case, at least one of the reference information values may be a value determining an on-peak time period. In particular, lengths of the on-peak time period may be classified into, e.g., upper, middle, and lower levels. A decrease degree determined when a length of the on-peak time period is the upper level is greater than a decrease degree determined when a length of the on-peak time period is the middle or lower level. When electricity prices are classified into a plurality of levels, an energy decrease degree corresponding to a high electricity price is greater than an energy decrease degree corresponding to a low electricity price.","In another example of the method of operating a component, selection of an energy decrease method may be varied depending on the type or state of energy information or additional information. For example, a component may be a refrigerator, and an on-peak time period may be within a first reference value. In this case, a compressor may be turned off (which is a first method). When the on-peak time period is within the first reference value and a second reference value greater than the first reference value, cooling performance of the compressor may be varied (which is a second method). When the on-peak time period is equal to or greater than a third reference value greater than the second reference value, a target temperature of a storage compartment may be increased (which is a third method). A decrease method may be varied in a section where high price-related information is recognized. High price-related information may be recognized, and the first method may be performed. In this state, when a predetermined period is elapsed, one of the second and third methods may be performed or the second and third methods may be sequentially performed.","In another example of the method of operating a component, when a component includes a plurality of energy consumer parts, selection of an energy consumer part to be controlled may be varied depending on the type or state of energy information or additional information. For example, the selection of an energy consumer part to be controlled may be varied according to energy price values or energy price levels. In this case, a reference information value may include a first reference information value and a second reference information value greater than the first reference information value. Alternatively, the reference information value may include only a value. When a value corresponding to the energy information or additional information is greater than the second reference information value, power of a first energy consumer part (a component that consumes energy) is adjusted (operation limitation). When the value corresponding to the energy information or additional information is between the first and second reference information values, power of a second energy consumer part (a component that consumes energy) is adjusted (operation limitation). When the value corresponding to the energy information or additional information is smaller than the first reference information value, electricity may be stored in an energy storage part (an operation of an energy storage component may be started). That is, any one of control targets or control methods may be selected according to the type or state of energy information or additional information.","In another example of the method of operating a component, while a component is operated, when high price-related information is recognized, total power of energy consumer parts constituting the component and performing the same function may be decreased. The energy consumer parts may be the same or different in type. When the high price-related information is recognized, part of the energy consumer parts may be turned off or power thereof may be decreased. Alternatively, when the high price-related information is recognized, respective power of the energy consumer parts may be decreased with the energy consumer parts maintained at an on-state. Alternatively, when the high price-related information is recognized, respective power of the energy consumer parts may be decreased by the same amount or the same power decrease ratio. Alternatively, when the high price-related information is recognized, respective power of the energy consumer parts may be decreased by different amounts or different power decrease ratios. Alternatively, when the high price-related information is recognized, the energy consumer parts may be alternately turned on and off.","In another example of the method of operating a component, while a component is operated, when high price-related information is recognized, the function of at least one of energy consumer parts constituting the component may be limited, and the function of the other(s) of the energy consumer parts may be performed. A power consumption amount of the energy consumer part with the function limited is greater than a power consumption amount of the energy consumer part with the function performed. For example, while a high power component is operated, when high price-related information is recognized, a high power energy consumer part may be turned off, and a low power energy consumer part may be turned on.","In another example of the method of operating a component, while a component is operated, when high price-related information is recognized, the operation of one of energy consumer parts constituting the component, particular, the operation of an energy consumer part satisfying a limitation condition may be limited. The limitation condition may be a power consumption amount, an energy charge, or limitation priority order. That is, among the energy consumer parts, the operation of an energy consumer part having a power consumption amount or energy charge exceeding a reference value may be limited. Alternatively, among the energy consumer parts, the operation of an energy consumer part having a relatively high power consumption amount may be limited.","In another example of the method of operating a component, when an operation mode of a component includes a plurality of processes, at least one of the processes is limited in a section where high price-related information is recognized. The limitation of the process means a stop of the process or a decrease of a power consumption amount during the process. For example, when the component is a washing machine, the operation mode may be a standard course, a blanket course, or a wool course, and the processes may include at least one of soaking, washing, rinsing, dehydrating, and drying processes. The limitation of the process may be automatically set, or manually set or changed.","In another example of the method of operating a component, while a component is operated, when high price-related information is recognized, two or more factors of factors related to the operations of one or more energy consumer parts (components that perform functions) constituting the component may be varied. The factors may include an operation speed, an operation time period, power, and an operation rate. When a value related to one of the two or more factors is decreased, a value related to another factor may be increased. For example, when an energy consumer part is a motor, a rotation speed of the motor may be decreased, and a rotation time period thereof may be increased. When an energy consumer part is a heater, power of the heater may be decreased, and an operation time period thereof may be increased. That is, when high price-related information is recognized, two or more factors related to the operations of one or more energy consumer parts may be varied. When an energy consumer part is a motor, an operation pattern of the motor may be varied. In particular, when a motor rotates a drum of a washing machine, the motor may be rotated in a forward direction or a reverse direction. The motor is controlled to lift a laundry target and then drop the laundry target. Driving motions of the drum may be different according to rotation speeds of the motor and rotation angles of the motor in a specific direction. The driving motions may include a normal driving motion and one or more special driving motions (which are greater than the normal driving motion in rotation angle of a rotation operation or rotation speed). A power consumption amount of the motor during a special driving motion is greater than a power consumption amount of the motor during the normal driving motion. When high price-related information is recognized in a special driving motion, the washing machine may perform the normal driving motion. When low price-related information is recognized during the normal driving motion, the washing machine performs a specific motion set to be performed when low price-related information is recognized.","In another example of the method of operating a component, only when a period (e.g., an on-peak time period) when high price-related information is recognized exceeds a reference time point, a control operation may be performed to decrease energy consumed by a component. Alternatively, the control operation may be performed just after the high price-related information is recognized. In this case, after the control operation may be performed for a predetermined period, it may be determined again whether the high price-related information is recognized, to determine whether a current state is maintained. This prevents a component operation method from being frequently varied.","In another example of the method of operating a component, a component may receive energy from a plurality of energy generator parts. In particular, the energy generator parts may be different utility networks. In this case, a ratio of energy transmitted from the energy generator parts may be varied depending on energy information. That is, when an energy price of a first energy generator part is lower than that of a second energy generator part, the first energy generator part may supply a larger amount of energy to the component. In this case, an amount or ratio of energy supplied from the energy generator parts may be displayed on a display part of the component. Alternatively, one of the energy generator parts may constitute a utility network, and another one of the energy generator parts may constitute a home network. Also in this case, a ratio of energy transmitted from the energy generator parts may be varied depending on energy information. Alternatively, the component may receive energy from one of the energy generator parts. For example, the component may compare a prediction power consumption amount with an amount of energy supplied from the energy generator parts, to receive energy from one or more energy generator parts selected from the energy generator parts.","In another example of the method of operating a component, a component may have a plurality of spaces that may be cooled or heated. The cooling or heating of the spaces may be varied depending on the type or state of recognized energy information. For example, when high price-related information is recognized, one or more of the spaces may not be cooled or heated. Alternatively, priorities of the spaces may be determined, and thus, the spaces may be sequentially cooled or heated in priority order. The priorities of the spaces may be set by a user, or be automatically set. When high price-related information is recognized, heat or cool air may be transferred from one of the spaces to another space. For example, when high price-related information is recognized, heat may be supplied from a cooking chamber to a heat conservation chamber for keeping food warm.","According to the embodiments, an energy source can be effectively managed."],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 12"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
