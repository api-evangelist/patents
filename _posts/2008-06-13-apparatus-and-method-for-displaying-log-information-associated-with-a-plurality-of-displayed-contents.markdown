{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7365 of International Application PCT\/JP2008\/001537, filed Jun. 13, 2008, which was published in accordance with PCT Article 21(2) on Dec. 17, 2009 in English.","The present invention relates to displaying of log information indicating content output history.","In recent years, in various facilities such as training facilities and business facilities, there has been an increase in the requirement to output a combination of a number of different types of contents such as video sequences, still images, text, and audio at the same time. For example, a desire has arisen to output a number of contents to a single display at the same time in order to convey a greater amount of information to users such as customers and students at one time. There is also a desire arising to output audio and text data relating to video sequences at the same time in order to convey information to a user in a manner that is easy to understand and effective using both a sense of sight and a sense of hearing.","For example, an STB (Set Top Box) has been put forward as a way of meeting such requirements. An STB is a terminal device having a function that connects a server and a management computer terminal via a network, connects an output device via a cable, converts a plurality of image contents distributed by a server into signals capable of being watched and listened on an output device such as a display, and outputs the signals to the output device. The STB divides a display region of a display into a plurality of regions based on description language such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and outputs a plurality of contents accumulated on the server simultaneously at each region.","Methods exist of notifying the user of the occurrence of a malfunction by displaying a predetermined icon, video sequence, or message in the region for displaying the content for which the malfunction occurred on the display when a malfunction occurs for one of a plurality of content outputs.","It is difficult though in this case to give a notification that extends as far as the cause of the malfunction. Here, \u201cmalfunction\u201d refers to cases where it is not possible to display an image because, for example, the data format or size of the image is different, or a file of the image cannot be obtained. When log information corresponding to the malfunction is displayed, the amount of log information generated by the various causes is vast. The causes therefore cannot be sufficiently displayed in the display region for the content. When log information is displayed as far as other display regions for contents, it becomes difficult to see the contents. Even if the log information can be displayed, specifying the log information that is wished to be referenced from the vast amount of log information is troublesome.","It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method capable of easily displaying just the necessary portions of the output history of a plurality of displayed contents.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus () for displaying log information, comprising: a receiving unit () for receiving at least one content and correlation information; the correlation information including correlation that correlates each of a plurality of segments formed at a display () and each of the at least one content outputted to the plurality of segments, an output unit () for outputting the at least one content to the plurality of segments based on the correlation information; and a processor (); wherein the processor is configured to generate the log information including segment information and content information, the log information representing content output history, the segment information identifying each of the plurality of segments, and the content information identifying each of the at least one content, extract part of the log information based on either of the segment information or the content information, and output the extracted log information.","According to the present invention, the log information indicating the content output history is generated so as to include segment information that identifies a segment, and content information that identifies a content. For example, when a video sequence is outputted at a certain segment, log information including segment information that identifies the segment where the video sequence is being outputted and content information that identifies the video sequence is generated. By using either of the segment information or the content information as a search key, log information is then extracted from the generated log information and outputted to the output device. As a result, when contents are outputted in parallel at a plurality of segments, the user can easily refer to log information for the content outputted at a desired segment or log information for the desired content from within a vast amount of log information.","In the scope of the claims and specification of the present invention, \u201csegment\u201d refers to a region formed at part of the entire display region of the display unit that is the output destination of a content. In the case of the picture-in-picture display format, it is also possible for one segment to be the entire display region of the display unit. Further, a \u201ccontent\u201d includes, for example, video sequences, still images, and text, etc.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for displaying log information, comprising steps of: receiving at least one content and correlation information; the correlation information including correlation that correlates each of a plurality of segments formed at a display and each of the at least one content outputted at the plurality of segments, outputting the at least one content to the plurality of segments based on the correlation information; generating the log information including segment information and content information, the log information representing content output history, the segment information identifying each of the plurality of segments, and the content information identifying each the at least one content; extracting (S) part of the log information based on either of the segment information or the content information; and outputting (S) the extracted log information.","According to the present invention, when contents are outputted in parallel at a plurality of segments, the user can easily refer to log information for the content outputted at a desired segment or log information for the desired content from within a vast amount of log information.","According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a program for causing a computer to execute the steps of: receiving at least one content and correlation information; the correlation information including correlation that correlates each of a plurality of segments formed at a display and each of the at least one content outputted at the plurality of segments, outputting the at least one content to the plurality of segments based on the correlation information;

The correlation DB  stores correlation data that correlates the content identifiers, the segment identifiers, and the content output time. The content DB  and the correlation DB  do not have to be at the server  and can also be, for example, within the multimedia terminal .","<<Hardware Configuration of Multimedia Terminal>>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"100"},"Referring to , in this example, the multimedia terminal  has a CPU , a RAM , a ROM , an input interface , an output interface , a hard disc drive (HDD), a communication interface , and a bus  that connects these elements together.","The CPU  executes a control program recorded in the ROM  and controls the overall operation of the multimedia terminal .

A processor may be a general purpose processor, or a built-to-order processor, for example ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit). The RAM  functions as a work area for executing programs. The ROM  stores a control program and preset parameters, etc. The input interface (I\/F in the drawings)  receives an operation signal indicating the results of user operations of the operation unit  such as a remote controller and a keyboard, etc. and supplies an operation signal to the CPU  via the bus .

At the correlation table , it is also possible to correlate other information in addition to the segment identifier and the content identifier. In this example, content \u201coutput time\u201d is further correlated. The correlation table of , for example, correlates the content identifier \u201cmovie A\u201d between 8:00 and 9:59 with the segment identifier \u201cSeg001\u201d, and correlates the content identifier \u201cmovie B\u201d between 10:00 and 13:59 with the segment identifier \u201cSeg001\u201d.","In this example, the output time is shown using absolute time information but this is by no means limited.

The segment display region is a display region that is part of the display  in this example. Each display region can be described by, for example, coordinates (x, y, z). In the first embodiment, the case where display regions of each two-dimensional segment displayed using coordinates (x, y) do not overlap and do not change with time is shown to simplify the description. However, even if the display regions for each segment do overlap, display regions for each segment in this case can be shown using three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z).

When a malfunction occurs in the output for the content, each output program outputs a predetermined notification to the segment corresponding to the content. The predetermined notification can include a predetermined video sequence, a still image, a text image, or a combination of such images, and depends on each output program. A malfunction can be deterioration in picture quality, or stopping of the outputting of a content, etc. A malfunction occurs, for example, when a content cannot be found at the server  or when the receipt of data is delayed as a result of packet loss on the network .
