title: Methods and systems for evaluating interaction of medical products and dependence on demographic variables
abstract: A computer implemented method of evaluating interaction two or more medical products or conditions, in the context of a reference condition, based on a dataset of patient records includes developing a reference contingency lattice of lattice subsets from a subset of the patient records containing the reference condition, wherein the lattice subsets correspond to the number of patient records that contain each of the two or more medical products or conditions and combinations thereof. A plurality of comparison contingency lattices are developed, each of the comparison contingency lattices developed from a respective random subset of patient records not containing the reference condition, where each of the comparison contingency lattices include lattice subsets that correspond to the number of patient records that contain each of the two or more medical products or conditions and combinations thereof. The lattice subsets of the reference contingency lattice are compared to the corresponding lattice subsets of the comparison contingency lattices to determine whether a lattice subset is indicative of an interaction between the medical products or conditions with respect to the reference condition.

This approach uses a lattice-based comparison of datasets, which is also described further herein. In certain embodiments, the following two things are specified:\n\n","The specific example discussed here takes \u201crhabdomyolysis\u201d as the reference condition, comparing results obtained from the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database (maintained by the Food and Drug Administration) among patients reporting this reference condition, against random samples of patients not reporting rhabdomyolysis (i.e., the reference condition). The criteria of primary interest in this example are the three drugs Baycol, Lopid, and Plavix, and the objective of the analysis is to assess the evidence in support of associations between rhabdomyolysis and either individual drugs or drug combinations. It should be noted that the particular reference condition described herein as well as the particular drugs (as criteria of primary interest) referenced herein are exemplary only. One skilled in the art would recognize various other alternatives and modification all of which are considered to be a part of the present invention.","The first construction described here is the contingency lattice, which characterizes all possible combinations of the criteria of primary interest, in a way that it displays information that may be stored in a multi-way contingency table. The random permutation-based reference strategy proposed herein basically asks whether the multi-way contingency table generated from the dataset under the reference condition is consistent with those generated from datasets of the same size (or a similar size) that do not satisfy the reference condition. It should be noted that, in certain embodiments, the generated datasets could be a multiple or a fraction of the size of the dataset under the reference condition provided the results are scaled to account for the different sizes of the datasets.","The second construction described is the orthogonalized contingency lattice, an extension of the contingency lattice just described that is designed to reduce bystander effects where the presence of one condition (e.g., the drug Baycol appearing in an adverse event report) induces a spurious association between other conditions (e.g., the presence of the drug Plavix and the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis).","2 Contingency Lattices","A 2\u00d72 contingency table can be used to summarize records that do or do not satisfy two different binary conditions. That is, suppose that Conditions A and B are characterizations of records in a dataset D that can either be satisfied or not satisfied. In pharmacovigilance problems, for example, these conditions would typically be the presence of a specified drug or adverse event in a spontaneous reporting database (or other similar database) like the FDA's AERS database. For example, Condition A might be the presence of the adverse reaction \u201crhabdomyolysis\u201d in an Individual Safety Report (ISR), and Condition B might be the presence of the drug Baycol (cerivastatin sodium) in the report. Much of what is now done in pharmacovigilance is very closely related to 2\u00d72 contingency tables constructed from such drug-adverse event pairs. These tables are characterized by the following four numbers:\n\n","In particular, commonly used measures of association between conditions (e.g., the odds ratio) can be computed from these four numbers. See, for example, A. A, CDA2ed., Wiley (2002). A key observation is that each of the four numbers listed above represents the size of a well-defined set of records, satisfying the following inclusion conditions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["S","AB"]},"mo":["\u22d0","\u22d0"],"mrow":[{"mo":["{","}"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["S","A"]},"mo":"\u00b7"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"B"}}}}]}},{"mi":["S","\u2026"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"These inclusion conditions represent an important example of a partial order. B. A. DH. A. P, ILO, Cambridge University Press, 1990. Therefore, set S precedes set T, written S<T, if S is contained in T as a subset. Note that not all sets are comparable in this partial order: for example, S. is generally neither contained in nor contains S.. Conversely, note that these two sets exhibit a greatest lower bound (specifically, the set S=S.\u2229S.is the largest set contained in both S. and S.) and a least upper bound (the set S..).","More generally, a lattice is a special case of a partially ordered set or poset in which it may not be possible to compare all elements of the set directly, but every pair of elements does have both a greatest lower bound (GLB) and a least upper bound (LUB). That is, given two elements x and y and some ordering criterion <, it may not be true that either x<y or y<x, but if x and y are elements of a lattice, it is true that there exist elements a and b such that both a<x and a<y hold, and that x<b and y<b also hold. An important example is the collection of subsets of a set, ordered by inclusion. For concreteness, consider the three-element case, S={x, y, z}. Altogether, there are 2=8 possible subsets:\n\n","where \u2205 denotes the empty set. By definition, the empty set is a subset of all other sets, and it is clear that all one- and two-element sets in this list are subsets of the original set S, but some of these sets are not comparable under the inclusion ordering. For example, since {x, y} neither contains nor is contained in {x, z}, these two sets are not comparable under this order. However, both of these sets contain {x} as a subset and both are contained in the complete set S. These two sets represent the greatest lower bound (i.e., the largest subset common to both) and the least upper bound (i.e., the smallest set containing both), respectively, for the pair of sets {x, y} and {x, z}.","Lattices provide the basis for formal concept analysis (FCA), an area of active research in the data mining community. U. Priss, , ARIS, V40 (to be published). Roughly speaking, FCA is based on lattices defined by mutually-reinforcing sets of data records and attributes. A practical disadvantage of formal concept analysis is that the resulting lattices are often huge. For example, Stumme et al. (cited further herein) note that the total number of formal concepts required to fully characterize the mushroom dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Archive is 32,086 for a dataset containing 23 characterizations of 8,416 mushrooms. G. Stumme, R. Taouil, Y. Bastide, N. Pasquier, and L. Lakhal, , DKE, V42, 189-222 (2002). Examples like this one motivate their development of approximate descriptions in terms of much smaller lattices of concepts with \u201clarge support.\u201d","Alternatively, any finite collection of binary conditions (i.e., conditions that each individual record either satisfies or does not satisfy) defines a subset lattice, consisting of the subsets satisfying each individual condition and all possible combinations of these conditions. For N conditions, this lattice consists of 2sets and it corresponds to a multi-way contingency table analogous to the 2\u00d72 contingency table (suitably expanded) discussed above. Typically, multi-way contingency tables involving three or more conditions are analyzed using loglinear models (See A. Agresti at Section 8.4), but the asymmetric nature of these models (i.e., they predict a single response variable from all others, taken as independent stimuli) has been raised as an objection in some applications where it is not natural to separate variables into a single response and N\u22121 independent stimuli. See J. R. Vokey, , C. J. E. P, v. 57, 257-264 (2003). In certain embodiments, the present invention proposes the use of the lattice of these sets as an alternative approach to analyzing these multiway tables.","As a specific example,  shows a lattice  generated by the subsets of ISR's from the AERS database listing the following three drugs: B: Baycol (cerivastatin sodium), L: Lopid (gemfibrozil), P: Plavix (clopidogrel bisulfate).","These criteria define three subsets of the patient records in the dataset D, and these subsets in turn generate the subset inclusion lattice  shown in . That is, each box (-) in this figure represents a subset of patient records from D, with the top box representing all records in the dataset. The three boxes (, , ) in the second row from the top in this figure correspond to the sets of patient records satisfying each of the three conditions defined above, and the three boxes (, , ) in the third row correspond to the subsets of patients satisfying each pair of these conditions. Finally, the single box () at the bottom corresponds to the subset of patients exhibiting all three of these characteristics. The arrows in this figure point from each set to all of its immediate subsets (i.e., all subsets obtained by imposing one additional condition).","In the basic analysis approach proposed here, given a set of conditions of interest (e.g., the three drugs Baycol, Lopid, and Plavix in the example just described), a corresponding contingency lattice is first constructed, as in . We then characterize all of the sets defined by this lattice in terms of their size, giving a vector of 2integer-valued components. Finally, we determine whether these numbers are associated with the reference condition by using the random subset-based significance analysis described in the next section. The basic question of interest is whether any of the subsets defining the contingency lattice are larger or smaller than we would expect due to random sampling alone, in the absence of any association between the reference condition that defines dataset D and the conditions of interest defining the lattice of subsets.","3 Randomized References","To interpret contingency lattice results, the contingency lattice as described in the preceding discussion is first constructed, using the records from a dataset Dthat satisfies a specified reference condition R. In the specific example considered in this note, this reference condition is the occurrence of the adverse event \u201crhabdomyolysis\u201d in each adverse event report (i.e., Dcontains all records for patients reporting rhabdomyolysis). A key assumption is that the reference set Dis a proper subset of the original dataset D, such that the difference set D\\D=D\u2229 contains a relatively large number of records compared with D. Note that this condition is automatically satisfied if N<<N, as in the example considered here (N=11,773 vs. N=597,074). Under this assumption, it is possible to generate a large number M of random subsets of D that do not satisfy the reference condition R. The basic analysis strategy is then to generate M such subsets, construct their associated contingency lattices, and compare the results obtained with the original contingency lattice. If these randomly generated lattices are consistently different from the original contingency lattice, this observation provides evidence of an association between the reference condition R and one or more of the conditions of interest defining the contingency lattice.","The measures of difference considered here are the sizes of the subsets defined by the contingency lattices. It should be recognized that using the sizes as a measure of difference is exemplary only and one skilled in the art would recognize various alternatives and modifications all of which are considered a part of the present invention. Examples of which can include the use of alternative characterizations, such as age or gender. In certain embodiments, each of the randomly generated comparison datasets {D} is of fixed size N, and the sizes of the 2\u22121 other lattice subsets will be denoted Nwhere j=1, 2, . . . , 2\u22121 designates the sub-set and i=1, 2, . . . , M designates the dataset Dconsidered. The sizes of the corresponding subsets constructed from the reference dataset Dare denoted Nfor j=1, 2, . . . , 2\u22121. Differences between the results obtained for the reference dataset Dand the random comparison datasets Dare assessed using the difference between the subset sizes Nand {N} for i=1, 2, . . . , M for all subsets j. Unusually large values of Nrelative to {N} suggest a possible association between the reference condition R and the conditions of interest that define the subset j.","Boxplot summaries provide a convenient graphical way of representing these results, highlighting the subsets for which the differences between the primary reference dataset and the randomized comparison datasets are most pronounced. This point is illustrated in , which shows the results  obtained for the reference condition \u201crhabdomyolysis,\u201d which defines a reference dataset Dof size N=11,773. The solid points shown in  represent the sizes of each of the seven subsets (-) of Ddefined by the three conditions of interest (i.e., patient was taking Baycol, Lopid, Plavix, or a combination of these drugs). The boxplots shown in  summarize the subset sizes obtained for M=200 comparison sets {D}, each obtained by randomly selecting N=11,773 patient records from among those not reporting the reference condition rhabdomyolysis. The fact that some of the reference results (most prominently, those for Baycol (Case B or ), Lopid (Case L or ), and Baycol with Lopid (Case BL or )) fall well outside the range of the randomized comparison results suggests a significant association between the condition \u201crhabdomyolysis\u201d and these drugs.  also lists the z-scores  associated with each comparison (i.e., between the size of primary reference dataset and the sizes of the randomized comparison subsets). These numbers provide quantitative characterizations of these comparisons and are described in the next section.","4 Interpretation Via Z-Scores","In classical statistics, random variables are frequently assumed to exhibit a Gaussian distribution, which is completely characterized by the population mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3. In fact, if \u03bc and \u03c3 are known, the probability of observing a sample from this distribution with the value X is completely determined by the value Z=(X\u2212\u03bc)\/\u03c3. In cases where the Gaussian assumption is reasonable but \u03bc and \u03c3 are unknown, these quantities are usually estimated from a sequence of N data samples {x} as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"^"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["x","k"]}}}},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c3","mo":"^"},"mo":"=","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","k"]},"mo":"-","mover":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"^"}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"."}}}}}],"mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"It follows from this result that the probability of observing a specific data value x in an approximately Gaussian data sequence can be reliably estimated from the z-score, the sample analog of Z defined above:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0048"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"z","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"-","mover":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"^"}},"mover":{"mi":"\u03c3","mo":"^"}},"mo":"."}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Despite its popularity, the Gaussian assumption often fails to hold; even so, the z-scores can still be used to derive probability bounds that are quite conservative but almost universal.

It follows from the above arguments that if the magnitude of the resulting z-score is large, the result obtained under the primary reference condition is not consistent with the randomized comparison results. Such an inconsistency represents evidence that the reference condition significantly influences the size of the corresponding contingency lattice subset. If there is insufficient data regarding a given set of conditions, however, the standard deviation of the numbers in the comparison contingency lattice will increase. This may be taken as an indication that, because of insufficient data, the proposed method has inadequate power to draw conclusions.","As a specific example, the very large z-scores listed in  for Cases B, L, and BL (, , and ) provide evidence that the drugs Baycol, Lopid and the two together are strongly associated with the adverse event rhabdomyolysis.

Specifically, this table gives the size of each of the seven subsets for patients reporting rhabdomyolysis, the range of the corresponding subset sizes for M=200 randomly selected samples of patients not reporting rhabdomyolysis, the associated z-scores, and their probability bounds as determined by the Chebyshev inequality (4).

Hence, if the probability of declaring a result significant when it is not (i.e., the \u201cfalse positive rate\u201d) is fixed at \u03b1 and all tests are independent, it follows that the probability of erroneously declaring one of p results significant when it is not increases to approximately p\u03b1. The simplest way of correcting for this effect is to use the Bonferroni correction, which replaces the single-test significance level \u03b1 with the more conservative p-test significance level \u03b1\/p.

Subsequent investigation shows that the cause of these apparent associations is the large number of cases involving the drug Baycol present in each of these individual subsets. This effect\u2014the spurious generation of association signals between a drug and an unrelated adverse event\u2014is called a bystander effect and is a significant concern in the pharmacovigilance literature. See, for example, D. M. Coulter, A. Bate, E. H. B. Meyboom, M. Lindquist, and I. R. Edwards, , BMJ322, 1207-09 (2001).","5 Orthogonalized Contingency Lattices","A difficulty with the analysis described above is that subsets listing a particular drug or drug combination may also list other drugs or drug combinations with unknown frequencies. For example, the subset labeled \u201cPlavix\u201d in  contains all patient records that list the drug Plavix, regardless of whether they also list the drugs Baycol, Lopid, or both. Consequently, if there is a strong association between the drug Baycol and the condition rhabdomyolysis, which is known to be the case, and if there is a significant overlap between patient records listing Plavix and Baycol, then the apparent association between Plavix and rhabdomyolysis can be significantly inflated in the contingency lattice analysis just described. Note also that, even when using the multiway contingency tables, these bystander effects can be expected in traditional analyses based on contingency tables.","To overcome these bystander effects, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides orthogonalized contingency lattices as a basis for pharmacovigilance analysis. The basic idea is to replace subsets like \u201call patients taking Plavix\u201d in the example considered earlier with non-overlapping subsets like \u201call patients taking Plavix but not taking either Baycol or Lopid.\u201d To illustrate this idea more completely,  shows the orthogonalized version  of the contingency lattice shown in . As before, the three drugs considered are designated as B (Baycol), L (Lopid), and P (Plavix), but in  an overbar is used to indicate that a certain condition is excluded in constructing the corresponding patient subset. For example, the left-most block  in the second row in  is designated B, , , defining the set of AERS ISR's listing the drug Baycol but not listing the drugs Lopid or Plavix. More generally, note that each of the seven subset blocks (-) appearing in  lists all three symbols B, L, and P, either without an overbar to indicate it is included in forming the subset, or with an overbar to indicate that it is excluded. As a consequence, it should be noted that all of these subsets are mutually exclusive, with no patient appearing in more than one subset.","The results obtained from the orthogonalized contingency lattice just described are analyzed exactly as in the case of the basic contingency lattice described previously. That is, the sizes of the subsets defined by the combinations of conditions of interest in the orthogonalized lattice are compared, between records satisfying the reference condition R and M randomly selected subsets of the same size that do not satisfy this reference condition. As discussed earlier herein, the comparison record set may also be a multiple or fraction of the size of the record set satisfying the reference condition provided the results from the comparison record set are suitably scaled so that comparisons effectively made between record sets of the same size.","Significant differences in subset size between those based on the reference condition and those based on the random comparison datasets give evidence of an association between the reference condition and the conditions of interest defining each subset in which the significant size difference has been observed. As before, significance is assessed using the Bonferroni-corrected z-score analysis described earlier herein. The primary difference between the results obtained with the original contingency lattice construction and those obtained with the orthogonalized construction lies in the fact that the orthogonalized patient subsets are mutually exclusive. Consequently, associations observed between the reference condition and the conditions of interest defining a subset cannot be a spurious consequence of associations between the reference condition and other conditions of interest, provided they are included in the orthogonalized contingency lattice. That is, spurious associations due to conditions not included in the analysis are still possible. For example, if Baycol were replaced with Lipitor in this example, the fact that many records listing Lopid also list Baycol would not enter into the analysis, so unrecognized Baycol-induced bystander effects would inflate the Lopid\/rhabdomyolysis association, just as in the non-orthogonalized results presented in the preceding discussion.","The orthogonalized contingency lattice results obtained for the example considered here are summarized in a boxplot  shown in , which should be compared with the boxplot  shown in . First, note the difference in horizontal scales between these two figures, reflecting the fact that the subsets (-) defining the orthogonalized lattice are generally smaller than the respective subsets (-) defining the original lattice. In particular, note that each of the subsets (-) indicated in  is contained in the corresponding subset (-) indicated in . For example, the subset designated B, , , in  is contained in the Baycol subset (Case B or ) in . Second, and more significantly, note that the apparently strong association between Lopid and rhabdomyolysis implied by the results for Case L in  is much weaker in the orthogonalized results presented in . The magnitude of this difference is even more apparent from the z-scores presented in Table 2 below for the orthogonalized results, when compared with those presented in Table 1 for the original results. For the case of Lopid, it should be noted that removal of Baycol and Plavix records in the orthogonalized result decreases the z-score by an order of magnitude, from z=403 to z=43, increasing its associated probability by two orders of magnitude. Finally, the third major difference between these two figures is that the rhabdomyolysis result for Plavix (Case P), which falls clearly outside the range of the non-rhabdomyolysis results in the original analysis, falls within this range in the orthogonalized analysis. This difference is also reflected in the z-scores listed in Table 2: whereas in the original results, the association seen between Plavix and rhabdomyolysis was significant at the Bonferroni-corrected 5% level, this is no longer true for the orthogonalized results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0064"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of subset definitions, sizes based on the rhabdomyolysis"},{"entry":"dataset, minimum and maximum subset sizes from the 200 randomly"},{"entry":"generated non-rhabdomyolysis datasets, the z-scores characterizing the"},{"entry":"differences between the rhabdomyolysis and non-rhabdomyolysis"},{"entry":"randomized datasets, and the corresponding probabilities derived from"},{"entry":"the Chebyshev inequality.

In two cases, they are the same: one is the three-way interaction BLP where the subsets ( and ) are identical in the two contingency lattices, and the other is the interaction between Baycol and Lopid, where the subsets ( and ) differ in size (and content) by about 1%. Conversely, there are cases where the differences between these results are quite pronounced, most prominently in the case of Lopid (Case L or  vs. orthogonalized Case L  or , where the z-score declines from 403 to 43. While the orthogonalized result remains significant, it is substantially less so, reflecting the fact that the orthogonalized Lopid subset is substantially smaller than the non-orthogonalized one (306 records vs. 2982 records). Finally, two other cases where the orthogonalization makes an important difference are those of Plavix alone and Plavix with Lopid: both original results are significant at the Bonferroni-corrected 5%, while the orthogonalized results are not.

Baycol alone ranks second in both cases, but the z-score for the orthogonalized result is substantially smaller than that for the original result (293 vs. 498), reflecting the large number of records listing Baycol that also list Lopid. The third-ranked subset differs substantially between the orthogonalized and original lattice results: for the original results, Lopid by itself ranked third, while in the orthogonalized results, this subset drops to fifth and the combination BP  is ranked third.

A basic description of an example approach of an embodiment of the invention illustrates a well-known case: that of Baycol, where significant association with rhabdomyolysis, particularly when co-prescribed with Lopid, led to its withdrawal from the market.

The essential idea behind the displays considered here is that they compare the numbers of times Adverse Reaction X is observed under the following four conditions: (1) among records listing both Drug A and Drug B; (2) among records listing Drug A without Drug B; (3) among records listing Drug B without Drug A; (4) among records listing neither Drug A nor Drug B.","In the following description, let N denote the size of the first subset listed above\u2014i.e., the total number of records in the available database listing both drugs. The interaction analysis considered here begins by computing N, the number of times that Reaction X appears in this first record subset, and the objective of the analysis is to provide reference numbers to answer the following questions:\n\n","Each of these questions defines a collection of random reference sets that may be used to provide answers. Specifically, M random samples, each of size N, are drawn from the reference population defined by each of these questions (i.e., Drug A alone, Drug B alone, and neither drug), and the number of records in each random sample that also lists Reaction X is recorded. Side-by-side boxplot displays provide a useful visualization of these results.","As a specific example,  presents the boxplot  results obtained for the drugs Baycol and Lopid, with the adverse event \u201crhabdomyolysis.\u201d The solid circle  in  represents the number Nof records listing rhabdomyolysis in the N=1728 records listing both Baycol and Lopid. The left-most boxplot  summarizes the range of results obtained for the drug Baycol alone, giving the number of records in 100 random samples, each of size N=1728 that list the adverse event rhabdomyolysis and the drug Baycol but not the drug Lopid. The central boxplot  summarizes the range of results obtained for the drug Lopid alone, computed analogously, and the right-most boxplot  summarizes the range of results obtained from 100 random samples drawn from those records that list neither drug. The fact that the solid circle  lies so far above the range of variation of any of the three reference boxplots provides strong evidence of an interaction between the two drugs: the adverse reaction rhabdomyolysis is much more likely in patients taking both drugs than in patients taking either drug alone. In fact, this interaction was cited explicitly in the FDA's withdrawal notice for the drug Baycol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610","620","630","640","610"]},"8 Augmented Lattice Displays","The augmented lattice display approach may be used to address strong second-order bystander effects involving more than two medical products or conditions. An augmented lattice display combines the results obtained from the orthogonalized lattice described herein with the two-way interaction analysis procedure described herein. This display includes the same individual points and reference boxplots as in the orthogonalized lattice, augmenting the plot for any results that are declared significant but which may represent second-order bystander effects. If Drug A exhibits a strong association with the adverse event under consideration, records listing Drug A along with other drugs should have a significant probability of listing the adverse event even in the absence of any effect from the other drugs, as seen in the example of Infliximab and Methotrexate shown in . Thus, the augmented lattice display includes an estimate of the range of values expected for the drug combination in the absence of any interaction effects. If the observed result falls significantly above this range, this observation provides evidence for a positive (e.g., harmful) interaction involving Drug A, while if the observed result falls significantly below this range, this observation provides evidence for a negative (e.g., beneficial) interaction involving Drug A. Results falling within this range suggest that drug interaction effects are not significant.","The point in the orthogonalized lattice plot corresponds to N, the number of times a specified drug combination appears among those records listing Adverse Reaction X. An equivalent interpretation of N, however, is as the number of times Reaction X appears in the set of N records listing the specified drug combination. This alternative view provides the basis for the augmented reference values considered here, which are the numbers of times Reaction X appears in M random samples, each of size N, drawn from records listing Drug A alone, without the other drugs included in the combination. The basic idea is that if these other drugs have no interaction effects, the observed value of Nshould fall within the range of these random samples.","The drug infliximab (Remicade) is indicated for treatment of arthritis and Crohn's disease. The first 25 of 365 adverse events for this drug that exceed the Bonferroni-corrected 5% significance threshold, ranked in descending order of Statistical Unexpectedness, are listed in Table 7. The strongest association seen in this list is that with \u201ctuberculosis nos,\u201d consistent with the black box warning issued in October of 2001, which included the following wording: Tuberculosis (frequently disseminated or extrapulmonary at clinical presentation), invasive fungal infections, and other opportunistic infections, have been observed in patients receiving Remicade. Some of these infections have been fatal. Altogether, the 12 distinct tuberculosis designations listed in Table 7 fall above the Bonferroni-corrected 5% Statistical Unexpectedness limit and are combined here into the overall tuberculosis adverse reaction used in subsequent discussions. Further examination of the AERS ISR's associated with both the drug infliximab and the tuberculosis reactions listed in Table 7 shows that infliximab is frequently co-prescribed with the corticosteroids prednisone or prednisolone, with methotrexate, or with leflunomide. These observations motivate the interaction analysis described here, which attempts to determine which of these drugs or drug combinations are strongly associated with tuberculosis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0107"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

The five solid circles represent results that are declared significant by the orthogonalized lattice analysis, based on their distance from the corresponding reference boxplots appearing across the bottom of the figure.

These reference values were computed as described above: each drug combination defines a set of size N consisting of all records listing the indicated drugs but not listing the excluded drugs. Then, 200 random samples of this size are drawn from the larger set of records listing only the drug infliximab and none of the other three, and the number of these records listing tuberculosis is determined. The reference ranges shown in the plot correspond to the ranges for these numbers.","In three of these cases\u2014combinations of infliximab with methotrexate only, with both steroids and methotrexate, and with both steroids and leflunomide\u2014the original Nvalue falls within this range of 200 random reference values. Thus, these three combinations represent second-order bystander effects since the range of Nvalues expected on the basis of the infliximab\/tuberculosis association alone covers the observed Nvalue. In the one remaining case\u2014Case 5, the combination of infliximab with steroids\u2014the observed Nvalue falls slightly below the range of the random reference values, suggesting the possibility of a weak protective interaction between steroids and infliximab. Thus, the only strong positive association with tuberculosis is that with infliximab alone, as shown in .","9 Dependence on Demographic Variables","An extension of the two-way interaction analysis method described earlier may be used. The purpose of this extension is to provide a computationally-based tool that permit the assessment of the extent to which the association results, obtained by methods described in the literature, depend on demographic variables like age or gender that may be included in the data source on which the analysis is based. Given a specified drug and adverse event, this analysis method is based on four data subsets analogous to those used in the two-way analysis, namely: (1) records listing both the drug and the adverse event; (2) records listing the drug but not the adverse event; (3) records listing the adverse event but not the drug; (4) records listing neither the drug nor the adverse event.","These records are characterized in one of two ways. For continuous demographic variables like age or weight, each collection of records is characterized by the average of the available values for this demographic variable. In the illustrative embodiment described here, no imputation of missing values for this variable is performed, although doing so will be apparent to one skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure and could be accomplished by any one of several different methods that have been described in the literature. See, for example, R. J. A. Little and D. B. Rubin, 2nd ed., Wiley, 2002, and R. K. Pearson, , SIAM, Philadelphia, 2005. For categorical demographic variables like gender or race, these collections of records are characterized by the fraction of records for which the variable assumes a specified value (e.g., \u201cfraction of records listing male gender\u201d).","Given the four classes of records listed above and a numerical characterization like those just described for each record class, the analysis method proposed here proceeds as follows. First, the collection of records listing both the drug and the adverse event has a fixed size N, and the quantitative characterization just described yields a single number when applied to these N records. Next, a collection of M random samples, each of N records, is drawn from the collection of records from each of the other three classes: all records listing the drug but not the adverse event, all records listing the adverse event but not the drug, and all records listing neither the drug nor the adverse event. The quantitative characterization described above is then applied to each of these M random samples, yielding a collection of M numerical values for each of these three reference populations. A graphical display is then constructed to compare the original result with the M results from each reference population, exactly analogous to the two-way interaction analysis plots described earlier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","810","820","830","840","850"]},"The results shown in  demonstrate first, that the average reported age for records listing both the drug and the adverse event are substantially lower than those for random samples from any of the three reference populations. This observation suggests that age may be an important factor in the association between this drug and adverse event. In particular, while it appears from  that the average reported ages for both records listing the drug alone and those listing the adverse event alone are significantly lower than average for the AERS database overall (specifically, note that the dashed line lies above the average age range for both of these populations), the average reported age for records listing both the drug and the adverse event lies well below the range of variation seen for either of these reference populations.","As a second illustrative example, the boxplot  of  shows the analogous results obtained using the fraction of records listing gender as \u201cfemale\u201d for the combination of the drug Accutane with the adverse event \u201cmood swings.\u201d Here, the solid circle  represents the fraction of the N records listing the drug Accutane and the adverse event \u201cmood swings\u201d that also list female gender. The three boxplots , ,  in  give this characterization for the three reference populations analogous to those considered in the previous example: M=100 randomly drawn samples, each of size N, from records listing the drug Accutane without the adverse event, from those listing \u201cmood swings\u201d without the drug, and from those listing neither the drug nor the adverse event. Here, the fact that the solid circles lies above the range of all three boxplots means that the combination of the drug and the adverse event is significantly more likely to appear in a record listing female gender than is typical for any of the three reference populations.
