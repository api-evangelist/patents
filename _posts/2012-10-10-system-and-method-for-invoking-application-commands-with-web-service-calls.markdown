Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure may be implemented entirely hardware, entirely software (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or combining software and hardware implementation that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present disclosure may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable media having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Any combination of one or more computer readable media may be utilized. The computer readable media may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer readable storage medium would include the following: a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an appropriate optical fiber with a repeater, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electro-magnetic, optical, or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. Program code embodied on a computer readable signal medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc., or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present disclosure may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language, such as JAVA\u00ae, SCALA\u00ae, SMALLTALK\u00ae, EIFFEL\u00ae, JADE\u00ae, EMERALD\u00ae, C++, C#, VB.NET, PYTHON\u00ae or the like, conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language, VISUAL BASIC\u00ae, FORTRAN\u00ae 2003, Perl, COBOL 2002, PHP, ABAP\u00ae, dynamic programming languages such as PYTHON\u00ae, RUBY\u00ae and Groovy, or other programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider) or in a cloud computing environment or offered as a service such as a Software as a Service (SaaS).","Aspects of the present disclosure are described herein with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatuses (systems) and computer program products according to aspects of the disclosure. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable instruction execution apparatus, create a mechanism for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that when executed can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions when stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which when executed, cause a computer to implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks. The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable instruction execution apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatuses or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","Service oriented architectures may enable application reuse by exposing service functionality across platforms via a network. Businesses may host applications on several computing platforms such as WINDOWS, UNIX, and LINUX. These platforms may not be compatible and may not be designed to allow access to applications running on a different platform. Developing web services that conform to the representational state transfer (\u201cREST\u201d) architecture may ensure that those services may be accessed with standards based methods such as hypertext transfer protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) methods. However, calling such services may require an in depth knowledge and understanding of HTTP. Application developers, generally, may specialize in high level applications and may not be familiar with the HTTP concepts required for conducting REST service communications.","An organization's inability to leverage service oriented architectures may produce inefficiencies. When businesses may host applications on incompatible platforms, users or applications running on one platform may not communicate with applications hosted on other platforms. A duplicate application may be deployed on each platform to ensure compatibility. Moreover, redundant applications may duplicate development and maintenance effort. An upgrade to one application may require development and deployment on multiple platforms. Such a configuration may waste resources and may produce maintenance inefficiencies.","This disclosure may allow a programmer with no knowledge of TCP\/IP socket programming or Transport Layer Security programming to make web service requests, and invoke application commands. Methods of the disclosure may be used to substitute runtime data into a template XML document which may be read from disk. These methods may present a technical advantage by alleviating the programmer responsibility of forming an entire, grammatically correct, XML document within application logic. Simplifications to the programming effort embodied in the disclosure to send REST web service requests may increase customer adoption of web services provided by various software-as-a-service applications.","Referring to , a system  for invoking an application command may be implemented in one or more computers, e.g., one or more of a personal computer, a server, a mobile device, or the like. System  may comprise computers  and .

The notification command may comprise information from XML document . Application  may send a notification to a recipient that may correspond to the recipient in XML document  when the notification command is executed on application . The notification may comprise a message that may correspond to the message to the recipient in XML document . The notification may further comprise an inquiry that may correspond to the inquiry in XML document . The notification may further comprise a response to be selected by the recipient that may correspond to the response to be selected by the recipient in XML document .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100","200"]},"At step , a computer may generate XML document . A computer may run an application configured to make web service calls by calling API functions during execution. A computer may store XML document  in one or more of hard disk, and main memory during one or more of application runtime, installation, and function execution. The XML document may contain a command. The command may contain information indicating an application and information indicating a command to invoke. In another embodiment, XML document  may include one or more of information indicating a recipient, a message, an inquiry for the recipient, and a response to be selected by the recipient.","The command may comprise information indicating application , and information indicating the command to be executed on application . Web service  may parse the command information from XML document , and may search memory  for processes that may match the information indicating application . In another embodiment, the command may comprise a combination of one or more of application names, parameters, arguments and constraints. In still other embodiments, XML document  may include, for example, one or more of information indicating a recipient, a message, an inquiry for the recipient, and a response to be selected by the recipient.","XML document  may be stored in data storage , and may be loaded into memory  by application . In another embodiment, application  may create XML document  and may store it in memory . Application  may generate XML document . In another embodiment, different applications may generate XML document , or XML document  may be generated during application  installation.","At step , the computer referred to in step  may transmit a request through a network using request manager . The request may be an HTTP request, and may include one or more of a URI, a query string, and a plurality of HTTP header fields. The query string parameters may comprise one or more of a user name, password, and HTTP method. Other parameters may be included in the query string without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The XML document may be embedded in the query string. In another embodiment, the XML document may be embedded in the body of the HTTP POST request.","Request manager  may receive parameters from application . The parameters may include one or more of a uniform resource identifier (URI), a hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) method, a user name, a password and XML document . The URI may comprise an internet protocol (IP) address of computer , a port number indicating a port on computer  and a path indicating a path in the web server directory structure of computer  that may correspond to web service . In another embodiment, the URI may comprise a domain name of computer  and a path to web service . The domain name may be resolved to the IP address of computer  by a domain name server. The HTTP method may indicate the action to be performed on the resource specified by the URI. The HTTP method may include HEAD, GET, POST, OPTIONS, or any other HTTP method for which web service  is configured to act on. The user name may be associated with a user running application . The user name may be a network service user, a generic web user, or any other user that may be authorized to access web service . The password maybe encrypted in application , decrypted in web service  and may be used to authenticate the request. The password may be encrypted and decrypted using a public shared key or any other encryption\/decryption algorithm. In another embodiment, the password may not be encrypted.","Request manager  may create a request using the parameters of the command. The request may be an HTTP request that may be sent to the URI. Request manager  may modify the URI to include query string parameters. The query string parameters may comprise one or more of the user name, password, and HTTP method. Other parameters may be included in the query string without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Request manager  may include parameters in an HTTP header field or body. For example, request manager  may include XML document  in the HTTP request body when the request is using the POST HTTP method. HTTP header fields may include complex character strings.","A URI may represent a resource upon which operations are performed. The meaning of an HTTP method may be determined by the specified URI. For example, the base name of a URI targeted to a web service running under an application server on a local machine may be: https:\/\/localhost:8443\/apwebsvc. A specific host name may be used by a client application running on another computer. Further, a site may choose to configure an application server to use a non-default port number. The remainder of the URI may reflect the resource of interest.","A URI may contain a query string that may contain non-hierarchical data that, along with data in the path component, may serve to identify a resource within the scope of the URI's scheme and naming authority. Request manager  may modify the URI to include the parameters in the query component of the URI, such that the URI may pass parameters from resource manager  to web service . The query component may be indicated by the first question mark (\u2018?\u2019) character and may be terminated by a number sign (\u2018#\u2019) character or by the end of the URI. Query components may be used to carry identifying information in the form of \u201ckey=value\u201d pairs.","The URI may have multiple query options separated with an ampersand character (\u2018&\u2019) character as in the following example: URI-path?option1=value&option2=value2. When an unknown query option is specified, the operation may return an HTTP status error of 400 (Bad Request). If an otherwise valid query option is specified, which is not applicable due to a conflict with another query option, the non-applicable option may be ignored and the operation may be processed.","Within some query strings, a pattern-matching expression may be used as the value of a query option.

Code objects may communicate with request manager  through an application programming interface (API). The API may allow access to functions of request manager .","In a particular embodiment, the API may be a web service JAVA\u00ae client API that may be used to make web service requests of a server. The web service API may be a RESTful interface that may use the HTTP protocol to specify the web service object of interest through a URI string, and request that an action be performed against that URI. The HTTP request-response protocol may be implemented within an application in order to send HTTP operations to a web service listener. The purpose of the JAVA\u00ae API may be to abstract the HTTP protocol.","When using this JAVA\u00ae API, the JAVA\u00ae programming responsibility may consist of:","1. Form a URI string that represents a desired web service  resource.","2. Identify the action to take on that resource.","3. Specify a user name and password that is authorized to perform the desired action.","4. If required by the action, form a string containing an XML document that provides all of the properties associated with the action.","5. Construct a com.ca.distauto.ap.websvc.client.RequestService object.","6. Call the RequestService.sendRequest method.","7. Check the returned HTTP status code value.","8. Process the returned XML reply document.","The JAVA\u00ae API may be bundled with a RequestService client. The JAVA\u00ae API may be deployed onto a remote computer.","Most of the web service actions may require an XML request document and may return an XML response document. XML schemas that may define the formats of all of these documents may be contained in a directory. For example, schema documents  may be stored in the \u2018InstallationDirectory\\distrib\\websvc\u2019 directory.","In a particular embodiment, the API may comprise a RequestService class that may perform web service requests for programs that may have no knowledge of web service protocols. The class may contain the functionality of request manager . The RequestService class may perform requests of REST web services, and may communicate XML documents with a web service using the HTTP protocol in a REST approach. The calling code may not know most of the REST communication details. The request manager object may further send a REST request to a URI using the XML document as the body of the request. The RequestService class may contain the three methods detailed below:\n\n","The RequestService class may contain a sendRequest method that may send REST requests to a specified URI using a specified XML document as the body of the request. The signature for the sendRequest method may be described below:\n\n","The sendRequest method may accept parameters that may include an action, a resource URI, a user name, a password, a XML document, and a reply document. The action may specify the HTTP method to be performed against the specified URI. The resource URI may represent the desired service resource. Any spaces in the URI may automatically be converted to the HTTP URI encoding convention. The user name may specify a user name with privileges to act on the desired resource. The password may specify the password for the specified user name. The XML document may contain the request information. The XML document parameter may be null for a request that does not take a XML document. The XML document parameter may be supplied with XML document . The reply document may be an XML document that may contain the reply from the web service request. Not every request may deliver a reply document upon success. Some service requests may return an HTTP status code. The sendRequest method may return an HTTP status code that may represent the success or failure of the request. Values less than 300 may represent a success. Any other value may represent a failure.","The RequestService class may contain a replacePatterns method that may replace a set of patterns with corresponding replacements within textWithPatterns. Each pattern may be a simple text string (no regular expression pattern matching). The intended use of this method may be to replace multiple place-holders within XML template text with values determined at runtime. The signature for the replacePatterns method may be described below:","public java.lang.String replacePatterns(java.lang.String textWithPatterns,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":"java.util.ArrayList<RequestService.Substitution> substitutions)"}}}},"The replacePatterns method may accept parameters that may include the text for which the pattern replacement will be performed, and an array containing pairs of patterns and replacements.","The RequestService class may contain a main method that may be run from the command line to make a request of a RESTful web service-enabled server program. This application may accept parameters from the command line needed to communicate to the server application. This program may understand the web service protocols needed to communicate XML documents with a web service. It may be intended to enable scripts, which may have no knowledge of web service protocols, to make web service requests. The method signature may be described below:","public static void main(java.lang.String[ ] cmdLineArgs)","In a particular embodiment, the API may utilize a REST architecture. Thus, the API may perform various operations by issuing the HTTP methods GET, PUT, POST, and OPTIONS against a well-defined hierarchy of URIs that represent web service  objects. These URIs may be like the URIs that may be typed into a browser. Web service  URIs may be specific to a given server. These URIs may be accessible to that portion of a corporate network that can access the server.","A set of URIs that may represent meaningful web service objects may be defined and manipulated. The HTTP methods that may be issued against a given URI may be defined. The operations each method may perform against the related web service object may also be defined.","REST HTTP operations may include an attached XML payload that may contain parameters that may be associated with the desired operation. Similarly, the replies that may be received and the error results may be delivered in reply documents. The reply document may be parsed to process detailed results from the request, and may be formatted in XML. Different command and reply documents may apply to each specific HTTP method, issued against each web service  URI.","At step , web service  may receive the request, and may authenticate the request. If the request is authenticated successfully, web service  may parse request body for the XML document. In another embodiment, web service  may parse the query string for the XML document. Web service  may use the schema document to retrieve information from the XML document. In another embodiment, the schema document may be used to de-serialize the XML document into a code object that web service  may understand.","Computer  may execute web service  and a web server in memory . The web server may be configured to listen to traffic on an open port, and may forward requests to web service . Web service  may comprise application code configured to receive requests and execute application commands based on those requests. Web service  may comprise one or a plurality of code objects, and may be instantiated and referenced by other code objects running on computer . Code objects may communicate with web service  through an API. The API may allow access to functions of web service .","Web service  may receive the request from request manager . The request may be an HTTP request, which may trigger execution of logic in web service . Web service  may parse the request for parameters that may include the user name, the password, and XML document , and may authenticate the request based on one or more of the parameters. Web service  may decrypt the password using a public shared key or any other encryption\/decryption algorithm. If the request is not authorized, web service  may return a response indicating that an error occurred.","Schema document  may define an XML schema and may be an extensible markup language schema document (XSD). Schema document  may be stored in data storage on computer , and may be stored in memory  by web service . In another embodiment, web service may create schema document  and may store it in memory . Web service  may store schema document . In another embodiment, different applications may store schema document , or schema document  may be stored during web service  installation. In another embodiment, web service  may de-serialize XML document  into a code object based on schema document .","Web service  may parse information from XML document  based on schema document . In certain embodiments, schema document  may be an XSD and XML document  may have XML formatting. In those embodiments, XML document  may correspond to schema document . If XML document  does not conform to schema document , web service  may return an error message to request manager .","The information contained in XML document  may include a command. The command may comprise information indicating application , and information indicating a command to run on application . Web service  may parse the command information from XML document  based on schema document , and may search memory  for a process that may correspond to the information indicating application . In another embodiment, the command may comprise a combination of one or more of application names, parameters, arguments and constraints. For example, the command may comprise the name of a notification application, the name of a send notification command, and the name of a group of recipients. Upon receiving the request, web service  may invoke the send notification command on the notification application with the name of the group of recipients. The notification application may then send a notification to each recipient in the group of recipients.","In still other embodiments, XML document  may include one or more of information indicating a recipient, a message, an inquiry for the recipient, and a response to be selected by the recipient. Web service  may search memory  for a notification application, and may execute a notification command. The notification command may comprise information from XML document  and may send a notification to a recipient that may correspond to the recipient in XML document . The notification may comprise a message that may correspond to the message to the recipient in XML document . The notification may further comprise an inquiry that may correspond to the inquiry in XML document . The notification may further comprise a response to be selected by the recipient that may correspond to the response to be selected by the recipient in XML document .","Web service  may execute any application running in memory  based on the parameters contained in XML document , and may return a return document indicating return information.","For example, web service  may comprise a URI that exposes functionality to request notifications, such as: https:\/\/localhost:8443\/apwebsvc\/notifications. This URI may represent the notifications that may have been processed by a notification manager. Sending a request with the GET HTTP method specifying the above URI may return a return document comprising a list of notifications in order from the oldest notification to the latest notification. HTTP query strings may be added to the URI to control the volume and order of returned URIs. Most query options may represent properties of the object that are returned in the reply document. For example, specifying a query string with \u201cAnswerableBy=\u201d may return a return document comprising a contact name that may be allowed to answer the notification. In another example, specifying a query string with \u201cIssuedBy=\u201d may return a return document comprising a name of a login that may have issued the notification. A sample URI using the GET HTTP method to return a return document comprising a list of 10 notifications occurring after the last result returned from the last web service call may resemble the following URI: https:\/\/192.168.1.5:8443\/apwebsvc\/notifications?AfterId=LastIdOfOurPreviousGet&Count=10. In this example, no XML document  may be sent.","In another example, the POST HTTP method may be specified in a request to send a notification. A XML document may contain characteristics of the notification, such as who may be notified and what the message may be. The XML document may correspond to a schema document. A user name and password may be sent in the HTTP headers of the request. The reply may contain response HTTP headers. A status HTTP header value of 202 may indicate that the request was successful. The reply may also contain a reply document that may contain the URI which may identify the created notification. The URI may also be returned in the HTTP location header.","The following is an example of XML document  from system  that may be sent in an HTTP POST
