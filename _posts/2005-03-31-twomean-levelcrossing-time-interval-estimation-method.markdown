title: Two-mean level-crossing time interval estimation method
abstract: N-sample level-crossing estimator methods and devices are provided that extract more information from given time samples than the current two-sample approach and that are more resistant to interference from noises. The two-mean level-crossing time-interval estimation method extracts more information from given time samples than existing methods, advantageously estimates a level-crossing time interval with a limited number of time samples and is quieter than current noisy estimation techniques. The two-mean level crossing time-interval estimation method for N-sample estimation uses all N time samples by calculating the mean value of the first N/2 time samples and subtracting it by the second N/2 time sample to average out the noises in time samples. The two-mean level crossing time-interval estimation method can be implemented by using a Finite Impulse Response filter to take level-crossing time samples as inputs, take the differential level-crossing time samples as inputs, or take the N/2-step differential level-crossing time-interval as an input. An addition only one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator device and a one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator device are also provided.

In particular, the present invention relates to a two-mean level-crossing time interval and signal frequency estimation technique.","Level-crossing time interval estimation techniques can be useful for signal frequency estimation, rotation angular velocity estimation and signal modulation classification. The time interval between two level-crossing points of a periodic function can be estimated by using a moving average of the level-crossing time samples. Current level-crossing time interval estimation techniques are based on a certain number of important mathematical expressions.","Assuming that the signal g(x) is periodic in a given time domain x\u2266x\u2266xand also assume that signal g(x) has N number of level-crossing time samples, or measurements, x(k), x(k\u22121), . . . , x(k\u2212N+1) between xand xsuch that g[x(k)]=g[x(k\u22121)]= . . . =g[x(k\u2212N+1)]=E, where E is a given level for measuring crossings. If E=0, the time samples x(k), x(k\u22121), . . . , X(k\u2212N+1) are considered to be zero-crossing points. The time interval between two level-crossing time samples, x(k) and x(k\u2212v), is then defined as v-step differential level-crossing time-interval, denoted by the expression:\n\n()=()\u2212(),\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere 1\u2266vV\u2266N\u22121 . . . is a positive integer. Since the function g(x) is noisy in practice, the level-crossing time interval will be estimated by taking the time average of:\n\n(1)=()\u2212(1)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nas shown below,\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"m","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"2"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["k","j"],"mo":"-"},"mo":",","mn":"1"}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"m","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["k","N"],"mo":["-","+"],"mn":"1"}}}],"mo":"-"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"There are a number of disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations with the current two-sample estimation technique. One problem with the current two-sample estimation technique is that it only uses two samples at a time, so that the information from numerous other given time samples is not accessed and used. Another problem with the current two-sample estimation technique is that noises in samples x(k\u2212N+1) and x(k) from various sources, such as electronic components, interference in transmission or even thermal noise, will directly affect the two-sample estimation result of m(k,N\u22121). Thus, there has been a long-felt need for other estimating techniques and devices that are quieter and extract more information from given time samples than the current two-sample approach.","The long-felt need for new time estimation techniques has now been answered with N-sample level-crossing estimator methods and devices that extract more information from given time samples than the current two-sample approach and that are more resistant to interference from noises. The two-mean level-crossing time-interval and signal frequency estimation method of the present invention extracts more information from given time samples than existing methods, can advantageously estimate a level-crossing time interval with a limited number of time samples and is more accurate than the inefficient and noisy prior art estimation techniques. The present invention also encompasses addition only one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator and one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator devices that are less noisy than inefficient prior art estimation techniques.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for two-mean level-crossing time-interval estimation.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for two-mean level-crossing time-interval and signal frequency estimation that extracts more information from a greater number of samples.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an addition only one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator device that extracts more information from a greater number of samples and is less noisy than prior art techniques.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator device that extracts more information from a greater number of samples and is less noisy than prior art techniques.","These and other objects and advantages are accomplished with this invention's two-mean level crossing time-interval and signal frequency estimation method for N-sample estimation. The new technique uses all N time samples by calculating the mean value of the first N\/2 time samples and subtracting it by the second N\/2 time sample to average out the noises in time samples. The two-mean level crossing time-interval estimation method can be implemented by using a Finite Impulse Response (\u201cFIR\u201d) filter to take level-crossing time samples as inputs, take the differential level-crossing time samples as inputs, or take counter outputs as an input. The present invention contemplates this N time sample estimation method, an addition only one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator device and a one-step differential level-crossing time-interval estimator device.","Referring now to the drawings,  is a conceptual flow diagram depicting a basic N-sample time estimator showing a signal g(x)  being sent to a level-crossing sampler  so that the level-crossing time, x(k), represented by arrow , is sampled and recorded whenever the value of the signal g(x)  equals a given level E, so that signal g(x)=E.
