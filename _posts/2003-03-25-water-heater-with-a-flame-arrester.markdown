{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Division of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/834,535, filed Apr. 13, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,561,138.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a water heater with a flame arrester set in a garage, a cellar, a warehouse and the like where inflammable materials such as gasoline, thinner, benzine and the like generating combustible vapor are stored.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, in this kind of a water heater with a flame arrester, for example, as shown in , a hot water storage chamber  and a combustion chamber  are provided upward and downward within a hollow cylindrical body , the combustion chamber  is provided with an exhaust passage  which penetrates the shaft center position and has an air supply inlet  and an opening on the upper portion of the body  for exhausting combustion gas within the combustion chamber , and further, a flame arrester (flame interruption apparatus)  is provided on the air supply inlet . A water heater with a flame arrester is made so that when exhaust gas at a high temperature burned with a gas burner provided within the combustion chamber  passes through the exhaust passage , water supplied within the hot water storage chamber  is heated by the exhaust gas and stored as hot water at the predetermined temperature and then supplied to the outside of the water heater as appropriate. The flame arrester  is made of metal in a plate shape which is provided with a large number of minute openings such as a punching metal or an expand metal. Each inflammable gas has a quenching distance which is the largest gap that flame can not go through without being extinguished, since the flame arrester  utilizes this principle, the opening is made in a minute shape and the size of it is made in the range on the order of \u03c61.5-3 mm.","However, since the opening of the flame arrester  is small as described above, it becomes easily clogged by combustion products such as dust, a drain generated by the combustion of the gas or the like. Therefore, if the flame arrester  had been clogged by dust or combustion products, an incomplete combustion state would be occurred due to the shortage of air supply within the combustion chamber , the state where carbon monoxide gas increases could be generated within the room around the water heater, and people within the room might have been suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning or the like.","Moreover, for the purpose of preventing sufferings from such carbon monoxide poisoning or the like, it is necessary to frequently do the work for cleaning the clogging of the flame arrester, and it has been very much troublesome.","Hence, an object of the invention is to solve the problem described above and to provide a water heater with a flame arrester capable of preventing trouble occurring with the shortage of the air supply due to the clogging of the flame arrester.","Moreover, another object of the invention is to provide a water heater with the shortage of the air supply due the clogging of the flame arrester as well as capable of saving the works of cleaning of the flame arrester for forcing the clogging itself of a flame arrester due to dust, the combustion products and the like not to be easily generated.","These and other objects are accomplished by a safety apparatus capable of maintaining safety in a room near by the foregoing body, when the air supply shortage or oxygen deficiency occurs within the foregoing combustion chamber due to the clogging of the foregoing flame arrester. It is preferable to employ the foregoing burner flame hanging detection means, and at least one of the foregoing fuel shut off means and an abnormality warning means.","Further, it is preferable to employ the foregoing clogging detection means, and at least one of the foregoing fuel shut off means and the abnormality warning means.","The object are further accomplished by providing a dust collection filter on the upstream side of the foregoing flame arrester.","The dust collection filter is approximately horizontally beneath the foregoing burner and the foregoing flame arrester is arranged approximately horizontally. The flame arrester and the dust collection filter are arranged vertically on the side wall of the combustion chamber. It is preferable to make the flame arrester and the dust collection filter at attachable and detachable from each other and to configure integrally the flame arrester and the dust collection filter. Further, it is preferable to configure dust collection filters as two filters opposing each other and arrange openings of the dust collection filters so that the openings are not projectively overlapped each other and to enable at least the dust collection filter on the upstream side to be attachable and detachable.","It is also preferable to provide heating means for maintaining the foregoing dust collection filter at a high temperature.","The objects are further accomplished by the flame arrester arranged beneath the foregoing burner horizontally, and further providing falling prevention means for preventing combustion products from falling from the upper side to the flame arrester.","A receiving member in the shape of an annulus is provided for receiving combustion products beneath the exhausting inlet as the falling prevention means.","A receiving member is provided in a circular shape without a hole for receiving combustion products beneath the exhausting inlet as the falling prevention means.","A receiving member is provided to cover most of the upper side of the flame arrester as the falling prevention means.","Next, as one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings,  is an elevational view in section showing a water heater with a flame arrester (hereinafter, referred to as only water heater) of the first embodiment of the first invention. This water heater  is provided with a body  which is made of iron, closed on the ends of top and bottom portions of the hollow cylindrical shape and whose interior surface is covered with enamel, an outer case  which covers the outer peripheral and upper surface of the body , and a controller  for controlling an operation of the water heater .","The body  of the water heater  is provided with cylindrical portion , bottom plate portion  which is a flat plate for closing the end of the lower portion, an upper end plate  which is slightly swelled upward in a spherical shape and closes the end of the upper portion, and the body  is provided in a state where it stands on the floor surface G with legs provided on the bottom plate portion . The body  is provided with a lower end plate  which is slightly swelled upward in a spherical shape and provided coaxially on the predetermined position nearer to the bottom plate portion , so that the body  is divided into the upper hot water storage chamber R and the lower combustion chamber R.","The upper end plate  and the lower end plate  are provided respectively with openings and , an exhaust pipe  extending in an axial direction at the shaft center position and forming an exhaust passage penetrating the openings and is fixed on the openings and . Furthermore, within the exhaust pipe , a baffle plate  in a twisted plate shape is fixed between an upper position slightly apart from its lower end and the upper end position. The baffle plate  provides a spiral passage along the axial direction inside of the cylindrical body. Moreover, a water supply pipe  and a hot water supply pipe  which are vertically suspended downward are provided from the upper end plate  within the hot water storage chamber R. Furthermore, on the upper end plate  within the hot water storage chamber R of the body , a water supply inlet of the water supply pipe  through which water is supplied to the hot water storage chamber R and a hot water supply outlet through which hot water within the hot water storage chamber R is supplied to the outside of the water heater  are provided, and a drain tap is provided at the position located slightly upper portion from the lower end plate  for discharging the hot water within the hot water storage chamber R to the outside of the water heater .","Inside of the combustion chamber R, a base plate  is provided slightly apart from the bottom plate portion , and a main burner  stands on the base plate . A gas supply pipe  penetrating the side wall of the body  is connected to the main burner . A pilot burner  is provided on the side of the main burner . Furthermore, a thermocouple  is provide on the side of the pilot burner  for detecting the changing state of the flame.","Then, an air supply inlet is provided at the lower position of the above-described base plate  of the bottom plate portion , and a flame arrester  is fixed on the bottom plate portion  in order to cover the air supply inlet . The flame arrester  is made of metal in a plate shape, which has a large number of minutes holes whose diameter is in the range of 1.5 mm-3 mm, for example, an expand metal, a punching metal, or a material in which these are laminated is employed. It should be noted that the flame arrester  may be equipped within an air supply pipe which is connected to the air supply inlet ","The peripheral portion and the upper portion of the body  are covered with the outer case  through the mediation of a heat-retaining material. As for the cylindrical portion of the outer case , its upper portion between the upper end and the approximately uppermost position of the lower end plate  is made of the foregoing heat-retaining material  of polyurethane resin, and its lower portion is made of a glass fiber heat insulating material  whose material is prepared by mixing a fiber glass into a resin. On the upper surface of the outer case , a ring-shaped top plate  is embedded on the portion of the polyurethane resin and further, a hood  covering the end portion of the above-described exhaust pipe  projecting from the top surface is mounted.","The controller  is provided at the peripheral lower end position of the heat insulating material  of the outer case . A thermostat  is provided on the side of the controller  and arranged to penetrate the heat-retaining material  and the cylindrical portion  and to project within the hot water storage chamber R. Moreover, an electromagnetic valve for opening and closing the passage to the above-described pilot burner  and the main burner  is built in the controller , and the thermocouple  is also connected to the controller . Furthermore, an alarm  is connected to the controller . A thermostat valve is also built in the controller  for closing the main gas passage to stop the gas supply to the main burner  when the detected temperature of the thermostat  becomes the predetermined value T or higher, and for opening the main gas passage to initiate the gas supply to the main burner  and to start the combustion when the detected temperature becomes the predetermined value T (<T) or lower, the thermostat valve is opened.","Moreover, when an output of the thermocouple  is lowered less than the predetermined value due to the shortage of the air supply the controller  also closes the gas passage to the gas supply pipe  and stops the gas supply to the main burner  in a similar manner and is capable of preventing an accident such as carbon monoxide poisoning due to the leakage of carbon monoxide to the outside of the body  because of an incomplete combustion of the main burner . Similarly, the controller  is capable of preventing the accident due to the incomplete combustion of the main burner  by sounding the alarm .","Next, operations of the above-described embodiment will be described below.","First, the pilot burner  is ignited while pressing down an ignition knob positioned on the upper portion of the controller . Electromotive force is generated in the thermocouple  which is heated by the pilot burner , and the built-in electromagnetic valve is maintained to be open and attracted (the knob is released from the hand at this moment) Moreover, the ignition knob is turned around to the left and when the main gas passage is opened, the main burner  is ignited. Thus initiating the operation of the water heater lets the thermocouple  detect the changes of the flame of the pilot burner . When the flame arrester  is not clogged and the air is sufficiently supplied to the inside of the combustion chamber R, as shown in , flame of the pilot burner  is represented by the solid line, and the detected result by the thermocouple  also exceeds the reference value T as shown in FIG. . At this moment, since the hot water temperature within the hot water storage chamber R is still low, the thermostat valve built in the controller  is still opened, and the combustion by the main burner  is initiated. The hot water within the hot water storage chamber R is heated and its temperature rises by the procedure that the high temperature exhaust gas generated by the combustion rises through the exhaust pipe  while the exhaust gas is heating the lower end plate  and the exhaust gas passes by the baffle plate . Then, when the thermostat  detects that the temperature of the hot water becomes T or higher, the above-described thermostat valve is closed and the flame of the main burner  is extinguished. When the temperature of the hot water drops or when the hot water is discharged through the hot water supply pipe  and the hot water storage chamber R is filled up with water supplied from the water supply pipe  and the temperature of the hot water becomes T or lower, the lowered temperature is detected by the thermostat , the main gas passage is opened by opening the thermostat valve, the combustion by the main burner  is initiated again, and the hot water within the hot water storage chamber R is heated.","During the time in which the above-described heating within the hot water storage chamber R by the main burner  is repeated, if the flame arrester  is clogged up with dust or the like, the air supply shortage or oxygen deficiency occurs within the combustion chamber R, therewith resulting in the extension of flame of the pilot burner  represented by the dashed line as shown in , and the detected result by the thermocouple  becomes the reference value T0 or lower as shown in FIG. . The controller  receiving this detected result of the thermocouple  closes the built-in electromagnetic valve, and shuts off the gas supply to the main burner . At the same time, the alarm  goes off, an accident due to an incomplete combustion of the main burner  can be prevented.","As a result, the combustion in the main burner  in a state of the air shortage is stopped, excessive generation of carbon monoxide by the incomplete combustion can be prevented, and poisoning by carbon monoxide within the room due to the leakage of carbon monoxide to the outside of the body  can be prevented. When obtaining this result, the normal combustion operation of the main burner  can be recovered by means of the procedure that the flame arrester  is removed from the body , the clogging is removed and the flame arrester  is reset in the body , and the hot water within the hot water storage chamber R can be heated.","Next, in the above-described embodiment, one modified example of the detection of flame temperature by the thermocouple will be described below with reference to FIG.  and FIG. . In the modified example, the flame temperature of the pilot burner  is detected by the two pieces of thermocouples, TC and TC. As shown in , the first thermocouple TC is disposed at the position h of the flame at the time of complete combustion, the second thermocouple TC is disposed at the position h of the flame at the time of incomplete combustion, and further, both of the thermocouples is connected in series by inversing the polarity of one thermocouple. Thus, the detected value of both thermocouples \u0394T is represented by the following expression according to FIG. . \n\n","Specifically, since the detected value is (T\u2212T) in the case where one piece of thermocouple is placed at the position h, by providing and arranging two pieces of thermocouples, the sensitivity of the detected value is enhanced by the value (T\u2212T), and the state of the temperature of the flame can be acknowledged more precisely.","Next, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIG.  and FIG. .","In the second embodiment of the first invention, it is made so that the clogging state of the flame arrester  can be detected by the shape of the pilot burner and the electromagnetic valve built in the controller  can be closed according to the state of clogging. Specifically, the pilot burner is used as detection means for detecting the clogging of the flame arrester . The pilot burner  is, as shown in , a hollow cylindrical body , whose end is a cone-shaped projecting portion  projecting in an axial direction. A port for heating thermocouple  is provided on the side wall nearby the projecting portion  of the cylindrical body , a port for carrying over  is provided on the projecting portion . Moreover, the cylindrical body  is provided with air supply holes  nearby the connection portion with the gas supply pipe , over which wire gauze  covers and surrounds air supply holes . The meshes of the wire gauze  is finer than those of the flame arrester . On the side of the port for heating thermocouple  of the pilot burner , a thermocouple  is provided and arranged.","In the second embodiment of the first invention, when the clogging of the flame arrester  does not exist, the air is sufficiently supplied to the combustion chamber R, and the pilot burner  completely burns due to air from the air supply hole , as shown in , flame H is formed at the port for heating thermocouple  and the port for carrying over , and the flame temperature is normally detected by the thermocouple . On the other hand, as the clogging of the flame arrester  proceeds, the wire gauze  which is clogged more easily than the flame arrester  is more significantly clogged. Therefore, when the air supply from the air supply hole  becomes insufficient and the air supply to the pilot burner  becomes short, as shown in , the flame H is formed at the port for carrying out  but the flame H is not formed normally at the port for heating thermocouple . As a result, the flame can not be detected by the thermocouple , the clogging of the flame arrester  can be detected. Upon receiving this detected result of the thermocouple , the controller  closes the built-in electromagnetic valve and shuts off the gas to the main burner . As a result, the gas combustion in a state of shortage of air supply is stopped, the generation of carbon monoxide due to the incomplete combustion can be prevented, and the occurrence of the poisoning due to carbon monoxide within the room by the leakage of carbon monoxide to the outside of the body  can be prevented.","It should be noted that as an example of the above-described second embodiment of the first invention, as shown in , the opening may be provided on the side wall of the pilot burner  shown in the first embodiment and covered with the wire gauze whose meshes is finer than the flame arrester  in the same way as the above-descried wire gauze . According to this modified example, the progress of the clogging of the flame arrester  can be previously detected with the wire gauze  which is clogged more easily than the flame arrester . Specifically, the thermocouple  can detect the change from the flame in the solid line to the flame in the dashed line due to the shortage of the air supply from the opening because of the clogging of the wire gauze ","Next, the third embodiment of the first invention will be described below with reference to FIG. .","In the third embodiment, as detection means for detecting a state of flame, the sensor burner  which is capable of securely detecting a state of flame is used with the pilot burner. The sensor burner  is mounted on a gas draft pipe  branched off from the gas supply pipe  described later, and comprises the mixture pipe  approximately L-letter shaped, a porous plate having ports, a cylindrical guard  surrounding the porous plate , and a thermocouple . The mixture pipe  is provided with a nozzle  connected to the gas draft pipe at the end, and the porous plate having ports provided inwardly in the axial direction and the cylindrical guard  surrounding the porous plate are provided at the other end of the mixture pipe . The thermocouple  is provided nearby the outside of the porous plate and arranged to penetrate the wall of the cylindrical guard . Moreover, the sensor burner  is connected to the gas supply pipe  supplying the gas to the main burner  and the pilot burner , and is provided with a gas shut off valve  for opening and closing the gas supply pipe .","The gas shut off valve , the first pipe portion  on the straight upstream side, and the second pipe portion  on the straight downstream side paralleling to the first pipe portion  form an approximately S-letter shaped pipe passage. The portion between the first pipe portion  and the second pipe portion  is divided in the axial direction of the gas shut off valve  by a valve seat  having an opening in the center. A penetrated portion is opposed to the valve seat  of the first pipe portion , an opening and closing valve  in a plate shape is pressed on the valve seat  by a coil spring which surrounds the penetrated portion , and closes the opening , thereby closing the pipe passage. Moreover, an axis on which the opening and closing valve  is mounted is securely fixed on a movable electromagnet  on the left side through the penetrated portion ","On the left side of the penetrated portion of the first pipe portion , a magnet  which is a cylindrical case is mounted. On an opposing face to the penetrated portion within the magnet , a U-letter shaped, fixed electromagnet  provided with an attracting plate on the head is fixed so that the head portion of the fixed electromagnet  faces the penetrated portion . Moreover, a non-magnetic plate is sandwiched between the attracting plate and an attracting plate ","The fixed electromagnet  is connected to the thermocouple  of the sensor burner , and generates the predetermined magnetic force when the normal ignition of the sensor burner  is detected. On the other hand, the movable electromagnet  is connected to the thermocouple  provided on the side of the pilot burner , and generates the predetermined magnetic force when the normal ignition of the pilot burner  is detected. Therefore, in the case where the combustion of at least one of the sensor burner  or the pilot burner  becomes incomplete due to the clogging of the flame arrester, the electromotive force of either the thermocouple  or  is lowered, the magnetic force of the electromagnets  and  is lowered, and the electromagnet  becomes apart from the electromagnet . Needless to say, it is also operated at the time of extinguishing the pilot burner .","An ignition button  which is pressed at the time of the initiation of the operation of the water heater is opposed to the valve seat  of the second pipe portion . The ignition button  is provided with a push rod which has penetrated the pipe wall of the second pipe portion , whereas, it is constantly pressed outside of the second pipe portion  in the outer direction by a coil spring . Therefore, the end of the push rod is usually positioned across the valve seat  from the opening and closing valve . It should be noted that a thermostat valve  is equipped on the above-described gas supply pipe  on the side of the main burner , thus opens and closes the main gas passage according to the detected temperature of the above-described thermostat .","In the above-mentioned third embodiment of the first invention, pressing down the ignition button  for the initiation of an operation of the water heater causes the push rod to press the opening and closing valve  which has closed the opening  pressed on the valve seat  by the coil spring . At this moment, the sensor burner  and the pilot burner  are normally ignited, and accompanying with that, the electromagnets  and  generate the predetermined magnetic force, therefore, the electromagnet  pushed by the push rod attracts on the electromagnet . Therefore, the opening and closing valve  opens the valve seat , the gas shut off valve  is open, the gas is supplied to the main burner , and its combustion is initiated. It should be noted that it will be available if the corresponding ones of the first embodiment are applied to the ignition button  and the thermostat valve  in the third embodiment.","On the other hand, when the combustion of one of the sensor burner  or the pilot burner  becomes incomplete due to the clogging of the flame arrester, the electromotive force of at least either the thermocouples  or  is lowered, the magnetic force of the electromagnet  or  is lowered, and the electromagnet  becomes apart from the electromagnet . As a result, the opening and closing valve  is pressed by the coil spring and closes the opening of the valve seat . Thus, the gas shut off valve  is closed, the gas supply to the main burner  is shut off, and its combustion is stopped.","As a result, also in the third embodiment, the combustion at the main burner  running short of the air supply is stopped, the excessive generation of carbon monoxide due to the incomplete combustion can be prevented, and the occurrence of the poisoning due to carbon monoxide in the room by the leakage of carbon monoxide to the outside of the body  can be prevented.","It should be noted that as the modified example of the third embodiment, as shown in , it will be available that only the sensor burner  is employed as detection means for detecting a state of flame without employing the pilot burner. Specifically, in the magnet  of the gas shut off valve , an attracting plate is mounted on the end of the axis provided at the center of the opening and closing valve  and projecting toward the magnet , and the U-letter shaped fixed electromagnet  whose head portion faces the penetrated portion is fixed on the opposed face to the penetrated portion within the magnet . Since the other configuration of the gas shut off valve  is similar to those shown in the above-described third embodiment, the description is omitted.","In the modified example, the attracting plate pushed by the push rod attracts the fixed electromagnet  by pressing the ignition button  at the time of the initiation of the operation of the water heater. Therefore, the opening and closing valve  opens the valve seat , the gas shut off valve  is open, the main burner  is supplied with the gas, and its combustion is initiated. On the other hand, the combustion of the sensor burner  becomes incomplete due to the clogging of the flame arrester, the electromotive force of the thermocouple  is lowered. Thus, the magnetic force of the fixed electromagnet  is lowered and the attracting plate is apart from the fixed electromagnet , the opening and closing valve  is pressed by the coil spring and closes the opening of the valve seat . Thus, the gas shut off valve  is closed, the gas supply to the main burner  is shut off, and its combustion is stopped. As a result, also in the modified example, the effect similar to that of the third embodiment is obtained.","It should be noted that in the above-described respective embodiment, although the thermocouple is employed in order to detect a state of combustion of the flame, instead of this, the flame current can be monitored by employing a flame rod. As for the flame rod, the flame current is lowered when the flame is in an incomplete combustion state, and the flame current is high when the flame is in a complete combustion state. The relationship of an amount of the air supply or oxygen density with CO density and the flame current is schematically shown in , however, for example, CO density can be prevented from rising more than 0.03% by shutting off the gas by means of closing the electromagnetic valve of the main gas passage sending 1 mA or less of the flame current. Thus, the combustion running short of the air is stopped, the excessive generation of carbon monoxide due to the incomplete combustion can be prevented, and the occurrence of the poisoning due to carbon monoxide in the room by the leakage of carbon monoxide to the outside of the body  and the like can be prevented.","It should be noted that in the above-described respective embodiments, although the alarm  goes off as well as the combustion at the main burner ,  is stopped by closing the electromagnetic valve for opening and closing the passage to the main burner when the clogging of the flame arrester  is occurred, instead of this, only one of the functions may be activated.","Then, an embodiment of the second invention in which the flame arrester cannot be sassily clogged by the dust or the like will be described below with reference to FIG. . It should be noted that since the same reference numerals as ones described in the afore-mentioned first invention denote the same configuration portions, the overlapped description will be omitted.","Now, the body  is provided with a base portion  which is a flat plate dividing the inside of the body  upward and downward at the position slightly upper from the bottom plate portion , and a communication chamber S in which the air outside communicates beneath the base portion . In the cylindrical portion , an air hole is partially provided beneath the base portion . Inside of the combustion chamber R, the base plate  is provided slightly apart from the base portion , the main burner  is provided standing upright.","Then, an air supply inlet is provided on the base portion  below the above-described base plate , the flame arrester  which covers this air supply inlet is fixed on the base portion .","Moreover, a cover member  which is a hollow approximately cylindrical cover surrounding the air supply inlet , and projecting from the lower surface of the base portion  is mounted on the lower surface of the base portion . An opening is provided on the horizontal flat plate portion of the cover member , and a circular dust collection filter  covering this opening is fixed on the cover member . The dust collection filter  is made of metal in a plate shape having a large number of minutes holes on the order of the diameter of 4 mm, for example, an expand metal, punching metal, or the ones in which these are laminated is employed. It should be noted that a mounted position of the dust collection filter  is not limited to this, the dust collection filter  is provided at the air supply pathway for supplying the air outside to the flame arrester .","On the other hand, as for the glass fiber heat insulating material , the lower side from the lower end plate  is removed in the predetermined range including the air hole of the circular cylindrical portion , and the portion between the portion of the glass fiber heat-retaining material  and the outer case  is a space portion S. In the outer case , the air hole  through which the air outside faces and flows into this space portion S is provided. Hence, the air outside flown into the space portion S further flows into the communication chamber S via the air hole , passes through the dust collection filter  and the flame arrester , and flows into the combustion chamber R.","Hence, in the present water heater, the purified air which is removed the large dust from the air outside by the dust collection filter  provided upstream of the flame arrester  can be sent to the flame arrester . Specifically, since the larger dust in the air outside is first removed by the dust collection filter , the clogging of the flame arrester  is relatively delayed. Moreover, since the accumulated dust can be fallen down by the weight of the dust itself by providing the dust collection filter  beneath the main burner  in a horizontal direction, the clogging of the dust collection filter  can be further delayed. Therefore, the clogging of the flame arrester  can be largely delayed compared to the case of the prior art, the possibility of the carbon monoxide poisoning due to the clogging of the flame arrester  can be lowered as well as the chore of the cleaning can be relatively reduced.","Next, an modified example of the dust collection filter will be described below with reference to FIG. .","In this modified example, a flame arrester and a dust collection filter are arranged vertically on the side wall of the combustion chamber. Specifically, as shown in , the main burner  is placed on the bottom plate portion  of the body , an opening  is provided nearby the bottom portion  of the cylindrical portion , the flame arrester  covering the opening  is mounted on the cylindrical portion , and further, an opening  is provided on the outer case  surrounding the cylindrical portion , and located slightly upper from the above-described opening , and the dust collection filter  covering the opening  is mounted on the outer case . Thus, it is made so that the air outside passes through in turn the dust collection filter  and the flame arrester  and flows into the combustion chamber R.","In the present modified example, by providing the flame arrester  and the dust collection filter  vertically on the side of the combustion chamber R, even if the combustion products such as drain generated within the combustion chamber R and the like fall, it is made so that they are not easily adhered to the flame arrester . Moreover, the purified air which is removed the large dust from the air outside by the dust collection filter  provided upstream of the flame arrester  is sent to the flame arrester . Therefore, as to the flame arrester , the clogging factors from the inside and outside of the combustion chamber R is diminished, the clogging of the flame arrester  is largely delayed. Therefore, the chore of cleaning the flame arrester  is largely reduced.","Next, another modified example will be described below with reference to FIG. .","In the present modified example, it is made so that the dust collection filters are consisted of two sheets and the respective openings of the dust collection filters are not overlapped in an opposed direction. Specifically, as shown in , the main burner  is placed on the bottom plate portion  of the body , the opening  is provided nearby the bottom plate portion  of the cylindrical portion , and the flame arrester  covering the opening  is mounted on the cylindrical portion . Furthermore, the opening  is provided on the outer case  surrounding the cylindrical portion , and located slightly upper from the above-described opening , the first filter covering the opening  is mounted on the outer case , and further outside of the first filter , the second filter which is another member is mounted on the outer case , thereby configuring the dust collection filter . The first filter and the second filter are opposed in parallel each other, and they are arranged so that small holes of the first filter and the small holes of the second filter are not projectively (in an opposed direction) overlapped each other. Thus, it is made so that the air outside passes through in turn the second filter and the first filter of the dust collection filter  and the flame arrester  and flows into the combustion chamber R.","In the present modified example, since first, a large amount of dust is removed with the second filter on the upstream side, the dust passed through the small hole hits the first filter on the downstream side and is removed, the large dust can be efficiently removed through two filters and . Moreover, since the second filter which is placed upstream and on which dust is easily clogged is attachable and detachable, the second filter can be removed and easily cleaned. Moreover, since the purified air which is removed the larger dust in the air outside can be sent to the flame arrester  through the dust collection filter  provided on the upstream side of the flame arrester , the clogging of the flame arrester  can be delayed. Moreover, similar to the afore-mentioned modified example, if the combustion products such as drain generated within the combustion chamber R and the like fall, the combustion products and the like are not easily adhered to the flame arrester  by providing the flame arrester  and the dust collection filter  vertically on the side of the combustion chamber R. Therefore, the chore of cleaning the flame arrester  is largely reduced.","It should be noted that the modified example in which two dust collection filters are arranged in parallel each other, and further two filters are arranged so that the respective small holes of the filters are not overlapped in an opposed direction can be also applied to the case where the filter is arranged in a horizontal direction as the dust collection filter as shown in FIG. .","It should be noted that in the embodiments shown in the above-described FIG.  through , heating means for heating the dust collection filter and maintaining at the high temperature on the order of 200\u00b0 C. or higher can be provided. Thus, the dust adhered to the dust collection filter is easily decomposed and removed by heating, an auto cleaning effect with which the dust is removed through the dust collection filters is obtained, and the dust collection filters can be made not to be easily clogged. As a result, the clogging of the flame arrester can be further delayed as well as the chore of cleaning the dust collection filters can be reduced, and the chore of cleaning the flame arrester can be largely reduced.","Moreover, in the embodiments shown in the above-described FIG.  through , the dust collection filter and the flame arrester are provided as separate bodies, respectively, however, the dust collection filter and the flame arrester are made so as to be attachable and detachable from each other as well as both are integrated in a unit. Thus, both can be attached and detached in a lump on the water heater, the installing work can be simplified. Moreover, each cleaning can easily performed.","Next, an embodiment of the third invention in which the clogging of the flame arrester due to the combustion products and the like cannot be easily occurred will be described below with reference to FIG. . It should be noted that since the same reference numerals as the ones described above denote the same portions of the configurations, the description to be overlapped will be omitted.","Inside of the combustion chamber R, a receiving member  which is falling prevention means in a flat annulus vessel shape is provided above the main burner  and located slightly lower from the lower end opening which is the exhaust inlet of the exhaust pipe . The combustion products such as drain and the like are generated by gas components and water in the exhaust reacting with the wall of the exhaust pipe  and the inside wall of the combustion chamber R, however, these combustion products tend to be especially generated mainly on the inside surface of the exhaust pipe , and the receiving member  receives and stores these combustion products.","Hence, while the heating within the hot water storage chamber R by the combustion of the main burner  is repeated, the combustion products such as drain and the like are generated by gas components and water in the exhaust reacting with the wall of the exhaust pipe  and the inside wall of the combustion chamber R, these combustion products are peeled off the wall surface and fall, these are efficiently received by the receiving member  provided beneath the exhaust pipe , the falling can be prevented, thereby being capable of preventing the clogging of the flame arrester  due to the combustion products. As a result, the chore of cleaning the clogging of the flame arrester  due to the combustion products can be deleted.","Next, a modified example of the receiving member will be described below.","As for the modified example 1, as a receiving member for preventing the falling as shown in , the receiving member  which is fall prevention means in a circular and flat vessel shape without a hole is provided above the main burner  and located slightly beneath the lower end opening of the exhaust inlet of the exhaust pipe  in the combustion chamber R. Thus, the combustion products which are peeled off the wall surface of the exhaust pipe  and fall are efficiently received by the receiving member , and the falling can be prevented. Therefore, the clogging of the flame arrester  provided on the bottom plate  due to the combustion products can be hindered and prevented and the chore of cleaning the flame arrester can be deleted. Moreover, as for the modified example 2, as shown in , the above-described receiving member  can be also arranged beneath the above-described receiving member .","Next, as for the modified example 3, an annulus receiving member  for preventing the falling, as shown in , whose curvature extends from the slightly inside of the lower end opening of the exhaust inlet of the exhaust pipe  to nearby the circumference of the lower end plate  along its curvature surface in a diameter direction is provided above the main burner  and located slightly lower from the opening in the combustion chamber R. Specifically, the flame arrester  provided on the bottom plate portion  is almost entirely covered with the receiving member . Thus, the combustion products which are peeled off the wall surface of the exhaust pipe  and fall are received by the receiving member , and the falling on the flame arrester  can be prevented. Therefore, the clogging of the flame arrester  due to the combustion products can be prevented and the chore of cleaning the combustion products can be deleted.","The occurrence of carbon monoxide poisoning in the room outside of the body can be prevented by the safety apparatus, and the safety within the room can be guaranteed.","Moreover, the safety within the room can be securely maintained by shutting off the fuel supply to the burner or by warning the abnormality according to the abnormal detection result of the flame of burner or the clogging abnormal detection result of the flame arrester.","Furthermore, the safety within the room can be securely maintained by shutting off the fuel supply to the burner or by warning the abnormality according to the clogging state detection result of the flame arrester.","Since the purified air removed larger dust from the air outside by the dust collection filter can be sent to the flame arrester, the clogging of the flame arrester can be largely delayed comparing to the prior art and the chore of cleaning the flame arrester can be reduced and the trouble occurred with the shortage of the air supply due to the clogging of the flame arrester can be prevented as well.","Moreover, The clogging of the dust collect on filter can be delayed by providing the dust collection filter beneath the burner in a horizontal direction and making the accumulated dust fall by its weight, and the chore of cleaning them can be reduced.","Moreover, the clogging factors from the inside and outside of the combustion chamber to the flame arrester by arranging the flame arrester and dust collection filter vertically on the side wall of the combustion chamber can be diminished, as a result, the chore of cleaning the flame arrester can be largely reduced.","Moreover, [according to the invention of claim ,] the dust collection filter and the flame arrester can be easily handled by integrally configuring the flame arrester and the dust collection filter and making both attachable and detachable from each other.","Moreover, the flame arrester cannot be easily clogged and the chore of cleaning the flame arrester can be largely reduced by substantially providing two dust collection filters in order to remove larger dust further securely. Furthermore, the dust clogged can be efficiently cleaned by at least the dust collection filter on the upstream side tending to accumulate the dust easily being detachable.","Moreover, the dust collection filter cannot be easily clogged and the chore of cleaning the filter can be reduced by maintaining the dust collection filter at a high temperature using the heating means for automatically removing larger dust clogged in the dust collection filter.","Moreover, the clogging of the flame arrester due to the combustion products can be prevented, the chore of cleaning the flame arrester can be deleted and the trouble occurred with the air supply shortage due to the clogging of the flame arrester.","Moreover, the falling of the combustion products from the exhaust inlet where the combustion products mainly generates can be efficiently received and the clogging of the flame arrester can be efficiently prevented by providing a receiving member in an annulus shape or in a circular shape without a hall beneath the exhaust inlet.","Moreover, the fall of the combustion products to the flame arrester can be prevented and the chore of cleaning the flame arrester can be deleted by providing a receiving member which covers most of the upper portion of the flame arrester.","It will also be appreciated that, although a limited number embodiments of the inventions have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the inventions. Accordingly, the inventions should not be limited except as by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0104"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0002","num":"0105"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0003","num":"0106"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0004","num":"0107"},"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0005","num":"0108"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0006","num":"0109"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0007","num":"0110"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0008","num":"0111"},"b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0009","num":"0112"},"b":"27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0010","num":"0113"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0011","num":"0114"},"b":"41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0012","num":"0115"},"b":"44"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0013","num":"0116"},"b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0014","num":"0117"},"b":"56"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0015","num":"0118"},"b":"60"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0016","num":"0119"},"b":"61"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0017","num":"0120"},"b":"64"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0018","num":"0121"},"b":"67"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0019","num":"0122"},"b":"70"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0020","num":"0123"},"b":"92"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0021","num":"0124"},"b":"102"},"R . . .
