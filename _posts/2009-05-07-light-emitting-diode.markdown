Growth of conventional semiconductor materials can be performed via a variety of different growth processes and is dependent upon the type of material being grown. These growth processes can include, but is not limited to: metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, pulsed laser ablation, ammono thermal method, etc. In doped semiconductors, p-type and n-type, the Fermi level is shifted by the dopants, illustrated by their band gaps. The Fermi function f(E) gives the probability that a given available electron energy state will be occupied at a given temperature. The Fermi function is defined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"E"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"e","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["E","\u03c6"]}}},"mo":"\/","mi":"kT"}},"mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}}},"br":{},"sub":"F ","sup":"\u22125 "},"The Fermi function dictates that at ordinary temperatures, most of the levels up to the Fermi level Eare filled, and relatively few electrons have energies above the Fermi level.","High efficiency III-nitride LEDs and lasers is difficult to achieve due to many well-known problems. Existing state of the art III-nitride light emitters have the wurtzite crystal structure, grown in the <0001> direction, are Ga-polar where the p-GaN layer is grown on top of the n-GaN layer, which shows a Ga-polar p-up device. As used herein, p-up describes the general growth sequence where a template layer  is grown on top of a substrate  then a p-layer  is grown on top of a n-layer ; and p-down describes the general growth sequence where the a template layer  is grown on top of a substrate and a n-layer  is grown on top of a p-layer  as shown in , respectively. One problem is the large internal electric field associated with the spontaneous\/piezoelectric polarization charges. This strong internal electric field separates the injected electrons from the holes, resulting in a lower radiative recombination rate. Another problem with nitride LEDs or lasers is the small conduction band offset in the InGaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), resulting in vertical electron leakage into the p-side GaN (AlGaN) waveguide layer. While these phenomena occur in both p-up and p-down Ga-polar structures, the positive polarization charge near the p-cladding layer in a conventional p-up Ga-polar device combined with a small conduction band offset in the InGaN\/GaN system further leads to electron overshoot, and thus a decrease in the efficiency of visible and near-ultraviolet light emitting devices as shown in . To reduce the electron overshoot, an electron-blocking layer (EBL), with a larger band gap must be used as shown in , which shows a template , grown on a substrate  where the growth sequence continues as follows: a n-GaN layer , a n-InGaN\/GaN MQW , a p-AlGan EBL  and a p-GaN layer .","The larger band gap electron-blocking layer, however, increases the polarization field in the quantum well LED structure, creating a potential spike in the valence band that blocks the injection of holes while only partly ameliorating the electron leakage, as the strong electric field in the QW barriers effectively lowers the electron barrier. To circumvent these polarization effects in LEDs and lasers, devices grown on non-polar or semi-polar substrates have been realized and polarization-balanced quaternary InAlGaN devices on c-plane substrates have been proposed. This problem has existed since the beginning of the development of III-nitride LEDs, and the spontaneous\/piezoelectric polarization charges are always considered as a detrimental effect.","As shown in the band diagram of , positive spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization charge result in a reduced effective conduction band barrier resulting in large electron overshoot (allowance of carrier leakage to the p-layer) and necessitating the introduction of the commonly employed electron blocking layer (such as AlGaN electron blocking layer (EBL) structure. The incorporation of the larger band gap EBL increases the polarization field in the QW and effectively inhibits the injection of holes. To circumvent the polarization effects in LEDs and lasers, devices have been grown on non-polar m-plane and a-plane substrates and on semi-polar substrates. In conventional devices, spontaneous\/piezoelectric polarization charges create a strong electric field that separates the injected electrons from the holes, resulting in a lower radiative recombination rate. Another crucial issue with conventional nitride LEDs or lasers is the small conduction band offset in the InGaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), resulting in vertical electron leakage into the p-side GaN (AlGaN) waveguide layer.  is a graphical illustration of the band gaps in conventional p-up Ga-polar III-Nitride light emitting devices. Furthermore, the positive polarization charges at the interface of the electron blocking layer and the active region, which block the injection of holes into the active region, resulting in lack of holes there. This problem has existed since the beginning of the development of III-nitride LEDs, and the spontaneous\/piezoelectric polarization charges are generally considered as a detrimental effect.","In general, the polarization effect on InGaN\/GaN and GaN\/AlGaN quantum well light emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers is considered detrimental for conventional applications. The electric field inside the quantum well generated by polarization sheet charges of opposite sign on either side of the quantum well reduces the emission efficiency in several ways. First, the strong electric field leads to a spatial separation of electrons and holes, which lowers the probability of radiative recombination and thus lowers the emission efficiency. Second, the strong localization due to the large field reduces the effective barrier height for electrons and holes, which promotes the carriers' escape from the quantum well. The above two considerations are applicable to both p-up and p-down Ga-polar devices. However, in a conventional p-up Ga-polar device, the positive polarization charge near the p-cladding layer combined with a small conduction band offset in the InGaN\/GaN system further leads to electron overshoot, and thus decreases the injection efficiency. To reduce the electron overshoot, an electron-blocking layer with a larger band gap must be used. The large band gap electron blocking layer, however, increases the polarization field in the quantum well and creates a potential spike in the valence band, blocking the injection of holes.","Shown in , and as reported by M-H. Kim, et al., Appl. Phys. Letter, 91, 183507 (2007), the polarization effect on InGaN\/GaN QW LED is detrimental for conventional p-up and p-down devices, as the strong electric field in the quantum well (QW) lowers the probability of radiative recombination and promotes the carriers' escape from the QW. The strong electric field in the QW lowers the probability of radiative recombination and promotes the carriers' escape from the QW. For p-up device the strong electric field in the barrier effectively lowers EBL and leads to a large electron overshoot. The large Eof the electron blocking layer (EBL) increases polarization in the quantum well (QW), creating a potential spike in valence band; thereby reducing hole injection efficiency.","Several methods have been used to improve the performance of III-nitride LEDs. One approach utilizes multiple quantum wells to confine the electrons and holes inside the well, thus increasing its radiative recombination rate. Most of the commercially available III-nitride LEDs are based on a quantum well structure, since this approach has shown success. However, this approach introduces other obstacles that inhibit device efficiency. Due to the large electric field in the quantum well, the benefit of confining the electrons and holes close together can only be achieved with very thin quantum well. The positive polarization charge near the p-cladding layer combined with a small conduction band offset in the InGaN\/GaN system further leads to electron overshoot, and thus decreases the injection efficiency. To reduce the electron overshoot, an electron-blocking layer with a larger band gap must be used, which is typically AlGaN. The large band gap electron blocking layer, however, increases the polarization field in the quantum well and creates a potential spike in the valence band, blocking the injection of holes. Utilization of AlGaN increases the turn on voltage resulting in lower conversion efficiency for these devices. In addition, use of high Al composition in AlGaN is not desirable from growth and fabrication consideration.","In a publication by Piprek, et. al., entitled 420 , SPIE Proc. 3944, 2000, the authors, using self-consistent laser simulation, analyzed the performance of nitride laser diodes grown on sapphire. The carrier distribution among quantum wells was found to be strongly non-uniform leading to a parasitic (absorbing) quantum well. The influence of defect recombination, vertical carrier leakage and lateral current spreading was investigated. The reduction of such carrier losses was deemed important to achieve lower threshold currents and less self-heating. According to Piprek, et. al, elimination of the parasitic quantum well was shown to substantially enhance the device performance.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,515,313 to Ibbetson, et al., hereby incorporated by reference, proposed several methods to reduce polarization induced charges in a MQW LED structure, including reducing difference in the material compositions of adjacent crystal layers, grading one or more layers to generate space charges and quasi-fields that oppose polarization-induced charges, incorporating various impurities into the semiconductor that ionize into a charge state opposite to the polarization induced charges, inverting the sequence of charged atomic layers, inverting the growth sequence of n- and p-type layers in the device, employing a multilayer emission system instead of a uniform active region and\/or changing the in-plane lattice constant of the material. These methods are limited to quantum well structures and only address the issues of the confinement of electron and holes. It does not address the vertical electron leakage and the injection of holes issues.","An object of the present invention is to reduce the adverse effect of polarization-induced charge and make it beneficial to the performance of a light emitting device. Moreover, LED prior art devices commonly comprise a second heterojunction. With present invention; a second heterojunction is not necessary.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a new single heterojunction III-nitride design for LEDs and other light emitting crystal structures, with either p-down Ga-polar or p-up N-polar. A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a heterojunction structure without quantum wells. The spontaneous\/piezoelectric polarization charge at the interface of the heterojunction is negative resulting in an increase in the electron barrier, substantially eliminates the hole barrier. A 2D hole-gas forms near the interface, which significantly enhances the recombination of electrons with holes. The present invention exhibits a higher current to light conversion efficiency than conventional devices. In addition, no electron blocking layer is required resulting in a lower turn on voltage, higher conversion efficiency, and longer device lifetime due to lower thermal load. The band gap is wider in the p-type layer so that the recombination occurs in the n-type layer. In one preferred embodiment, the negative polarization charge is obtained by utilization of p-type layer having a spontaneous polarization charge less than the n-type layer spontaneous polarization charge. In addition, lattice mismatching creates a piezoelectric polarization charge. The present invention is not limited to any particular material composition and a variety of polar semiconductor materials may be selected.","The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description.

The electric field inside the quantum well generated by polarization sheet charges of opposite sign on either side of the quantum well reduces the emission efficiency in several ways. First, the strong electric field leads to a spatial separation of electrons and holes, which lowers the probability of radiative recombination and thus lowers the emission efficiency. Second, the strong localization due to the large field reduces the effective barrier height for electrons and holes, which promotes the carriers' escape from the quantum well. The above two considerations are applicable to both p-up and p-down Ga-polar devices. However, in a conventional p-up Ga-polar device, the positive polarization charge near the p-cladding layer combined with a small conduction band offset in the InGaN\/GaN system further leads to electron overshoot, and thus decreases the injection efficiency. To reduce the electron overshoot, an electron-blocking layer with a larger band gap must be used. The large band gap electron blocking layer, however, increases the polarization field in the quantum well and creates a potential spike in the valence band, blocking the injection of holes. To circumvent the polarization effects in LEDs, devices are grown on non-polar enplane and a-plane substrates and on semi-polar substrates.","The p-side down Ga polar InGaN\/GaN interface of the present invention was compared with a conventional p-up Ga polar device at forward bias of 2.7 volts. The spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization charge at the InGaN\/GaN interface was estimated to be in the mid 10\/cmrange and negative for p-down Ga polar, positive for a p-up Ga polar, positive for p-down N polar, and negative for p-up N polar. For the conventional p-up Ga polar structure as shown in , the effective electron barrier was only about 98 meV, which leads to a significant leakage of electrons from the active n-InGaN to the p-GaN layer at room temperature, resulting in lower efficiency. Also, the injection of holes from the p-GaN to the n-InGaN results in a potential barrier as high as 807 meV, leading to a very inefficient injection of holes to the n-InGaN layer.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the p-down Ga polar device as shown in , has an effective electron blocking barrier as high as 533 meV; for a potential improvement of up to 800%. Also, the hole-barrier substantially disappears with a 2D hole-gas near the interface, which greatly enhances the recombination of injected electrons with holes in the active layer, and also increases efficiency.","Photoluminescence measurements indicate that the large Auger recombination coefficient in InGaN, combined with the high carrier densities in InGaN\/GaN quantum well LEDs, is the reason why the maximum quantum efficiency in these devices is observed at very low current density. Since the carrier densities in single and double heterojunction LEDs are lower, these devices should have higher external quantum efficiencies at the higher current densities required for applications such as general illumination, projection displays, and automotive headlights, making them attractive alternatives to quantum well LEDs. The effect of polarization charge inside a p-n heterojunction has different characteristics from those in a quantum well LED.

Accounting for spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations, the total charge at the InGaN\/GaN interface is estimated to be 10e\/cmand negative (positive) for p-down (p-up), Ga-polar structures. Since this negative polarization charge is greater than the maximum positive space charge that the n-InGaN layer can support, in the case of the p-down, Ga-polar device, the negative polarization charge at the interface leads to the formation of a well-confined 2DHG just within the InGaN near the n-InGaN\/p-GaN interface, a substantially reduced barrier for hole injection from the p-GaN to the n-InGaN, and a significantly enhanced conduction band heterobarrier that acts as an effective blocking layer for electron transport to the p-GaN (). In contrast, the positive polarization charge at the hetero-interface in the conventional p-up geometry causes a dramatic reduction in the conduction band barrier to electron transport into the p-GaN, as well as a steep (up to several hundred meV) barrier to hole transport into the n-InGaN ()). It could also lead to the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas within the InGaN near the hetero-interface.","The impact of these contrasting band diagrams on electron and hole current densities and radiative recombination rates in these device structures is shown in . For the p-down device, the formation of the 2DHG and reduction in the barrier to hole injection in the n-InGaN, in combination with the effective electron confinement in the same layer due to the higher conduction band hetero-barrier, significantly enhance the radiative recombination of electrons with holes in the n-InGaN active region, as shown in  by the dotted line. The simultaneous rapid blue shift and superlinear increase in electroluminescence observed in  (A) below 25 A\/cmare consistent with radiative tunneling, as described for GaAs p-n junctions. Under forward bias, some of the injected electrons undergo spatially indirect recombination with the 2DHG. With increasing forward bias, the electron quasi-Fermi level increases, leading to more high energy electrons recombining with the 2DHG and a concomitant blue shift of the electroluminescence. This effect, in combination with the improved overlap of electron and hole wave-functions, results in a superlinear increase in light output. The inset of  (A) shows good agreement between modeling and device behavior at low current densities. The more linear increase in intensity accompanied by a slower, smaller blue shift in peak wavelength at higher current density is attributed to a transition to direct recombination, as predicted by our modeling, and residual band filling effects possibly associated with compositional inhomogeneity in the high In content n-InGaN. The low current density behavior, characteristic of the p-down SH device, is distinctly different from band filling in conventional DH LEDs, for which the EL peak is nearly stationary at low injection levels, but exhibits a larger blue shift for high injection. The blue shift is also different from the blue shift in quantum well structures due to the quantum confined Stark effect, in which the majority of the contribution to the blue shift is from the Stark shift of the hole band.","In the case of the conventional p-up Ga-polar structure, the substantially smaller effective electron barrier at the n-InGaN\/p-GaN interface leads to a significant leakage of electrons from the active n-InGaN to the p-GaN layer, resulting in recombination within the p-GaN layer, as shown in  (A), and characteristic blue emission from fabricated devices (not shown). In addition, the high potential barrier to hole injection into the n-InGaN leads to very inefficient injection of holes into the n-InGaN layer. The first practical devices showed that these issues are partially remedied through insertion of a wider bandgap AlGaN electron blocking layer at the hetero-interface that aids electron confinement in the active region in conventional InGaN\/GaN MQW and DH LEDs.","The EQE of the p-down SH n-InGaN\/p-GaN LED under 1% DC current injection peaks above 100 A\/cm, well beyond the current density (\u02dc10 to 25 A\/cm) at which conventional p-up, Ga-polar InGaN\/GaN MQW LEDs already exhibit significant efficiency droop. It has been suggested that the peak efficiency at low current density in conventional InGaN\/GaN MQW LEDs is strongly dependent upon electron leakage from the active region and device defect density, while the drop in efficiency at high current density has been attributed to Auger recombination resulting from the high QW carrier density, although electron leakage may still play a role. While the efficiency at low current density in our p-down SH LED is limited by its tunneling behavior, the efficiency at high current density should strongly depend on the effective width for radiative recombination within the triangular potential that confines the 2DHG. Since the electron wave function is not confined, for comparison purposes this effective width can be defined as that of an equivalent InGaN\/GaN quantum well with a similar hole wave function as that in our LED under forward bias. This width is \u02dc12 nm, suggesting that our EQE should peak at higher current densities because of the reduced carrier density in this active region. A 430 nm DH LED with similar active region width (13 nm) has been reported to have peak external quantum efficiency at current density beyond 200 A\/cm. The lack of significant efficiency droop in our p-down SH LED at 1% DC current densities as high as 500 A\/cmwithout need of the AlGaN electron blocking layer or the second heterojunction to ensure hole confinement required in conventional p-up Ga-polar DH LEDs shows promise for simplified LED structures with lower manufacturing costs.","In accordance with the present invention, the peak intensity line rises approximately linearly at significantly higher current densities. Thus, in addition to low wall plug efficiency, the prior art devices usually exhibit further external quantum efficiency droop at high injection currents (20 A\/cm.), which are attributed to large electron overshoot at high injection currents resulting from the positive polarization charge near the p-cladding layer in conventional p-up Ga-polar devices. To reduce electron overshoot, an electron-blocking layer with a larger band gap must be used. The large band gap electron blocking layer, however, increases the polarization field in the quantum well, thereby only partly ameliorating the electron leakage, while creating a potential spike in the valence band that blocks the injection of holes. Recent research shows that the efficiency droop may relate to the strong Auger recombination in the QW and suggests that single or double heterojunction LEDs may be beneficial in achieving higher efficiency at high injection currents. In accordance with the present invention, both modeling and experimental results on single heterojunction light emitting devices demonstrate that the negative polarization charge is beneficial by properly engineering the device layers. The benefit of such device is the suppression of electron overshoot in combination with enhanced hole injection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0124"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 21"],"sup":["2 ","2","2","2"]},"Similar behavior is observed for the 17% InN device as seen in  (C) and (D). The peak emission wavelength shifts from 495 nm to 470 nm with a simultaneous superlinear increase in light output as the current density increases from 8-20 A\/cm. At higher injection currents a linear increase in intensity is observed with no further blue shift in peak wavelength. These behaviors are in general agreement with our modeling as discussed above.","The optical behavior of the 22% InN device shown in  departs slightly from the lower indium content films described above. Although the same emission intensity trend is observed with increasing forward bias, i.e. a superlinear increase in intensity followed by a linear intensity increase, the wavelength blue shift of the 22% InN film continues beyond the indirect to direct transition. At higher injection current densities the linear increase in power is accompanied by a slower, smaller blue shift to 476 nm by \u02dc85 A\/cm, with no further blue shift in peak wavelength above this current density. This continued blue shift is not observed in the lower indium content films and is an indication of band filling within the 22% InN film.","SH n-InGaN\/p-GaN p-side down LED devices containing less than 20% InN exhibit a superlinear increase in emission intensity accompanied by rapid blue shift in peak wavelength as injection current is increased due to a transition from indirect radiative tunneling to direct radiative recombination. Further increases in current yield a linear increase in emission intensity with no shift in peak wavelength. However, devices with greater than 20% InN continue to exhibit a more gradual blue shift well beyond the indirect to direct transition. This behavior is an indication of band filling which may be associated with compositional inhomogeneities within the InGaN film.","The single heterojunction n-InGaN\/p-GaN was grown on an n-GaN template by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) on a sapphire substrate. HVPE was preferred because it has higher growth rates (up to 100 \u03bcm) than MOCVD and MBE. Buffer layers were not required for growth of high quality, low defect density GaN. In the preferred embodiment of , p-GaN template is grown by HVPE with \u02dc1\u00d710\/cmcarrier concentration (doping concentration). As an example, the preferred embodiment of  which consists of a substrate , a template , a p-GaN layer , a n-InGaN layer , with a p-contact layer  and a n-contact layer , may be produced using standard photolithography ICP\/RIE to define MESA depth of 0.5 \u03bcm with E-beam evaporation of p-contact Ni\/Au; 200 \u212b\/1000 \u212b; RTA at 650\u00b0 C. for 2 min in N; RF sputtering of n-contact; ITO 1500 \u212b. Device area consists of 100 \u03bcm, 200 \u03bcm and 300 \u03bcm square devices.","Reflectivity and transmission measurements were performed using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 UV\/VIS\/IR spectrometer system on both the SH and the ITO. Based on these measurements the band-edge for the InGaN is \u02dc421 nm (2.94 eV).  is a graphical illustration of transmission and reflectance data of n-InGaN\/p-GaN single heterojunction (p-GaN down) of . The transmission and reflectance measurements taken using Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 UV\/VIS\/IR spectrometer system. The band gap measured to be \u02dc2.72 eV (455 nm) which corresponds to indium composition of \u02dc17%.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, peak intensity line rises approximately linearly after a current density of approximately 24 amperes per centimeter squared. This is shown in  as the linear part of the line containing squares. The corresponding line for conventional devices, not shown, would reveal an \u201cefficient droop\u201d at around 20-30, i.e., the intensity would go down after around 20-30 amperes per centimeter squared for conventional device. For the a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the peak intensity it does not go down at least up to 40, which represents a dramatic improvement in performance results. Thus, in addition to low wall plug efficiency, the prior art devices usually exhibit further external quantum efficiency droop at high injection currents (20 A\/cm), which are attributed to large electron overshoot at high injection currents resulting from the positive polarization charge near the p-cladding layer in conventional p-up Ga-polar devices. To reduce electron overshoot, an electron-blocking layer with a larger band gap must be used. The large band gap electron-blocking layer, however, increases the polarization field in the quantum well, thereby only partly ameliorating the electron leakage, while creating a potential spike in the valence band that blocks the injection of holes. Recent research shows that the efficiency droop may relate to the strong Auger recombination in the QW and suggests that single or double heterojunction LEDs may be beneficial in achieving higher efficiency at high injection currents. In accordance with the present invention, both modeling and experimental results on single heterojunction LEDs demonstrate that the negative polarization charge is beneficial by properly engineering the device layers. The benefit of such device is the suppression of electron overshoot in combination with enhanced hole injection. Experimental results, as shown in , show no efficiency droop with the present invention at continuous injection current densities up to 40 Amperes per centimeter squared. Using the principles of the present invention result in improved performance of LEDs, which have many DOD and civilian applications including ultraviolet light devices.","The terminology \u201cpolarization vector\u201d as used herein means the polarization has both a magnitude and direction. In classical electromagnetism, the polarization density (or electric polarization, or simply polarization) is the vector field that expresses the density of permanent or induced electric dipole moments in a dielectric material. The polarization vector P is defined as the dipole moment per unit volume. The SI unit of measure is coulombs per square meter.
