The computer programs include processor-executable instructions that are stored on a non-transitory tangible computer readable medium. The computer programs may also include stored data. Non-limiting examples of the non-transitory tangible computer readable medium are nonvolatile memory, magnetic storage, and optical storage.","The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for ensuring that a person (e.g., a driver or a passenger) of a vehicle reaches a destination for a scheduled meeting at a scheduled time. The systems and methods are implemented using the Internet. The systems and methods can automatically gather a meeting location and a meeting time for a meeting scheduled by a user. Based on the meeting location and the meeting time, the systems and methods can automatically gather maps and traffic and weather information, plan the travel to the meeting location, and alter the travel plan as needed based on changes in traffic and weather conditions. For example, when the person schedules the meeting (e.g., using a calendar program), the systems and methods perform the following functions automatically (i.e., without intervention or interaction from the person) based on the scheduled meeting location and meeting time.","The systems and methods determine a route and a departure time by automatically retrieving the meeting location, the meeting time, and predicted traffic and weather conditions likely to occur along the route during the travel. The predicted traffic and weather conditions can be generated based on historical traffic and weather information available in respective databases. The departure time and the route are automatically output to one or more devices of the user (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, or a personal computer (PC)). Further, prior to the departure time, the systems and methods continue to monitor the traffic and weather conditions along the route and update the departure time and\/or the route based on changes in the traffic and weather conditions.","When the person begins the travel at the departure time, the systems and methods continue to monitor the traffic and weather conditions along the route and update the route based on changes in the traffic and weather conditions. The systems and methods may interface with an output system (e.g., an in-dash display and\/or audio system) of the vehicle and inform the person of the changes and the updated route via the output system. During the travel, the systems and methods may also interface with a control system of the vehicle (e.g., a traffic monitoring system, a navigation system, etc.) and use the control system to monitor the traffic and weather conditions along the route. Further, the systems and methods may interface with a control system of the vehicle (e.g., a control system that monitors wiper blades, tires, etc.), infer weather and road conditions based on data received from the control system, and update the route based on the data.","Additionally, before the travel begins, the systems and methods may learn travel patterns of the person. For example, depending on the time of the day of travel, the person may stop to drop off another person, and\/or at a restaurant, a bank, and\/or a gas station, etc. Depending on the travel patterns, the systems and methods may automatically plan ahead for one or more stops and adjust (pre-pone) the departure time accordingly so that the person arrives at the meeting location at the scheduled meeting time.","Further, the systems and methods may gather information about parking places near the meeting location, select one of the parking places based on the needs of the person, and adjust the departure time and the route based on a distance between the meeting place and the selected parking place. During the travel, the systems and methods may continue to gather information about the parking places, update the route depending on the time constraints of the person and the availability of the parking places, and guide the person to the best available parking place.","Referring now to , the systems and methods of the present disclosure may be implemented using the Internet. For example, a system  may include a communication system  for ensuring that a person reaches a meeting location at a meeting time according to the present disclosure. The system  may further include the Internet , a mail\/calendar server , a device , and a vehicle . The device  and the vehicle  can communicate with the Internet  using one or more networks. For example, the networks may include a cellular network, a satellite network, a local area network (LAN), and\/or a wide area network (WAN).","The device  executes a scheduling program, which the person uses to schedule a meeting at a meeting time and a meeting location. The scheduling program (e.g., a calendar program) may run on the mail\/calendar server . The device  may connect to the mail\/calendar server  via the Internet . While only one device, one mail\/calendar server, and one vehicle are shown, the system  may include multiple devices, mail\/calendar servers, and vehicles. Further, the communication system  may be distributed at multiple geographic locations.","The communication system  communicates with the device , the mail\/calendar server , and the vehicle  via the Internet . Communications between the communication system  and each of the device , the mail\/calendar server , and the vehicle  can be secured based on subscription of the person to the communication system . The communication system  may maintain and\/or access multiple databases via the Internet . The databases may include information relating to maps, traffic, weather, etc.","In use, the person uses the device  to schedule a meeting using a calendar program from home, office, etc. The meeting information (e.g., location, time, etc.) is stored on the mail\/calendar server . The communication system  retrieves the meeting information from the mail\/calendar server  via the Internet . The communication system  sets up a route and a departure time for the person from home, office, etc. based on the meeting information. The communication system  gathers and monitors traffic and weather information on an ongoing basis. The communication system  updates the route and\/or the departure time based on traffic and weather conditions along the route. The communication system  sends the route, the departure time, and any updates to the device . The communication system  may also set up one or more stops along the route based on the travel patterns of the person and inform the person of the stops.","When the person begins the travel along the route, the communication system  communicates with the vehicle  in addition to, or instead of, the device . If multiple persons use the vehicle , the communication system  may identify the person based on the identification information of the person stored in the device  and\/or a key fob belonging to the person. The device  may communicate with the vehicle  via Bluetooth\u00ae, for example. Alternatively or additionally, the person may use the key fob to operate the vehicle . The communication system  may retrieve the identification information of the person from the device  and\/or the vehicle . Based on the identification information, the communication system  may monitor and update the route of the identified person. The communication system  may output updated information to the person via an output system (e.g., an in-dash display and\/or speaker system) of the vehicle . The communication system  may also adjust the route and the stops of the identified person depending on the traffic and weather conditions along the route and whether the person can reach the meeting location at the scheduled meeting time.","Referring now to , the communication system  is shown in detail. The Internet  and the mail\/calendar server  are omitted for simplicity of illustration. The vehicle  may include one or more vehicle control systems  and\/or one or more output systems . The vehicle control systems  may include a traffic monitoring system, a weather monitoring system, a navigation system, a vehicle monitoring system, etc. For example, the vehicle control systems  may include an OnStar\u00ae system. The output systems  may include an in-dash display system, a speaker system, etc.","The communication system  includes a device interface module , a calendar interface module , a route determining module , a monitoring module , an updating module , a vehicle interface module , a learning module , a planning module , and a parking module . The device interface module  interfaces the communication system  to the device  via the Internet . The vehicle interface module  interfaces the communication system  to one or more vehicle control systems  and\/or one or more output systems  of the vehicle  via the Internet .","The calendar interface module  interfaces with the scheduling program via the device interface module . Alternatively, the calendar interface module  may interface with the scheduling program via the Internet . The calendar interface module  retrieves from the scheduling program the meeting time and the meeting location scheduled by the user.","The route determining module  determines a route from a first location to the meeting location and a departure time for the user to depart from the first location to reach the meeting location at the meeting time. For example, the first location may include an office location, a home location, or any other location from where the user may depart for the meeting location.","The route determining module  determines the route and the departure time based on predicted traffic conditions and predicted weather conditions surrounding the first location and the meeting location. The route determining module  outputs the route and the departure time to the user on the device . The route determining module  receives the predicted traffic conditions and predicted weather conditions from the monitoring module . The monitoring module  monitors the past and current traffic and weather patterns and determines the predicted traffic and weather conditions based thereon.","Specifically, prior to the departure time, the monitoring module  monitors the traffic and weather conditions surrounding the first location and the meeting location. The updating module  may update the route and\/or the departure time based on the monitored traffic and weather conditions. The route determining module  outputs the updated route and\/or departure time to the user on the device .","The monitoring module  may monitor the traffic and weather conditions using various sources. For example, the monitoring module  may access traffic and weather databases on the Internet . The monitoring module  may access the databases directly via the Internet  or via the device , which may have a connection to the Internet .","Additionally, prior to the departure time, the route determining module  may determine\/update the route and\/or the departure time based on inputs received from the planning module  and\/or the parking module . The planning module  may plan one or more stops for the user between the first location and the meeting location. For example, the planning module  may plan one or more stops based on travel patterns of the user learned by the learning module .","The learning module  may learn the travel patterns from travel data gathered during prior travels. For example, the learning module  may gather the travel data from one or more vehicle control systems  (e.g., the OnStar\u00ae system). Alternatively or additionally, the learning module  may gather the travel data from one or more databases maintained on the Internet . The databases may include the travel data gathered from prior routes traveled by the vehicle , communications made by the person using the device , transactions made by the person during prior trips (e.g., credit\/debit card purchases), etc. The learning module  may access the databases directly via the Internet  or via the device , which may have a connection to the Internet .","The planning module  may plan one or more stops along the route using the travel patterns. The planning module  may plan the stops based on the meeting location, the meeting time, the route, and the departure time. The route determining module  may adjust the route and the departure time based on the stops.","The parking module  may receive parking information of parking locations near the meeting location based on the meeting location and the meeting time and may select one of the parking locations before the travel begins. The parking module  may select the parking location based on factors such as distance from the parking location to the meeting location, parking expenses, special needs of the person, etc. The route determining module  may determine\/adjust the route and the departure time based on the selected parking location.","During the travel, the monitoring module  monitors traffic and weather while the user travels along the route. The monitoring module  may monitor traffic and weather by accessing relevant databases on the Internet . The monitoring module may access the databases directly via the Internet , via the device , or via one or more of the vehicle control systems , which may have connections to the Internet . Additionally, the monitoring module  may infer weather and\/or road conditions from data received from a vehicle control system that monitors wiper blades, tires, etc., for example.","The updating module  may update the route based on the monitored traffic and weather and other conditions. The route determining module  may output the updated route to the person via one or more of the output systems  of the vehicle . For example, the route determining module  may output the updated route on an in-dash display and\/or via a speaker system of the vehicle .","In addition, the parking module  may continue to receive information about parking places around the meeting location and may select a different parking location depending on where along the route the user is and whether a different parking location can help the user reach the meeting location at the scheduled meeting time. For example, the parking location selected before departure may be far from the meeting location, and delays due to weather, traffic, road construction, etc. may occur during the travel. If a parking location is available close to the meeting place, the parking module  provides the information to the route determining module . The route determining module  may adjust the route according to the newly selected parking location and output the updated route to the user on the output system of the vehicle. Thus, the person can reach the meeting location at the scheduled meeting time with minimal distractions.","Referring now to , a job map (method)  for ensuring that a person reaches a destination at a scheduled meeting time is shown. Unlike a process map that shows operations performed by a job executor (e.g., a driver or a passenger of a vehicle), the job map  shows functions performed by the systems and methods of the present disclosure. These functions help the job executor perform the operations. The context in which persons execute the job may include but are not limited to home, office, school, or while walking. The job map  outlines a solution that uses information to help a person execute the job of getting to a meeting location at a scheduled meeting time.","Control begins at  and retrieves appointment details (meeting time and location) from the calendar program of the user. Control estimates departure time under normal traffic and weather conditions at . Control determines time to allow for vehicle preparation at . For example, vehicle preparation may include loading\/unloading the vehicle. Control determines time to allow for atypical travel conditions at . For example, atypical travel conditions may include construction, road closures, detours, immigration delays, etc. At , control determines time to allow for errands, if any, to be run along the route. At , control sets the route based on determinations made at -. At , control plans one or more stops along the route. Control sets the departure time at .","At , control determines whether to make the trip. Control aborts the job at  if the trip is canceled. Control proceeds to  if the trip is not canceled. At , the person proceeds to the vehicle. The person prepares the vehicle at . The person begins driving the vehicle to the meeting location at . The person makes planned stops at .","At , control assesses if the person can reach the meeting location at the scheduled meeting time. Control may cancel one or more stops if the assessment indicates that the person may be late due to one or more of the planned stops. At , control adjusts the route as needed to ensure that the person arrives at the meeting location at the scheduled meeting time. Control may also inform the person of the canceled stop or stops and the updated route and guide the person to the selected parking location. At , the person parks the vehicle at the selected parking location. At , the person proceeds to the meeting location at the scheduled meeting time.","Referring now to , an example of an implementation  of the communication system  and the method  is shown. The implementation  utilizes a decision-making module (shown as engines)  that processes information from different sources (e.g., information module ) and that helps ensure that a person reaches a meeting location at a scheduled meeting time with minimal effort. The decision-making module  works with existing devices of a customer (shown as user interfaces , e.g., PC, laptop, phone, or tablet) and calendar services (e.g. Outlook, iCal, Google Calendar). The decision-making module  can access the devices via a protected gateway , which connects to the user interfaces  via one or more networks (shown as connectivity) .","The decision-making module  can also be integrated with control systems and in-dash displays of vehicles (shown as vehicle) . The decision-making module  can retrieve information about a vehicle from the control systems of the vehicle and can inform the person of the decisions via the in-dash display of the vehicle. For example, the decision-making module  can communicate with the vehicle  via a protected gateway , which connects to the vehicle  via one or more networks (shown as connectivity) .","The decision-making module  can access the information in the information module  through the protected gateway  and connectivity . Alternatively or additionally, the decision-making module  can access the information in the information module  through the protected gateway , connectivity , user interfaces , and a feedback module . The feedback module  allows the decision-making module , the user interfaces , and the information module  to exchange data. Additionally, the feedback module  allows the decision-making module  to learn preferences of the person (e.g., infer destination based on day of the week, time of the day, driver ID, presence\/absence of a passenger, etc.). The decision-making module  can also include application programming interfaces (APIs) . The APIs  allow the decision-making module  to pull data from multiple sources having information related to traffic and weather, events and parking, maps and road construction, calendars, etc.","More specifically, the information module  includes information databases  such as calendar programs of users, traffic and weather databases, routes and events databases, parking databases, etc. The information module  also includes location elements , time elements , vehicle elements , and real-time elements . The location elements  identify where the user is located at any given time. The time elements  characterize time of the day (e.g., rush hour). The vehicle elements  provide information about configurations and capabilities of vehicles (e.g., year, make, and model; whether equipped with control systems such as navigation systems; etc.) The real-time elements  provide real-time information (e.g., current traffic and weather conditions, updated route based on current traffic and weather conditions, etc.).","The decision-making module  performs core decision-making functions using various decision-making engines. For example, the decision-making module  may include a decision engine  to decide the route and the departure time based on the information received from the information module . A past\/predictive engine  analyzes past (historical) data related to traffic and weather patterns, travel patterns of the person, etc. The past\/predictive engine  provides related predictive data to the decision engine  and an optimization engine . The optimization engine  optimizes the decisions related to the route and the departure time based on the predictive data.","The decision-making module  may include additional engines such as a weather engine, a traffic engine, a navigation engine, a parking engine, etc. One or more of these engines may be included in, or may be part of, other engine or engines in the decision-making module . One or more of these engines may exchange information with other engines in the decision-making module .","The decision-making module  makes decisions based on the information received from the information module  and in turn also update the information in the information module  with the decisions made. For example, the decision-making module  may update the information in the information module  via the feedback module . The decision-making module  can perform the core decision-making functions in the Internet cloud, which allows ongoing and automatic updates to the decisions and the information in the information module  with minimal effort or activity required from the customer. Accordingly, the decision-making module  minimizes driver distraction.","The decision-making module  works with most popular devices and does not require additional end-user hardware. The decision-making module  can detect resources available to the user (e.g., device or devices used by the user, data plans used by the user, etc.) and scale service depending on available resources. Minimally essential capability is made available on a user-owned device.","Functions or services performed by the decision-making module  can be scaled up as more resources become available. Further, the services can be scaled on a subscription basis. The services are scalable to multiple users. The services can be provided in different geographic areas. The services can utilize existing data plans of the customer for transferring data to the phone device of the user (e.g., providing alerts including updated departure time by SMS). The services interface with other devices of the user either directly or as a tether\/conduit to the vehicle instead of relying on a phone embedded in the vehicle to minimize variable costs of data transfer. The decision-making module  can also cache data in case of lapses in cellular coverage. If connectivity is lost, the decision-making module  will provide service with at least the information as of when the connectivity was lost.","Further, the decision-making module  can be a node in a probe network and be able to transmit rich data in addition to location and speed of a vehicle. The decision-making module  also leverages information from the vehicle systems such as wipers on\/off, degree of congestion of opposing traffic using a front camera, wheel spin events, etc. The decision-making module  minimizes privacy barriers to adoption and use of the services. Individual identification information is not retained at any central server sites longer than necessary. Individual historical data are retained only on user-controlled devices.","In summary, when a user enters a meeting time and location in the calendar, the communication system  automatically synchronizes with a user's calendar, identifies the meeting time and location, calculates the route, determines travel time and departure time based on historical and current traffic and weather patterns, and creates a scheduled travel time and departure time and route on the user's calendar. If the weather and\/or traffic conditions change, the communication system  automatically adjusts the travel time on the user's calendar and notifies the user of a new route and\/or departure time. This feature minimizes the time it takes to determine how much time is needed to deal with adverse weather conditions, e.g., snow, ice, rain, etc. This feature also allows the communication system  to track the person's schedule and time allocated to reach the destination at the scheduled meeting time. This feature provides at least the following benefits before the person starts the drive to the destination: minimizing the likelihood of failing to consider traffic build up that routinely occurs at different times of the day when setting the route, and minimizing the likelihood of failing to be informed of a change in the departure time, e.g., due to a recent accident, a change in conditions, etc.","The communication system  includes a vehicle synchronization feature. This allows the job executor to automatically connect to an in-dash display of the vehicle so that navigation and information updates can be provided by the communication system  in a safer and larger interface relative to a handheld device. Vehicle synchronization provides at least the following benefits to the person while driving the vehicle: minimizing the likelihood of encountering an unplanned delay, e.g., a road closure, accident, construction, etc.; minimizing the time it takes to determine if an alternate route should be taken to save time due to unexpected travel conditions; minimizing the time it takes to determine how much travel time will be saved using possible alternate routes; minimizing the time it takes to determine which alternative route to select, e.g., to get to the destination on time, to make needed stops, etc.; minimizing the likelihood of missing a turn, e.g., missing an exit, a required turn, etc.; minimizing the likelihood of getting lost, e.g., not knowing where to go, not knowing current location, etc.; minimizing the likelihood of parking in a location where the vehicle can get damaged, e.g., dinged, dented, etc.; and minimizing the likelihood of parking in a location where the vehicle may get burglarized, e.g., broken into, stolen, etc.","The weather engine of the communication system  continuously monitors weather conditions along the route before and during the drive. The communication system  makes decisions about the departure time and the navigation based on inputs from weather sources and data about traffic and congestion along the route. This feature provides at least the following benefits to the person before and during the drive: minimizing the time it takes to determine how much time is needed to deal with adverse weather conditions, e.g., snow, ice, rain, etc.; minimizing the time it takes to determine how changes in travel conditions along the selected route will impact the arrival time, e.g., traffic, construction, etc.; and minimizing the likelihood of failing to be informed of a change in the updated departure time, e.g., due to a recent accident, a change in conditions, etc.","The traffic engine of the communication system  continuously monitors traffic conditions along the route before and during the drive. The communication system  makes decisions about the departure time and the navigation based on inputs from traffic, accident, construction, and event sources (e.g., concerts, expositions, sports events, etc.). This feature provides at least the following benefits to the person before and during the drive: minimizing the likelihood of encountering an unplanned delay, e.g., a road closure, accident, construction, etc.; minimizing the time it takes to determine how much time is needed to deal with adverse traffic conditions, e.g., accidents, road closures, construction, etc.; minimizing the time it takes to determine if an alternate route should be taken to save time due to unexpected travel conditions; minimizing the likelihood of traffic build up that routinely occurs at different times of the day being not considered when setting the route; minimizing the time it takes to determine how much travel time will be saved using possible alternate routes; minimizing the time it takes to determine how changes in travel conditions along the selected route will impact the arrival time, e.g., traffic, construction, etc.; minimizing the time it takes to determine which alternative route to select, e.g., to get there on time, to make needed stops, etc.; minimizing the likelihood of failing to be informed of a change in the required departure time, e.g., due to a recent accident, a change in conditions, etc.","The navigation engine of the communication system  makes decisions for the person about which route the person should follow to the destination. This feature provides at least the following benefits to the person before and during the drive: minimizing the time it takes to determine if an alternate route should be taken to save time due to unexpected travel conditions; minimizing the likelihood of traffic build up that routinely occurs at different times of the day being not considered when setting the route; minimizing the time it takes to determine how much travel time will be saved using possible alternate routes; minimizing the time it takes to determine how changes in travel conditions along the selected route will impact the arrival time, e.g., traffic, construction, etc.; minimizing the likelihood of missing a turn, e.g., missing an exit, a required turn, etc.; minimizing the likelihood of getting lost, e.g., not knowing where to go, not knowing current location, etc.; and minimizing the time it takes to determine which alternative route to select, e.g., to get there on time, to make needed stops, etc.","The parking engine of the communication system  makes decisions for the person about parking. This feature provides at least the following benefits to the person at the end of the drive: minimizing the likelihood of parking in a location where the vehicle may get damaged, and minimizing the likelihood of parking in a location where the vehicle may get burglarized.","While the present disclosure uses a vehicle (e.g., an automobile) as an example, the teachings of the disclosure are applicable to other modes of transportation. For example, the teachings can be used in the context of public transportation. The user may travel using public transportation instead or in addition to using a vehicle. When the user uses public transportation, the user's device receives additional information such as a bus or train route and a departure time of a bus or train on a selected route. The selected bus\/train route, the corresponding departure time of a bus\/train, and the user's departure time from home\/office may be altered if needed.","During the travel in the bus or train, the user's device may receive an updated route from the bus or train station to the destination depending on changes in road conditions between the bus or train station and the meeting location. For example, the user may be prompted to disembark at a different bus\/train station. In addition, the teachings can be used when the mode of transportation is simply walking and\/or biking. Further, the user may be a driver or a passenger in a vehicle (e.g., in a taxi).","The broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a variety of forms.
