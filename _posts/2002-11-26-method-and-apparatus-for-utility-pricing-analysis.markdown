title: Method and apparatus for utility pricing analysis
abstract: In one implementation, a volatility of expected service usage is calculated along with an expected revenue. User input provides estimates of service usage such as an estimated high usage, an estimated low usage, and a swing range of percentiles for the high and low usage estimates, for each time period in a plurality of future time periods. A user also provides a schedule of prices that are based on usage rates. A model volatility is calculated based on the swing range of percentiles, the estimated high and low usage, and a cumulative density function, such as a cumulative lognormal density function, for each time period in a plurality of time periods. The expected usage and the schedule of prices, along with any discount plans, are also used to calculate an estimated revenue.

No. 60\/333,377, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR UTILITY PRICING ANALYSIS\u201d, filed Nov. 26, 2001, having L. Dagum and V. Vaidya as inventors, and having as assignee Rapt, Inc., the assignee of the present invention. This provisional is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to pricing, and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for analyzing utility pricing.","2. Description of the Related Art","As the cost of information technology (IT) infrastructure increases, customers increasingly risk over- and under-investing in technology capital. System vendors and service providers are now making available utility-based pricing services, in which customers need only pay for the computing services used. Flexible methods for modeling these types of contracts, including their expected returns and variance, are needed. In particular, a method and apparatus for the economic analysis of utility pricing would prove very helpful in performing such analysis. More specifically, what is needed is an analytic method for predicting the revenue, along with risk and uncertainty, from utility based pricing of an entity's infrastructure (e.g., corporate information technology infrastructure.)","In one embodiment, an architecture for the analysis of utility pricing is disclosed.","The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary if illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. As will also be apparent to one of skill in the art, the operations disclosed herein may be implemented in a number of ways, and such changes and modifications may be made without departing from this invention and its broader aspects. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","The following is intended to provide a detailed description of an example of the invention and should not be taken to be limiting of the invention itself. Rather, any number of variations may fall within the scope of the invention which is defined in the claims following the description.","Introduction","For the purposes of the present invention, a usage-based pricing methodology, also referred to herein as a pricing algorithm, refers to a schedule of prices that depends on a user's utilization of a device as measured by one or more metrics. A device refers to any hardware resource or software application. For a given device, and for each applicable metric, the capacity of that metric refers to the maximum metric output of the device. The device may be resident with the user in which case any excess metric capacity is not utilized by the user and remains idle. Alternatively, the device may reside with the device provider, in which case idle device capacity may be consumed by other users.","The present invention provides techniques that 1) compute the expected net present value (NPV) of a pricing algorithm and the variance around that value; 2) computes the upside and downside risks of a pricing algorithm; 3) provides updates of the values in (1) and (2) as new customer usage data becomes available; 4) given a target NPV, determines the pricing algorithm that minimizes the variance; 5) given a target variance on the NPV, determines the pricing algorithm that maximizes the expected NPV; 6) computes the expected NPV and variance of a portfolio of devices that may be in different stages of their usage lifecyle and that may differ in pricing algorithms used; and 7) given a target aggregate NPV for the portfolio, dynamically adjusts the pricing algorithms to minimize the portfolio variance.","An Example of Utility Analytics","This section describes a mathematical model and its implementation as an analytic engine according to the present invention. This section focuses primarily on the one dimensional problem, in which price is a function of a single variable, and the consumed service has no further dependent components. For example, consider usage based pricing of central processing units (CPUs) in a multiprocessor computer system. The price is a function only of the number of CPUs used, and consumption of a CPU places no additional provisioning burden on the service provider (i.e., there is no other dependent component).","The basic problem that the utility analytic engine attempts to solve is \u201cWhat is my revenue for this price schedule and assuming this adoption profile?\u201d. There is uncertainty in the adoption profile and that is reflected in the resulting revenue. The applicable price is path dependent.","The basic methodology models the usage as a stochastic process and generates usage paths representative of the specified adoption profile and its distribution. For each usage path, a price schedule can then applied and one arrive at a \u201crevenue\u201d path. Given a statistically significant number of such revenue paths, the expected revenue can be computed, as well as percentile bands around that expected revenue.","Stochastic Model","Two different stochastic models can be applied to this problem, either an additive model or a multiplicative model. The main distinction is in the resulting distributions around the means for any forward step in the process. An additive model results in a normal distribution, whereas a multiplicative model results in a lognormal distribution. In the finance world, the lognormal distribution is usually preferred because such a distribution more accurately reflects price movements, although this alternative is not mandatory. Such a distribution also has the property that the random variable is always positive. This is more \u201cphysically\u201d representative of prices. Utility has a similar constraints (i.e., negative usage values are not possible). Consequently, the multiplicative model is implemented first, although an additive model in the analytic engine can also be employed.","The multiplicative model in continuous time is defined by:\n\n()=\u03c5()()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere U(t) is the usage at time t, \u03c5(t) and \u03c3(t)\u22670 and represent the time-dependent drift and volatility terms in the model, and z is a standard Wiener process defined as:\n\n()\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5(t) is a standardized normal random variable. With the model written in this fashion, an Euler discretization can be used to arrive at the simulation equation in multiplicative form:\n\n()\u2212()=\u03c5()()\u03b5()\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nor\n\n\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere the subscript k is used to refer to values evaluated at time t. Given\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c5","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"sub":["k ","k"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["dU","t","t","U","t","dt+\u03c3","t","U","t","dz "]},"Monte Carlo and Quasi Monte Carlo Simulation","Consider a utility contract with n billing intervals, k=[0,n]. A usage path can be defined as an instantiation of the usage over the length of the contract. Equation 4 can be used to instantiate the usage for a utility contract, in other words, Equation 4 can be used to generate possible usage paths. If the set [\u03b5, . . . , \u03b5] denotes an instantiation of \u03b5(t), . . . , \u03b5(t), and this set is applied to Equation 4, a corresponding usage path [U, . . . , U] can be generated. For the case where there is a hard maximum limit on usage (e.g. the usage is measured on CPU's and there exists a fixed number of CPU's in the system), the usage path is limited to stay within the maximum possible U. As long as the lognormal formulation of Equation 4 is used, there is no need to do anything special for the opposite boundary at zero usage.","Equation 4 can be solved by generating a representative sample of usage paths, and from these, deriving the moments of interest (primarily the mean and certain percentile bands). This, of course, is the well known Monte Carlo method of simulation.","The standardized normal random variable \u03b5(t) is sampled in one of three ways:\n\n","The first two are low-discrepancy quasi-random sequences which are popular for their superior convergence. It is use of these sequences that gives rise to a so-called Quasi MonteCarlo method. Using a purely pseudo-random sequence makes the approach a standard Monte Carlo approach. It will be noted that for the standard Monte Carlo scheme, the error is expected to be proportional to 1\/\u221a{square root over (N)}, where N is the sample size (i.e. number of usage paths generated). It is reasonable to expect the Quasi Monte Carlo scheme to perform at least as well. It will be noted that, for these relatively simple one-dimensional problems, performance is typically not a critical factor.","Model Estimation","For this example, no actual usage data are assumed. Consequently, the model inputs are entirely users estimates on the expected adoption of the sold configuration. For every billing period k of the utility contract, the user inputs an expected mean adoption, as well as a low and high value for some percentile swing around the mean. From these four inputs, the most closely approximating lognormal distribution id found and the appropriate \u03c5(t) and \u03c3(t) to use in our model is derived.","Some basic properties of the lognormal distribution function are now presented as way of background.

Such an implementation can be programmed using, for example, the JAVA\u2122 programming language. The various components of analytic component  are now described.","Adapter layer  can be situated in the package utility.analytics.adapter (as is depicted in  by API.utlitity.analytics ), for example. Adapter layer  is responsible for converting data structures between that which is used in the rest of the system (i.e., user interface system  or document manager ) and that which is used by domain layer . It also provides a flat file interface for driving the analytics without a user interface (primarily for testing purposes.) The main class in this package is the UtilityEngineAdapter class. Typically, the only entry point to the analytics from document manager  is through a method referred to herein as a do_analysis( ) method. The do_analysis( ) method gathers the inputs defined in terms of the public API objects from API.utility.analytics.values (as is depicted in  by API.utlitity.analytics ), and sets the corresponding variables in the domain layer classes. The do_analysis( ) method then calls the main class in domain layer  (the UtilityEngine class) to run the requested analysis. The analysis is synchronous, so the adapter waits for the UtilityEngine to complete and then communicates the results back to document manager  through the API objects. The document manager\/analytic engine interface is described more fully in the subsequent section entitled \u201cAn Example Design for Utility Pricing Analysis.\u201d","The flat file interface can be, for example, in a FlatFileReader class. Accepted inputs are in the associated \u201cjavadoc\u201d. The section below entitled \u201cUser Guide\u201d describes examples of these inputs and their syntax.","Domain layer  is situated in the package utility.analytics.engine. It is responsible for solving the business problem at hand, in this case computing the expected revenue from a utility contract. The main class is the UtilityEngine class. The control flow entry point from the adapter layer is through the computeRevenue( ) method, however prior to this the adapter will have set input values in the helper classes: AdoptionProfile, Discount, PriceSchedule and Revenue. The adapter pulls results out from the Revenue class.","Utilities layer  is situated in several packages under analytics.quasi and analytics.numerical. Utilities layer  is purely mathematical and agnostic to the application. The Quasi-Monte Carlo implementation is in the quasi package. The numerical package contains classes for computing error functions, lognormal distributions, Cholesky factorization and numerical integration of arbitrary one dimensional functions. The ananlysis performed in utilities layer  is reflected in the analysis described earlier herein, as well as in subsequent sections which generalize this analysis.","User Guide","The analytic engine is situated in the package utility.analytics.engine.

section describes the generalization of the mathematical model described in \u201cUtility Analytics\u201d to the case where pricing is multidimensional and consumption is hierarchichal. For example, consider usage based pricing of messaging with multiple service levels. The price is a function of the number of messages and the service level. Furthermore, the \u201cconsumption\u201d of messages can place additional provisioning burdens on the service provider in terms of CPUs, storage, network bandwidth, possible software licensing costs (if the messaging software is licensed based on number of CPUs) and other such overhead. This provisioning problem can be solved through demand statistical arbitrage.","As noted, for the purposes of the present invention, a usage-based pricing methodology, also referred to herein as a pricing algorithm, refers to a schedule of prices that depends on a user's utilization of a device as measured by one or more metrics. A device refers to any hardware resource or software application. For a given device, and for each applicable metric, the capacity of that metric refers to the maximum metric output of the device. The device may be resident with the user in which acse any excess metric capacity is not utilized by the user and remains idle. Alternatively, the device may reside with the device provider, in which case idle device capacity may be consumed by other users.","The present invention provides techniques that 1) compute the expected net present value (NPV) of a pricing algorithm and the variance around that value; 2) computes the upside and downside risks of a pricing algorithm; 3) provides updates of the values in (1) and (2) as new customer usage data becomes available; 4) given a target NPV, determines the pricing algorithm that minimizes the variance; 5) given a target variance on the NPV, determines the pricing algorithm that maximizes the expected NPV; 6) computes the expected NPV and variance of a portfolio of devices that may be in different stages of their usage lifecycle and that may differ in pricing algorithms used; and 7) given a target aggregate NPV for the portfolio, dynamically adjusts the pricing algorithms to minimize the portfolio variance.","IT Services Model","Let X={1, . . . , n} denote the set of services, and iX index this set. Note that a single customer may deploy multiple services. Furthermore, note that usage of these services may be correlated positively or negatively. Let xi denote the usage of service i at time t. (For this report, we assume a predefined choice of service units.) Let Sdenote the covariance matrix for the n services at time t. When the covariance matrix is not time dependent, the subscript t is dropped. For the n set of services, let y, . . . , ydenote the quantity of the m set of hardware, software, network, and other components necessary for delivering that service at time t. Lastly, for service i and component j, let a, ij denote the connect rate, that is the jth component requirement for delivering one unit of service i. Note that these connect rates may be time dependent to model component transitions in providing the service. Adenotes the m\u00d7n connect rate matrix and note that\n\n<0 \u2003\u2003(2.1)\n\nis required to ensure that the hardware provisioning at time t supports service demands xat time t.\n","An example can now be created. Customer X requires a messaging application, application web hosting, and a general purpose server. The first two services are delivered as a software products that require a server, storage device and network components. The last service is a hardware product. The connect rates for the hardware requirements will depend on the hardware products, the IT architecture and other variables. Each hardware product can itself have a bill-of-material that specifies its configuration. For example, the server used for the web hosting may be configured with 500 MHz CPUs and an upgrade to 750 MHz CPUs offered in 6 months. The CPU upgrade will naturally change the connect rates between the web application service and its server support.","Stochastic Model for Services\u2014Independent Demand","Having introduced the basic IT service model introduce a model for the demand of services over some prede\u00a3ned period of time. begin with a general Markov model de\u00a3ned for the n\u00d71 vector of services x,\n\n=\u03bc()(), \u2003\u2003(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03bc(x, t\\\u03b8) denotes the drift term of the vector stochastic process and the n\u00d7k matrix \u039b(x, t\/\\\u03b6)V denotes the volatility term. \u03b8 and \u03b6 denote parameters for the functional forms of these terms. V is a constant n\u00d7k matrix, and \u039b(x, t\\\u03b6) is a diagonal n\u00d7n matrix with diagonal elements \u03c3(x, t\\\u03b6). The process dzdenotes a standard k-dimensional Wiener process. For any given dimension we have that\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b5\u02dc(0,1) is normal with mean zero and unit variance. Furthermore, E[\u03b5\u03b5=0 for t\u2260t\u2032 or i\u2260j, suggesting that the \u03b5are independent and serially uncorrelated.\n","Observe that the covariance of the vector stochastic process de\u00a3ned in Equation 3.1 is given by\n\n\u2003\u2003(3.2)\n\nwhere we have suppressed the dependence on xand t in the volatility terms. But the covariance of the n services is given by \u03a3=\u039bR\u039b\u2032, where R is the correlation matrix of the n services. We assume that the correlation matrix is time independent across the servcies, but we let the variances vary over time. Thus, we get that VV\u2032 is the principal component decomposition of the correlation matrix R that maintains the \u00a3rst k components.\n","In the special case where the services are uncorrelated, V is the diagonal matrix, and \u03c3(x, t\\\u03b6) denotes the volatility of the ith service. Observe, that when the services are uncorrelated, we need a full n-dimensional representation of the correlation matrix and noise terms.","Discretization of the Stochastic Process","Using an Euler discretization of Equation 3.1\n\n+\u03bc()\u0394()\u2003\u2003(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u02dc(0,1) for t=0, . . . , T\u2212\u0394t.\n\nTransition Function of the Stochastic Process\n","The transition functions of the stochastic process are essential for using maximum likelihood estimation (ML) of the parameters. We can approximate transition probabilities to general stochastic process by using the Euler discretization. This introduces error proportional to \u0394t, the size of the discretization interval.","Observe that we have assumed a deterministic functional form for the drift and the volatility terms. In general, we may also choose to model these as stochastic processes. Modelling one, or both, of these terms as a stochastic process leads to a two, or three, factor model. These models are typically estimated using \u00a3ltering techniques. For now we will simply assume that the drift and volatility follow a parametric functional form.","Gaussian","When the volatility term does not depend on the state variables x, the process becomes a Gaussian model. In this case, the transition function of the difference, f(x\u2212x|x, \u03b8, \u03b6), is a multivariate normal distribution with conditional mean and covariance de\u00a3ned by\n\n|=\u03bc()\u0394\n\n|=\u039b()()\n\nWe observe that the trajectory of the mean is given by \u03bc(x, t\\\u03b8)\u0394t. Speci\u00a3cation of this trajectory may be deterministic or stochastic. In the former case, we may choose, for example, to specify the trajectory as a Bass model \u00a3tted to observed data.\n","The volatilities in this model are captured in the variance terms \u03c3(t\\\u03b6) that appear on the diagonal of the \u039b(t\\\u03b6)\u039b\u2032(t\\\u03b6) matrix. If these variances are not time dependent, then the model is homoscedastic. In general, the variances will varyover time, de\u00a3ning a hetroscedastic model. The model for the time dependence of the variance can be deterministic or stochastic. The variances may be deterministically speci\u00a3ed exogenously through historical data or user input. Alternatively, we may employ a GARCH model or a stochastic diffusion model to model the time dependence of the variances.","Example","In this simplest case, the user may specify a time series of mean and variance terms for the cumulative usage of utility over some period of time T. Assume that the n services are uncorrelated and that we use all n principal components in the model.

We can use Equation 2.1 to transform the independent services demand xinto the dependent demand y=Ax. Because we are modelling ydependent on the services requirements x, the matrix Acan capture disjunctive relationships across components that are needed, for example, in component lifecycle transitions.","Example","Consider service xwith two components yand y. Assume that xrequires either ayor ay. Because we are using dependent demand we must actually specify the split across yand y. Let \u03b1 and 1\u2212\u03b1 denote the split across the two components. Thus, we get that\n\n\n\n=(1\u2212\u03b1).\n","If we assume that yis a component upgrade of y, then can model the lifecycle transition by making the mix coef\u00a3cient \u03b1 time dependent. Thus, \u03b1 starts at 1 and goes to zero as the components or hardware get upgraded. Multilevel BOMs can be similarly modelled by composition of the matrices while reporting back the dependent demand for all intermediary results.","Model Estimation and Update","We explore model estimation using maximum likelihood (ML) and model update using \u00a3ltering or Bayesian methods. Estimation of the parameters in the model refers to \u00a3tting the drift and the volatilities to data. We \u00a3rst discuss the several choices of data inputs.","Data Inputs","There are generally two different data types and each will lead to different methods of estimation.","Drift and Volatility Data","The \u00a3rst data type consists of data on the drift and volatility terms of the model. For example, the user may specify a time series of mean service usage and the corresponding variances. Thus, for a contract of length T we could have a time series of means and variances, \u03bc, . . . , \u03bcand \u03bd, . . . , \u03c3respectively. Observe that this speci\u00a3cation assumes that the volatility is fully captures by the second moment and hence must be normal or lognormal. This form of data speci\u00a3cation will be commonly used when no historical data is available. The data inputs will be largely based on judgement.","Users may well specify the percentile bands of usage. For example, the user may specify \u03b6, . . . , \u03b6, for K equal to the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile. Observe that unless the distribution is symmetric, the 50th percentile is the mode and does not correspond to the mean. In that case, the user may choose to specify the mean directly instead of the 50th percentile band. When percentiles are speci\u00a3ed, then we assume that either the percentiles at any time point arise from a normal distribution or from a lognormal distribution. In either case, we estimate \u00a3rst and second moments directly from the percentiles and use either the Gaussian model or the lognormal model.","Service Utilization Data","The second type of data is data based on directly observed usage of the services. We differentiate between two categories of usage data. The \u00a3rst category includes sparse usage data. Sparse usage data consists of, for example, 1 to 5 sets of observations. The second consists of dense usage data. In either case, this type of data input differs from the \u00a3rst data category in that the data corresponds speci\u00a3cally to the service usages xand not to the drift and volatility terms of the model.","Maximum Likelihood Estimation","Observe that to use ML estimation methods we need to have de\u00a3ned transition functions. In general, we cannot obtain exact transition function probabilities from the stochastic model equations. Instead, we approximate the transition functions by discretizing the stochastic models as in Equation 3.3. This approach, known as Quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) is suf\u00a3cient for fast approximate estimations. More re\u00a3ned and accurate estimations can be achieved through simulated maximum likelihood. For now we will discuss the QML approach and defer the simulated ML approach.","Estimation from Drift and Volatility Data","When drift and volatility data is available, we have two alternatives. In the \u00a3rst alternative, we can employ that data directly to specify \u03bcand \u03c3. In this case, no estimation is necessary since the model is fully speci\u00a3ed by the data. Alternatively, if the drift and volatility expressions have parametric forms, for example, \u03bc(t\\\u03b8) and \u039b(t\\\u03b6), then we can use parametric estimation procedures to estimate the parameters \u03b8 and \u03b6 that are consistent with the data.","Estimation from Service Utilization Data","Each service utilization data series provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the drift and volatility parameters \u03b8 and \u03b6. Thus, from multiple data realizations we can computer a distribution of these parameters, and the distributions associated moments. We let f(\u03b8\/\u03a9) and f(vzeta\/\u03a9) denote the distributions for these parameter vectors conditional on the observations \u03a9={(w, . . . , w):i\u2208|N|} that contains N observational series of length T. In providing a pricing algorithm for a new contract, we use these distributions as prior probability estimates of the drift and volatility parameters. Note that if we also have access to a utility function, then we can choose the initial model parameters as those that maximize the expected utility.","Bayesian Update","As we collect actual utilization data for the services, we can update the parameter estimates. Regardless of the choice of initial data set, we can compute an MLE of drift and volatility parameters from the new data samples. These new estimates can be used to update the original prior parameter distributions if they existed.","Pricing Algorithms","Thus far we have modelled each service by a single time dependent random variable. That variable represents some chosen metric representative of service consumption. In general, a single service may have an arbitrary number of acceptable consumption metrics. For example, a server my be monitored by total CPU utilization, memory utilization, storage consumption, etc. For the ith service, let x, . . . , xdenote the K\u22671 metrics that are representative of its consumption. We assume that these K metrics are not functional transformations of each other (for example, MB and GB for storage). Each metric is modelled by a stochastic diffusion model, noting that these metrics will be highly correlated.","The pricing algorithm consists of an arbitrary algorithm that transforms the set of service metrics into a revenue number. We may choose to have a pricing algorithm for each service that takes as input all the monitored service metrics and converts them into a price, or we may price an portfolio of services that takes as inputs all monitored metrics for all delivered services. We will discuss in this report an even simpler version of the pricing algorithm. This version takes as input an aggregation of the service metrics into a single metric.","Aggregation of Service Metrics","We let hdenote the scalar valued utility function that maps the K metric values into a single scalar value that can be used in the pricing algorithms. The function h may also aggregate the metrics into a coarser time scale. Thus, letting x=(x, . . . , x), we have that\n\n(), \u2003\u2003(6.1)\n\nwhere \u03c4 indexes the coarser time scale, and t, . . . , t\u2208\u03c4. Note that we have allowed the utility function hto depend on \u03c4 for maximum generality. In most applications, however, we do not expect the utility function to change over the contract period for the rendered service.\n\nExample\n","Consider a single service metric such as number of CPUs utilized in an N-way server. Suppose that an event is triggered and stored every time the number of active CPUs changes. We \u00a3rst need to transform the nonuniform event samples into uniform samples. Consider taking the daily maximum number of CPUs. That sequence de\u00a3nes the service metric xwhere t is a daily index. Examples of utility functions include 1) the monthly mean of the x; 2) the 75th percentile of the monthly distribution of the x; 3) the maximum of xand F for some \u25a1oor usage F; 4) a weekly weighted mean of the daily usages where weekends are weighted differently from weekdays; 5) xitself.","Observe that in the \u00a3rst four examples, the daily service sampling was transformed into a coarser sample such as weekly or monthly.","Single Metric Pricing Algorithm","Let w=(w, . . . , w) denote the aggregated utilization of a given service up to time \u03c4. We de\u00a3ne a general single metric pricing algorithm, Z(\u03a9|w) that maps metric usage at time \u03c4 into a positive real number. We assume that the pricing algorithm is a deterministic function, although we can conceive of a randomized policy pricing algorithm and deploy the same methods. Furthermore, the pricing algorithm may be a function of historical usage w.","Example","We consider the following pricing algorithm example. Let fdenote a \u25a1oor level of utilization and let cdenote the ceiling level of utilization. Note that cwill depend on the capacity of the IT infrastructure installed to support the service. For example, given a one time installation, then c=c and is time independent.","Let R denote a rate schedule such that for a given usage level w, we get that R(w) de\u00a3nes the incurred rate. The pricing algorithm is now de\u00a3ned as\n\n())=(min[, max[]]). \u2003\u2003(6.2)\n","Observe that this pricing algorithm requires the customer to pay for a time-dependent \u25a1oor level of utilization even if actual utilization falls below the \u25a1oor. In addition, the customer can at most pay for the available ceiling level of utilization since the supporting IT infrastructure cannot deliver in excess of that ceiling.","Cost Analysis","We have thus far captured the revenue generated by the service oriented model. We must now consider the cost incurred in delivering that service. We have previously discussed the dependent demand of the supporting IT infrastructure. Several methods exist to deliver that infrastructure support. For example, the delivery may consist of a single initial hardware installation. Alternatively, the installation may consist of stage hardware installations that provide additional utilization capacity. Lastly, the hardware may undergo technology upgrades to provide faster processing speeds, for example.","Financial Metrics","Let F=F(x, t\\A, C) denote a \u00a3nancial metric such as revenue or margin, that is determined from a service utilization quantity x and the implicit pricing algorithm A and cost structure C. Because the underlying process x is a Wiener process, we need to use Ito's Lemma to compute the value of dF.
