title: Worldwide television tuning system with country code based tuning
abstract: A worldwide television tuning system is configurable to the television standards and channel frequencies of multiple different countries based on a country's ITU long-distance country code. The tuning system maintains a country code table listing a plurality of countries according to their ITU codes. The tuning system also maintains multiple channel-to-frequency mapping tables that correlate channel numbers to corresponding frequencies for associated countries in the country table. The country table indexes the channel-to-frequency mapping tables. During configuration, a user or application selects a particular country by passing in the ITU code. The tuning system uses the ITU code to locate an entry for that country in the country code table. The table entry contains an index to an associated channel-to-frequency mapping table for the selected country. The tuning system loads and saves the channel-to-frequency mapping table for subsequent use. The channel-to-frequency table also identifies the appropriate television standard for the selected country. During tuning, the user or application enters a particular channel number. The tuning system uses the channel number to lookup a corresponding television frequency in the channel-to-frequency table. The tuning system then tunes to the television frequency. The tuning system stores a set of tuning frequencies for corresponding channels within a particular locale. If the tuning system is transported to another locale and then back to the original locale, the tuning frequencies may be retrieved from memory to restore operation within the original locale, rather than having to reconfigure the system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE APPENDIX","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to tuning systems for broadcast television signals. More particularly, this invention relates to worldwide tuning systems that are configurable to various broadcast television standards and channel frequencies used throughout the world.","Analog video standards for broadcast television differ from country to country. The broadcast television standard used here in the United States, for example, is different than the broadcast standard used in France. Conventional standards include multiple versions of NTSC (National Television Standards Committee), multiple versions of PAL (Phase Alternate Line), and multiple versions of SECAM (Sequential Couleur Avec Memoire).","Broadcast frequencies also change from country to country. Each country is assigned a range of frequencies to allot to its domestic television broadcast service. An international governing body known as the \u201cInternational Telecommunications Union\u201d or \u201cITU\u201d governs the allocation of broadcast frequencies among the various countries.","The country-by-country discrepancies among broadcast standards and channel frequencies pose a problem for television manufacturers. Since each country employs a particular standard and operates within a particular range of frequencies, manufacturers must tailor their televisions to the country into which they are to be sold. Traditionally, the manufacturers have hardwired the televisions during manufacturing to comply with the standard and frequency requirements of the destination country.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","22","24","26","28","30","22","22","24","26","28","24","30","24","28"]},"Under conventional manufacturing techniques, televisions used in different countries have different tuners  and video decoders . Televisions shipped in the United States are equipped with tuners and video decoders compatible with the U.S. broadcast standards and frequencies, whereas televisions shipped to other countries are equipped with different tuners and video decoders that are compatible with their broadcast standards and frequencies.","Country-based customization is inefficient because the manufacturer must make several versions of a product. In addition to broadcast standards and frequencies, the manufacturer might also have to contend with other regional differences, such specialized audio decoders for a particular market, or variations in picture tubes (e.g., 525 v. 625 line operation). The customization plays havoc with inventories because an overabundance of televisions for one country may not be cross-sold into another country where demand is strong.","To partially address this problem, manufacturers began using tuners and decoders that support multiple standards and frequencies. With this improvement, manufacturers are able to mass-produce one version of the television using the same components regardless of the destination country. Prior to shipping, the manufacturers program the tuner and decoder at the factory to a desired television standard and frequency range for the destination country.","While this is an improvement, it is not ideal. Video standards employed within a country may change. A country might decide to reallocate the broadcast frequencies, or perhaps adopt a different television standard, for political, administrative, or technical reasons. Televisions programmed at the factory are not capable of accommodating these changes. Accordingly, there is a need to design a television tuning system that may be upgraded in the field.","Another problem concerns portability. In the past, televisions sold into one country would typically reside in that country for the life of the product. It was less common for people to transport their televisions to different countries, unless they were permanently moving.","Today, as television tuner hardware decreases in size and continues to fall in component cost, it can be incorporated into portable computing devices, such as laptop computers. Given the portable nature of these computing devices, it is very likely that they will be used in numerous different locations throughout the world that employ different television standards and channel frequencies. Thus, there is a need for a worldwide television tuning system that is reconfigurable in the field to adapt to different television standards and channel frequencies.","This invention concerns a worldwide tuning system that may be implemented in televisions, computing devices, or other television broadcast receiving units. The worldwide tuning system is configurable to the television standards and channel frequencies of multiple different countries, and is reconfigurable in the event any of these parameters change. As a result, the worldwide tuning system may be transported to different countries and reconfigured to local television broadcasts. Additionally, the worldwide tuning system is upgradable in the field to accommodate any changes in television standards and channel frequencies used in various countries.","The worldwide tuning system is configurable based on a country's ITU long-distance country code. The tuning system maintains a country code table listing a plurality of countries according to their ITU codes. For instance, the United States has an ITU code of 1 and France has an ITU code of 33. The tuning system also maintains multiple channel-to-frequency mapping tables that provide television standards and correlate channel numbers to corresponding frequencies for associated countries in the country table. The country table indexes the channel-to-frequency mapping tables.","During configuration, a user or application selects a particular country by passing in the ITU code. The tuning system uses the ITU code to locate an entry for that country in the country code table. The table entry contains an index to an associated channel-to-frequency mapping table for the selected country. The tuning system then loads and saves the channel-to-frequency mapping table for subsequent use until a new and different ITU code is passed in. The tuning system utilizes the television standard listed in the channel-to-frequency mapping table for decoding broadcast television signals in the selected country.","During tuning, the user or application enters a particular channel number. The tuning system uses the channel number to lookup a corresponding television frequency in the channel-to-frequency table. The tuning system then tunes to the television frequency.","In one implementation, the television tuning system is configured as a combination hardware\/software architecture. The hardware components include tuner circuitry to tune to various television frequencies carrying television video signals and video decoder circuitry coupled to receive a television video signal from the tuner circuitry and to convert the television video signal to digital video data. A software layer overlying the hardware layer includes a tuner module coupled to adjust the tuner circuitry to a particular television frequency and a video decoder module to decode the digital video data according to a particular video standard.","The tuner module implements the country code table and the multiple channel-to-frequency mapping tables. The tuner module is implemented as a replaceable dynamic linked library (DLL). The tuner module supports an application program interface (API) to expose the DLL's functionality to an application program. In the event changes are made to broadcast television standards and channel frequencies within one or more countries, and as new countries are created or old countries cease to exist, a new tuner DLL can be downloaded and used to replace the out-of-date DLL without affecting operation of the tuning system.","The tuner module selects a channel-to-frequency mapping table based upon input of a particular country and outputs a video standard to the video decoder for use in decoding the digital video data. The tuner module selects a television frequency from the selected channel-to-frequency mapping table based upon input of a corresponding channel and outputs the selected television frequency to the tuner circuitry to cause the tuner circuitry to tune to the selected television frequency.","As a result, a manufacturer can make one television product, which can be shipped anywhere in the world. Once arriving at a particular country, the television product can be configured to the standards and frequencies of that country either automatically, or via a simple user interface.","An attached appendix forms part of this document. The appendix contains a description of methods implemented in a tuner API (application program interface) utilized by the worldwide tuning system.","This invention concerns a worldwide tuning system that is configurable to different broadcast television standards and channel frequencies used by various countries according to the countries' ITU long-distance country code. The worldwide tuning system may be implemented in televisions, computing devices, or other television broadcast receiving units. One example context for implementing the worldwide tuning system is described below.","Broadcast System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","52","54","56","56","54","52"],"i":["a","d"]},"Three different broadcast-enabled viewer units are shown in . Viewer unit () is a wireless television that receives broadcast signals over a wireless medium, such as satellite or RF networks. Viewer unit () is a cable-enabled television having a set-top box  for receiving video broadcast over a cable network. Viewer unit () is a broadcast-enabled personal computer (PC) that is capable of receiving a broadcast video stream from the broadcast medium (e.g., satellite, Internet, cable, etc.) and playing the video on a computer monitor or other display device. One example implementation of a broadcast-enabled PC is described in a co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/503,055, entitled \u201cBroadcast-Enabled Personal Computer,\u201d filed Jan. 29, 1996 in the names of Gabe L. Newell, Dan Newell, Steven J. Fluegel, David S. Byrne, Whitney McCleary, James O. Robarts, Brian K. Moran; William B. McCormick, T. K. Backman, Kenneth J. Birdwell, Joseph S. Robinson, Alonzo Gariepy, Marc W. Whitman, and Larry Brader. This application is assigned to Microsoft Corporation, and is incorporated herein by reference. Viewer unit () is a portable computer that is equipped with a broadcast tuner to receive broadcast signals.","Each viewer unit  is equipped with a worldwide tuning system that tunes to a particular broadcast frequency to receive video and audio signals and processes the signals according to a particular broadcast standard for output to a display and sound subsystem. The worldwide tuning system flexibly adapts to various broadcast standards and broadcast frequencies of different countries around the world. As a result, a manufacturer can produce just one version of a viewer unit that can be used anywhere in the world. Once the viewer unit resides in a particular country, the worldwide tuning system unit can be configured to the standards and frequencies of that county.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["56","60","62","64","66","68","70","72","64","60","64","62"]},"The central processing unit  has a processor  and memory  (e.g., RAM, ROM, Flash, disk drive, floppy disk drive, CD-ROM, etc.). An operating system  is stored in memory  and executed on processor  when the viewer unit is turned on. The operating system  is preferably a multitasking operating system that allows simultaneous execution of multiple applications. One preferred operating system is a Windows brand operating system sold by Microsoft Corporation, such as Windows CE, or Windows 95, or Windows NT or other derivative versions of Windows.","The viewer unit  runs a multimedia application  that provides processing support of the streaming video and analog signals received over the broadcast receiver. The multimedia application  is stored in memory  and executed on the processor . In the illustrated implementation, the multimedia application  is implemented using a technology known as Microsoft DirectShow, which provides playback multimedia streams from local files or Internet servers, and capture of multimedia streams from devices.","The multimedia application includes a modular arrangement of pluggable components known as \u201cfilters\u201d which are connected together at interface points known as \u201cpins\u201d (referenced generally as number  in ). A filter is a COM (component object model) object that performs a specific task on a data stream, such as decompressing video data. For each stream, the filter exposes at least one pin. A pin is a COM object created by the filter that represents a point of connection for a unidirectional data stream on the filter. Input pins accept data into the filter, and output pins provide data to other filters. A typical transform filter has one input pin and one output pin. A source filter has one output pin for each data stream and a destination filter has one input pin. More complex filter arrangements are also possible.","Filters are arranged in a configuration called a \u201cfilter graph\u201d. During construction, a developer uses a component called the \u201cfilter graph manager\u201d to connect the filters and control the stream's data flow.","Here, the filters  of the multimedia application  are configured to control underlying hardware elements in the tuner\/decoder circuitry  associated with reception and playback of a broadcast signal. The multimedia application  also has a layer of drivers  that interface the filters  with the tuner\/decoder circuitry .","Worldwide Tuning System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","82","84","64","64","102"]},"The tuner  separates the broadcast signal into two analog data signals: a video signal and an audio signal. The audio and video signals are routed through crossbar  to an audio decoder  and a video decoder , respectively. In this implementation, the audio decoder  converts the analog signal to digital audio data, which is passed to the sound subsystem  for further processing to provide such qualities as surround sound. In another implementation, the audio decoder passes the analog signal through without digitizing it. In this case, the audio decoder is used to control other parameters, such as volume.","The video decoder  converts the analog video signal to digital video data. The video decoder  is preferably a multistandard analog decoder that is capable of decoding video signals using one of a variety of video standards. The digital video data is stored in the memory  of the central processing unit  (), which is accessible by the filters  for processing the video data prior to display.","The worldwide tuning system  implements a filter graph  that programs the hardware tuner\/decoder circuitry  to the appropriate frequencies and standards used in various countries of the world. The filter graph  includes a tuner filter , a crossbar filter , an audio filter , and a video decoder filter . These filters correspond to respective hardware components in the tuner\/decoder circuitry , and namely the tuner , crossbar , audio decoder , and video decoder . Other filters in graph  include an overlay mixer filter , a video renderer filter , a tee filter , a closed captioning (CC) filter , an electronic programming guide (EPG) filter , and a broadcast data filter . The VBI filters are proxies for underlying kernel level software drivers: CC driver , EPG driver , and BC data driver . Although three VBI filters are shown in  for discussion purposes, other VBI filters can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ones shown. A \u201cline \u201d decoder filter  is also provided in the filter graph .","Each filter has at least one input pin (represented by a box with a \u201c>\u201d sign inside on the left side of a filter) or at least one output pin (represented by a box with a \u201c>\u201d sign inside on the right side of a filter). Several filters have both an input pin and an output pin, and some filters have multiple input and\/or output pins. Data flows from the tuner filter  through the various filters as indicated by the arrows connecting output pins of preceding filters to input pins of the next filters.","The drivers  provide an interface between the filters  and corresponding hardware components . The tuner filter  controls the tuning frequency of the tuner  via a tuner driver . The crossbar filter  submits routing instructions to the crossbar  via a crossbar driver . The audio filter  uses an audio driver  to control the audio decoder , and the video decoder filter  employs a video decoder driver  to manage the video decoder . The video renderer filter  provides display data to a display driver , which in turn provides pixel data to the display . A tee driver  is a kernel level instantiation of the tee filter . As noted above, the CC driver , EPG driver , and BC data driver  correspond to, and facilitate data flow for, the CC filter , the EPG filter , and BC data filter , respectively.","The worldwide tuning system  is configurable to different broadcast standards and broadcast frequencies based on ITU long-distance country codes. An ITU long-distance country code is the international calling code assigned by the International Telecommunications Union to facilitate international telephone calls. The ITU code is the number that precedes the area code in an international telephone call. The ITU code for the United States is \u201c01\u201d or just \u201c1\u201d. The ITU codes uniquely identify the countries in the world.","The tuner filter  has an ITU country code table  that lists all of the participating countries or territories in the world according to their ITU codes. The tuner filter  also maintains multiple international channel-to-frequency mapping tables  that provide broadcast standards and correlate channels and broadcast frequencies in individual countries. There might be one channel-to-frequency table for each country, or it may be possible for two or more countries to share the same channel-to-frequency conversion. It is further noted that one country might have more than one table in the event that separate regions within the country require a different broadcast standard or different channel-to-frequency mappings.","The worldwide tuning system  exposes an application program interface  (discussed below and in the Appendix) that can be used during configuration to select the correct country. The API enables applications to set video standards, set TV channels, and to get or set information about the channel frequencies. A configuration application allows a user to enter the correct country by typing in or selecting a country name, or abbreviation, via a user interface. The configuration application can convert the user-entered country to a corresponding country code and then call an API function to pass in country code to the worldwide tuning system. Once the country code is input, the worldwide tuning system  automatically adjusts to the appropriate broadcast standards and group of broadcast frequencies for the country.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["140","142","140","140","140"]},"The ITU country code table  contains indexes to corresponding channel-to-frequency tables . In , the table entries for USA and France index to corresponding channel-to-frequency tables () and (). The channel-to-frequency tables  in turn map channels in the countries to appropriate cable and broadcast frequencies for those countries. The channel-to-frequency tables  also contain the appropriate video standards for the countries. The France channel-to-frequency table (), for example, correlates channel numbers 2, 3, 4, . . . , J with associated cable and broadcast frequencies, and identifies the SECAM\/L standard.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["100","150","110","144","110","140","152","142","154","110","142","156"]},"Locale specific tuning is an advantageous feature of this worldwide tuning system. It is particularly useful for portable situations. For instance, suppose a user is located in Seattle, Wash., USA. The user might configure the worldwide tuning system to the Seattle locale using \u201cIAMTVTUNER:: put_TuningSpace\u201d. All channels in Seattle are scanned for optimal tuning frequencies and are then stored via \u201cIAMTVTUNER::StoreAutoTune\u201d as a file or other data record.","Now, suppose the user travels to Paris, France, taking along a portable viewer unit. The user can then reconfigure the worldwide tuning system to the Paris locale using \u201cIAMTVTUNER::put_TuningSpace\u201d. All channels in Paris are scanned for optimal tuning frequencies and are then stored in a second file via \u201cIAMTVTUNER::StoreAutoTune\u201d.","When the user returns to Seattle with the portable viewer unit, the worldwide tuning system can simply retrieve the file with optimal frequencies for that locale. The worldwide tuning system is immediately restored for operation in Seattle, without reconfiguration and rescanning. As a result, the portable viewer unit is immediately available for TV viewing in Seattle. Similarly, the user could return to Paris and retrieve the stored frequency file for that locale, as well. Once a mapping table  for a particular country is loaded, the worldwide tuning system  tunes to particular frequencies upon selection of various channels. At step , the tuner filter  receives a particular channel via API . The method \u201cIAMTVTUNER::put_Channel\u201d is called to input the channel number. The tuner filter  uses the channel to lookup the corresponding frequency in the channel-to-frequency table  (step  in ). The tuner filter  passes the frequency to the tuner driver , which tunes the hardware tuner  (step ). The tuner driver  responds with information regarding the quality of the signal received at that frequency (step ). If the quality is not optimal, the tuner filter  uses a search algorithm to scan for the best possible signal within the channel (step  in ). The method \u201cIAMTVTUNER::AutoTune\u201d is called to scan for a precise signal on the channel's frequency.","Filter Graph Data Flow Architecture","With continuing reference to , the tuner filter  communicates tuning changes to the other filters synchronously while providing the control instructions to the underlying tuner driver  and tuner . At the beginning and end of each tuning operation, the tuner filter  sends a packet  downstream to all filters connected in the graph . The packet  contains information regarding the tuning operation in progress. The packet  includes the country code, the channel being tuned, the video standard, and flags indicating whether this is the beginning or end of the tuning operation. As an example, the packet  can be implemented as a data structure KS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_INFO as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"typedef struct tagKS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_INFO {"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"DWORD","dwFlags;","\/\/DS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_*"]},{"entry":[{},"DWORD","dwCountryCode;","\/\/ITU Country Code"]},{"entry":[{},"DWORD","dwAnalog VideoStandard;","\/\/Current Analog Video Standard"]},{"entry":[{},"DWORD","dwChannel;","\/\/Channel Number"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"} KS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_INFO, *PKS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_INFO;"},{"entry":"dwFlags:"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"KS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_BEGIN_TUNE","Tuning operation is beginning"]},{"entry":[{},"KS_TVTUNER_CHANGE_END_TUNE","Tuning operation is complete"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The crossbar filter  routes the packet to the video decoder filter  and audio filter . Even though the packet may not contain any audio instructions, the packet notifies the audio filter  when a tuning operation is beginning and ending. In response, the audio filter mutes the audio output between the time it receives a beginning packet and an ending packet to prevent output of noise or a distorted sound.","The video decoder filter  passes the packet  on to tee filter  and overlay mixer filter . The tee filter  replicates the packet and supplies it to the closed captioning filter , the EPG filter , and the broadcast data filter . These filters \u2013 detect whether the packet  is for beginning or ending a tuning operation. During the tuning transition, these filter \u2013 cease decoding the data because the data might become corrupted in the interim. The overlay mixer filter  passes the packet onto the video renderer filter .","The video decoder filter  extracts the video standard from the packet  to determine which standard is being used in the video data stream. This information, in turn, determines which VBI (vertical blanking interval) lines to decode. The video decoder filter  includes a VBI component  and a video capture component . Depending on the video standard, the VBI component  decodes certain lines of data contained in the digital video data output by the video decoder . This VBI data is passed to the tee filter , where it is sent for processing to the closed captioning filter , the EPG filter , and the broadcast data filter . The tee filter  does not replicate the data; rather, the data is treated as being read-only and a single copy is simultaneously passed to each of the VBI decoders.","The VBI data might include closed captioning information for the closed captioning filter , data used by the EPG filter  to create or update an electronic programming guide, or other data collected by the data filter  to provide stock quotes, whether, news, and so forth. As noted above, many other types of VBI codecs may be used to decode many different type of data embedded in the VBI portion of the television signal. The closed captioning filter  outputs data to a \u201cline \u201d decoder filter , which decodes the CC data. The decoder filter  passes the closed captioning data on to the overlay mixer filter , where it is combined with the video data.","The video capture component  decodes the digital video data from the video decoder  according to the video standard contained in the packet . Additionally, the video capture component  might further process or enhance the video data stream.","The video decoder filter  outputs the video data to the overlay mixer filter  where it is combined with the closed captioning data. The overlay mixer filter processes the video data and outputs the stream to the video renderer filter  for rendering. The video renderer filter  outputs the video data stream to the display driver , which drives the display .","To illustrate data flow through the worldwide tuning system ,  shows steps in a method for changing channels. At step , the tuner filter  receives a new channel via API  (i.e., IAMTVTUNER::put_Channel). The tuner filter  uses the channel to lookup a corresponding broadcast or cable frequency in the channel-to-frequency table  (step  in ). The tuner filter  generates a beginning packet that contains the country code, the new channel, the video standard, and a flag indicating the start of the tuning operation (step ). The tuner filter  passes the beginning packet to the downstream filters to inform them of the impending tuning operation (step ). In response, some downstream filters (e.g., audio filter , closed captioning filter , EPG filter , data filter ) cease processing the current data stream to avoid processing corrupt or incomplete data.","At step  in , the tuner filter  outputs the new frequency to the tuner driver , which tunes the tuner  to the new channel. Fine adjustment may then be performed as described above with respect to steps  and  in .","After the tuner  is tuned to the new channel, the tuner filter  generates an ending packet that contains the country code, the new channel, the video standard, and a flag indicating the end of the tuning operation (step ). In response, the downstream filters begin processing the data stream.","Tuner API","The tuner filter  implements an API that enables applications to set video standards, set TV channels, and to get or set information about the channel frequencies. This interface can also determine what analog video standards your TV supports. Generally, the API includes methods for performing the following functions:\n\n","A detailed list of the methods in the tuner API is provided in the Appendix to this disclosure. This Appendix is incorporated into the disclosure.","Upgrading Worldwide Tuner","Video standards employed within a country may change from time to time for various reasons. For instance, governments might reallocate broadcast frequencies or adopt a different video standard for political, administrative, or technical reasons, or countries may be created or cease to exist. Due to these changes, the channel-to-frequency mapping tables within the tuner filter  may output erroneous frequency values or erroneous video standards.","In one implementation, the filters  are configured as dynamic linked libraries (DLLs). Any one filter may be replaced dynamically without restarting the system. For instance, in the event that certain broadcast frequencies have changed, a manufacturer or other provider can provide a new tuner filter DLL with updated channel-to-frequency tables that reflect the new broadcast frequencies. This tuner filter DLL can replace the existing, out-of-date tuner filter.","The new filter DLLs may be downloaded using several different means. As examples, the filter DLLs might be downloaded over the Internet, or broadcast as VBI data, or distributed on disk.","The worldwide tuning system is advantageous over prior art tuning systems. The tuning system enables worldwide tuning based on ITU country code, allowing it to be configured in the field rather than at the factory. Additionally, if standards or channel frequencies change, the tuning system can be reconfigured.","Another benefit is that the worldwide tuning system is portable. The worldwide tuning system can be implemented in portable computers and reconfigured to receive different television broadcasts as the user travels to different countries.","Another benefit is that the worldwide tuning system can be implemented as replaceable DLLs that are accessed via a set of APIs. As changes are made to broadcast television standards and channel frequencies, new DLLs can be downloaded and used to replace out-of-date DLLs without affecting operation of the system.","Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or steps described.
