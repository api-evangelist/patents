Technical Field","This disclosure relates generally to techniques for content delivery.","2. Description of the Related Art","It is known in the art for a content provider to outsource its content delivery requirements to a content delivery network (a \u201cCDN\u201d). A content delivery network is a collection of content servers and associated control mechanisms that offload work from Web site origin servers by delivering content on their behalf to end users. A well-managed CDN achieves this goal by serving some or all of the contents of a site's Web pages, thereby reducing the customer's infrastructure costs while enhancing an end user's browsing experience from the site. For optimal performance, the CDN service provider may maintain an objective, detailed, real-time view of the Internet's topology, reliability, and latency, and this view may then be used to power a dynamic DNS-based system to direct end users to the best CDN server to handle a particular request.","In some known content delivery networks, DNS canonical names (CNAMEs) are sometimes used to provide a level of indirection between customer hostnames and CDN service provider-specific information used to enable the service for the customer. To give a concrete example, for customer domain \u201cwww.customer.com,\u201d the CDN service provider may create a CNAME like \u201cwww.customer.com.edgeservice.net CNAME g.cdnsp.net\u201d. The customer would then create a CNAME for its domain name into the service.net domain, such as: \u201cwww.customer.com CNAME www.customer.com.edgeservice.net\u201d. Known methods for provisioning CNAMEs are either highly manual or are not monitored and prone to problems. Customers are unable to provision their own CNAMEs and typically must rely on professional services consultants, who must then create the CNAMEs by hand-editing files or other, inefficient means.","The subject matter herein describes a tool that allows a CDN customer, partner, or other authorized entity to create a CNAME on the content delivery network without having to contact the content delivery network service provider directly.\n\n","The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent features of the disclosed subject matter. These features should be construed to be merely illustrative. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed subject matter in a different manner or by modifying the invention as will be described.","By way of background, it is known to deliver digital content (e.g., HTTP content, streaming media and applications) using an Internet content delivery network (CDN). A CDN is a network of geographically distributed content delivery nodes that are arranged for efficient delivery of content on behalf of third party content providers. Typically, a CDN is implemented as a combination of a content delivery infrastructure, a request-routing mechanism (preferably based in DNS), and a distribution infrastructure. The content delivery infrastructure usually comprises a set of \u201csurrogate\u201d origin servers that are located at strategic locations (e.g., Internet network access points, Internet Points of Presence, and the like) for delivering content to requesting end users. The request-routing mechanism allocates servers in the content delivery infrastructure to requesting clients in a way that, for web content delivery, minimizes a given client's response time and, for streaming media delivery, provides for the highest quality. The distribution infrastructure consists of on-demand or push-based mechanisms that move content from the origin server to the surrogates. An effective CDN serves frequently accessed content from a surrogate that is optimal for a given requesting client. In a typical CDN, a single service provider operates the request-routers, the surrogates, and the content distributors. In addition, that service provider establishes business relationships with content publishers and acts on behalf of their origin server sites to provide a distributed delivery system.","As seen in , an Internet content delivery infrastructure usually comprises a set of \u201csurrogate\u201d origin servers  that are located at strategic locations (e.g., Internet network access points, and the like) for delivering copies of content to requesting end users . A surrogate origin server is defined, for example, in IETF Internet Draft titled \u201cRequirements for Surrogates in the HTTP\u201d dated Aug. 9, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference. The request-routing mechanism  allocates servers  in the content delivery infrastructure to requesting clients. Typically, the request routing mechanism  is implemented within, or as an adjunct to, a DNS subsystem that is managed by the CDN service provider. A representative CDN of this type is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,553,413. The distribution infrastructure consists of on-demand or push-based mechanisms that move content from the origin server to the surrogates. A CDN service provider (CDNSP) may organize sets of surrogate origin servers as a group or so-called \u201cregion\u201d or cluster. In this type of arrangement, a CDN region typically comprises a set of one or more content servers that share a common backend network, e.g., a LAN, and that are located at or near an Internet access point. Thus, for example, a typical CDN region may be co-located within an Internet Service Provider (ISP) Point of Presence (PoP) . A representative CDN content server is a Pentium-based caching appliance running an operating system (e.g., Linux, modified Linux, Windows NT, Win2K) and having suitable RAM and disk storage for CDN applications and content delivery network content (e.g., HTTP content, streaming media and applications). Such content servers are sometimes referred to as \u201cedge\u201d servers as they are located at or near the so-called \u201cedge\u201d of the Internet. The CDN typically also includes network agents  that monitor the network as well as the server loads. These network agents are typically co-located at third party data centers or other locations. Mapmaker software  receives data generated from the network agents and periodically creates maps that dynamically associate IP addresses (e.g., the IP addresses of client-side local name servers) with the CDN regions.","Content may be identified for delivery from the CDN using a tool  operated, for example, at a participating content provider server. Tool  rewrites embedded object URLs to point to the CDNSP domain. A request for such content is resolved through a CDNSP-managed DNS to identify a \u201cbest\u201d region, and then to identify an edge server within the region that is not overloaded and that is likely to host the requested content. A representative operation of this type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,108,703. If desired, various customer parameters (such as a content provider code, an object nonce, or the like) may also be encoded into the object URLs that are modified to point to the CDN to facilitate the content delivery process. Instead of using content provider-side migration (e.g., using the tool ), a participating content provider may simply direct the CDNSP to serve an entire domain (or subdomain) by a DNS alias directive such as a canonical name (a CNAME). In such case, typically the CDNSP provides object-specific metadata to the CDN content servers to determine how the CDN content servers will handle a request for an object being served by the CDN. Metadata, as used herein, refers to a set of control options and parameters for the object (e.g., coherence information, origin server identity information, load balancing information, customer (content provider) code, other control codes, and the like), and such information may be provided to the CDN content servers via a configuration file, in HTTP headers, or in other ways. The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of an object that is served from the CDN in this manner does not need to be modified by the content provider. When a request for the object is made, for example, by having an end user navigate to a site and select the URL, a customer's DNS system directs the name query (for whatever domain is in the URL) to the CDNSP DNS request routing mechanism. Once an edge server is identified, the browser passes the object request to the server, which applies the metadata supplied from a configuration file, HTTP response headers, or the like, to determine how the object will be handled.","As also seen in , the CDNSP may operate a metadata transmission (MDT) system  comprising a set of one or more servers to enable metadata to be provided to the CDNSP content servers. The system  may comprise at least one control server , and one or more staging servers -, each of which is typically an HTTP server (e.g., Apache). Metadata is provided to the control server  by the CDNSP or the content provider (e.g., using a secure extranet application) and periodically delivered to the staging servers -. The staging servers deliver the metadata to the CDN content servers as necessary. As noted above, metadata is per-customer control information for the content delivery service. Metadata may be conveniently expressed as an XML file to allow a given CDN customer the ability to control end user requests and behaviors of the content delivery network upon receipt of a request or response.","The CDN may also include other infrastructure, such as a distributed data query and collection system -that collects usage and other data from the edge servers, aggregates that data across a region or set of regions, and passes that data to other backend systems , ,  and  to facilitate monitoring, logging, alerts, billing, management and other operational and administrative functions.","The above described content delivery network is merely illustrative. The present invention may leverage any content delivery infrastructure, and there is no requirement that CNAMEs be used in association with customer-specific metadata. Stated another way, the present invention may be used to facilitate CNAME provisioning irrespective of whether the CDN service provider implements metadata handling processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","210","200","212","214","216","212","218","220"]},"As described above, DNS CNAMEs are sometimes used to provide a level of indirection between customer hostnames and CDN service provider-specific information used to enable the service for the customer. To give a concrete example, for customer domain \u201cwww.customer.com\u201d the CDN service provider may create a CNAME like \u201cwww.customer.com.edgeservice.net CNAME a13.g.cdnsp.net\u201d. The customer would then create a CNAME for its domain name into the service.net domain, such as: \u201cwww.customer.com CNAME www.customer.com.edgeservice.net\u201d. Known methods for provisioning CNAMEs are either highly manual or are not monitored and prone to problems. Customers are unable to provision their own CNAMEs and typically must rely on professional services consultants, who must then create the CNAMEs by hand-editing files or other, inefficient means.","The CNAME provisioning system described here allows customers, CDN service resellers, and permitted others to provision their own CNAMEs. Moreover, the provisioning system gives the CDN service provider permitted users a powerful interface for managing CNAMEs without having to go through complex internal systems. It is also much more robust, the system preferably is monitored and tied into other backend systems such as an alert system. In addition, the CNAME provisioning system supports new complex CNAME configurations, e.g., using geo-based information. The latter feature, for example, allows the CDN service provider to configure a customer's domain to use one domain such as \u201cg.akamai.net\u201d domain for US-based traffic and another domain such as \u201cx.akamai.net\u201d domain for non US-based traffic.","More generally, the tool allows for the provisioning of CNAMEs on the content delivery without necessarily having to contact the CDN service provider directly. Customers create CNAMEs for one or more accounts that are currently under contract with the CDN service provider. Customers preferably access the CNAME tool via a provisioning page on a CDN service provider customer portal. Customers may search for hostnames that have already been created; however, like with the CNAME creation tool, preferably only CNAMEs that are linked with a specific customer account are returned in the search.","As seen in , at a very high level, the CNAME provisioning system  has a frontend subsystem  and a backend system . The frontend subsystem  takes requests to create and modify CNAMEs and generates XML configuration files for the back end subsystem . The backend subsystem  uses these XML configuration files to produce the proper zone db and tree files for upload to a set of top level DNS servers in the CDN service provider's DNS subsystem. The backend subsystem  then reports success status to the frontend subsystem , which provides status information to the user. In more detail, the main function of the frontend subsystem  is to allow entering of CNAME information. In an illustrative embodiment as seen in , there are two main inputs, a mapping.xml file  and a SOAP application programming interface (API) . The mapping.xml file  defines and categorizes a set of available mapping solutions or \u201cmap rules\u201d for the various content delivery services being provided by the CDN service provider. The SOAP API  provides methods to create, edit, delete, search and get status for CNAMEs. Professional Services consultants as well as customers can use the SOAP API directly. In addition, a secure portal based GUI  may be provided on top of the SOAP API, and this portal  provides a convenient way to manage CNAMEs. Preferably, only the CDN service provider can modify the mapping solutions information.","One technique for implementing the backend subsystem, as will be described in more detail below, is to use an extended DNS (EDNS) infrastructure that provides a secondary DNS, i.e., a system wherein customers maintain their own DNS zone information on their own \u201cmasters\u201d and use EDNS to serve as \u201csecondaries,\u201d receiving DNS information via DNS zone transfer. Preferably, the front end sends information to the EDNS backend subsystem via the CDN metadata transport mechanism (such as the mechanism shown in ). Based on information gathered through the SOAP API and the mapping.xml file, the frontend generates one or more XML files to be used by the backend. The frontend then packages these files into an appropriate format (e.g., a tarball) and sends the package to the backend. The package preferably contains an XML file for each of the zones used by the various CDN services. The mapping.xml file preferably is also included in the package. Upon receiving a package from the metadata transport mechanism, the EDNS backend goes through a series of tests to validate the information. If successful, the backend subsystem then uploads the zones to the EDNS top level name servers in the CDN DNS subsystem. The backend reports status information through the data collection subssystem. The frontend monitors these tables to provide feedback to users.","The following provides additional details concerning the components of the provisioning tool.","Referring now to , preferably the front end subsystem  is made up of two main components: an ExtAPI SOAP server  and a metadata user interface (MUI) . The ExtAPI SOAP server  implements the external SOAP API, which allows users and integration consultants to queue up CNAME change requests. These changes include creating, editing, and deleting CNAMEs in one or more CDN service provider domains. Preferably, the CNAME information is stored in an ExtAPI database . MUI  periodically polls the ExtAPI SOAP server  to see if any CNAME changes have been queued. If changes exist, MUI  pulls the CNAME information from the SOAP server  using an internal SOAP API. MUI  then generates the XML configuration files needed by the backend system and submits them as a package (e.g., a tarball) to the metadata transport system (MDT). MUI  then monitors the status of the package through a query mechanism as new DNS zones are loaded by the backend subsystem. MUI  updates the SOAP server  with the status of the CNAME changes. CDN customers, employees and permitted others can use the external SOAP APIs to get the status of their changes.","The SOAP APIs used to manage CNAMEs are served from the ExtAPI SOAP server . The ExtAPI server may also support other SOAP APIs besides the CNAME APIs. Examples of these are the APIs used by the CDN for publishing or reporting. The CNAME APIs may be instances of an ExtAPI framework, with access to individual methods controlled with SSL certificates. Thus, preferably users can only invoke methods using certificates that have been granted access to that method. All CNAME information logically lives on the ExtAPI SOAP server and is stored in the ExtAPI database. As noted above, the SOAP APIs allow CDN customers, employees and permitted others to manage CNAMEs used with the CDN services such as object or whole site content delivery, secure content delivery, distributed content storage, and others. The API includes methods to create, edit, bulk edit (change multiple CNAMEs), delete and search for CNAMEs. Methods that queue a change preferably return a change ID. These change IDs can later be used to find out the status of a change. Representative methods are set forth below.","Preferably, CDN customers only specify the hostname and a comment attribute when creating a CNAME. The CDN service provider may set any attribute of the CNAME. Depending on the service the CNAME is used with, these other attributes include, by way of example only, object TTL, a serial number to facilitate load balancing, a map identifier, a map alias, and so forth. Preferably, the customer does not access these extra attributes, and the API preferably does not provide any indication that the attributes exist. The SOAP APIs take an array of name\/value pairs to specify the CNAME attributes. The SOAP API preferably only allows requests using certain certificates to specify the other attributes.","When a customer creates a CNAME, preferably the attributes of the CNAME are automatically determined. Consider the case where a customer creates a CNAME to be used with a content delivery network that provides object or whole site delivery. In this example, the customer gives the hostname \u201cimages.foo.com\u201d and a comment \u201cserves images for our foo.com site\u201d. The SOAP server then determines default values for all the other attributes needed by an service CNAME. From the information stored in mapping.xml, the SOAP server, for example, assigns a TTL of \u201c6h\u201d and sets the map to \u201ca;x.cdnsp.net\u201d (these values being illustrative only). If serial numbers are used for load balancing, the SOAP server may randomly pick a serial number (e.g., \u201c768\u201d) from a list of least loaded serial numbers. The way in which the SOAP server gets the list of least loaded serial numbers is described below. This results in a CNAME being created that maps images.foo.com.edgeservice.net to a768.x.cdnsp.net with a TTL of 21600 seconds. The customer can later check on the status of the images.foo.com CNAME, but preferably the customer is restricted from changing any of the attributes. This is not a requirement. As mentioned above, however, the CDN service provider can change these attributes at any time.","The SOAP server preferably treats default values differently than values that are explicitly set. For the customer created CNAME in the example above, the SOAP server records that the map and the TTL are as specified as the default values in mapping.xml. If the CDN service provider then changes the default TTL for the a;x.cdnsp.net map in mapping.xml, then a change is queued to update all the CNAMEs using the a;x.akamai.net map with the default TTL. If the CDN service provider changes the default map to another name, e.g., a;g.akamai.net, then all CNAMEs using the default map are changed to use a;g.akamai.net. If the CDN service provider explicitly sets the map or TTL, preferably those attributes will no longer be affected by changes to mapping.xml.","In an illustrative embodiment, database tables used to store CNAMEs logically represent a table of \u201clive\u201d CNAMEs and a table of pending changes. The \u201clive\u201d CNAMEs are CNAMEs that are currently loaded into their respective DNS zones. Pending changes can be a change to create a CNAME, a change to delete a CNAME, a change to edit a CNAME, or a change to edit multiple CNAMEs (bulk edit). Each change preferably has an associated change ID, and change IDs may be assigned from a monotonically increasing sequence. Changes can be added to the queue of pending changes preferably with one exception: only CNAMEs that are in the \u201clive\u201d table that are not pending deletion can be edited.","In this illustrative embodiment, MUI periodically asks the SOAP server for the latest change ID to determine if there are pending changes. MUI then uses this change ID information to \u201cpull a change\u201d. When MUI pulls a change, the SOAP server sends a list of all CNAMEs to MUI. This list preferably is a list of all the \u201clive\u201d CNAMEs merged with the pending changes. As the list is sent, preferably each pending change up to the specified change is applied to the list. MUI uses this information to generate a package of configuration information for the backend subsystem. At some later time, MUI may update the SOAP server with the status of the change. Preferably, the change status value is inherited by all pending changes with change IDs less than the specified change. For example, if changes , ,  and  are pending, and MUI pulls change  and reports it was successful, then changes ,  and  are marked successful and the live table is updated. Change  would still be pending.","Preferably, all communication between the ExtAPI SOAP Server and MUI is done using a private SOAP API. Preferably, all requests are initiated by MUI.","The SOAP APIs try to do as much validation as possible. Most validation is fairly straight forward. CNAMEs are checked for illegal characters. TTLs, serial numbers and slots are checked to make sure they are in the valid range. Mapping information is checked against the information in MappingSolutions.xml. etc.","Extra validation is done to determine which CNAMEs can be created or accessed. When a customer tries to create a CNAME, identifying information in the certificate is used to figure out which origin domains the customer owns. This information is pulled from ASAP using a SOAP call. If the customer owns only the foo.com origin domain, then they can create any CNAME that ends in .foo.com but not a CNAME that ends in .bar.com. They can also only edit and search for CNAMEs that end in .foo.com. Extra validation may also be done when deleting a CNAME. If it appears that the customer still has a CNAME pointing to a CDN service provider CNAME, the SOAP API preferably will refuse to delete the CNAME unless a force flag is set.","A web based GUI running on the portal may use the CNAME SOAP API. If used, this GUI provides an intuitive and easy way for CDN customers, employees and permitted others to manage CNAMEs without using the SOAP API directly.","As noted above, the MUI component is responsible for pulling CNAME changes from the ExtAPI SOAP server, generating a package of configuration information, and pushing the package to the network (or backend). MUI monitors a query mechanism database (i.e., query tables) to determine the success or failure of loading the new configuration files, and it reports the results back to the SOAP server. Each CNAME package pushed to the backend preferably contains an XML file per domain (e.g., edgesuite.net, edgekey.net, upload.akamai.com and download.akamai.com, as set forth below), the mapping.xml file, and an index.xml file. The index.xml file contains the ID of the package and information about each of the files contained in the package.","The bulk of the work needed to pull CNAME configuration information and push it to the backend subsystem is done by a number of daemons, collectively called the \u201cMUI daemons.\u201d They are illustrated in . The daemons preferably run at set intervals. At each interval they wake up, perform an action specific to that daemon, and sleep until the next interval. Each daemon acts as a stage in the pipeline that pushes metadata to the content delivery networks. Four of the daemons are of interest for CNAME tarball packages, namely: the Pull, Push, PushReport, and Sync daemons. Each of these are now described.","Pull Daemon\u2014","The pull daemon  periodically polls the ExtAPI SOAP server for new CNAME changes. If changes exists, the pull daemon pulls a list of all CNAMEs from the SOAP server for a specific change. The SOAP server applies the changes and all earlier pending changes to the list of CNAMEs returned to the pull daemon . The pull daemon then generates all the XML configuration files needed by the backend. A CNAME tarball is created and the process of pushing a tarball is started. A relationship is maintained between the tarball and the change ID used when pulling the CNAMEs from the SOAP server.","In addition to checking for CNAME changes, the pull daemon  also periodically checks for changes to the mapping.xml file and updates the SOAP server with a set of the least loaded serial numbers if used. The pull daemon accesses mapping.xml through any convenient means. When a change to mapping.xml is made, the pull daemon  parses the file and updates the SOAP server using a SOAP API. The list of least loaded serial numbers preferably is obtained through a database link to an appropriate database that includes this data. The SOAP server uses this information when picking default serial numbers.","Push Daemon\u2014","The push daemon  pushes tarballs of all types, including CNAME tarballs, to the network.","PushReport Daemon\u2014","After a tarball has been submitted, the pushReport daemon  determines the status of the tarball. Preferably, this daemon uses query tables populated by the backend to determine if the contents of the tarball have been successfully validated by the backend. The pushReport daemon  then checks query tables to make sure the new DNS zones have been loaded by the CDN top level DNS servers. The end result is the tarball either succeeds or fails. If the pushReport daemon  is unable to determine the status after a given time, the tarball is failed.","Sync Daemon\u2014","Once the pushReport daemon  determines the status of a tarball, it updates the SOAP server with the status of the change ID associated with the tarball. The SOAP server is then able to update its tables and give feedback to users. This is accomplished by the sync daemon .","Preferably, the MUI component keeps a history of CNAME tarballs. An interface may be provided by MUI to view the contents of past CNAME tarballs. If a failure is encountered at any point, email (or some other notification) is sent out to an appropriate entity. Preferably, MUI deals with only one tarball of a given type at a time. The pull daemon preferably does not pull another CNAME change until the status of the current tarball is determined. Preferably, there will not be more then one outstanding CNAME tarball at a time. CNAME tarballs will typically contain the global state of all CNAMEs. A tarball does not just contain the CNAMEs that changed, but contains all CNAMEs for all domains. Each tarball also contains the mapping.xml file. A tarball is totally independent of other tarballs.","Each XML file in the tarball typically contains version information. When the backend receives a new tarball, it uses this version information to decide which files need to be processed. If a file has not changed since the last seen tarball, then the backend does not process the file. In same cases it may be desirable to force the backend to load the files contained in a tarball no matter what the version is. For example, there could be an emergency that requires a previously deployed tarball to be pushed to the network again. To support this, an \u201cemergency\u201d tarball may be created. An emergency tarball is simply a tarball with an emergency attribute set in the index.xml file include in the tarball. MUI may provide an interface to select a previous CNAME tarball and perform an emergency push.","As noted above, preferably the MUI component determines success or failure on a tarball basis. Each CNAME tarball can contain multiple CNAME changes that have been batched together. Preferably, the MUI component does not report a failure to the SOAP server if the tarball contained batched changes. Instead, the MUI component will request each change individually from the SOAP server and push tarballs containing individual changes. When a tarball with only a single change fails, the error information is much more useful.","EDNS is a \u201csecondary DNS\u201d service. As illustrated in , the EDNS backend subsystem  typically comprises several \u201czoneloader\u201d machines , each running a \u201czoneloader\u201d process  that accepts configuration information (customer's zones and master name servers). The zoneloader process is instantiated as a zonewriter process , which instructs a local bind \u201cnamed\u201d process  to perform the necessary zone transfers, converts the files into an appropriate file format, which the top level name servers  expect, performs validation (including extensive testing against a local name server process), issues alerts in case of problems, and uploads the database files to the top level name servers . This infrastructure is naturally suited for CNAME provisioning.","The zoneloader machines receive one tarball at a time via MDT. If a new tarball is found, the machine preferably will try to process the package (i.e., open it, parse the contents, and so on). If anything goes wrong along the way (all the way to creating the final database files), preferably the entire package is rejected. While parsing the tarball package, preferably the machine will validate all inputs.","Once the contents of the tarball are considered good, updates are applied. To be efficient, preferably zonewriter will only process zones that have updates (based on timestamps). If there are preexisting database files, only updates are applied. If database files are persistent, the machine can detect if a new tarball contains missing records for a zone that were not explicitly deleted. If the same tarball is sent twice (having the same id), it will be rejected. If, however, an emergency flag is set (e.g., in the tarball index file), all efficiency steps are circumvented, and preferably the tarball is processed from scratch.","Once all updates are applied successfully to (temporary versions of) the database files, a suite of tests is performed. First, all contents of a dbfile are queried against a local name server process. This local name server process works just like a regular EDNS top level name server, except preferably it only listens on localhost. Preferably, the local name server process is configured with all db files so that problems or errors can be detected. Second, zonewriter will perform a test of all zone contents against the local name server to catch potential problems with db file updates.","Preferably, zoneloader and zonewriter keep persistent state. They may also process files in a temporary area.","The following are representative data structures for the query mechanism .","Authdnsheartbeat Table","EDNS processes (zoneloader, zonewriter, configloader) preferably report into the authdnsheartbeat table. This table includes the most recent dynamic configuration timestamp (in the case of zonewriter the tarball id) and cycle times.","Zoneloader Table","This table gives the status of individual zones (name of zone, loadtime, SOA information, number of records, status and a few other columns), published by both zoneloader and zonewriter. A \u201czonewriter\u201d column may be added to distinguish between zoneloader and zonewriter zones. This table allows the service provider to find out basic information and write alerts to find stale zones, etc.","Dnsconfig Table","Preferably, only zonewriter publishes to this table, reporting the id and status of the most recently seen tarball. The frontend uses this information to find out if a tarball was successful or rejected, before pushing new tarballs.","Zoneloaderalerts Table","Both zoneloader and zonewriter may publish internal alerts to this table.","It may be desirable to add support for mixed mapping solutions. Mixed mapping solutions allow the CDN service provider to hand out a different CNAMEs based on given information (e.g. geo location, bandwidth, network type, and the like). This functionality may require the creation of non-default trees. The tree will be another input into zonewriter.","To safely support these mixed maps, the following technique may be used: for any mixed-map CNAME a \u201ccross-zone\u201d CNAME is created in the main zone (e.g. \u201cedgeservice.net\u201d) into a subzone (e.g. \u201cmixedmap1.edgeservice.net\u201d). The subzone (together with a corresponding tree) contains the actual to-be-configured CNAMEs. The cross-zone CNAME does not cause any significant performance overhead, since the same top level name server process will resolve it. The following is an example: \u201cmy.com\u201d is configured to use the \u201cmixedmap1\u201d mapping solution, which translates into the \u201cg\u201d map for the United States and the \u201cx\u201d map everywhere else. The edgeservice.net zone contain the CNAME \u201cmy.com.edgeservice.net CNAME my.com.mixedmap1.edgeservice.net\u201d. The subzone \u201cmixedmap1.edgeservice.net\u201d contains the actual \u201cg\u201d or \u201cx\u201d map CNAMEs in different region stanzas based on the tree mapping.","The provisioning system can be bootstrapped with currently existing CNAMEs. In other words, an entry needs to be added to the \u201clive\u201d table in the ExtAPI database for each CNAME currently in use. This is a straightforward process with the one exception of how to handle default values. Service CNAMEs can have their map and TTL values set to use the default values specified in mapping.xml. Changing the default map in mapping.xml results in a change to all CNAMEs that are set to use the default map. During bootstrapping, CNAMEs that are using the default map can have the map set explicitly, or it can have the map set to use the default map. If set explicitly, subsequent changes to mapping.xml will not change the CNAME. Preferably, the same applies to TTL values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIGS. 6-7"},"The core infrastructure is not limited to only handling CNAMEs; the CDN service provider can use this infrastructure to handle any kind of DNS information.
