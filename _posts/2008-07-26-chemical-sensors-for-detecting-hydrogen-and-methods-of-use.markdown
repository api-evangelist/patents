No. 60\/952,125, filed Jul. 26, 2007; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Subject matter described herein was made with U.S. Government support under Grant Number CHE0518561 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to sensors and methods for detecting hydrogen. In particular, the presently-disclosed subject matter relates to sensors and methods for detecting hydrogen wherein the conductivity of a chemiresistant film is increased upon exposure to hydrogen.","Hydrogen (H) is a useful energy source that has the potential to reduce the need for fossil-fuels in the future, and may someday replace or serve as an important alternative to the current fossil-based transportation fuels. A great deal of effort has been put forth to develop hydrogen-fueled motor vehicles in order to fulfill increasing energy demands for transportation. Also, hydrogen is present as a common reagent in industry and is used as an Oscavenger in metallurgy, in hydrocracking for refined fuels, and in degradation of synthetic materials [1]. However, utilizing Hcan be dangerous, as Hhas one of the lowest flash points (\u2212253\u00b0 C.) of any energy source making it highly explosive in air above 4% by volume [2]. Accordingly, one of the aims in fuel cell research is to safely store and release Hin a controlled manner [3,4,5]. For these reasons, it is important to develop simple, reliable, low cost sensors for the detection of Hover a range of concentrations.","Early chemiresistive Hsensors were based on conductive palladium (Pd) films whose resistance increased in the presence of hydrogen due to the formation of the more resistive PdHx [6,7]. More recent reports on this type of sensing mechanism demonstrated improved response times, higher sensitivity, and lower detection limits by using nanostructured materials (e.g., Pd nanotubes) [8]. Another type of sensing mechanism involved the use of Pd nanowires [9,10] or films of nanoparticles [11,12] that contain disconnected, high resistance metal-metal junctions. These materials exhibit a decrease in resistance in the presence of Hdue to the formation of PdHx, which expands in volume and forms a more connected, lower resistance structure. This behavior was demonstrated with Pd mesowires electrochemically synthesized by step-edge decoration of highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) [9,10,13] and lithographically fabricated Pd wires [14,15]. Similar behavior has been described for discontinuous films of Pd, which contain Pd nanoparticles evaporated or sputtered so that they are below the percolation threshold for conductivity [11,12,16,17]. The importance of the functionality of the substrate that the Pd is deposited on has also been demonstrated [12]. In general, these types of sensors exhibit very fast, reversible, and sensitive responses with detection limits as low as 0.05 ppm and response times on the order of ms [9,12].","The reactivity of alkanethiolate-coated Pd monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs) to hydrogen for chemiresistive sensing applications is also appreciated [18]. The use of films of chemically-synthesized Pd nanoparticles for Hsensing had several benefits over evaporated or sputtered Pd films in terms of simplicity, cost, reproducibility, and control over the electronic properties and sensing behavior. Yet, while the electronic properties of those alkanethiolate-coated Pd MPCs could be tailored by the surrounding monolayer, the presence of the strongly chemisorbed thiolate group prevented the reaction between Pd and H. Thus, ozone or heat treatment was required to desorb thiolates from the surface and promote Hreactivity, which is inconvenient and more complicated.","Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for sensors and methods for detecting hydrogen. In particular, there is an unmet need for sensors and methods for detecting hydrogen whereby nanoparticles are deposited as a film on a sensor and directly utilized for Hsensing without first treating the nanoparticles with ozone or heat.","This Summary lists several embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, and in many cases lists variations and permutations of these embodiments.

This object is achieved in whole or in part by the presently-disclosed subject matter.","An object of the presently-disclosed subject matter having been stated hereinabove, and which is achieved in whole or in part by the presently-disclosed subject matter, other objects and advantages will become evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the following description of the presently-disclosed subject matter, Figures, and non-limiting Examples.","The details of one or more embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter are set forth in the accompanying description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the presently-disclosed subject matter will be apparent from the specification, Figures, and Claims. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references noted herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control.","Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the presently-disclosed subject matter belongs. Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the presently-disclosed subject matter, representative methods and materials are now described.","Following long-standing patent law convention, the terms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d refer to \u201cone or more\u201d when used in this application, including the claims. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca sensor\u201d includes a plurality of such sensors, and so forth.","Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term \u201cabout\u201d. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in this specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the presently-disclosed subject matter.","As used herein, the term \u201cabout,\u201d when referring to a value or to an amount of mass, weight, time, volume, concentration or percentage is meant to encompass variations of in some embodiments \u00b120%, in some embodiments \u00b110%, in some embodiments \u00b15%, in some embodiments \u00b11%, in some embodiments \u00b10.5%, and in some embodiments \u00b10.1% from the specified amount, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes sensors and methods of using same for detecting hydrogen. Hydrogen (H) is thought to be a feasible source of energy that can replace or serve as an important alternative to the current fossil-based transportation fuels. Also, His present as a common reagent in industry and is used as an oxygen (O) scavenger in metallurgy, in hydrocracking for refined fuels, and in degradation of synthetic materials. However, Hhas one of the lowest flash points of any source (\u2212253\u00b0 C.) making it highly explosive above 4% by volume. As such, applications for Hrequire sensors that can detect flow and leakage at early stages.","Thus, in some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, a sensor for detecting Hover a range of concentrations is provided that can be used in a variety of applications, including, but not limited to, Hfuel sources for transportation. The terms \u201cdetect,\u201d \u201cdetecting,\u201d and grammatical variations thereof, are used herein to refer to determining the presence or absence and measuring the amount of H. As such, \u201cdetecting\u201d Hcan refer to a determination of whether hydrogen is present or absent in a sample of interest as well as quantifying the amount of hydrogen that is present in a sample of interest. For example, to quantify the amount of hydrogen present in a sample a calibration curve is obtained by measuring the response of a sensor, or the analytical signal, to known hydrogen concentrations, i.e. standards. The analytical signal used for the detection of His the percent response as described by the following equation:\n\n% Response=()\/*100%\n\nwhere iis the initial sensor baseline current in the presence of 100% Nand iis the sensor current in the presence of a H\/Nmixture of a certain standard percent H. A negative value is equal to a decrease in the current upon exposure to Hand vice-versa. The calibration curve is a plot of Hconcentration (x-axis) versus % response (y-axis). From this curve, the concentration of Hin unknown samples can thus be determined.\n","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the sensor for detecting hydrogen comprises an electrically insulating support; at least two electrodes positioned at a distance from one another and affixed to the support; and, a chemiresistant film deposited at least between the electrodes and comprising alkylamine-coated metal alloy nanoparticles, wherein the conductivity of the chemiresistant film is increased upon exposure to hydrogen.","As used herein, the phrase \u201celectrically insulating support\u201d refers to a substrate that resists the flow of electrical current and can be used to support or separate electrical conductors while providing low background conductivity or without allowing current to travel via the support itself. For example, an \u201celectrically insulating support\u201d can include, but is not limited to, substrates comprised of glass, porcelain, composite materials, polymers such as plastics, silicates such as mica, silicon nitride, ceramics, and silicon oxide. In some embodiments, the support and the electrodes are inert to hydrogen gas.","The electrodes of the presently-disclosed sensors can be comprised of any electrically conductive material through which an electric current may enter and leave. Such electrodes are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, silver and gold electrodes that can be affixed to a support. The term \u201caffixed\u201d is used herein to refer to the attachment of electrodes to a support. For example, silver electrodes may be affixed to glass by painting the silver electrodes onto a glass support with a clean pipette or sharp metal tip, such as a glass chromatography syringe. As another example, gold electrodes may be fabricated by photolithography and affixed to a silicon support by sputtering and depositing gold over a suitable adhesion layer such as a chromium adhesion layer.","An exemplary sensor of the presently disclosed subject matter typically comprises at least two electrodes. The phrase \u201cat least two electrodes\u201d is used herein to refer to two or more electrodes that are positioned at a distance from one another such that the current running between the two electrodes can be measured. In some embodiments, the distance between the electrodes is about 100 nanometers to about 1 millimeter. In some embodiments, the distance between the electrodes is about 23 micrometers.","A criterion regarding the distance between the at least two electrodes is that the films conduct electricity across the gap between the at least two electrodes. As such, the upper limit of the distance between the at least two electrodes can be set by the appearance of possible discontinuities or breaks in the film that would prevent conductivity. For example, distances of approximately 100 nm can be used for micro-contact printed chemiresistant films as the micro-contact printed chemiresistant films are generally continuous and conductive over this distance, but can have discontinuities over longer distances that prevent conductivity. As another example, drop-cast chemiresistant films are generally continuous over distances from about 100 nm to about 1 mm or more, so conductivity is possible over longer distances.","The phrase \u201cchemiresistant film,\u201d as used herein, refers to films of materials whose conductivity changes in the presence of a vapor or gas analyte. Typically, when a vapor or gas analyte partitions into such a film, the vapors or gas analytes diffuse and absorb onto the materials which comprise the film and the resulting change in conductivity is proportional to the amount of vapor absorbed into the film. As such, in some embodiments of the sensors of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the chemiresistant film deposited at least between the electrodes is comprised of alkylamine-coated metal alloy nanoparticles. The term \u201calkylamine\u201d is used herein to refer to an alkyl group that is bonded to an amino group. The term \u201camino\u201d refers to an \u2014NRRgroup where Rand Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, and substituted alkyl.","As used herein the term \u201calkyl\u201d refers to Cinclusive, linear (i.e., \u201cstraight-chain\u201d), branched, or cyclic, saturated or at least partially and in some cases fully unsaturated (i.e., alkenyl and alkynyl)hydrocarbon chains, including for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, octenyl, butadienyl, propynyl, methylpropynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl, heptynyl, and allenyl groups. \u201cBranched\u201d refers to an alkyl group in which a lower alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl or propyl, is attached to a linear alkyl chain. \u201cLower alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl group having 4 to about 8 carbon atoms (i.e., a Calkyl), e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 carbon atoms. \u201cHigher alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl group having about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms, e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16 carbon atoms. In certain embodiments, \u201calkyl\u201d refers, in particular, to Cstraight-chain alkyls. In other embodiments, \u201calkyl\u201d refers, in particular, to Cbranched-chain alkyls.","Alkyl groups can optionally be substituted (a \u201csubstituted alkyl\u201d) with one or more alkyl group substituents, which can be the same or different. The term \u201calkyl group substituent\u201d includes but is not limited to alkyl, substituted alkyl, halo, arylamino, acyl, hydroxyl, aryloxyl, alkoxyl, alkylthio, arylthio, aralkyloxyl, aralkylthio, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, oxo, and cycloalkyl. There can be optionally inserted along the alkyl chain one or more oxygen, sulfur or substituted or unsubstituted nitrogen atoms, wherein the nitrogen substituent is hydrogen or alkyl.","Thus, as used herein, the term \u201csubstituted alkyl\u201d includes alkyl groups, as defined herein, in which one or more atoms or functional groups of the alkyl group are replaced with another atom or functional group, including for example, alkyl, substituted alkyl, halogen, aryl, substituted aryl, alkoxyl, hydroxyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, sulfate, and mercapto.","Further, as used herein, the terms alkyl and\/or \u201csubstituted alkyl\u201d include an \u201callyl\u201d or an \u201callylic group.\u201d The terms \u201callylic group\u201d or \u201callyl\u201d refer to the group \u2014CHHC\u2550CHand derivatives thereof formed by substitution. Thus, the terms alkyl and\/or substituted alkyl include allyl groups, such as but not limited to, allyl, methylallyl, di-methylallyl, and the like. The term \u201callylic position\u201d or \u201callylic site\u201d refers to the saturated carbon atom of an allylic group. Thus, a group, such as a hydroxyl group or other substituent group, attached at an allylic site can be referred to as \u201callylic.\u201d","In some embodiments, the alkylamine is a compound of Formula (I):\n\nCH(CRR)(NRR)\u2014\u2003\u2003(I)\n\nwhere n is an integer from 3 to 15 and R, R, R, and Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, and substituted alkyl. Further, in some embodiments, the alkylamine is selected from the group consisting of CHNH\u2014, CHNH\u2014, and CHNH\u2014.\n","The presently-disclosed subject matter further provides, in some embodiments, a sensor for detecting hydrogen wherein the chemiresistant film further comprises alkylhiolate-coated metal alloy nanoparticles. In this regard, the metal alloy nanoparticles of the presently-disclosed subject matter can be coated with a mixed monolayer comprised of alkylamine and alkylthiolate groups such that a single metal alloy nanoparticle contains both alkylamine groups and alkylthiolate groups. The term \u201cthiol\u201d refers to a sulfur containing \u2014SH group. As such, the term \u201cthiolate\u201d is used herein to refer to a deprotonated thiol group, or \u2014S. In some embodiments, the alkylthiolate is a compound of Formula II:\n\nCH(CRR)S\u2014\u2003\u2003(II)\n\nwhere n is an integer from 3 to 15 and Rand Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, and substituted alkyl. In some embodiments, the alkylhiolate is CHS\u2014.\n","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, a sensor is provided wherein the chemiresistant film comprises surfactant-coated metal alloy nanoparticles, wherein the surfactant is a compound of Formula (III):\n\n[CH(CRR)]NR\u2003\u2003(III)\n\nwhere n is an integer from 3 to 15; Rand Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, or substituted alkyl; and, Ris selected from the group consisting of Cl, I, NO, SO, ClO, and PF. In some embodiments, the surfactant is tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr).\n","The term \u201cmetal alloy nanoparticles\u201d is used herein to refer to nanoparticles comprised of at least two elements, one of which is a metal. The term \u201cnanoparticles\u201d includes particles having an average size of, in some embodiments, between about 2 and about 100 nm, in some embodiments, between about 2 and about 50 nm and, in some embodiments, between about 2 and about 10 nm. A metal alloy of the presently-disclosed subject matter can be comprised of a pure metal alloy or mixtures of metal alloys. For example, the metal alloy can be a core\/shell particle that contains one metal in the core and another metal as a surrounding shell. As another example, the metal alloy can be a mixed alloy that is an even mixture of two metals throughout the particle. As yet another example, the metal alloy can be a phase-segregated alloy, where the metal alloy has different separate phases of each metal in the nanoparticle, but are not necessarily arranged as a core and shell.","In accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter the metal alloy nanoparticles can comprise a roughly spherical metal core that is surrounded by an organic monolayer, which, in some embodiments, can comprise an alkylamine, an alkylthiolate, or a surfactant. In this regard, the term \u201cmetal alloy nanoparticles\u201d can be used interchangeably with the phrase \u201cmonolayer protected clusters\u201d or \u201cMPCs.\u201d In some embodiments, the roughly spherical metal core can have a diameter of about 1 to about 3 nanometers and the roughly spherical metal core surrounded by an organic monolayer can have a diameter of about 2 to about 5 nanometers. [42] Further, the metal alloy nanoparticles surrounded by an organic monolayer can be taken from a solution in which they are soluble and then deposited as films between electrodes where conductivity of the film is then increased upon exposure to hydrogen.","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the metal alloy comprises palladium and a metal selected from the group consisting of gold, silver, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the metal alloy is selected from the group consisting of a palladium alloy, a palladium\/gold alloy, and a palladium\/silver alloy. The reaction between hydrogen and Pd or Pd-containing alloys is of great interest because of its relevance in hydrogen sensing and heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. It is appreciated that hydrogen spontaneously adsorbs to Pd as atomic hydrogen and diffuses into the lattice to form PdHx [6]. The initial \u03b1-phase Pd becomes \u03b2-phase PdHx through an \u03b1-\u03b2 phase transition. The Pd lattice spacing changes throughout these phase changes, depending on the hydrogen concentration in the surrounding atmosphere [2,6]. The phase transitions and changes in lattice spacing lead to measurable changes in the optical properties [19-27], resistance [7-14, 16-17, 28-38] and mass [2,24] of the Pd.","Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that upon exposure to H, PdHx forms and the chemiresistant films restructure and expand in volume to create more connected structure with fewer high resistance structures, thus lowering the resistance between the electrodes and increasing conductivity of the chemiresistant film upon exposure to H. Further, the conductivity of the chemiresistant films decreases with decreasing concentrations of H. As such, in some embodiments, the conductivity is reversible.","Typically, to exhibit reversible Hsensing behavior, films of alkylamine-coated Pd nanoparticle are first conditioned with 100% H. Upon the first exposure to 100% Hduring the conditioning, the conductivity of films of alkylamine-coated Pd nanoparticles increases irreversibly by 1 to 5 orders of magnitude, depending on the metal used (Pd, Pd\/Ag, or Pd\/Au) and alkyl chain length (e.g., C-C). This large increase in current can be attributed to an irreversible morphological restructuring of the Pd in the film due to the incorporation of atomic H into the Pd lattice, forming PdH, which increases the size of the nanoparticles and causes direct irreversible contact between the Pd nanoparticles. Removal from the hydrogen environment causes hydrogen to be removed from the film, but the film has been irreversibly altered due to the connections made between the Pd nanoparticles. Subsequent exposures to and removal of hydrogen after conditioning exhibit a reversible increase or decrease in current. The response direction (increase or decrease) depends on the metal composition (Pd, Pd\/Ag, or Pd\/Au) and the alkyl chain length (e.g., C-C). An increase in current occurs for films that are still highly resistive after conditioning due to more connections made in the film upon the volume expansion of PdHversus Pd. A decrease in current occurs for films that have a low resistance after conditioning due to an even larger resistance for PdHcompared to Pd. There is a competition between the increase in resistance associated with PdHversus Pd and the decrease in resistance associated with volume expansion of PdHversus Pd. One mechanism depends on the initial resistance of the film. The conditioning step and two sensing mechanisms apply specifically to films of alkylamine-coated Pd MPCs. TOABr coated Pd nanoparticles do not exhibit an irreversible conditioning step.","In some embodiments, the chemiresistant films of the presently-disclosed subject matter are deposited at least between the two electrodes of the sensors. As used herein, the phrase \u201cat least between\u201d is used to refer to the location where the chemiresistant films are deposited onto the support. For example, the chemiresistant films can be deposited onto the support such that the film is present only in the space between the electrodes. As another example, the chemiresistant films can be deposited on the support such that the film is present in the space between the electrodes and over the electrodes. Further, as another example, the chemiresistant film can be deposited on the support such that the film is present on a substantial portion of the support including, but not limited to, the space between the electrodes, over the electrodes, and over other areas of the support.","In some embodiments of the sensors of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the chemiresistant film is drop-cast deposited at least between the at least two electrodes. In this regard, one or more drops of a solution in which alkylamine-, alkylthiolate-, and\/or surfactant-coated metal alloy nanoparticles are solubilized, e.g. with toluene, can be deposited drop wise at least between the two electrodes and allowed to dry until the solvent has evaporated.","In some embodiments of the sensors of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the chemiresistant film is micro-contact printed at least between the two electrodes. In this regard, a solution comprising coated nanoparticles can be used as ink for micro-contact printing onto solid substrates [39]. Methods of micro-contact printing include inking a patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp with featured lines (e.g. lines approximately 1.3 \u03bcm wide, approximately 0.5 \u03bcm long, with approximately 2.2. \u03bcm separation) with a chemiresistant film solution, allowing the solution to dry for several minutes, and then bringing the stamp into contact with a support for several seconds.","Further provided, in some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, is a method for detecting hydrogen in a sample. In some embodiments, the method comprises providing a sensor in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter; applying a voltage potential between at least two electrodes; exposing the sensor to a gas sample; and detecting a change in the current between the at least two electrodes to thereby detect hydrogen in the sample. In some embodiments of the method, the hydrogen is present in the gas sample at a concentration of at least about 0.08%. In some embodiments, the hydrogen is present in the gas sample at a concentration of about 9.6% to about 0.08%.","The following Examples have been included to illustrate modes of the presently-disclosed subject matter. In light of the present disclosure and the general level of skill in the art, those of skill will appreciate that the following Examples are intended to be exemplary only and that numerous changes, modifications, and alterations can be employed without departing from the scope of the presently-disclosed subject matter.","Chemicals","The following chemicals were used as received. Sodium borohydride (99%), tetraoctylammonium bromide (99%), toluene (99.9%), and 2-propanol (99.9%), were purchased from VWR Scientific Products. Octylamine (CHNH) and dodecylamine (CHNH) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. 1-hexadecylamine (CHNH) containing CHNHand 1-octadecylamine (CHNH) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. Barnstead Nanopure water (17.8 M\u03a9-cm) was employed for all aqueous solutions.","Synthesis of Hexanethiolate-Coated Pd Nanoparticles","Hexanethiolate-coated (CHS\u2014) Pd nanoparticles were synthesized according to a modified Brust reaction [40-42]. Briefly, 0.40 g of KPdClwas dissolved in 25 ml of water and 1.00 g of tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr) was dissolved in 150 ml of toluene. The two solutions were combined and stirred until all of the PdCl transferred into the toluene phase. The toluene phase was separated and 90 \u03bcl of hexanethiol, corresponding to a 1:2 thiol:Pd ratio, was added to the toluene and stirred. The solution was cooled to approximately 0\u00b0 C. using an ice bath and a 10-fold excess of NaBH(0.46 g in 10 ml of water) with respect to Pd was added to the toluene solution with stirring. The solution turned black within a few seconds, indicating the formation of metallic Pd MPCs. 10 ml of additional water was added and the solution was stirred overnight. The toluene layer was separated and removed by rotary evaporation. The remaining black solid was suspended in 200 ml of acetonitrile and collected by filtration on a glass fritted B\u00fcchner funnel. The black solid product was washed with an additional 250 ml of acetonitrile and thoroughly dried before collecting. The average diameter of hexanethiolate-coated Pd nanoparticle prepared this way is approximately 3.0 nm [42].","Synthesis of Alkylamine-Coated Pd, Pd\/Ag, and Pd\/Au Nanoparticles","Alkylamine-coated Pd nanoparticles were synthesized similar to hexanethiolate-coated Pd nanoparticles and alkylamine-coated Au nanoparticles [43]. Briefly, 0.50 g (1.59 mmol) of KPdClwas dissolved in 20 ml of water and 1.92 g (3.51 mmol) of tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr) was dissolved in 100 ml of toluene by ultrasonication for 10 min. The two solutions were combined and stirred until all of the PdCl transferred into the toluene phase. The appropriate alkylamine ligand was then added to the rapidly stirring mixture in a 12:1 alkylamine:Pd ratio and allowed to stir for an additional 2 h. This ratio corresponds to 0.019 mol of alkylamine, which is 3.10 ml for octylamine (CHNH), 3.39 g for dodecylamine (CHNH), and 4.42 g for 1-hexadecylamine containing 1-octadecylamine (CHNH\/CHNH). The aqueous layer immediately turned a beige\/murky white upon addition of the alkylamine presumably due to the formation of a complex between the protonated amine and the PdCl. After approximately 2 hours of stirring, 0.84 g NaBH(0.022 mol) was dissolved in 10 ml of water and added to the two-phase solution with stirring. The solution turned black within a few seconds, indicating the formation of coated-Pd nanoparticles. 10 ml of additional water was added and the solution stirred overnight. The white and cloudy precipitate in the water phase disappeared and became colorless as the reaction proceeded. The toluene layer was separated and removed by rotary evaporation. The remaining black solid was suspended in 200 ml of acetonitrile and collected by filtration on a glass fritted B\u00fcchner funnel. The black solid product was washed with an additional 150 ml of acetonitrile, 150 ml of ethanol, and thoroughly dried before collecting. The average diameter of CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticles was 3.0\u00b10.8 nm as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements.","Alkylamine-coated Pd\/Ag and Pd\/Au alloy nanoparticles were synthesized in a 10:1 Pd:Ag or Pd:Au ratio by adding the corresponding salts in a 10:1 ratio in the reaction mixture. AgCFOand HAuCl. 3HO were used for Ag and Au, respectively. AgCFOwas directly soluble in the toluene phase while AuCl was phase transferred into toluene with TOABr along with PdCl. The amount of alkylamine and NaBHwas 12:1 and 15:1 with respect to total metal content. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV-vis spectroscopy measurements on coated Pd, Pd\/Ag, and Pd\/Au nanoparticles was consistent with the successful synthesis of coated Pd, Pd\/Ag, and Pd\/Au nanoparticles.","Synthesis of TOABr-Coated Pd and Pd\/Ag Nanoparticles","Tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr)-coated Pd nanoparticles were synthesized in a manner similar to the hexanethiolate coated Pd nanoparticles, except the hexanethiol was not added. TOABr-stabilized nanoparticles are insoluble when isolated as a powder [44]. Thus, after reduction and separation from the water phase, the toluene solution containing the particles was reduced to approximately 50 ml by rotary evaporation, filtered with a microdisc filter (acrodisc, 2 \u03bcm PTFE membrane) to remove insoluble materials, and then used from solution. TOABr-coated Pd\/Ag alloy nanoparticles were synthesized by adding AgCFOto the solution in a final 10:1 Pd:Ag molar ratio and performing the rest of the synthesis the same as that for pure Pd. The 10-fold excess of NaBHwas with respect to the total metal. The average diameter of TOABr-coated Pd nanoparticles was 7.0\u00b10.5 nm as determined by AFM measurements. UV-vis spectroscopy was consistent with the formation of metal nanoparticles, but NMR was not possible since the product could not be purified and isolated as a solid.","Sensor Device","Two Au electrodes separated by 23 \u03bcm were fabricated in a clean room by photolithography on a Si\/SiOsubstrate. The 100 nm thick Au electrodes were sputtered over a 10 \u212b thick Cr adhesion layer during the process. Wire leads were attached to the Au electrodes with Ag epoxy (cured 12 h, 80\u00b0 C.) which was further insulated with an overlayer of torr-seal epoxy (cured 12 h, 80\u00b0 C.). The electrode was cleaned by rinsing in acetonitrile, dichloromethane, acetone, ethanol, and 2-propanol before drying under N. The device was then placed in a UVO ozone cleaner (Jelight Company Inc., Irvine, Calif.) for 10 min before depositing the films of nanoparticles over the electrodes. Films of alkylamine-coated nanoparticles were drop-cast deposited using 1 to 3 drops of a 4 to 70 mg\/ml toluene solution. The concentration and number of drops were chosen to obtain current through the film above the baseline. Films of TOABr-coated nanoparticles were drop-cast deposited using 2 drops of an approximately 2.6 mg\/ml toluene solution, which is the concentration in terms of Pd when reducing the volume to 50 ml by rotary evaporation.","Gas Sensing","Gas sensing was performed with a CH Instruments 660A (Austin, Tex.) electrochemical workstation operating in chronoamperometry mode. The current was monitored with time while a \u22120.3 V potential was applied between the two electrodes and the sample was exposed to alternating flows of pure Nor air and different concentrations of Hin the Nor air carrier gas. A range of Hconcentrations was obtained using a set of flow meters (Cole Parmer, 2% error at full scale) located between the sample and gas cylinders and operated by a 3-way valve, which allows a constant Hflow during mixing with Nand avoids over-pressures and artificial current spikes during sensing. The different concentrations of Hand the total flow rates (H+N\/air) used were as follows: 9.6\u00b10.3% (3.1\u00b10.1 L.min), 6.2\u00b10.2% (4.9\u00b10.1 L.min), 3.2\u00b10.1% (4.7\u00b10.1 L.min), 1.0\u00b10.1% (4.7\u00b10.1 L.min), 0.50\u00b10.02% (4.6\u00b10.1 L.min), 0.21\u00b10.02% (4.6\u00b10.1 L.min), 0.11\u00b10.02% (4.6\u00b10.1 L.min), 0.08\u00b10.02% (4.6\u00b10.1 L.min). The flow rates and Hconcentrations were similar using Nor air as the carrier gas due to their similar density.","Characterization of Sensors","Films of alkylamine- and TOABr-coated Pd and Pd alloy nanoparticles were drop-cast deposited onto Si (100)\/TiW (50 {acute over (\u212b)})\/Au (2000 {acute over (\u212b)}) and electrode devices for surface reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and AFM experiments, respectively.

The arrows in  are reference points showing the same features on the surface as in . Morphological changes upon the incorporation of hydrogen into Pd and subsequent removal are appreciated [6]. The morphological changes observed by microscopy are consistent with the 5-6 order of magnitude conductivity increase and 80% loss of CHNH\u2014 ligands from the nanoparticles observed from the I-V curves and surface FTIR data, respectively.  show optical and AFM images, respectively, of the same area of the same surface after another 1 h exposure to ambient air. Several of the black features in the optical image and bright features in the AFM image disappeared, showing that there are slow morphological changes that occur in the film over longer periods of time after exposure to H. Many of the regions appear to heal themselves as indicated by the circle marked #1, but several regions were also altered irreversibly as indicated by the circle marked #2 ().","Further AFM and optical microscopy were performed to determine changes in film morphology upon conditioning\/restructuring with 100% H. In order to correlate morphology changes with conductivity changes, alkylamine Pd and Pd alloy nanoparticles were drop-cast deposited between electrodes from a toluene solution containing 70 mg\/ml of the nanoparticles and optical and AFM images of the films before and after conditioning were obtained until the electrodes displayed stable currents (indicated on the bottom-left corner of the optical images). AFM images were taken in between the Au electrodes where most of the current flows (dashed rectangles).  shows the optical and corresponding AFM images as indicated by the dashed box of the same area on the same film after exposure to 100% H.  shows the optical and corresponding AFM image for a film of CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticles before and after exposure to 100% Hfor 500 s. Frame 9A3 shows cracks on the film (top-right corner) that were not present in Frame 9A1, indicating significant morphology changes during conditioning. Comparison between AFM images in Frames 9A2 and 9A4 show morphology changes on the nanoscale as well. , Frame 1 shows the optical and corresponding AFM image for a film of CHNH-coated Pd\/Ag nanoparticles before and after exposure to 100% Hfor 400 s. There are no noticeable changes in the optical images (Frames 9B1 and 9B3). There are small changes in the AFM images (Frames 9B2 and 9B4), including the formation of new pits in the image, enlargement of existing pits, and other small changes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 9C","FIG. 9D"],"sub":["12","25","2","2 ","12","25","2","2 "],"sup":"\u22123 "},"The optical and AFM images in  are consistent with the conductivity and surface FTIR data obtained on the same films under similar conditions. Films of CHNH-coated Pd and CHNH-coated Pd\/Au nanoparticles showed the largest morphology changes, which is consistent with the large loss of alkyl chains from the surface as determined by FTIR (80 and 62%, respectively) and the large 5-6 order of magnitude increase in current. This shows that loss of the monolayer and large structural changes occur during the large increases in conductivity upon conditioning. Films of CHNH-coated Pd\/Ag and CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticles showed the smallest morphology changes. The small morphology change is consistent with the relatively smaller 4% and 36% loss of the alkyl chains as determined by FTIR for CHNH-coated Pd\/Ag and CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticles, respectively. This is also consistent with the smaller 1-2 order of magnitude increase in current after conditioning for the film of CHNH-coated Pd\/Ag nanoparticles. This is not consistent with the 5-6 order of magnitude current increase for the film of CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticles, however. This shows that film conductivity can increase significantly without noticeable structural changes in the film. Smaller changes can occur below the resolution of the AFM and optical images in . The large increase in conductivity with relatively smaller structural changes can result from the slower kinetics of the film restructuring process. In general, the morphology data in  correlate well with the loss of monolayer determined by FTIR and conductivity changes measured during conditioning.","The analytical signal used for the detection of His percent response as described by the following equation:\n\n% Response=()\/*100%=\u0394*100%\n\nwhere iis the initial baseline current in 100% N, iis the current in the presence of H, and \u0394i=(i\u2212i). A negative value is equal to a decrease in the current upon exposure to H.  shows the average calibration curves plotting the % response (y-axis) versus the Hconcentration (x-axis) for the six tested films (not forced through the origin). The points and curves represent the average of three samples. Frames A and B show the response of films whose conductivity increased in the presence of Hfrom 0.0 to 0.50% and 0.0 to 9.6% H, respectively. Frame C and D shows the response of films whose conductivity decreased in the presence of Hfrom 0.0 to 0.50% and 0.0 to 9.6% H, respectively. All the films displayed fairly linear sensing behavior below 0.50% H. The behavior from 0.0 to 9.6% Hdepended upon the type of stabilizer surrounding the particles. Films of alkylamine-coated nanoparticles exhibited non-linear calibration curves above 0.50% due to the \u03b1-\u03b2 phase transition, which occurs anywhere from 0.3 to 2.0% H, and saturation of Hin Pd at higher concentrations [2,6,23].\n","Films of TOABr-stabilized nanoparticles displayed much more linear behavior over the entire range (more pronounced for TOABr-coated Pd nanoparticles), which is not unexpected since the sensing mechanism is different. The slopes of the linear plots in  reflect the following sensitivity order for films that increase in current: TOABr Pd\u2248TOABr Pd\/Ag>CHNHPd\/Ag. The slopes of the linear plots in  reflect the following sensitivity order for films that decrease in current: CHNHPd (at intermediate current) (\u221210.5)>CHNHPd\/Au (\u22124.9)>CHNHPd (\u22122.9)>CHNHPd (at high current) (\u22120.8). All of the films lead to sensor responses below the explosive limit for H. Films of CHNH-coated Pd and Pd\/Ag nanoparticles exhibited the lowest detection limit (0.08%), while films of CHNH-coated Pd\/Au nanoparticles followed by those of CHNH-coated Pd\/Ag silver nanoparticles displayed the fastest response time of 10-15 and 10-20 s, respectively. It is appreciated that Pd\/Au and Pd\/Ag alloy films show faster response times and greater sensitivity, respectively [25-27]. This is consistent with the present data on CHNH-coated Pd\/Au films, which responded very fast during conditioning and also showed the fastest sensor response times (10-15 s). Films of Pd\/Au alloys described previously [27] were less sensitive to H, however, the present films of CHNH-coated Pd\/Au nanoparticles were more sensitive compared to films of CHNH-coated pure Pd nanoparticles. Some data sets are <10% RSD. Although the actual percent response measured from sample-to-sample had some deviation, the general trend in sensing behavior was very reproducible. The success column in Table 3 is a measure of the percent success of measuring the indicated Hconcentration for the three samples. All films exhibited 100% success at measuring 0.11% H, with the exception of TOABr-coated Pd, which is sensitive down to 0.21% H. Only CHNH-coated Pd, CHNH-coated Pd\/Ag, and CHNH-coated Pd\/Au nanoparticles were sensitive down to 0.08% Hwith 100, 33, and 100% success, respectively.","Table 4 summarizes the overall sensing characteristics of the six different films.

foregoing examples demonstrate the hydrogen reactivity of drop-cast films of chemically-synthesized alkylamine-coated Pd, Pd\/Ag (10:1) and Pd\/Au (10:1) nanoparticles and films of tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr)-stabilized Pd and Pd\/Ag (10:1) nanoparticles. The as-prepared films are highly reactive to Hand do not require Oor thermal treatment as previously observed for films of CHS-coated Pd nanoparticles. The films can be placed into two categories; those that decrease in current in the presence of Hand those that increase. Films of CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticles, CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticles (second conditioning), and CHNH-coated Pd\/Au nanoparticles exhibit large 5-6 order of magnitude irreversible increases in current upon the first exposure to 100% H, which is accompanied by a large loss of the alkylamine monolayer and noticeable morphological changes in the case of CHNH-coated Pd nanoparticle films. After this irreversible conditioning\/restructuring, the films exhibit stable, reversible decreases in current in the presence of Hconcentrations down to 0.08%. Films of CHNH-coated Pd (first conditioning) and CHNH-coated Pd\/Ag nanoparticles exhibit a much smaller 1-2 order of magnitude irreversible increase in current upon the first exposure to 100% H, which is accompanied by very little loss of the alkylamine monolayer and correspondingly small morphological changes in the film.","Further, after this irreversible conditioning\/restructuring, the films exhibit reversible increases in current in the presence of Hconcentrations down to 0.08%, which is stable for the case of coated Pd\/Ag nanoparticles. Films comprised of TOABr-coated Pd and Pd\/Ag nanoparticles exhibit reversible, stable increases in current in the presence of Hconcentrations down to 0.11% without any pre-treatment or conditioning. Alkylamine-coated Pd nanoparticles change in current through higher resistance of PdHx or lower resistance during volume increases of PdHx and the sensing mechanism of ammonium-coated Pd nanoparticles shows ionic conductivity. All of the films are easy to synthesize on a large scale and the devices are easy to construct, leading to responses to Hbelow the explosive limit.","Throughout this application, various publications are referenced.
