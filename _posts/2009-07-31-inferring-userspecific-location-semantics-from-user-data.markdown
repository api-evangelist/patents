title: Inferring user-specific location semantics from user data
abstract: Determining semantics for locations based on user data such as user activities and/or user communications. The user data is captured and analyzed to identify keywords including locations. Location data describing the locations is obtained and associated with the user and keywords. The associations represent user context for the locations. The associations are used to deliver services and/or products to the user at various times such as when user approaches or enters a particular location.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Electronic calendar data, to-do lists, and other user-specific data often identify particular locations. Existing systems identify the locations by place names such as the names of stores, restaurants, street addresses, or latitude\/longitude coordinates. In some instances, however, the same location can have different meaning for the same user depending on factors such as the time of day. For example, a local coffee house may be the location where the user obtains breakfast in the morning and the same location where the user attends a book club meeting at night. Similarly, the user may attend a wedding reception at a local banquet hall on one day and then attend a baby shower at the same banquet hall another day. In this example, the location has multiple meanings for the same user. Existing systems fail to identify and distinguish between the different contexts that apply to the same location for a particular user.","Embodiments of the invention infer location-specific user context. User data is received from one or more computing devices. The received user data describes user activities and\/or user communications. The user data is analyzed to identify location keywords associated with the user data. The location keywords include locations, for example. The user, location keywords, and location data for the locations are stored as one or more associations representing user context for the locations.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring to the figures, embodiments of the disclosure enable, at least, a determination of user context for locations. By inferring user context, aspects of the disclosure enable context-aware matching and delivery of relevant services to users  at the locations. For example, in addition to providing the determined or inferred user context for the locations to the users , the user context may be leveraged by developers to provide web services and application programming interfaces (APIs) for location semantics  and location intelligence .","Referring again to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the collection of user data  such as user activities  and\/or user communications  from a plurality of users  by a plurality of devices . In some embodiments, the user data  is transient. The plurality of devices  detects and\/or collects the user data  from the user . For example, the devices  include, but are not limited to, mobile telephones, laptop computers, netbooks, digital cameras, digital video cameras, gaming consoles (including handheld gaming consoles), portable music players, personal digital assistants, information appliances, personal communicators, and any other computing devices of the users . In some embodiments, the devices  include computing devices remote from the users , yet accessible by the users . Such computing devices include, for example, server computing devices, peer computing devices, local or remote network packet sensors, and the like.","The devices  detect user activities  and\/or user communications  and collect at least a portion of the detected activities and\/or communications. The collected data is stored in a memory area associated with the devices , in a memory area  associated with devices  that analyze the collected data (e.g., mining), and\/or in one or more other memory areas. The devices  mine the user data  collected by the detection devices  to infer user context. The user context is stored in the memory area . The memory area  includes any memory area internal to, external to, or accessible by the devices .","A network  connects the detection devices  and the mining devices . There may also be a network (not shown) between the users  and the detection devices , and between the mining devices  and the memory area . The network  includes any wired or wireless network including, but not limited to, cellular networks, intranets, the Internet, and BLUETOOTH brand wireless networks.","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the generation of location semantics  and location intelligence  based on the user activities  and the user communications . The user activities  are detected, accessed, received, obtained, or the like for location data mining . The user activities  may be explicit or implicit. Exemplary explicit user activities  include one or more of the following: calendar entries, task entries, to-do lists, and shopping lists. Exemplary implicit user activities  include, but are not limited to, commercial transactions (e.g., purchasing merchandise, buying movie tickets, etc.) and consumption of domain-specific mobile services. Domain-specific mobile services include turn-by-turn navigation, point-to-browse real estate information retrieval, point-to-shop price comparison, photo shooting, photo tagging, and more.","Similarly, the user communications  are detected, accessed, intercepted, received, obtained, or the like for the location data mining . Exemplary user communications  include one or more of the following: electronic mail messages, instant messages, text messages, blog postings, microblog postings (e.g., \u201ctweets\u201d), photo postings, web site postings, voice telephone calls, and video telephone calls. The user communications  include communications in which the user  is the originator and communications in which the user  is the recipient.","The location data mining  obtains location data from one or more data sources  based on the user activities  and the user communications . The data sources  include databases, web sites (e.g., user profile web pages, social networking web sites), or any other repositories of information. The location data describes or provides more information related to the user activities  and the user communications .","In some embodiments, the location data mining  is implemented as application programs executing on one or more computing devices . For example, the functionality of the location data mining  may be distributed across a plurality of computing devices  (e.g., cloud computing).","The location data mining  outputs location semantics , location intelligence , and other mined data. Location semantics  describe the meaning associated with a particular location based on the input user activities  and\/or user communications . For example, the location data mining  accesses the data sources  to match particular locations derived from the user activities  and\/or user communications  to landmarks, shops, attractions, etc. Location intelligence  includes, for example, information describing the particular locations. For example, if one of the locations corresponds to a restaurant, the location data mining  accesses the data sources  to obtain location intelligence  such as a review, rating, menu, or list of available reservation times.","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the analysis of collected user data  to infer user context. A data collection  module captures, intercepts, receives, or otherwise accesses user activities  and\/or user communications . The accessed activities and\/or communications are input into an image, audio, video, and\/or text analysis  module. The image, audio, video, and\/or text analysis  module performs an analysis to identify keywords (e.g., location keywords). The keywords include, for example, names of people, locations, items, and times. The location data mining  uses the keywords to extract location data from the data sources . The location data includes, for example, the location semantics  and location intelligence  illustrated in .","In the example of , the data collection  and image, audio, video, and\/or text analysis  functionality are illustrated as separate elements from location data mining . However, the various functions performed by data collection , image, audio, video, and\/or text analysis , and location data mining  may be divided into any quantity of elements, or performed by a single functional element.","One or more associations  are created among the users , keywords, and extracted location data. For example, each of the users  may have one association  for each location. This results in a plurality of associations  for each of the users . In some embodiments, the associations  represent user context for the locations identified from the user activities  and\/or user communications .","The created associations  are stored in the memory area  as the user context. For example, the associations  may be stored as an n-tuple conforming to the following format <user, location, tags>. An example includes <Jane, 2411 Main Street, CoffeeHouse, 6 am-5 pm, BOGO lattes after 9 am>. In this example, the location is the street address 2411 Main Street, and there are three tags. One tag identifies the name of the establishment at the street address, another tag identifies the hours of operation of the establishment, and another tag identifies a buy-one-get-one (BOGO) offer. The data in the tags reflects the location data obtained from the data sources .","In some embodiments, the tags in the associations  take the form of name-value pairs or key-value pairs. For example, the associations  may be stored in the following format <user, location, name=value, name=value, . . . >. An example includes <Jane, 2411 Main Street, restaurantname=\u201cCoffeeHouse\u201d, hours=\u201c6 am-5 pm\u201d, coupon=\u201cBOGO lattes after 9 am\u201d>. The names or keys in this format may be organized into categories based on the location (e.g., restaurants, shopping, museums, etc.).","Embodiments of the disclosure use the stored associations  to enhance the user experience. For example, the associations  may be provided at  to the user  in the form of a user profile. Additionally, the associations  may be used to generate content recommendations at . In some embodiments, use of the associations  is triggered based on time and\/or a present location of the user . Continuing the example above, if the user  is near 2411 Main Street and the time is 9:15 am, embodiments of the disclosure present the BOGO offer to the user .","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a computing device  having computer-executable components for inferring location-specific user context from user data . The computing device  implements functionality from one or more of the following: data collection , image, audio, video, and\/or text analysis , and location data mining  from . The computing device  includes at least a memory area  and a processor . In , the memory area  is within the computing device . However, the memory area  or any of the data stored thereon may be associated with any server or other computer, local or remote from the computing device  (e.g., accessible via a network). For example, the memory area  may be implemented as cloud storage.","The memory area , or other computer-readable media, stores user data  for one or more users . The user data  includes, for example, the user activities  and\/or user communications  as illustrated in .","The memory area  further stores computer-executable components for implementing aspects of the disclosure. Exemplary components include a collection component , a parser component , a mining component , a memory component , and a crowd component . The collection component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to receive the user data  for the users  from one or more computing devices such as devices  from . The parser component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to identify the location keywords associated with the user data  received by the collection component . In some embodiments, the location keywords include or correspond to one or more locations (e.g., stores, restaurants, street addresses, landmarks, and the like).","The mining component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to obtain location data for the locations corresponding to the location keywords identified by the parser component . As described herein, the location data includes any data describing the locations or providing additional information about the locations. The memory component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to associate the location data obtained by the mining component  and the location keywords identified by the parser component  with the users . For each of the users , the associated location data defines user context for that user  for the respective location.","While the user context is separately defined for each of the users  in some embodiments, other embodiments contemplate the calculation or determination of context for locations based on the location data associated with a plurality of the users  (e.g., a social group). The users  may belong to multiple social groups, and may want to project different persons in the various groups. In such embodiments, the location data mining  is extended to recognize group activities and group communications, and maintain social group affiliations for the users .","In an example in which the location is a coffee house, embodiments of the disclosure may analyze the location data for the plurality of the users  to identify the most popular coffee drink ordered at the coffee house. Such information represents location-specific context for the plurality of users , and may be added to one or more of the contexts for particular users . For example, a tag identifying the determined most popular coffee drink may be added to the user context for users  who opt in to receive such updates to their location-specific contexts. As another example, the determined most popular coffee drink may be identified to the coffee house as part of a service providing market data to companies. The companies can use the market data for marketing, advertising, and other business management and development reasons.","Additional calculations or determinations may be performed on the location data or associations  among the users  and the corresponding location data. For example, in some embodiments, temporal metrics may be calculated between trigger events such as entering a queue for an attraction, leaving the queue, and exiting from the attraction. Exemplary metrics include, but are not limited to, time spent at the locations, a wait time for an attraction, a wait time for a restaurant, and a frequency of visits to the locations.","Further, the metrics may be used to identify or update points of interest for one of the users  or common to a plurality of the users  providing the user data . For example, if the user  spends a particular threshold amount of time in an unknown location and frequents the unknown location often, that metric acts as a trigger for embodiments of the disclosure to conduct deeper searches of available data sources  to create a point of interest for the unknown location. In some embodiments, the user  is prompted to manually enter semantic location data for the unknown location, or help capture location data using a camera or other recording devices.","In another example, the crowd component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to analyze the user context defined by the memory component  to identify points of interest for the plurality of users . The points of interest describe locations in a way that has meaning for a particular group of users  whose activities and\/or communications enabled identification of the points of interest. As an example, if some of the users  meet at a particular location to discuss books, the name of the location may be CoffeeHouse but the point of interest derived from the activities and communications of the users  is \u201cBook Club Meeting.\u201d Referred to as heat maps or flash crowd triggers, embodiments of the disclosure also count and analyze user search, pointing, scanning, photo shooting, image recognition, commerce transaction, price comparison events, and the like to detect new points of interest. The points of interest are created and updated on an ongoing basis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) responsive to the received user activities  and\/or user communications  to detect deviations or other changes. When changes are detected, aspects of the disclosure conduct searches of the data sources  to update the location semantics . Alternatively or in addition, a quantity of the users  associated with the changed point of interest are selected (e.g., via a survey with random or targeted sampling) and prompted to confirm the changes and to assist in updating the location semantics .","In some embodiments, the mining component  is limited by one or more of the following: geospatial restrictions, social graph restrictions, temporal restrictions, activity restrictions, and statistical sampling. Exemplary geospatial restrictions include, but are not limited to, the most frequently visited places, locations with commercial activities, and user-defined location\/place collections. Exemplary social graph restrictions include, but are not limited to, contacts, first and second-degree connections, and commercial transactions or communication counterparts. Exemplary temporal restrictions include, but are not limited to, calendar events, non-recurrent events, work or non-work hours, and commute busy hours. Exemplary activity restrictions include, but are not limited to, product and information searches, purchasing, and business meetings.","The processor  includes any quantity of processing units, and is programmed to execute computer-executable instructions for implementing aspects of the disclosure. The instructions may be performed by the processor  or by multiple processors executing within the computing device , or performed by a processor external to the computing device  (e.g., by a cloud service). In some embodiments, the processor  is programmed to execute instructions such as those illustrated in the figures (e.g., ).","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates the collection and analysis of user data  to infer user context for a location. If user data  is received at  from computing device such as devices  (e.g., data relating to the user activities  and\/or user communications ), the user data  is analyzed at  to identify keywords associated with the user data . For example, a text analysis, image analysis, and\/or audio analysis are performed on the user data . In some embodiments, nouns and verbs of the activities are identified from the user data . For example, if the user data  include a calendar event such as \u201ceat dinner at Sushi Place with Amy,\u201d the words \u201ceat,\u201d \u201cdinner,\u201d \u201cSushi Place,\u201d and \u201cAmy\u201d are selected as keywords. In another example, if the user data  includes an instant message such as \u201cbabysitting Jonathan at country club by swimming pool,\u201d the words \u201cbabysitting,\u201d \u201cJonathan,\u201d \u201ccountry club,\u201d and \u201cswimming pool\u201d are selected as keywords. The keywords include location keywords that correspond to locations (e.g., \u201cSushi Place,\u201d \u201ccountry club,\u201d \u201cswimming pool\u201d).","The identified keywords act as triggers to obtain location data at . The location data represents location-specific knowledge. Embodiments of the disclosure may obtain a uniform resource locator (URL) of a web site of one of the location keywords, and then extract from the web site additional information about the location. From the examples above, the location data obtained for \u201cSushi Place\u201d may include the restaurant type, rating, pricing, menu, hours of operation, and directions listed on the \u201cSushi Place\u201d web site. Further, the location data obtained for \u201cbabysitting\u201d may include a list of babysitting opportunities posted on the country club web site.","One or more tags or other semantic artifacts may be created to store the obtained location data. One or more associations  are defined at  among the users  corresponding to the user data , the identified location keywords, and the obtained location data (e.g., the tags). The defined associations  are stored in the memory area  at  as location-specific and user-specific context.","The stored associations  may be used for many purposes. For example, as one of the users  approaches or enters a location, embodiments of the invention search for that location in the stored associations  for the user . For example, the location keywords in the stored associations  may be searched to find a matching association. If there is an association  for that location, the location data, or a portion thereof, from the association  is obtained and provided to the user  in some form. For example, the location data may be provided to the user  for display, or a product or service may be selected based on the location data. The selected product or service is presented to the user  when the user  enters the location, or while the user  remains in the location. Alternatively or in addition, a user interface is created or modified based on at least a portion of the location data from the matched association. The user interface is provided to the user , for example, as the user  enters the location, while the user  is at the location, or as the user  leaves the location.","For example, as the user  approaches a coffee house, the associations  are searched to identify the association  corresponding to the coffee house location. If found, the association  is parsed to extract one or more items of the location data. For example, a list of recently ordered coffee drinks may be extracted from the association. The extracted information is provided to the user  as the user  enters the coffee house. In this example, the list of recently ordered coffee drinks had been stored in the association  previously (e.g., after the immediate previous visit by the user  to the coffee house).","Exemplary Operating Environment","By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media store information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","Although described in connection with an exemplary computing system environment, embodiments of the invention are operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with aspects of the invention include, but are not limited to, mobile computing devices, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, gaming consoles, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, mobile telephones, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","Embodiments of the invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices. The computer-executable instructions may be organized into one or more computer-executable components or modules. Generally, program modules include, but are not limited to, routines, programs, objects, components, and data structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.
