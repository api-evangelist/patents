{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application relates in general to management of electronic information, and in particular, to a system and method for triaging of information feeds.","Information overload is a growing concern as the amount of information sources available and received electronically, for example, through the Internet has exponentially gown. People face the challenge of keeping track of numerous streams of information from a variety of sources, such as email messages from work colleagues and friends, news stories, status updates from networking sites, and changes to shared electronic files, such as documents in content management systems. Each of the information sources can require visiting a different Web site or tool, including input of a separate username and password to access each source.","Really Simple Syndication (RSS) was developed as a way to avoid the time and effort needed to manually visit each information source individually. RSS is Web-based format for publishing content and allows feed reader applications to gather information published using RSS from a variety of sources and to present the information to a user for monitoring and review. The feed reader application regularly collects information updates from sources, or feeds, subscribed to by the user of the feed reader. Unfortunately, subscribing even to a few feeds can quickly lead to feed overload. Reviewing hundreds or thousands of feed items can be daunting and identifying any feed items of particular interest to the user can be lost in the noise.","Conventional feed readers, such as Google Reader and FriendFeed, allow users to narrow the amount of feed items to review by showing only the feeds of particular people or from particular sources, but not in combination. Another approach, suggested by Marian D\u00f6rk, et al., in VisGets: Coordinated Visualizations for Web-based Information Exploration and Discover, IEEE Trans. on Visualization and Computer Graphics (Vol. 14, No. 6, 1205-1212, 2008), organizes feeds along three dimensions, time, location, and tags within a faceted browser interface. However, the approach assumes that the time, location, and tag information are already associated with the feed item, while, practically, many feed items do not include tag data about the content of the feed item.","Accordingly, there is a need for management of information feeds which includes identifying topics from the content of the information feeds.","Facet information is extracted from information feeds, which is then displayed as facets in a user interface, such as a Web browser. Facet information, such as creator, source, topic, and time can be identified directly from content of the information feed or information related to the feed. A user can select one or more selectable elements in the facets to filter out a portion of the information feeds. The facets are dynamically updated based on the remaining, or unfiltered, feeds.","An embodiment provides a system and method for triaging of information feeds. A plurality of information feeds are received. At least one topic is identified from each information feed. At least one topic is presented to a user in topic facet including a plurality of identified topics. A selection of one of the plurality of topics is received from the user. The user interface is updated to display only the feeds that contain the selected topic.","Still other embodiments of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein is described embodiments of the invention by way of illustrating the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.","Information overload can lead to unmanageable or difficult to find content of interest to a user. Management of information feeds through faceted browsing can lead to more efficient review and location of content as well as encouraging serendipitous discovery of information. Information feeds can be managed through dynamically updated facets in a user interface.  is a block diagram  showing a system for triaging of information feeds, in accordance with one embodiment. A digital data communications network , such as the Internet, provides an infrastructure for exchange of digital information. Other digital information exchange infrastructures, for instance, a non-public corporate enterprise network, are possible. The network  provides interconnectivity to diverse and distributed information sources and users that respectively supply and consume the digital information. Users continually post articles, Web pages, send emails, and the like to the network , which are maintained as a distributed data corpus through one or more source servers , feed aggregator servers , triage servers , and other data repositories that serve as information sources. These sources respectively serve feed items , , , and other information to users that access the network  through user devices , , . User devices can include desktop personal computers , laptop personal computers , and handheld devices, such as mobile telephones and mobile Internet devices .","In general, each user device , ,  is a Web-enabled device that executes a Web browser or similar application, which supports interfacing to and information exchange and retrieval with the servers , , . Both the user devices , ,  and servers , ,  include components conventionally found in general purpose programmable computing devices, such as a central processing unit, memory, input\/output ports, network interfaces, and non-volatile storage, although other components are possible. The devices , , , , ,  can include one or modules for carrying out the embodiments disclosed herein.","The modules can be implemented as a computer program or procedure written as source code in a conventional programming language and presented for execution by the central processing unit as object or byte code. Alternatively, the modules could also be implemented in hardware, either as integrated circuitry or burned into read-only memory components. The various implementations of the source code and object and byte codes can be held on a computer-readable storage medium, such as a floppy disk, hard drive, digital video disk (DVD), random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM) and similar storage mediums. Other types of modules and module functions are possible, as well as other physical hardware components. Moreover, other information sources in lieu of or in addition to the servers , , , and other information consumers, in lieu of or in addition to user devices , , , are possible.","Feed items , ,  are created by users or automatically generated, and can include emails, news content, status updates from networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and notifications of changes to electronic files, such as documents in content management systems. Other types of feed items are possible. Feed items can be received directly on user devices , ,  for user review via a user interface from a source server  or feed items from many sources'can be aggregated, cached, and accessed by user devices , ,  from other servers , .","Information is extracted from the feed items , ,  and used to populate facets in a browser as user selectable elements. The extracted information can include information regarding the creator, source, time, and topics of the feed items , , . The facets and feed items are displayed to the user for review and manipulation. The user can select one or more of the elements to filter, or winnow, the feed items , ,  displayed down to the selected elements, as further discussed below beginning with .","Information feeds can be filtered based on one or more facets extracted from the feeds.  is a flow diagram  showing a method for triaging of information feeds, in accordance with one embodiment. Information feeds are received (block ) from feed sources. The feeds can be received from a feed aggregator , for example, through the FriendFeed application programming interface (API), or directly from the feed sources  and organized for presentation in the user interface. Other ways of aggregating feeds are possible.","Facet information is extracted from the information feeds (block ). Facet information can include, for example, username of the creator of the information feed item, source that the feed item was received from, the time the feed item was created, and topics contained in the feed item. Other types of facet information are possible. In one embodiment, creator, source, and time information are extracted directly from the feed item, while topic information is determined from the content of the feed item.","Topics can be determined in a number of ways. In one embodiment, a part-of-speech tagger, such as the Stanford tagger, available at http:\/\/nlp.stanford.edu\/software\/tagger.shtml, can be used to identify nouns and noun phrases appearing in the content of each feed item. The number of occurrences of each noun and noun phrase across all feed items is aggregated, with the top n nouns and noun phrases appearing are displayed as topics in the topic facet. Some feed items include a selectable link, such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). In a further embodiment, the part-of-speech tagger is run on the content located at the linked URL as well. The nouns in the content located at the linked URL are then aggregated with the nouns identified directly from the content of the feed items and the topic facet is generated as discussed.","The topic or topics of a feed item may not be included as a noun or noun phrase in the content of the feed item. In a still further embodiment, topics of feed items can be determined from content related to the feed item, as discussed further below with reference to  and such as described in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Application, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Identifying Topics for Short Text Communications,\u201d Ser. No. 12\/646,810, filed Dec. 23, 2009, pending, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. In yet another embodiment, any metadata tag information associated with the feed items can be used to generate topics either directly or added to the calculation of the top n nouns and noun phrases in the feed items.","The extracted facet information is then populated into the user interface as selectable elements along with the information feeds (block ). A user selection of an element of a facet is received (block ) and the facets and information feeds are updated in response to the selection (block ), as discussed further below beginning with . Selection includes both selection and deselection of an element.","In one embodiment, topics for feed items can be identified using related content identified through a search query.  is a flow diagram  showing a method for identifying topics for feed items via related content, for use with the method of . Tokens, such as nouns, noun phrases, and root stems can be identified and extracted from the content of a feed item (block ). Other tokens are possible. In one embodiment, the tokens can be identified by using a part-of-speech tagger. For example, a feed item, such as a tweet from Twitter, includes the message \u201cawesome article on some SIGGRAPH user interface work: http:\/\/bit.ly\/30MJY\u201d. The nouns \u201carticle,\u201d \u201cSIGGRAPH,\u201d \u201cuser interface,\u201d and \u201cwork\u201d are identified by the tagger. Other methods for identifying the nouns are possible. Additionally, grammar specifically related to a source of the feed item is analyzed. On Twitter, for example, abbreviations, such as \u201cRT\u201d for re-tweet can be removed, while \u201c@ noun\u201d can be converted into a proper noun. Other examples are possible.","The extracted noun phrases can then be used to form a search query for applying to a set of documents (block ). The set of documents can include Web-based documents, or remotely or locally stored electronic documents. The search query can be executed through known search engines, such as Yahoo or Google, as well as through internal search engines. In one embodiment, all the identified tokens can be used for the query, while, in a further embodiment, a subset of the tokens can be selected, such as by a search engine, for generating the query. Other processes for identifying the subset of tokens are possible. The search query is generated by concatenating the tokens, which are sent to the search engine. Prior to conducting a search, the search engine can perform query transformation, rewording, or dropping of terms from the search query to provide results that are more closely related to the feed item.","The documents that match one or more tokens of the search query are identified as search results (block ). The number of documents returned can based on a result threshold, which is determined automatically or designated by a user. The result threshold can include an absolute number, percentage, rank, score, or relevancy, as well as a combination of the thresholds. Other measures for determining the search results are possible. Alternatively, each of the search results must match all of the nouns in the query. Returning to the previous example, a result threshold of ten documents is applied with the search query to identify the search results. Thus, at a maximum, ten search results can be returned. The search results selected can be those documents that are the most relevant to the feed item, which can be indicated by high rank, score, or percentage of similarity with the tokens.","Once obtained, salient terms are identified for each search result (block ). The search results can each be returned with a list of predetermined salient terms or alternatively, the salient terms can be subsequently identified using term frequency-inverse documents frequency (\u201ctf-idf\u201d). One or more salient terms are identified for each search result. If tf-idf is applied, the terms appearing in the search result with the highest tf-idf values can be selected as the salient terms.","A topic threshold is applied (block ) to the salient terms for all the search results to identify one or more topics (block ) based on the salient terms. The identified topics can include nouns originally identified in the feed item or salient terms identified in the related documents, but not the feed item.","In one embodiment, the topic threshold includes a majority-voting scheme in which each salient term is assigned votes and those salient terms that satisfy the threshold are designated as topics. Returning to the previous example, the topic threshold for identifying salient terms as topics is five or more votes. The ten search results are obtained along with the associated salient terms.","Each of the salient terms is assigned a voting score based on the number of search results in which the salient term is located. More specifically, a salient term is assigned one vote for each document that includes the term. For example, the salient term \u201ccomputer graphics\u201d appears in five search results. Accordingly, a voting score of five is assigned to the term \u201ccomputer graphics.\u201d Since the five votes satisfies the topic threshold, the salient term \u201ccomputer graphics\u201d is identified as a topic for the feed item. The salient terms that do not satisfy the threshold can be stored as suggestions for topics.","In a further embodiment, different topic thresholds can be applied to salient terms that appear in the feed item and salient terms that are absent from the content of the feed item. A salient term identified can be verbatim to a noun in the feed item or can be a root stem of a noun in the feed item. More specifically, the topic threshold can be lower or more relaxed for the verbatim salient terms. Returning to the previous example, the topic threshold for salient terms not identified in the feed item is five or more votes, while the topic threshold for verbatim salient terms is three or more votes. Other topic threshold measures are possible. The salient term \u201cSIGGRAPH\u201d is located in the content of the feed item and thus, the verbatim topic threshold is applied. \u201cSIGGRAPH\u201d is identified in four search results. A voting score of four is assigned to the salient term \u201cSIGGRAPH,\u201d which satisfies the threshold of three documents. Accordingly, \u201cSIGGRAPH\u201d is designated as a topic for the feed item.","At times, the search query may not return any related documents as search results. When no search results are returned, the search query can be modified. Terms in the query that are popular are removed and the modified query is again applied to find a set of documents.","Large number of feeds can be difficult to manage and may prevent a user from quickly finding a desired feed item. The user can manage the feeds by creator, source, topic, or time using a faceted browser for filtering feed items and locating items of particular interest. The embodiments disclosed herein apply to all feed items received by a user or a subset of all feed items, such as only read or unread feed items, or only feed items received within a certain time frame. Such choices can be automated, preset, or user selectable options.  is a screen shot diagram  showing, by way of example, a user interface  for triaging of information feeds. User interface  can be implemented in a Web-based form, such as in a Web browser, or any other type of software interface. The user interface  includes an information stream feed list  and one or more user-interactive facets , , ,  to filter the feed list  down to a desired subset. Facets , , ,  are used to organize the feed list  using information extracted from the feed list , and can include a creator facet , source facet , topic facet , and time facet . Other facets are possible.","In one embodiment, feed items  are displayed in reverse chronological order in the right half and the facets , , ,  are displayed in the left half of the user interface . Each of the facets , , ,  is represented by user selectable elements, which can be associated with the number of feeds that are related to each user selectable element. The elements are individually selectable. Selection applies to both selection and deselection of the elements. User selection of an element filters out, or otherwise removes or \u201cfades\u201d, all the feed items from the feed list  that do not match the selected element. Deselection of a previously selected element removes the filter applied based on the previous selection. The selection\/deselection state of an element can be shown in other ways, such as differences in size, text, and color. Additionally, the facets , , ,  are updated accordingly. In one embodiment, the default setting is that no elements are filtered out and all feed items are displayed in the feed list . In a further embodiment, one or more elements are automatically pre-filtered out by system default or by the user.","The creator facet  can include an icon -representative of the creator of a feed item, which can be an individual, corporate entity, or other creator. The number adjacent to the icon -indicates the number of feed items that specific creator has contributed to the feed list . User selection of one of the icons, , dynamically updates the feed list  and facets , , ,  to filter the feed items to only those produced by creator represented by the selected icon , as discussed further below with reference to . Additionally, facets can include buttons , , or other selectable element, to select or deselect all of the elements in the facet.","The source facet  contains a list of sources of where the feed items in the feed list  were created or delivered from, for example Facebook or del.icio.us. One creator can supply feeds from more than one source and more than one creator can supply feeds from the same source. Selection of a source in the source facet  removes all the feed items from other sources from the feed list  and updates the facets , , ,  accordingly, as further described below with reference to .","The topic facet  provides an overview of the content of the feed items. A predetermined number, of the topics identified from the feed items are displayed in the topic facet . The topics can be displayed, for example, as a list or tag cloud . Other types of topic display are possible. Each of the topics in the topic facet  is user selectable. Selecting a topic filters the feed items to display only the subset of feed items that contain the selected topic in the feed list , as further described below with reference to . The topics are generated from the content of the feed items, as further described above with reference to . The topic facet  is dynamically updated and displays the topics determined from the remaining feed items and is generated in the same manner. The number of topics displayed depends on the predetermined number as previously discussed. Additional selection of topics further filters the feed items displayed. Selection of more than one topic can function either as an OR query, displaying feed items containing any of the selected topics, or an AND query, requiring all selected topics to be in the feed item for the item to be displayed. The other facets , ,  are updated accordingly.","The time facet  aggregates and displays information about when the feed items were created. The user can select controls in the time facet  and view the feed items at a year, month, or day level. Other time periods are possible. Additionally, the user can choose to view all feed items. The controls in the time facet  also display the number of feed items associated with each time frame. The time information can be displayed as a bar graph, chronological list, or in another format. Selection by clicking a bar in the bar graph displays a more detailed view of the selection, for example, clicking a month will display a bar graph showing the days of the month and the number of feed items produced on each day. Further, a user selection of a particular time period filters out all feed items not created in that time period and only the feed items in that time period are displayed in the feed list .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","402","406","414","404","404","414","414","402"],"i":["b","b ","b"]},"Combinations of selections from different facets add further filtering granularity.  is a screen shot diagram  showing, by way of example, the user interface of  using the source facet . Selecting a source filters all other feed items from the feed list  and displays only the feed items from the selected source. Selecting more than one source in the source facet  by the user displays feed items from each of the selected sources.","As shown in , selecting a source in combination with a selected creator, displays the feed items from the selected creator and source. For example, a previous user selection of creator \u201cKoozda\u201d, as described further above with reference to , is combined with the source \u201cdelicious\u201d , which is highlighted in the source facet . All other feed items are filtered from the feed list . Additionally, the facets , , ,  have been updated to reflect the additional selection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIGS. 2 and 3"],"b":["700","410","410","404","410","406","408","412","406","408","412","406","408","410","412","410"]},"While the invention has been particularly shown and described as referenced to the embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will understand that the foregoing and other changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
