The application server  supports retail analytic and operational applications, such as Teradata Corporation's Teradata Solutions for Retail suite of retail business applications, illustrated in .","The Teradata Solutions for Retail suite of retail business applications comprises several analytic applications built on a common data model , leveraging a single source of data  across all departments. The application suite includes the following application members: Assortment Analysis , Promotion Analysis , Customer Analysis , Store Analysis  and E-Commerce Analysis .","Assortment Analysis (). The Assortment Analysis application is the foundation for basic sales and inventory reporting; monitoring of sales trends by geography, product and product trait. Beyond basic reporting, functionality includes assortment planning and allocation analysis; additional view of seasonal planning and additional detail on vendor performance measures. Also provides advanced analysis of assortment based on customer segment preferences using analysis of market basket and customer data.","Assortment Analysis integrates planning processes that occur before and during the selling season resulting in tailored merchandise assortment, pricing and promotional support for unique markets and individual stores. The Assortment Management Analysis provides a diverse set of business analyses and reports (views) that will assist a merchant in arriving at better informed decisions regarding the management of his\/her product assortments to the store level.","The Assortment Analysis application consists of three application modules:\n\n","Promotion Analysis (). The Promotional Analysis application enables a retailer to analyze \u201cLift\u201d by product, brand, or vendor, inventory effectiveness, Seasonal\/Regional Demand Patterns and Price Point Analysis.","The Promotion Analysis application is designed to more effectively analyze, plan and target your promotions based on item, store and customer data. By allowing for key sales and inventory performance measurements such as \u201csell thru\u201d, ending on hand stock, and sales to be combined and presented over various dimensional perspectives, one is provided with more accurate information regarding a promotion's effectiveness.","The Promotion Analysis application consists of two application modules:\n\n","Customer Analysis (). The Customer Analysis application provides critical insight into a retailer's customer base via ranking, deciling, RFM analysis, demographic segmentation, and defining purchase behavior.","The Customer Analysis application consists of a Customer Purchase Analysis application module  that provides critical insight into customer base via ranking, deciling, RFM analysis, demographic segmentation, and defining purchase behavior. The Customer Purchase Analysis application module provides analysis and information concerning: targeted customer promotions; optimum promotional item assortment; promotional effectiveness; and enhanced cross merchandising strategies.","Store Analysis (). The Store Analysis application provides analysis of store sales, labor, controllable expenses and variances.","The Store Analysis application consists of a Store Operations Analysis application module  that provides analysis of store sales, labor, controllable expenses and variances so as to provide a deeper understanding of costs, resources, traffic and productivity. The Store Operations Analysis application module provides analysis and information concerning: location sales; labor allocation policies; variable cost control; and resource (time) allocation.","E-Commerce Analysis (). The E-Commerce Analysis application provides analysis of customer interactions, ad effectiveness, preference profiling, and cross-channel effectiveness.","The E-Commerce Analysis application provides a better understanding of the customer and their interaction with the e-Storefront: including customer, purchase, promotion, and media analysis. The E-Commerce Analysis application consists of three application modules:\n\n","A logical data model is a graphical representation of the way data is organized in a data warehouse environment. The logical data model specifically defines which individual data elements can be stored and how they relate to one another to provide a model of the business information. The data model ultimately defines which business questions can be answered from the data warehouse and thus determines the business value of the entire decision support system.","A properly designed LDM for a retail industry provides a foundation for more effective sales, marketing, and operations management and supports the customer relationship management (CRM) requirements related to identifying, acquiring, retaining and growing valuable customers. A logical data model for the retail industry reflects the operating principles and policies of the retail industry and provides the underlying structure for the data imported into the data warehouse","A logical data model provides an architecture for the information that will be included in a data warehouse. The database provides the physical realization of that architecture in a form that can be efficiently maintained and used. There may well be some differences between the logical data model and the final database design. The database may include some tables (summary tables, etc.) or columns that have no direct correlation in the logical data model. Elements in the logical model may be grouped differently in the physical database.","A logical data model is organized by Subject Areas, each comprised of numerous Entities, Attributes and Relationships. The data model hierarchy includes one or more Subject Areas. Each Subject Area includes one or more Entities or Tables, each having Attributes and Relationships. Each Attribute describes a fact about an Entity. Relationships between two or more Entities are further defined by Cardinality. The Relationships define which entities are connected to other entities and the cardinality of the relationships. Each of these elements will be described in greater detail below.","A subject area is a subset of objects taken from the universe of data objects for a particular line of business or industry that focus on a particular Business Process. Typically, a subject area is created to help manage large data architectures that may encompass multiple business processes or business subjects. This is the highest-level data concept within a conceptual entity\/relationship (E\/R) model. Working with subject areas is especially useful when designing and maintaining a large or complex data model. Dividing the enterprise into several distinct subject areas allows different groups within an organization to concentrate on the processes and functions pertinent to their business area.","An Entity represents a person, place, thing, concept, or event (e.g. PARTY, ACCOUNT, INVOICE, etc.). It represents something for which the business has the means and the will to collect and store data. An Entity must have distinguishable occurrences, e.g., one must be able to uniquely identify each occurrence of an entity with a primary key (e.g. Party Identifier, Account Identifier, Invoice Number, etc.). An Entity is typically named with a unique singular noun or noun phrase (e.g., PARTY, BILLING STATEMENT, etc.) that describes one occurrence of the Entity and cannot be used for any other Entity. It should be exclusive of every other Entity in the database. An Entity cannot appear more than once in the conceptual entity\/relationship (E\/R) model. Each Entity may have relationships to other Entities residing in its own Subject Area or in other Subject Areas.","An Attribute is a data fact about an Entity or Relationship. It is a logical (not physical) construct. It is data in its atomic form. In other words, it is the lowest level of information that still has business meaning without further decomposition. An example would be FIRST NAME, or LAST NAME. An example of an invalid attribute would be PERSON NAME if it includes both the first and last names, as this could be further decomposed into the separate, definable (first name, last name) data facts.","A Relationship is an association that links occurrences of one or more Entities. A Relationship must connect at least one Entity. If only one Entity is connected, the Relationship is said to be Recursive. A Relationship is described by a noun or passive verb or verb phase that describes the action taken in the Relationship. A Relationship represent a static state of being between the occurrences of the Entities it connects. Relationships are not intended to represent processes or data flows. They cannot be linked to another Relationships. They may optionally represent future, present, and\/or past relatedness. The time frame must be explicitly defined in the data definition. Relationships may contain attributes. In a normalized model, a Relationship containing Attributes will result in the creation of an Entity.","In order for a data model to be considered accurate, it must contain both the maximum and minimum number of Entity occurrences expected. This is controlled by rules of cardinality, which describes a relationship between two Entities based on how many occurrences of one Entity type may exist relative to the occurrence of the other Entity. Typically, it is a ratio, commonly depicted as a one-to-one (1:1); one-to-many (1:N); and many-to-many (M:N) relationship.","The maximum cardinality may be an infinite number or a fixed number but never zero. The minimum cardinality may be zero, or some other positive number, but it must be less than or equal to the maximum cardinality for the same relationship.","The logical data model for the E-Business will now be described in more detail.

To effectively view and understand the data model, the data tables have been logically organized into smaller groups called subject areas. Each subject area is comprised of a set of tables that contain information relevant to a particular entity. In addition, the subject areas address particular business questions.","The Retail Logical Data Model is presented in the Conceptual View illustrated in . This view provides an overall high-level understanding of the major entities and how they relate to each other. The Conceptual View was derived directly from the Retail Logical Data Model by selecting the most important entities from every subject area, being sure that at least one entity from each subject area was selected, and distilling the relationships among the selected entities, while still maintaining the general nature of the way the entities relate to each other. During this process, some intervening entities were abstracted into relationships. Many-to-many relationships were used where appropriate. The result is a simple, easy to understand diagram that conveys the general content of the underlying logical data model.","Subject Area Views, such as the QUALITY FEEDBACK subject area view illustrated in , show small (but highly detailed) subsets of the model. Subject areas are collections of entities about business information objects or concepts that are closely related. The sum total of all subject areas equals the rLDM. For ease of use and understanding, the Retail Logical Data Model has been divided into the following fifty-six (56) subject areas, titled:\n\n","Details about each of these subject areas follow.","The ADDRESS subject area, represented by ADDRESS entity  in the conceptual model of , is used to capture all ADDRESS information that can be used for communications and physical addressing. Each unique occurrence of an ADDRESS may represent a physical MAILING ADDRESS (e.g., street, post office box), a TELEPHONE ADDRESS (e.g., voice or fax number), or an ELECTRONIC ADDRESS (e.g., e-mail, ftp, or URL). Internet Protocol addresses are modeled separately in the entity IP ADDRESS within the WEB VISIT subject area.","The AGREEMENT subject area, represented by AGREEMENT entity , defines the specific terms and conditions between Parties. This subject area is used to track the specific agreements made relating to pricing, as well as the specific terms and conditions associated with the sale, payment and\/or delivery of products and\/or services between Parties, in a quantitative manner, so that analysis can be better performed to determine performance compliancy.","The ASSOCIATE LABOR subject area, represented by ASSOCIATE LABOR entity  in , defines key business characteristics of an ASSOCIATE, sometimes referred to as an \u201cemployee\u201d who, as an individual, is part of the internal organization of the Enterprise. The key emphasis of the ASSOCIATE LABOR subject area is to track the critical information necessary to understand, analyze and make better decisions regarding an Enterprise's labor costs and related labor expenses, as they relate to each ASSOCIATE.","This section models both the forecasted, or planned, labor for each location (stores, distribution and call centers, etc.) in cost amounts and hours (including overtime) and the schedule of work for each Associate. A history of expenses related to associate labor and benefits is provided to aid in comparison analyses.","The CATALOG subject area, represented by entity  in , is used to describe the content and usage of catalogs by an enterprise. The intent is to accommodate the typical printed catalog that is mass-mailed to a targeted\/segmented group of potential customers. This Subject Area allows tracking of the success of a specific catalog or mailing, since it is related to the SALES (INTERNAL) Subject Area, indicating which sales were made from which catalog mailed to what target group.","Although targeted mainly at enterprises doing conventional catalog\/mail order business, this section can be adapted for usage to also describe promotional flyers, and other printed offerings if required.","The pages of a Catalog may be either printed for mailing and physical distribution or may be \u201cvirtual\u201d pages placed on a web site. Additional features are available on web sites such as keyword search and automated orders. This type of customer interaction is captured in the WEB VISIT subject area.","The DEMOGRAPHICS subject area is represented in  by DEMOGRAPHIC entity , MARKET GROUP entity  and MARKET SEGMENT entity . The DEMOGRAPHICS subject area contains information obtained (purchased\/leased) from external sources. Its primary usage is for the creation of SEGMENTs (groups of PARTYs sharing common characteristics) for marketing purposes.","MARKET GROUPs record third party aggregated sales data, such as that purchased from Nielson or IRI, for example. Information about these groups (e.g., supermarket, category discounter, drug store, etc.) is typically purchased and often used by the Enterprise to measure its performance in the marketplace. Market Groups may also be associated with various DEMOGRAPHICs.","MARKET SEGMENTs are groups of PARTYs targeted by the Enterprise for marketing and\/or analysis (and may be formed via algorithmic modeling or forecasting\u2014See MODEL SCORE & FORECAST Subject Area). These segments are also related to DEMOGRAPHICs to enhance and support analysis and targeted sales campaigns (See PROMOTION Subject Area).","The twenty-three Financial Management (FM) subject areas; FM.AP AR PA INVOICE, FM.AP INVOICE, FM.AP PAYMENT, FM.AR INVOICE, FM.AR PAYMENT AND COLLECTION, FM.FA FIXED ASSET, FM.GL.ASSET ACCOUNT, FM.GL.EQUITY ACCOUNT, FM.GL.EXPENSE ACCOUNT, FM.GL.GENERAL LEDGER ACCOUNT, FM.GL.CHART OF ACCOUNT BALANCE, FM.GL.PRODUCT SEGMENT, FM.GL.PROJECT SEGMENT, FM.GL.SUB ACCOUNT, FM.GL.JOURNAL ENTRY, FM.GL.LIABILITY ACCOUNT, FM.GL.REVENUE ACCOUNT, FM.PA PROJECT, FM.PA PROJECT RESOURCE, FM.PARTY, FM.PO PROCUREMENT, FM.PO PROCUREMENT RECEIPT, FM.PO PROCUREMENT RETURN; are represented by a single entity, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT entity  in .","The FM.AP AR PA INVOICE subject area contains information related to various types of billing documents or Invoices encountered by a business. Invoices are presented to a bill-to-party as a request for payment for goods sold or services rendered. This subject area links the Invoice detail back to the originating business transactions for verification and analytical purposes.","The FM.AP INVOICE subject area describes the details around amounts owed to a supplier for goods and services purchased. The Accounts Payable subledger holds details for these transactions including reimbursable expenses (employee expense reports) and recurring expenses.","The FM.AP PAYMENT subject area holds payment details for AP Invoices. Payments are the partial or complete discharge of the invoice obligation, typically by its settlement in the form of a transfer of funds. Payments may be applied against obligations represented by one or more Invoices.","The FM.AR INVOICE subject area describes the details around amounts billed to customers for goods and services sold. Summary Accounts Receivable amounts as well as sales and revenue amounts from the AR subledger are recorded to the company's General Ledger.","The FM.AR PAYMENT AND COLLECTION subject area describes the details concerning the process of converting Accounts Receivable to Cash. Payments may be received for AR Invoices, as well as interest earned, rents receivable, or periodic products and services provided. Collection activity includes any action a company takes to solicit settlement of AR obligations.","The FM.FA FIXED ASSET subject area holds information needed to track the addition and disposal of the tangible property of the business. This subject area also holds information needed to calculate and record the depreciation of an asset, including term, depreciation methods, accounting cycle, costs and residual values.","The FM.GL.ASSET ACCOUNT subject area contains information concerning enterprise assets. Assets are tangible or intangible property owned by a business, having monetary value (usually at cost or fair market value). These range from cash and investments to real estate such as land, other tangible property such as timber, or enforceable claims against others, etc. For accounting purposes these are usually classified under three groups: Current Assets, Fixed Assets and Other Assets.","The FM.GL.CHART OF ACCOUNT BALANCE subject area contains information concerning an enterprise's Chart of Account Balances. GL Chart of Accounts Balances are actual amounts experienced through some point in time, or budgeted amounts projected for a financial plan. Companies maintain only one record of actual amounts, but may define multiple financial plans and maintain balances for each financial plan instance.","The FM.GL.EQUITY ACCOUNT subject area contains information concerning equity in an enterprise. Equity is the shareholders' stake in any company\/business. From a financial accounting standpoint, Equity is total assets less total liabilities, also referred to as Net Worth.","The FM.GL.EXPENSE ACCOUNT subject area contains information concerning enterprise expenses. Expense is the amount spent by a company in running the business and producing goods or services. Some of the typical expense accounts are OPERATING EXPENSE ACCOUNT, INTEREST EXPENSE ACCOUNT, etc.","The FM.GL.GENERAL LEDGER ACCOUNT subject area contains information concerning an enterprise's General Ledger. The General Ledger is a collection of all accounts used by a business. It is the accounting transaction record, maintained either manually or using computer software, of all the balance sheet and income statement balances of a company or business. Previously as the name suggests, the General Ledger was a collection of books that was used to physically record accounting transactions. Today these transactions are generally recorded and stored by using computer software.","There are five main types of GENERAL LEDGER (GL) ACCOUNTs. They are ASSET ACCOUNT, LIABILITY ACCOUNT, EXPENSE ACCOUNT, REVENUE ACCOUNT and EQUITY ACCOUNT. Each account in turn may have sub-ledgers. For example, ASSET ACCOUNT consists of a group of accounts such as Fixed Asset Account, Current Asset Account, etc. The GL ACCOUNTs are shared by various internal organizations within a business and therefore are associated with other GL Segments in segment groups to track and report financial information.","The FM.GL.JOURNAL ENTRY subject area contains information concerning an enterprise's Journal Entries. Journal Entries record the monetary value of business transactions into GL Accounts as debits or credits. Journal Entries usually include supporting information referencing the transaction events or items affected, such as a vendor invoice, customer invoice, or inventory receipt.","The FM.GL.LIABILITY ACCOUNT subject area contains information concerning liabilities of an enterprise. The liabilities of a company are amounts owed to other parties or organizations representing loans, expenses, or any other form of a legally enforceable claim on the company's assets, excluding owner's equity that calls for the transfer of assets at a determined future date.","The FM.GL.PRODUCT SEGMENT subject area is associated with GL Accounts in segment groups to track and report financial product information.","The FM.GL.PROJECT SEGMENT subject area is associated with GL Accounts in segment groups to track and report financial project information. The GL PROJECT SEGMENT is used to track details of any type of business project activity.","The FM.GL.REVENUE ACCOUNT subject area contains information concerning enterprise revenue. Revenue (sometimes referred to as income) refers to the amount of money earned by a company.","The FM.GL.SUB ACCOUNT subject area is associated with GL Accounts in segment groups to track and report financial transactions for a company.","The FM.PA PROJECT subject area provides more granularity to project financial information than a General Ledger. Project Accounting (PA) focuses on maintaining control over revenues, costs, resources, and assets directly associated with a project.","A project can be any set of related business activities for which a company wishes to track financial information. Project expenses may include associates' time and expense reports, vendor expenses, and capital expenses. Project revenue is generated when project expenses are billable to a customer. PA generates the detailed information needed to create a customer invoice, but the invoice is actually processed through the billing function of Accounts Receivable.","Within PA, budgets by project, resource, task, etc. may be maintained separately from the General Ledger budget. PA supports project reporting by task, resource, vendor, and customer for different currencies and time periods.
