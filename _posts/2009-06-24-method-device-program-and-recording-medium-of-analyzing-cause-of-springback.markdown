Although the invention will be described with reference to a steel plate, the invention may also be applied to other metal plates, plastic plates and linear materials.","Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-329099, filed Dec. 25, 2008, the content of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Many parts of automobiles, such as doors and bumpers, or household appliances, such as refrigerator panels, are press-formed from a steel plate or other metal plates. There is an increasing demand for lightweight press-formed products. Therefore, high-strength steel plates are used to provide thin and lightweight products. High-strength steel plates, however, have greater deformation resistance, which may increase the likelihood of occurrence of springback caused by residual stress during the process of press-forming.","There is a recent trend that a forming process planning for forming products is started at the same time as a design stage of automobiles or the like; in order to reduce development man-hours and manufacturing costs. In order to follow the trend, a configuration of a press-formed product and its forming data are analyzed by a computer. The analysis provides calculation of a springback amount of the press-formed product estimated from the residual stress after the forming. The die configuration is corrected in accordance with the calculated springback amount.","Patent Document 1 and Non Patent Document 1 disclose a method of determining a die configuration by estimating springback as described above. In particular, residual stress in a steel plate pressed in a die at the press bottom dead center is analyzed by a finite element method, and a die having a configuration of deformation (i.e., spring forward) caused by a residual stress toward the direction opposite to the aforementioned residual stress is numerically analyzed. In this manner, a die configuration which addresses the problem of springback can be obtained easily.","However, it is very difficult to design a die through numerical analysis taking the problem of the springback into consideration in a complete manner, because it is a nonlinear problem. The methods in the foregoing documents are proposed only to obtain a simple die which is designed taking a consideration of springback by the finite element method. The documents therefore suggest no countermeasures against a product obtained by press-forming in a die that is outside of the tolerance for springback, which is a phenomenon that is difficult to analyze numerically.","If a formed product which satisfies the tolerance value for the springback cannot be obtained using a die designed considering the springback problem, countermeasures to be undertaken must be determined by experienced technical personnel. Accordingly, there is a need to produce an actual die and to repeatedly modify the die configuration while pressing steel plates in the die.","Another approach to reduce the springback is to modify configurations of steel plates or formed products, not the configuration of the die, to remove residual stress. An exemplary modification method is to provide an opening or a slit in the formed product at an area where springback is occurring.","This approach can reduce residual stress which may otherwise cause springback by undertaking a countermeasure against areas where springback is occurring. However, since cutting or punching may decrease rigidity of the product itself, only slight residual stress tends to cause great springback. For this reason, this approach fails to completely eliminate the springback problem. In addition, such an approach needs tests with an actual test die and a steel plate, which increases man-hours and costs at the design stage.","Patent Documents 2-5 also disclose simulations by the finite element method. The methods disclosed in Patent Documents 2-4 employ partial stress release and modification. In Patent Document 2, however, evaluation is only made with respect to an amount of angle variations, i.e., torsion, before and after springback occurs in parts and thus factors that cause deformation other than torsion are outside of the discussion. In Patent Document 2, all the stress components at release positions during stress release are set to 0. If deformation is large, linear approximation performed with respect to stress gradients produces larger inconsistency between the linear approximation and actual nonlinear transition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["[Patent Document 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Application No. 2003-33828","[Patent Document 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Application No. 2007-229724","[Patent Document 3] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Application No. 2008-49389","[Patent Document 4] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Application No. 2008-55476","[Patent Document 5] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Application No. 2004-148381"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"[Non Patent Document 1] Mitsubishi Motors Corporation technical review (Nov. 18, 2006, pages 126 to 131)"}},"As described above, although the press-forming process and the press-formed product have been analyzed through numerical analysis, it is difficult to accurately specify the cause of springback in a press-formed product at the design stage before conducting actual forming tests.","It is therefore an object of the invention to provide analysis of the cause of springback with which an area of a press-formed product in which springback occurs can be analyzed more accurately than ever before through numerical analysis and thus the time and cost needed to determine a process for a forming product can be reduced.","The invention has the following aspects in order to solve the foregoing problems.","(1) A first aspect of the invention is a method of analyzing a cause of springback, which includes: performing a forming analysis through a numerical simulation based on a forming condition of a plastically formed product so as to calculate forming data of the formed product;

decomposing, over an entire of the formed product, stress data included in the forming data of the formed product into an in-plane stress component and a bending moment component with respect to at least one directional component of directional components of the stress;

and displaying the degree of influence with respect to the springback deformation calculated for each area.","According to the present invention, the cause of springback can be accurately analyzed and the time needed to determine a forming process for a formed product can be reduced.","Further, the present invention provides a springback cause analysis which cannot be performed with actual products. Countermeasures against the springback can be taken by decomposing the problem into small components.","The present invention includes dividing a press-formed product into areas and multiplying, by a coefficient k, at least one directional component of stress in individual decomposition forming data in an area of interest for each of the areas. The coefficient k is preferably in a range of \u22122\u2266k\u2266+2 (including 0). If the coefficient k is 0, calculation is simplified and influence of stress for each area with respect to springback deformation can be evaluated clearly, based on the calculated degree of influence. If the coefficient k is a value close to +1, the degree of influence can be calculated and evaluated with higher accuracy. Evaluation accuracy is improved with the value of the coefficient k close to 1 as compared to the coefficient k close to 0 because a relationship between stress and displacement is practically nonlinear. If deformation is small, there is almost no difference in stress gradients before and after editing with respect to displacement between linear approximation simulation and an actual nonlinear process. In this case, even if calculation is performed with the coefficient k set to 0, the value of the degree of influence of the stress with respect to the springback for each area can be sufficiently accurate for analysis and evaluation. If deformation is large, on the contrary, difference in the stress gradients before and after editing with respect to the displacement becomes large between the linear approximation simulation and an actual nonlinear process. Therefore, the linear approximation may include errors. If the calculation is performed so that a value of stress after editing is close to a value of stress before editing (i.e., if the coefficient k is close to 1), the calculation is performed with the stress gradients before and after the editing with respect to the deformation are close to that of an actual nonlinear process. Accuracy in evaluating values of the degree of influence of the stress with respect to the springback of each area is therefore improved as compared to a case where the coefficient k is 0 (see ). It is especially advantageous to set the coefficient k to be a value close to +1.","Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described referring to analysis of a cause of springback in a product press-formed from a thin plate material.

component (i.e., the deviator stress component) was analyzed with respect to the torsional angle about the X-axis at an end portion of the press-formed product illustrated in  was analyzed. First, individual decomposition forming data which had only the bending moment component was created from the original data. The data was divided into five areas: areas  to  as illustrated in . The degree of influence with respect to the relative torsional angle of all bending moment components in each area was evaluated. The torsional angle about X-axis \u03b8 in the press-formed product of Example 5 is the sum of \u03b81 and \u03b82 illustrated in . The coefficient k herein was 0. In this evaluation, as illustrated in Table 5, the springback amount (i.e., the amount of relative torsion) of the individual decomposition forming data was 4.48 degrees. The springback amount was 3.75 degrees with the moment force component of, for example, the area  being set to zero. The degree of influence was 0.74 degrees which was obtained by multiplying the difference 0.74 degrees by the reciprocal of (1\u2212k), i.e., 1\/(1\u22120)=1. The thus-obtained total influence of the relative torsional angle from the area  to the area  was 4.19 degrees and the error was \u22126.60%.","Evaluation was made with the coefficient k being 0.5 as shown in Table 6. As a result of evaluation, the springback amount obtained by, for example, multiplying the moment component of the area  by 0.5 was 4.09 degrees. The degree of influence was \u22120.78 degrees which was obtained by multiplying \u22120.39 degrees which is the difference from the springback amount of individual decomposition forming data 4.48, by the reciprocal of (1\u2212k), i.e., 1,\/(1\u22120.5)=2.0. The sum of the influence quantities with respect to the torsional angle of each area obtained similarly was 4.40 degrees and the error was reduced from \u22126.60% to \u22121.81%. The result in Table 6 shows that the area  has the largest influence with respect to the occurrence of torsion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0113"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"357pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE
