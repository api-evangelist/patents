A first end user is walking and can receive her content download over a cellular network . Another end user at his desk in his office obtains downloads over a WiFi network  through his company.","As shown in , the content downloaded to the end user  at his desk over the WiFi  is of the highest quality and greatest quantity, as shown as content  on a display  of a mobile communication devices .","As shown in , the content downloaded over the cellular network  to the mobile phone  of the end user  walking down a street is of the lowest quality and lowest quantity.","The mobile resident application  is able to determine whether the wireless network is WiFi or a cellular network using several methods. One method is to query the mobile communication device . The mobile resident application  determines if SSID (Service Set Identification) is utilized or if a MAC address is for a cellular radio or WiFi radio of the mobile communication device . Alternatively, the mobile resident application  determines the download speed (throughput) of the network. The mobile resident application  samples the content download rate, preferably in a continuous manner, to determine the quality and quantity of content to be downloaded to the mobile communication device . The mobile resident application  then directs the content to be downloaded to the mobile communication device  in the most appropriate manner based on the network download rate. For example, the mobile resident application  will determine that a LTE network download rate in the middle of the Las Vegas strip is higher than a DSL download rate at an end-user's home.","As shown in , the level of content delivery over a WiFi network  varies from a medium quality and highest quantity WiFi network download mode, as shown  on a display , to a medium quality and medium quantity WiFi network download mode, to a highest quality and highest quantity WiFi network download mode, as shown  on a display . Those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that other levels of content delivery are possible for WiFi networks without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. Further, if the mobile application determines that the WiFi network is associated with the mobile application (e.g., a casino application that is associated with a casino, and the WiFi network is at the casino), then the download is at the highest possible quality with minimal safeguards since the application recognizes the WiFi network.","As shown in , the level of content delivery over the cellular network  varies from a medium quality and lowest quantity cellular network download mode, to a medium quality and medium quantity cellular network download mode, as shown  on a display , to a lowest quality and lowest quantity cellular network download mode, as shown  on a display .
