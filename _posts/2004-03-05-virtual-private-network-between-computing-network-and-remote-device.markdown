No. 09\/767,465, filed Jan. 22, 2001, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/257,481, filed Dec. 20, 2000; and also this application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/452,248, filed Mar. 5, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","1. The Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to virtual private networks. In particular, the present invention relates to systems and methods for enabling both the exchange of data and the execution of software applications remotely via a virtual private network.","2. The Related Technology","In today's business world, many businesses protect their data from unauthorized access by installing firewalls into their network infrastructure. Typically, a firewall is configured to prevent unidentified users from accessing network data from a remote location. Although firewalls are generally very beneficial for enabling a business to have more control over who accesses its network data, they also have the undesirable consequence of disconnecting mobile professionals from critical and urgent business information when they are away from the office or otherwise unable to gain local access to the network data.","To enable a mobile professional to access business information from a remote location, some businesses have installed virtual private networks (VPNs) between the business and designated remote locations, such as from a professional's home or satellite office. The function of a VPN is to open a secure connection between the business network and a designated remote location through the business firewall. Although beneficial for providing remote access to network data, a VPN requires the installation of expensive hardware and\/or software at the business network and sometimes at the remote location.","In typical VPN arrangements, a user communicates with a business network from a remote location through a VPN tunnel. At each end of the VPN tunnel is a VPN node. At the business network, one of the VPN nodes straddles the business network's firewall. Network data is transmitted through the firewall at the VPN node and through the VPN tunnel to the user. According to the prior art, it is also possible for a remote business to communicate with the business network through a second VPN tunnel between the two VPN nodes.","VPN hardware and software employ encryption technology and other security features at the VPN nodes to ensure that data transmitted through a VPN tunnel is not intercepted and that the user or remote business is authorized to access the business network data. The benefits of a VPN, however, are limited to discrete, remote locations where the appropriate VPN software and\/or hardware is installed. Accordingly, VPNs do not currently provide users with mobile remote access to network data stored behind business firewalls. In particular, a prior art VPN does not readily enable a user to access network data from a telephone while commuting in a moving vehicle, or from various other mobile devices, including pagers, personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d), and laptop computers.","With regard to the aforesaid mobile devices, it is highly desirable in today's mobile society to provide enhanced connectivity between such devices and a remote location, such as a business network at the user's place of employment. Specifically, the ability for such mobile devices to remotely and securely exchange both data and applications with the business network greatly enhances both their utility and value, particularly for mobile professionals and others who spend a significant amount of time away from the office. As already described, typical VPN configurations do not readily enable such mobile remote connectivity.","Further complicating the secure transfer of data between a remote device and the business network is the fact that the remote device and business network may employ respectively differing communication protocols for transmitting data. For example, an e-mail application locally based in a business network may employ the Messaging Application Programming Interface (\u201cMAPI\u201d) protocol for exchanging e-mail messages to network users. A remote device, such as a PDA, however, may use the differing Post Office Protocol (\u201cPOP\u201d) for retrieving, sending, and reading e-mail. Without resolution, the incongruity of the two protocols renders communication between the remote and local devices impossible.","In view of the foregoing, a need currently exists for providing a simple means by which secure communication can be transacted between a local host device and a remote device without the attendant problems discussed above. In addition, such a means should provide for the ability to exchange data and\/or share applications between the host and remote device even in cases where differing protocols are respectively employed.","The present invention relates to systems and methods for establishing a secure connection between a computer network and a remote device. The present invention further extends to secure communication between local and remote devices that is enabled via a carrier network and a spontaneous virtual private network established between the devices. Additional embodiments of the present invention include secure exchange of data between local and remote devices via communication protocols. Embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, opening data tunnels that operate as virtual private networks between the corporate network and a carrier network and between the remote device and the carrier network, optionally using the communication protocols.","Accordingly, a first example embodiment of the invention is a method for transmitting data in a secure manner between a computing network and a remote device, each of the computing network and the remote device including a tunneling client. The method generally includes: establishing a first data tunnel leg between a tunneling client of the computing network and a tunneling server of a carrier network; establishing a second data tunnel leg between the tunneling server of the carrier network and a tunneling client of the remote device; and transmitting data between the remote device and the computing network via the first and second data tunnel legs and the carrier network using a first template associated with a first protocol, the first template being used by the tunneling client of the computing network, and a second template associated with the first protocol, the second template being used by the tunneling of the remote device.","A second example embodiment of the invention is performed in a carrier network capable of communicating with a corporate network and a remote device. This embodiment relates to a method for enabling the remote device to access network data of the computing network. The method generally includes: receiving a first connection signal from a computing network; in response to the first connection signal, establishing a first data tunnel leg between the carrier network and the computing network; receiving a second connection signal from a remote device; and in response to the second connection signal, establishing a second data tunnel leg between the carrier network and the remote device, the first data tunnel leg and the second data tunnel leg together operating as a virtual private network.","A third example embodiment of the invention is performed in a device, such as a mobile or cellular phone, PDA, pager, laptop computer, etc. This embodiment relates to a method for enabling a user operating the device to access network data of a remote computing network. The method generally includes: transmitting a connection signal from the tunneling client of the device to a tunneling server of the carrier network, wherein a first data tunnel leg has already been established between the tunneling server and the remote computing network; and upon the establishment of a second data tunnel leg between the computing network and the carrier network in response to the connection signal, transmitting a data request via the second data tunnel leg to the carrier network using a first template that is associated with a first protocol and is used by the tunneling client of the device. In this embodiment, the remote computing network receives the data request from the carrier network via the first data tunnel leg. In addition, the remote computing network processes the data request using a second template associated with the first protocol.","Yet another example embodiment of the invention is performed in a computing network, such as an enterprise or corporate network. This embodiment relates to a method for enabling a user operating a remote device to access network data of the computing network. This embodiment generally includes: transmitting a first connection signal from a tunneling client of the computing network to a carrier network; upon the establishment of a first data tunnel leg between the computing network and the carrier network, transmitting a keep alive signal from the computing network to the carrier network to maintain the first data tunnel leg; and receiving a data request from a remote device via the first data tunnel leg and a second data tunnel leg located between the carrier network and a remote device. In this embodiment, the data request is transmitted using a first template associated with a first protocol, the first template being used by the tunneling client of the computing network, and a second template associated with the first protocol, the second template being used by a tunneling client of the remote device.","These and other features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.","Reference will now be made to figures wherein like structures will be provided with like reference designations. It is understood that the drawings are diagrammatic and schematic representations of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and are not limiting of the present invention nor are they necessarily drawn to scale.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-5"},"Embodiments of the present invention include or are incorporated in computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Examples of computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. When information is transferred or provided over a network, tunnel, channel or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media. Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data that cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. The computer-executable instructions and associated data structures or modules represent an example of program code means for executing the steps of the invention disclosed herein.","The invention further extends to computer systems for enabling a remote user access to network data of a corporate network that is stored behind corporate network firewalls. This includes, but is not limited to, opening data tunnels that operate as virtual private networks between the corporate network and a data center, and transmitting network data through the data tunnels. Those skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced in many environments with many types of computer and telephone systems, including portable computers, telephones, wireless telephones, PDA's, personal computers, multi-processor systems, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like.","1. System Environment","Reference is first made to , which shows one embodiment of a system for enabling secure communication between a local network and a remote device, the system being generally designated at . As described, the system  generally comprises several components, including a corporate network , a carrier network , and a remote device . In particular,  illustrates systems and methods of the present invention for enabling a user of the remote device  to access network data  and\/or one or more software applications  of the corporate network  through a data tunnel  initially established between the corporate network  and carrier network , and between the carrier network and the device , respectively. In one embodiment, the corporate network  is a business computer network containing network data  and applications  that are protected behind a firewall  to prevent unauthorized access.","As used herein, the term \u201ccorporate network\u201d should be broadly construed to include any computing environment where tasks are performed by processing devices that are linked together. The corporate network  can include, for example, the computing environment or network of any enterprise, business, corporation, individual, or other entity. In the corporate network , computer-executable instructions and program modules for performing the features of the invention may be located in local and remote memory storage devices. The term \u201ccorporate\u201d used in this context does not require the entity that operates the network to have any business or organizational structure.","The term \u201cremote device\u201d is understood to include a variety of electronic devices and apparatus that are remotely disposed with respect to the corporate network. Examples of a remote device include a mobile or cellular phone, PDA, pager, laptop computer, etc. The remote device can be capable of receiving, executing, and transmitting computer-executable instructions.","The terms \u201cnetwork data\u201d and \u201cbusiness network data\u201d should be construed to include any data that is stored in local and remote memory storage devices and is accessible to the corporate network . Network data  may include for example, email data or web page data. In one embodiment, network data  is protected behind a firewall infrastructure that includes the firewall . It should be appreciated, however, that network data  can include any data that is accessible to the corporate network , even if it is not protected behind the firewall infrastructure. Similarly, the term \u201capplication\u201d should be broadly construed to include any set of computer executable instructions for performing one or more functions in connection with a computer or other electronic device.","The term \u201ctunnel\u201d should be interpreted to include any channel or other line of communication through which data can be securely transmitted. One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous protocols and methods of encryption and authentication that can be employed to enable secure communication through a tunnel, such that the data transmitted through the tunnel is delivered only to an identified user who is authorized to access said data. It should further be appreciated that the terms \u201ctunnel,\u201d \u201cdata tunnel,\u201d and \u201cchannel,\u201d are interchangeable, as used herein. The tunnel operates as a virtual private network by enabling secure remote access to network data through a business's firewall infrastructure.","According to the present invention, as shown in , a data tunnel leg A is established between the corporate network  and the carrier network , and a data tunnel leg B is established between the carrier network and the remote device . The data tunnel legs A and B are used to transmit data between the corporate network  and the device . Specifically, the data tunnel leg A in one embodiment is established and maintained as a continuously open data tunnel between the corporate network  and the carrier network , through which information can be transmitted from the corporate network  for eventual receipt by the remote device . The data tunnel leg B is also established as a tunnel between the remote device  and the carrier network  to enable the transfer of information between the remote device and the corporate network . The data tunnel leg B in one embodiment is only opened as the need for data to be either transmitted from or received by the remote device  is present. Thus, in contrast to the data tunnel leg A, which is continuously established, the data tunnel leg B in one embodiment is intermittently established as the need for communication arises. This arrangement can be preferable in cases where the remote device  comprises a battery operated device, such as PDA, where power resources are to be conserved when possible.","In general, to establish the data tunnel leg A, the corporate network  transmits a connection signal A to the carrier network . In response, the carrier network  establishes the data tunnel leg A with the corporate network . Similarly, the remote device  transmits a connection signal B to the carrier network , which establishes the data tunnel leg B in response. In the illustrated embodiment, the carrier network , in establishing the respective data tunnel leg, can send a connection signal reply  to the corporate network , the remote device , or both. It is appreciated, however, that the connection signal reply  is not essential in establishing the data tunnel legs A or B. More details concerning the establishment of the data tunnel legs A and B are given below.","As used herein, the term \u201cconnection signal\u201d should be broadly construed to include data comprising a uniform resource identifier (\u201cURI\u201d), which represents a request for the carrier network to provide access to a web page, hypertext markup language (\u201cHTML\u201d) data, extensible markup language (\u201cXML\u201d) data, or other data resources. The connection signals A and B made by the corporate network  and the remote device , respectively, can be performed independently of each other, or in concert, according to system design. Likewise, the carrier network  is preferably configured to respond to each connection signal A and B independently, though the response to both the corporate network  and the remote device  by the carrier network can, if desired, be coordinated to occur simultaneously.","In the case of the corporate network , the data tunnel leg A, once established, is maintained by a keep alive signal . In one embodiment, the keep alive signal  comprises a small amount of nominal data sent to the corporate network  from the carrier network  in order to continually maintain the presence of the data tunnel leg A. This data is incrementally sent in packets having a size such as 100 bytes. In one embodiment, the keep alive signal  can comprise a nominal request for data from the corporate network . In response, the corporate network  can reply via the data tunnel leg A to the carrier network  with the requested data, thereby maintaining the tunnel leg A open. In a similar manner, the keep alive signal  is also sent by the carrier network  to the device  in order to maintain the presence of the data tunnel leg B when that leg is active.","As mentioned above, the data tunnel leg A between the corporate network  and the carrier network  is established repeatedly or on an ongoing basis so that the tunnel leg A is continuously available in the event that the remote device  attempts to establish the virtual private network connection with corporate network  described herein. For instance, the keep alive signal  can be sent on a periodic basis with a frequency, such as every 20 seconds, that is high enough to minimize the latency experienced by the remote device  when the remote device attempts to establish communication with the virtual private network. The connection signal A and the keep alive signal  transmitted between the corporate network  and the carrier network  can be performed automatically and in the background in preparation for the remote device  to eventually make the attempt to establish the virtual private network connection. In contrast, the connection signal B sent by the remote device  to the carrier network  is generally performed in response to input from a user of the remote device indicating that the user wishes to establish the virtual private network connection. In the case where multiple corporate networks are included in the present system, the initial connection signal B, or data subsequently transmitted over the tunnel leg B can identify the target corporate network  with which the device is to communicate.","In the case of the corporate network , the connection signal A, the keep alive signal , and the connection signal reply  are transmitted through the firewall . One skilled in the art will appreciate that the firewall  can include hardware, software, or a combination of both. Essentially, a firewall is a security mechanism that prohibits access through designated ports of a network and ensures network data cannot be accessed from an unauthorized user from outside of the firewall. Though only one firewall  is shown, multiple firewalls can be employed to afford enhanced data protection, if needed. The connection signal A, the keep alive signal , and any connection signal reply  relating to the corporate network  can also pass through one or more proxy servers  that are employed in conjunction with the firewall  as a security feature.","As shown in , the carrier network  receives the connection signals A and B and transmits keep alive signals  using a server. In the present embodiment, a web server, or sVPN server , operating as a component of a spontaneous virtual private network (\u201csVPN\u201d) is utilized. Though only one sVPN server  is depicted in , it should be appreciated that the carrier network  can comprise multiple web and\/or sVPN servers to enable the carrier network  to communicate with multiple corporate networks\/remote devices and to maintain multiple data tunnels (not shown). The sVPN servers or web servers are examples of \u201ctunneling servers\u201d that operate with tunneling clients as described herein to establish data tunnels between computing networks and remote devices. It should be appreciated that, according to the present invention, multiple data tunnels can be established between a single corporate network or remote device and a single web server, or between a single corporate network or remote device and multiple web servers.","The corporate network  and the remote device  use an sVPN corporate client  and an sVPN device client , respectively, to transmit their respective connection signals A and B to the carrier network  and to receive the connection signal reply  in response. \u201cConnection signal reply\u201d should be construed to include any data transmitted by the carrier network  in response to receiving the connection signal A or B and which is transmitted in an ongoing manner so as to keep open the tunnel legs A and B between the carrier network  and the corporate network , and between the carrier network and the remote device , respectively. The sVPN corporate client  is an example of a \u201cnetwork client\u201d that operates in the network with which the remote device communicates. Similarly, sVPN corporate client  and sVPN device client  are examples of \u201ctunneling clients\u201d that reside, respectively, on the network and the remote device and establish data tunnel legs that are connected to form a complete data tunnel as described herein.","As mentioned, data entering or exiting the corporate network  must pass through the firewall , which acts as a security feature to prevent unauthorized access to the network. In the present invention, penetration of the firewall  by the transmission and reception of the connection signals A, the keep alive signal , and the connection signal reply  is accomplished due to the fact that the data are packetized in a TCP\/IP or another appropriate format typically associated with web traffic. Thus, transmission of the connection signal A, the keep alive signal , and the connection signal reply  is performed via ports already established through the firewall  that are reserved for web traffic, thereby eliminating the need for establishing additional ports through the firewall and simplifying data transmission.","The corporate client , the device client , and the sVPN server  incorporate software for implementing sVPN communication technology, which includes software for initiating or responding to the connection signals A and B and, as will be described below in further detail, software for transcoding data between protocols, as needed. In turn, this enables the corporate client  and the device client  to establish the secure data tunnel legs A and B, respectively, with the sVPN server , as referred to earlier. Because a traditional VPN interface between these components is avoided, the challenges corresponding to typical VPN installations are avoided as well. In particular, because the data tunnel legs A and B are established by sending outgoing connection signals that permit ports to be opened through the firewalls, the virtual private network is established without requiring VPN hardware at the corporate network  that is otherwise required in conventional VPN systems. Further details regarding the establishment and use of sVPN connections with components similar to those discussed above can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/767,465, entitled \u201cSpontaneous Virtual Private Network Between Portable Device and Enterprise Network,\u201d which was filed Jan. 22, 2001, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The sVPN component of the corporate network  in the present discussion is characterized as a corporate client that is located on a computer server or similar component within the corporate network. The present invention is not so limited, however. Indeed, in one embodiment, the sVPN component can be implemented as a desktop client located on a desktop computer within the corporate network . In such an implementation, the desktop client can reside as a WIN  application on the computer, for example. The example illustrated in  is therefore exemplary with regard to the variations possible with this component of the present system.","Reference is now made to , which shows the data tunnel  established from the corporate client  of the corporate network  to the device client  of the remote device . As will be explained, the formation of the data tunnel leg A between the corporate client  and the sVPN server  of the carrier network , and the data tunnel leg B between the sVPN server and the device client  via the connection signal\/connection signal reply interaction discussed above, enables the sVPN server to broker the linkage of the two data tunnel legs and operatively form the complete data tunnel  from the corporate network  to the remote device . The data tunnel  enables secure data transfer to occur between the remote device  and the corporate network , and more specifically, between and through sVPN-enabled devices, such as the corporate client , the device client , and the sVPN server . It is appreciated that in presently preferred embodiments, access between the corporate client  and the carrier network , and between the carrier network and the device client  is implemented, either wholly or partially, via the Internet. By extension, therefore, each of the above components is configured to transmit and receive data via the Internet.","The corporate client  and device client  monitor their respective tunnel legs A and B to ensure that the tunnel  remains open when needed. If for any reason the tunnel leg A or B is undesirably closed, the respective client opens a new data tunnel leg with the sVPN server  of the carrier network  by transmitting a new connection signal to the carrier network . Once a new tunnel leg is established, the sVPN server  brokers the linkage of the tunnel leg between itself and the respective client with the previously established tunnel leg of the other client. Although several acts are described herein as being specifically performed by the corporate client  or the device client , it should be appreciated that inasmuch as the corporate network  includes the corporate client, and inasmuch as the remote device  includes the device client, any acts performed by the corporate client are also acts performed by the corporate network, and acts performed by the device client are also acts performed by the remote device. In an alternative embodiment, the sVPN server  specifically monitors the data tunnel leg A and merely notifies the corporate network  if the leg is closed or lost for some reason. The corporate network  can then take steps to reestablish the data tunnel leg A.","The data tunnel  between the corporate client  and the device client  in presently preferred embodiments uses transmission control protocol\/internet protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP\u201d), hypertext transfer protocol with secure sockets layer protocol (\u201cHTTPS\u201d), IP security protocol (\u201cIPsec\u201d), or other appropriate protocols for data transfer. Using these protocols, connection signals, network data, connection signal replies, and other access requests are encrypted in packets and transmitted through the data tunnel  using \u201cport \u201d (not shown) of the corporate network . Port  is typically open to enable users to access the Internet from the corporate network , within the firewall .","As described, the present invention uses preexisting open ports in the firewall infrastructure to enable secure, VPN-related communication from remote mobile locations. Accordingly, it should also be appreciated that the present invention is an improvement over the prior art because additional ports are not required to be opened in the firewall infrastructure, which would require the use of traditional VPN hardware and software that is expensive and time-consuming to install and to maintain. Furthermore, the present invention enables a proxy server to filter any data packets transmitted through the ports to ensure compliance with the defined protocols.","Reference is now made to , which depicts various details relating to the corporate client  and the device client . For clarity, some other components comprising the system  in this and following figures have been omitted. As illustrated, both the corporate client  and the device client  include a plurality of software templates  and , respectively. Each template  and  is configured for a specific protocol used in transmitting data between the corporate client  and the device client . Accordingly,  shows a plurality of N templates , designated template A, B, . . . , N, disposed in the corporate client . Similarly, the device client  includes N templates designated A, B, . . . , N. Each similarly designated template pair in the corporate client  and device client  is identical as to the protocol each template represents, (e.g., the protocol format contained in template D (such as Instant Messenger protocol) is identical to that contained in template D, which also pertains to the Instant Messenger protocol). Despite this similarity, in one embodiment each template  located in the corporate client  contains the actual protocol code, while the templates  located in the device client , though identical in protocol format, merely contain the protocol formatting and not the actual protocol code. This is done so as to preserve the limited memory and processing resources of the remote device .","The templates ,  are employed to assist the transfer of information, such as application data, commands, etc., between the corporate client  and the device client . Specifically, each template ,  enables data transfer according to a specific communication protocol, as already mentioned. To that end, each template  and  further includes one or more inflection points  that correspond to commands or other data aspects that are unique to the respective protocol.","For instance, a template pair A\/A can be configured to correspond to a POP e-mail protocol used in transferring e-mail commands and\/or data between the corporate network  and the remote device . As such, each template A and A will include a plurality of inflection points  that can contain the various commands and data specific to the POP protocol. This enables the templates A and A to be utilized in transmitting POP e-mail data between a POP-based e-mail application  disposed in the remote device , and a POP e-mail server  at the corporate network , both of which are shown in .","In another example, a template pair \/ can be configured that corresponds to the Instant Messenger protocol, which includes four main tasks that can be executed by the instant messenger application: send a message, receive a message, retrieve a buddy list, and login. Accordingly, the template pair \/ corresponding to the instant messenger protocol contains at least four inflection points, each corresponding to one of the four tasks above that can be performed by the instant messenger application. Template pairs \/ can be readily modified or added so as to accommodate new protocols or inflection points that are introduced within the present system  as described herein.","The corresponding pair of templates  and  can be configured to correspond to any one of a variety of protocols; thus the examples illustrating both the type and number of templates as given herein are meant to be merely exemplary. Further, though  illustrates an e-mail application  being associated with the remote device  and an e-mail server  associated with the corporate network , it should be appreciated that a wide range of applications and\/or programs can be utilized in connection with the present system for enabling secure communications between a corporate network and a remote device.","2. Remote Access to Network Data","Reference is now made to  together. The system and to environment just described is suitable for practicing the methods of the present invention for enabling secure data intercourse between a remote device and a corporate network through a spontaneous virtual private network arrangement. According to these methods, a user wishing to remotely access network data, such as the e-mail information contained on the e-mail server  of the corporate network , opens a line of communication, or the data tunnel leg B, with the carrier network  using the remote device , which in this example comprises a web-enabled PDA. The data tunnel leg B is established using the connection signal\/connection signal reply mechanism for establishing connectivity between the remote device  and the carrier network , as described above. Concurrent with or prior to the establishment of the data tunnel leg B, the data tunnel leg A is established between the corporate network  and the carrier network  using the same connection signal\/connection signal reply routine discussed above.","In conjunction with these procedures, presently preferred embodiments also include device and user authentication and security procedures that ensure that the system is properly configured and that all users and system components are properly authorized. Specifically, a three-tiered regimen is utilized to accomplish the authentication and security tasks. The first tier comprises device authentication tasks for authenticating both the remote device  and the corporate network . When either the remote device  or the corporate network  attempts to establish a data tunnel leg with the sVPN server , its respective client transmits, along with or following the connection signal A or B, an identification code, such as a client identification (\u201cCID\u201d). The CID is an encrypted certificate that authenticates the corresponding client as one that is valid for transacting data with the present system . Upon receipt of the CID, the sVPN server  can authenticate that client, and hence its host (i.e., the corporate client  or the remote device ) as a component of the system . As will be seen, the CID of each client  and  will be used in later tiers in connecting the data tunnel legs A and B into a single data tunnel .","As mentioned, the transmittal of the CID and related data from either of the device  and  to the sVPN server  is encrypted. In the present embodiment, this encryption is accomplished using x.509 certificates. The x.509 certificate can be used as a digital signature to ensure the various components to be used in transacting data within the system via the sVPN server  are valid devices. In one embodiment, the sVPN server  is pre-loaded with the required digital signature and certificate data during manufacture so as to enable the sVPN server to validate these digital signatures later during operation.","As a result of the first tier device authentication procedure above being completed, data tunnel legs A and B are established between each device  and  and the sVPN server . Before the complete data tunnel  is formed and data can be transacted between the corporate network  and the remote device , however, the other two tiers of the security and authentication tasking must also be completed. In the second tier, various security procedures are performed to enable secure data transfer. First, a session key is created for use by the corporate client  and the device client . In the present embodiment, this step is performed using an RSA algorithm, which creates a 2,048-bit session key. These steps are preferably performed by the device client  of the remote device  and transmitted via the sVPN server  to the corporate network , where the session key is received by the corporate client . In alternative embodiments other components, such as the corporate client , can create the session key.","After the session key is created, it is used to set up the encryption protocol that will be used during data transmission between the corporate network  and the remote device . In the present embodiment, RC-4 techniques are used to set up the data encryption based on the session key. Then, a message digest, such as MD-5, is used to ensure that the encryption is accurately performed and is not corrupted by extraneous events.","As a result of these various security devices and algorithms, secure encryption of data to be transmitted between the various components is ensured. At this point, the x.509 certificate created in the first tier is terminated, and the full data tunnel  from corporate network  to remote device  is established by the sVPN server , as shown in .","Once the complete data tunnel  is established, the third tier of the security and authentication regimen can be executed, wherein the corporate network  authenticates the identity of the user of the remote device  to verify that the user has authority to access the corporate network before data is transacted. In one embodiment, the user's identity is authenticated when the user enters a personal identification number. In another embodiment, the user's identity is confirmed over the Internet using encryption technology, such as twin-key encryption, with corresponding public and private keys assigned to the user. Those skilled in the art will recognize there are various methods for authenticating the identity of a user, any of which may be used in accordance with the present invention. Other such methods for authenticating the identity of a user include, but are not limited to, tokens and smart cards. More details concerning user authentication are given further below.","It is appreciated that, despite the details given herein, other methods can be used to provide the security and authentication results obtained by the above three-tiered regimen. Additionally, any one of the three tiers can substituted with an alternative procedure that substantially accomplishes the same task. Finally, though all three tiers are preferably practiced in connection with the present invention, it is appreciated that less than three tiers\u2014or, alternatively, more than three tiers\u2014can be utilized in establishing the present system  for secure data exchange.","Once all three security and authentication tiers are satisfied, the user, by way of the device client  of the remote device , can transmit along the data tunnel  an access request to the corporate network  (via the sVPN server ), which is received by the corporate client . The access request can include any request requiring access to network data  or applications . For example, the access request can include a request to receive access to email messages, web pages, document files, or other data of the corporate network . As illustrated in , the e-mail application  of the remote device can issue an access request via the device client  to receive e-mail information from the e-mail server of the corporate network . As such, the access request is packetized by the device client  of the remote device  and transmitted using data tunnel .","It is noted here that once the data tunnel  is established and all authentication and security procedures have been met, the sVPN server  preferably does not interact with (i.e., caching, transcoding, decrypting, etc.) access requests, access replies, or any other data being transferred between the remote device  and the corporate network , but merely enables the data transfer to pass through it.","Like the connection signals , the keep alive signal , and the connection signal replies  discussed above, the access request transmitted by the device client  in the present embodiment comprises a protocol structure that enables it to be transmitted as web traffic. In particular, each packet comprising the access request includes an http header or similar protocol identifier that will cause the firewall  and the proxy  to recognize the packet as web traffic and allow its passage through the designated port of the corporate network , in this case, port . An underlying protocol, such as IPSec, also resides in the packet and contains the actual data pertaining to the access request. This arrangement of the data packets comprising the access request transmitted by the device client  thus allows them to pass through a port already open for such traffic, thereby avoiding the need to open yet another port through the firewall . Any packets comprising the response by the corporate client  to the access request of the device client  are also packaged in this manner such that they too pass freely through the firewall , as will be seen.","The above access request, originally produced by an application and sent by the device client  of the remote device , is transmitted via the data tunnel  using the corresponding template  of the device client . For example, the access request can pertain to a request for e-mail header information to be used by the e-mail application  of the remote device . As such, the access request is transmitted using the template A pertaining to such an e-mail header request. The inflection points  of the template A correspond to such an e-mail header request. Again, the access request can comprise any one of a variety of request types, and the templates  and  can be configured to pertain to one of these types. It is noted that, in this configuration, the e-mail application  of the device client  interprets the template  as representing the application or server that is actually located in the corporate network . As such, the template  acts as a \u201cproxy\u201d for that corporate application or server, in this case, the e-mail server .","As seen in , the templated access request transmitted by the device client  is received via the data tunnel  by the corporate client  after passing through the sVPN server , the proxy server , and the firewall . Again, because the access request is transmitted in preferred embodiments in a web traffic configuration, the firewall  allows it to pass through a port already open for such traffic, thereby avoiding the need to open yet another port therethrough.","The corporate client  then matches the access request to the appropriate template  before forwarding it to the designated application in the corporate network . For instance, continuing the above example, the e-mail header access request sent from the device client  is received at the corporate client  and is matched to the appropriate template A. The data contained in the inflection points  of the template A are then extracted and sent to the e-mail server , where the access request is processed and the requested data is forwarded to corporate client  in response to the access request. As was the case with the device client , the e-mail server  interprets the template A as representing the e-mail application  that is actually remotely located in the remote device . Thus the template A acts as a proxy for the e-mail application .","The manner in which the access request is responded to can be defined and\/or limited by the corporate network . By allowing the corporate network  to control what acts are performed in response to the access request, the corporate network is able to maintain control over access to network data and applications and can control how these network elements are manipulated within the network. Predefined acts can include, but are not limited to, retrieving email headers, retrieving email message bodies, retrieving web page data, deleting email, faxing email data or web page data to the user, and transmitting other network data between the corporate client  and device client .","Once received by the corporate client , the data is packetized as an access response to the access request according to an appropriate template . The templated access response is then forwarded via the data tunnel  for receipt by the device client  in a similar manner to that described above. In one embodiment, the access response can be incorporated into the continual connection signal string being continually sent by the corporate client  to maintain the data tunnel leg A open, as described earlier.","In one embodiment, the transmission of data contained in an access response is performed via the data tunnel . In another embodiment, a second data tunnel (not shown) is established for the transmission of the access response. It is to be remembered that these data tunnels cooperate with the corporate client , the device client , and the sVPN server  in a spontaneous VPN configuration in enabling the secure transmission of data between the corporate network  and the remote device . In the case where a second data tunnel is implemented for data transfer, the second data tunnel can be established through the same port used for the data tunnel  (e.g., Internet port , port ) or through a separate port.","In one embodiment, a null template pair (not shown) can be designated in the templates  and . The null template pair can be configured to capture and transmit data between the corporate client  and the device client  that has been compared with the other templates  or  of the corporate or device client and does not match with any of those templates. Such unmatched data can then be captured by the null template on either the corporate client side or the device client side and transmitted over to the null template of the other client. The respective client  can then forward the data according to pre-defined procedures. In this configuration, the null templates enable the spontaneous VPN system to operate similar to a traditional VPN configuration, wherein data is not collected and assigned according to protocol templates  and .","It should be noted that more than one remote device can be utilized in connection with the corporate network  at any given time. Thus, the illustration of one remote device is merely exemplary. Similarly, multiple corporate clients disposed in one or more corporate networks can be utilized in accordance with the present teachings while still residing within the scope of this invention. Reference is now made to , B, and C in describing various techniques by which implementation of the present invention into network systems can be achieved. Note that the implementations to be described are merely exemplary; as such, other means of implementation can also be employed. In the first two implementations given below with respect to , it is noted that full encryption technology is preferably employed from device client  to corporate client  in order to secure the communications transmitted therebetween.","In , a first means of implementation is depicted, wherein the device client  of the present system  is compiled into a device application  of the remote device . The corporate client  is disposed in a software configuration within the corporate network  as previously discussed. Thus, both the device client  and corporate client  are implemented as software modules in the corporate network  and remote device , respectively.","In , both the corporate client  and the device client  are implemented as software modules, similar to . In contrast to , however, the present embodiment implements the device client  as a discrete software module being separately positioned with respect to the one or more device applications  that are located within the remote device . As before, the corporate client  resides as a software module within the corporate network . In this implementation, the device client  interacts with the device application  by implementing a port listener scheme by which the device client continuously monitors the port through which commands and data from the device application are sent and received. Once detected, this command and data information is intercepted by the device client  and manipulated for inclusion into an appropriate template  before being transmitted to the corporate client  via the carrier network  and sVPN server , as described earlier.","In  a third implementation is depicted, wherein a user interface, such as a user interface service (\u201cUIS\u201d) is employed. Here, the UIS, in the form of a wireless application protocol (\u201cWAP\u201d) browser, interacts with an application protocol from the corporate client  or device client  via the respective protocol template  and\/or . As seen in , for example, requested data from the corporate database  or application  is encrypted and forwarded by the corporate network  to the sVPN server  of the carrier network , again, using the template scheme discussed earlier. The sVPN server  or other component of the carrier network  then renders this data in a visual format before forwarding it on to the remote device . The device client  of the remote device  decrypts the visual data and further processes it as needed or desired. This embodiment can be implemented, among other things, in systems employing the WAP protocol, such as e-mail service for WAP-enabled mobile phones, for instance. Also, in embodiments incorporating the present UIS configuration, the UIS is normally located with the sVPN server at the carrier network . In such embodiments, the UIS can contribute security features to enhance those already associated with the present invention, if desired. For instance, in a UIS implementation employing WAP protocol, WTLS, which is a WAP-related security program, can be utilized to provide data protection and integrity.","3. Simplified User Authentication","Reference is now made to , depicting yet another embodiment of the present invention. As already mentioned, the data tunnel  is established by creating the data tunnel leg A from the corporate client  to the sVPN server , and the data tunnel leg B from the sVPN server  to the device client . The sVPN server  can then unite the two data tunnel legs A and B to form the complete data tunnel . Before enabling data to flow between the corporate client  and the device client , however, the corporate network  in executing the third tier of the three-tiered authentication and security regimen can require the user of the remote device  to be authenticated by the network. This can be accomplished by utilizing an authentication template pair , similar to the templates \/ described above. In one embodiment, the user enters appropriate security credentials, such as an NT domain password, radius security password, active security password, or custom password, into the device client . This security credential data is then input into the authentication template  of the device client . The templated security credential data is then forwarded via the data tunnel  to the corporate client , where it is received and input into the authentication template  of the corporate client. The security credential data is then forwarded to a security layer of the corporate network , including an authentication module , for user authentication. If authentication is successful, the security credential information can be preserved in a storage device , such as a 3DES encrypted database. Data can then be enabled by the corporate network  to flow between the corporate client  and the device client .","Once authentication by this or other similar method is accomplished, the security credential information can be synchronized by the corporate client  with the authentication\/password requirements of other designated applications, such as application servers  in the corporate network  that the user of the remote device  may choose to access. This synchronization causes the user authentication requirements of each designated application server  to be met. This in turn enables the user to access the various applications without again having to enter appropriate security credential information, such as a password, for each application contained on the application servers , thereby streamlining and simplifying use of the network for the user. This synchronized authorization can be distributed as narrowly or as broadly as designated by the corporate network  and security administrator.","The present invention enables secure data transfer between remotely disposed components using a simplified connectivity infrastructure. This in turn enables data synchronization and access between a corporate network and a remote device. In particular, the synchronization of corporate data with remotely disposed devices, as well as the utilization and enablement of native device applications in conjunction with a corporate network, are provided for. It should be understood that, though the principles herein have been directed at implementation within a spontaneous virtual private network environment, these principles can also be largely applied to other data transport embodiments having varying hardware\/software implementations, such as typical VPN configurations.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.
