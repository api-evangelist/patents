title: Evaluating a trust value of a data report from a data processing tool
abstract: Various embodiments of systems and methods for evaluating a trust value for a report are disclosed herein. The method includes obtaining one or more reports by the computer, where the reports are formed of one or more fields of data. An end-to-end lineage for the data is determined to trace the data back to the data source system from which the data had originated initially. Further, the method includes validating each of the multiple data source systems including intermediate tables, and determining a data quality score for each of the multiple data source systems. A trust value for the report is calculated based on the data quality scores for the one or more data source systems and intermediate tables, and rendered along with the report.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field relates generally to information processing tools. More specifically, the field relates to evaluating a trust value of a report generated by an information processing tool.","Business Intelligence (BI) generally refers to software tools used to improve business enterprise decision making. These tools are commonly applied to financial, human resource, marketing, sales, customer and supplier analyses. More specifically, these tools can include: reporting and analysis tools to present information; content delivery infrastructure systems for delivery and management of reports and analytics; data warehousing systems for cleansing and consolidating information from disparate sources; and, data management systems, such as relational databases or On Line Analytic Processing (OLAP) systems used to collect, store, and manage raw data.","There are a number of commercially available products to produce reports from stored data. As used herein, the term report refers to information automatically retrieved, in response to computer executable instructions, from a data source such as a database, a data warehouse, or a datamart, where the information is structured in accordance with a report schema that specifies the form in which the information should be presented.","Data commonly manifested in reports, is critical to establishing business strategies and actions. Enterprises increasingly integrate data from a number of sources such as different databases, external streaming data feeds, and personal spreadsheets. Once this data is integrated it is difficult to determine which values in a report come from which source. In addition, it is not clear how fresh the data may be or if there are validity issues with the data source. For these reasons, the value of the report is questioned due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the underlying data.","Although, validation of data within a data warehouse may add some degree of confidence in the report, establishing trust in a report document merely based on the accuracy of data within the data warehouse may not provide a reliable measure of confidence in the report. Moreover, currently available enterprise reporting systems do not effectively link such validation information with the report.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for evaluating a trust value of a data report from a data processing tool are described herein. The method for evaluating a trust value for a report involves obtaining one or more reports from a business intelligence tool. Each of one or more reports is composed of one or more related fields. A field contains an item of data; that is, a character, or group of characters that are related. For instance, a grouping of related text characters such as \u201cMark Twain\u201d makes up a name in the name field. Further, the method includes determining an end-to-end lineage for the data to trace the data back to the data source system from which the data had originated initially. Each of the multiple data source systems including intermediate tables are validated using a set of validation rules, and a data quality score for each of the multiple data source systems is determined. Further, the method includes calculating a trust value for the report based on the data quality scores for the one or more data source systems and intermediate tables. The trust value for the report may be rendered along with the report as a numerical value, or any form of audio, or visual, or audio-visual representation. The trust value provides an indication of the trustworthiness of the report in terms of accuracy and quality of data in the report.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for evaluating a trust value of a data report from a data processing tool are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130"]},"Further, the method includes calculating () a trust value for the report based on the data quality scores for the one or more data source systems and intermediate tables if any. The trust value provides an indication of the trustworthiness of the report in terms of accuracy and quality of data in the report. In an embodiment, the trust value is calculated by calculating an aggregate score of the data quality scores for each of the one or more data source systems. The aggregate scores can be calculated by any method including but not limited to weighted average, minimum value, and maximum value. The trust value for the report may be rendered () on the computer as a numeric score, or any form of audio, or visual, or audio-visual representation. For example, the trust value can be represented as a color code, where \u201cred\u201d represents low reliability, \u201cgreen\u201d represents high reliability, and \u201corange\u201d represents moderate reliability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","210","211","212","220","230","240","250","260","210","211","212","210","211","212","210","211","212","270","210","211","212","210","211","212"]},"By way of example, the data source systems , , and  may include databases, external feeds, data ware houses, datamarts, modeling tools, ETL tools, Business Intelligence (BI) tools, and the like. Data consolidation systems  such as ETL, EAI, and ELT coordinate the retrieval and delivery of metadata from the disparate data source systems , , and  to the metadata repository . Also, the data in the data source systems , , and  are subject to data transformation and integration through the data consolidation system  and loaded into the data warehouse . The data in the data warehouse  may be accessed by Business intelligence (BI) tools  to create and supply one or more reports . The BI tools  include executable instructions required to turn the data into information such as standard reports, queries, analytical applications, OLAP analysis, exception based reporting, data mining etc. The one or more reports  may be rendered on the computer  in the network.","The computer  includes a computer readable storage medium (CRSM) having executable instructions or code stored therein to perform the above-illustrated methods. For example, the CRSM includes a data lineage constructor , a trust value generator , validation routine  and weight definition  comprising executable instructions to coordinate the processing of the information in the reports , data warehouse , and the metadata repository .","The data lineage constructor  includes executable instructions to identify relationships between objects in a report  with respect to multiple data source systems , , and , particularly, original data source systems. As used herein, the term \u201cobject\u201d refers to data elements within a record of the report  and the term \u201coriginal\u201d data source system refers to the data source system  from which the data initially originated prior to being subject to transformations and integrations in intermediate tables. Based on the instructions from the data lineage constructor, a processor associated with the computer executes a set of relationship rules to identify and characterize the impact and lineage of objects in the report  using the metadata stored in the metadata repository .","Further, based on the lineage information provided by the data lineage constructor, the processor calculates data quality scores for the multiple data source systems. A data quality score is obtained by applying a data validation rule to a field (row\/column) of a record in a data source system . For example, the data quality score may indicate a degree of accuracy of data, where higher the data quality score, better the accuracy of data in the record. The data quality score may be stored in the metadata repository or the data warehouse  along with the data. In an embodiment, the data quality scores, in the form of metadata, are directed to the metadata repository . The data quality scores may be downloaded from the metadata repository  for processing by the trust value generator .","The trust value generator  includes executable instructions for generating trust values using data quality scores retrieved from the metadata repository . The trust value may be associated with a report  to ascribe a level of trustworthiness to a report . The trust value provides an indication of the trustworthiness of the report in terms of accuracy and quality of data in the report. The trust value generator  generates the trust value by aggregating the data quality scores. In an embodiment, the combination of data quality score is a weighted average, where the weights associated with the data quality scores are configurable. In an embodiment, the combination is by extreme value of data quality score, that is minimum or maximum value.","According to an aspect, when a report  is generated or received at the computer , the data lineage constructor  within the CRSM determines an end-to-end lineage of the report . The end-to-end lineage of the report  is determined by tracking the lineage of the data in each field of the report  back to an original data source system , , and\/or  including any intermediate tables. The lineage of the data may be determined using metadata information from the metadata repository . As mentioned already, the data consolidation system  coordinates the retrieval and delivery of metadata from the disparate data source systems , , and  to the metadata repository . Also, the metadata information of the source data that are subject to data transformation and integration through the data consolidation system  is loaded into the metadata repository . By using the metadata information stored in the metadata repository , the data lineage constructor  constructs an end-to-end lineage of the data.","For example, the lineage of the data can be represented by a line diagram or flow diagram with the data in the report  as the starting point in the flow, and tracing back to the source of origin of the data. The flow diagram may also show any intermediate tables where the data has been subject to transformation, integration, or any other processing. In an embodiment, the lineage constructor  may associate a data quality score with each of the intermediate and source tables in the data flow. As mentioned above, the data quality score may be generated throughout the network at various points by applying validation routines . In addition, the lineage constructor  may be configured to display additional metadata characteristics such as value distribution, transformations, integrations, maximum value, minimum value, pattern, length of field, blanks, how populated the field is, etc.","In an alternative embodiment, subsequent to determining the lineage of the data, the data quality scores for the identified original data source(s) is retrieved from the metadata repository . It is herein assumed that a set of validation rules have already been applied to the data source systems , , and  and the data quality scores have been stored in the metadata repository .","Further, the trust value generator  processes the data quality scores to generate a trust value for the report . For example, the trust value generator  may assign weights to each of the data quality scores, according to weight definition  () and then determine an aggregate of the data quality scores to produce a trust value. The trust value indicates a level of trustworthiness for the report .","In addition, the report  may include information on the individual data quality scores. The composition and weighting of the individual data quality scores is configurable. In addition, the weighting of components forming an individual data quality score is configurable. For example, more weight may be ascribed to trust categories that represent valued trust criteria for a given organization. That is, an organization can customize trust indicators within a system to reflect an organization's internal values, priorities, weightings, and thresholds with respect to trusting data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","270","310","210","211","212","320","210","211","212","330","250","230","340","270","270","350","210","211","212","210","211","212","360","270","370","380","270"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","260","420","430","420","440","444","445","450","450","425","435","448","435","430","440","441","442","443","444","445","440","441","442","443","444","450","455","448","443","445","448","450","443","450","455","440","445","448","450","440","450","455","450","455","445","450"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":"500"},"The \u201cValidation routine\u201d table  provides the data quality score obtained upon application of the one or more validation rules  against the relevant columns  in the data source system . For example, the score 7.34 is obtained when the \u201cAnnualSales rule\u201d is applied to the \u201cAnnualSales\u201d column  in the data source system  with a weighting of 30%. Similarly, the data quality scores 5.99-8.83 are generated by applying the corresponding rules to the relevant columns in the data source system . Thus, the data quality score is a function of one or more validation rules specified as an externally defined validation rule forming input metadata input. Metadata outputs associated with the data quality score include a success\/failure data, success\/failure rows, and the number of success\/failure rows. In an embodiment, the lineage constructor  may be configured to display the data quality score as a minimum column score for a column or may be configured to display the data quality score as the maximum column score for a column. Alternatively, the data quality score may be displayed as the weighted average of the data quality score for a column.","Further, the \u201cQuality dimension\u201d table  provides options for quality criteria that may be set by default or be altered by a user. The validation rules may be categorized so as to be associated with at least one of the criteria. For example, selecting the quality criteria \u201cAccuracy\u201d would invoke the validation rules that are configured to check for accuracy of data. For example, a validation rule for determining accuracy may determine whether the data meets a particular syntax such as string_length. Similarly, a validation rule for determining \u201cCompleteness\u201d may be configured to determine whether the column has empty cells or not. As illustrated, the data quality score has component weightings of 80% for Accuracy and 20% for completeness. These weightings may be set by default or they may be altered by a user.","The \u201cOverall Trust Value\u201d table  provides a numerical score indicating the trust value for a report. In the given example, the \u201cInput Controls and Charts\u201d report  has a trust value of 7.42 where a minimum threshold is \u201c4\u201d and a maximum threshold is \u201c9.\u201d The threshold limits are used to assess a level of trustworthiness of the report with \u201c4\u201d being a lower cut-off limit and \u201c9\u201d being an upper cut-off limit with respect to a trust value. The trust value of a report may be used to trigger various actions. For example, a user may be alerted to a report refresh operation only in the event that an acceptable trust value is reached. Alternatively, a database administrator may be alerted when a refreshed report fails to achieve a specified trust value. A database administrator may also use trust values to periodically remove untrustworthy reports from a repository.","The \u201cRule Bindings\u201d table  shows the data quality scores for individual columns in the data source system along with the applied validation rule. In the given example, the data quality score of 7.55 is obtained upon application of \u201csyntax_yr rule\u201d on column \u201cFiscal year\u201d  of table \u201cHistorical_cost\u201d in the data source system . Similarly, the remaining data quality scores are shown to be generated based on application of the relevant rules on the corresponding columns. The trust value is generated by aggregating the individual data quality scores for each of the columns.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components may be implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions.
