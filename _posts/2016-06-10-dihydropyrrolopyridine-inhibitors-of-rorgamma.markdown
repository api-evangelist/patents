Dev. Biol. 2006, 16, 313-355). The ROR family consists of ROR alpha (ROR\u03b1), ROR beta (ROR\u03b2) and ROR gamma (ROR), each encoded by a separate gene (in human: RORA, RORB and RORC, respectively; in mouse: rora, rorb and rorc, respectively). RORs contain four principal domains shared by the majority of nuclear receptors: an N-terminal domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) consisting of two zinc finger motifs, a hinge domain, and a ligand binding domain (LBD). Each ROR gene generates several isoforms, differing only in their N-terminal domains. ROR has two isoforms: ROR1 and ROR2 (also known as RORt). ROR refers to ROR1 and\/or RORt. ROR1 is expressed in a variety of tissues including thymus, muscle, kidney and liver, but RORt is exclusively expressed in the cells of the immune system, has a critical role in thymopoiesis and the development of several secondary lymphoid tissues, and is a key regulator of Th17 cell differentiation (Jetten, 2009, Nucl. Recept. Signal., 7:e003, doi:10.1621\/nrs.07003, Epub 2009 Apr. 3).","Th17 cells are a subset of T helper cells which preferentially produce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22. Th17 cells and their effector molecules, such as IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, GM-CSF and CCL20, are associated with the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, allergy and asthma (Maddur et al., 2012, Am. J. Pathol., 181:8-18). Recent findings support a role for IL17 and Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of acne (Thiboutot et al., 2014, J. Invest. Dermatol., 134(2):307-10, doi: 10.1038\/jid.2013.400; Agak et al., 2014, J. Invest. Dermatol., 134(2):366-73, doi: 10.1038\/jid.2013.334, Epub 2013 Aug. 7). Th17 cells are also potent inducers of inflammation associated with endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory disease (Hirata et al., 2010, Endocrinol., 151:5468-5476; Hirata et al., 2011, Fertil Steril., July; 96(1):113-7, doi: 10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2011.04.060, Epub 2011 May 20). Additionally, Th17 cells have a key role in the mouse autoimmune models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) (Bedoya et al., 2013, Clin. Dev. Immunol., 2013:986789. Epub 2013 Dec. 26. Th17 cells are activated during inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes and are responsible for recruiting other inflammatory cell types, particularly neutrophils, to mediate pathology in target tissues (Miossec & Kolls, 2012, Nature Rev., 11:763-776; Korn et al., 2009, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 27:485-517). Aberrant Th17 cell function has been implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Autoimmune disease is believed to arise from the disruption of the equilibrium between effector and regulatory T cells (Solt et al., 2012, ACS Chem. Biol., 7:1515-1519, Epub 2012 Jul. 9). The importance of RORt to Th17 cell differentiation and the pathogenic role of Th17 cells is evidenced by the fact that RORt-deficient mice have very few Th17 cells and have a reduction in severity of EAE (Ivanov et al., 2006, Cell, 126:1121-1133).","Circadian rhythms are daily cycles of behavioral and physiological changes that are regulated by endogenous circadian clocks. A number of studies have established links between nuclear receptor (including ROR) function and expression, the circadian regulatory circuitry, and the regulation of various physiological processes (Jetten (2009) op. cit.).","Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a chronic inflammatory disease regulated by T lymphocytes. OSAS patients have a significant increase in peripheral Th17 cell frequency, IL-17 and RORt levels (Ye et al., 2012, Mediators Inflamm., 815308, doi: 10.1155\/2012\/815308, Epub 2012 Dec. 31).","A number of studies have provided evidence of a role of RORs in cancer. Mice deficient in the expression of ROR exhibit a high incidence of thymic lymphomas that metastasize frequently to liver and spleen. High expression of Th17-associated genes (including ROR) and high levels of Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis in various cancers, including lung, gastric, breast and colon cancer (Tosolini et al., 2011, Cancer Res., 71:1263-1271, doi: 10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-10-2907, Epub 2011 Feb. 8; Su et al., 2014, Immunol.

Conventional resolution techniques include forming the salt of a free base of each isomer of an enantiomeric pair using an optically active acid (followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base), forming the salt of the acid form of each enantiomer of an enantiomeric pair using an optically active amine (followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free acid), forming an ester or amide of each of the enantiomers of an enantiomeric pair using an optically pure acid, amine or alcohol (followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary), or resolving an enantiomeric mixture of either a starting material or a final product using various well known chromatographic methods.","When the stereochemistry of a disclosed compound is named or depicted by structure, the named or depicted stereoisomer is at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99% or 99.9% by weight pure relative to all of the other stereoisomers. Percent by weight pure relative to all of the other stereoisomers is the ratio of the weight of one stereoisomer over the weight of the other stereoisomers. When a single enantiomer is named or depicted by structure, the depicted or named enantiomer is at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99% or 99.9% by weight optically pure. Percent optical purity by weight is the ratio of the weight of the enantiomer over the weight of the enantiomer plus the weight of its optical isomer.","When the stereochemistry of a disclosed compound is named or depicted by structure, and the named or depicted structure encompasses more than one stereoisomer (e.g., as in a diastereomeric pair), it is to be understood that one of the encompassed stereoisomers or any mixture of the encompassed stereoisomers are included. It is to be further understood that the stereoisomeric purity of the named or depicted stereoisomers at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99% or 99.9% by weight pure relative to all of the other stereoisomers.

(PerkinElmer, Cat. # NET674250UC), for a ligand binding site on a recombinant ROR\u03b3 Ligand Binding Domain (LBD) protein expressed as a 6\u00d7His-Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) fusion. The assay was performed in 96-well SPA plates (PerkinElmer, Cat. #1450-401) in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl, 10% (v\/v) glycerol, 2 mM CHAPS, 0.5 mM \u03b2-octylglucopyranoside and 5 mM DTT. Tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and semi-log (3.162\u00d7) serial dilutions of the compounds were prepared in the same solvent. Two \u03bcL of the DMSO solutions were mixed with 28 \u03bcL of 8.6 nM 25-hydroxy[26,27-H]-cholesterol and 50 \u03bcL of 24 nM ROR\u03b3 LBD. The plate was shaken at 700 rpm for 20 min and incubated for 10 min at rt, after which 40 \u03bcL of poly-Lys YSi SPA beads (PerkinElmer, Cat. # RPNQ0010) were added to achieve 50 \u03bcg of the beads per well. The plate was incubated on an orbital shaker for 20 min and then for 10 min without agitation at rt. SPA signal for tritium beta radiation was registered on PerkinElmer Microbeta plate reader. Percent inhibition values were calculated based on the high signal obtained with DMSO control and the low signal observed with 10 \u03bcM standard ROR\u03b3 inverse agonist T0901317 (SigmaAldrich, Cat. # T2320). The percent inhibition vs. concentration data were fit into a four-parameter model, and IC50 values were calculated from the fit as the concentrations corresponding to the inflection points on the dose-response curves Inhibitory constants (Ki) were calculated using the following equation, where [RL] is the concentration in the assay and Kis a dissociation constant of 25-hydroxy[26,27-H]-cholesterol:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0247"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["K","i"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"I","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"C","mn":"50"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"RL"},"msub":{"mi":["K","D"]}}}},"mo":"."}]}}}},"br":{},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00040","he":"2.46mm","wi":"2.46mm","file":"US09481674-20161101-P00038.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"Compounds of the present invention were tested for ROR\u03b3 inverse agonist activity in a cell-based, transcriptional activity assay. Secreted Nanoluc\u00ae luciferase was used as a reporter for transcriptional activity of the full-length RORt in Jurkat cells (ATCC, Cat. # TIB-152). A reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting 5 repeats of the ROR Response Element (RORE) AAAGTAGGTCA (SEQ ID NO:1) into a commercially available promoterless plasmid pNL1.3 [secNluc] (Promega, Cat. # N1021) using KpnI and HindIII restriction sites. The expression plasmid for RORt was purchased (GeneCopoeia, Cat. # EX-T6988-MO2). Jurkat cells (30 million cells) were transfected with 11 \u03bcg of EX-T6988-MO2 and 26 \u03bcg of the reporter plasmid in OptiMEM\u00ae media using Lipofectamine\u00ae LTX and Plus\u2122 reagents (Life Technologies, Cat. #15338-100). After 5-6 hr incubation at 37\u00b0 C.\/5% CO, the cells were collected, resuspended in phenol-red free RPMI media containing 10% (v\/v) dilapidated FBS (Hyclone, Cat. # SH30855.03) and dispensed into 96-well clear bottom tissue culture plates (CoStar, Cat. #3603), at 80,000 cells per well. Tested compounds were added to the cells in the same media (final concentration of DMSO was 0.1% (v\/v)), and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C.\/5% COfor 16-18 hr. Luciferase activity in the conditioned supernatants was determined with NanoGlo\u00ae assay reagents (Promega, Cat.# N1130). Percent inhibition values were calculated based on the fully inhibited and non-inhibited (DMSO) controls, and the values were regressed against concentrations of the tested compounds to derive IC50 values using a four-parameter non-linear fitting model.","Human Whole Blood Assay (Assay 3)","Compounds of the invention were tested in the human whole blood assay to measure their effects on IL-17A production as determined by cytokine secretion into 50% blood\/media supernatant. Mixtures of sodium heparinized whole blood (isolated from healthy human donors) and the T cell activator CytoStim, in the presence or absence of compound, were plated in sterilized, tissue culture-treated 24-well plates. Specifically, the mixtures in each well were as follows: (1) 500 \u03bcL of whole blood, (2) 250 \u03bcL of compound diluted into RPMI-1640 media containing 10% HyClone\u2122 FCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.), Gibco\u00ae Pen\/Strep and Gibco\u00ae NEAA (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.), and (3) 250 \u03bcL of CytoStim (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) diluted to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcL\/mL in complete cell culture medium.","Mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C.\/5% COfor 48 h, after which, 200 \u03bcL of clean supernatant (i.e., no red blood cells) from each well was transferred to a well in a 96-well plate. IL-17A cytokine expression was determined using 25 \u03bcL of the transferred supernatant diluted with 25 \u03bcL of Diluent 43 from the Human IL-17A V-PLEX\u2122 kit (cat. # K151RFD-4, Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, Md.). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using included reagents. The IL-17A V-PLEX\u2122 plates were read using the Meso Scale Discovery Imager (Model 1200). The levels of IL-17A were extrapolated from a standard curve using a four-parameter non-linear fitting model and expressed as pg\/mL. These values were regressed against concentrations of the tested compounds to derive ICvalues using a four-parameter non-linear fitting model.","hERG Assay (Assay 4)","Compounds of the invention were tested in vitro against the hERG (human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene) potassium ion channel (a surrogate for IKr, the rapidly activating delayed rectifier cardiac potassium ion channel).","The buffer was HEPES-buffered physiological saline (HB-PS) solution composed of: 137 mM NaCl, 4.0 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl, 1 mM MgCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, and 0.3% DMSO. Chemicals used in solution preparation were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), unless otherwise noted, and were of ACS reagent grade purity or higher.","HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells were stably transfected with hERG cDNA.","For the patch clamp experiment, onset and steady state inhibition of hERG potassium current was measured using a pulse pattern with fixed amplitudes (depolarization: +20 mV for 2 s; repolarization: \u221250 mV for 2 s) repeated at 10 s intervals from a holding potential of \u221280 mV. Peak tail current was measured during the 2 s step to \u221250 mV. A steady state was maintained for at least 30 seconds before applying compound or positive control (cisapride). Peak tail currents were measured until a new steady state was achieved.","Data acquisition and analyses were performed using the suite of pCLAMP\u00ae (ver. 8.2) programs (MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Steady state was defined by the limiting constant rate of change with time (linear time dependence). The steady state before and after each compound application was used to calculate the percentage of current inhibited at each concentration.","Concentration-response data were fit to an equation of the following form:\n\n% Inhibition={1\u22121\/[1+([Test]\/IC50)N]}*100\n","where [Test] was the compound concentration, IC50 was the compound concentration at half-maximal inhibition, N was the Hill coefficient, and % Inhibition was the percentage of current inhibited at each compound concentration. Nonlinear least squares fits were solved with the Solver add-in for Excel 2003 (Microsoft, WA) and the IC50 was calculated.","The results of assays 1 and 2 are shown in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0261","num":"0259"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"ROR\u03b3","ROR\u03b3t5X"]},{"entry":[{},"Binding Ki","IC50 Range*"]},{"entry":["Compound","Range* (nM)","(nM)"]},{"entry":["#","(Assay 1)","(Assay 2)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["2","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["3","+++",{}]},{"entry":["4","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["5","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["6","++",{}]},{"entry":["7","+++","++"]},{"entry":["8","+++","+"]},{"entry":["9","++",{}]},{"entry":["10","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["11","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["12","++",{}]},{"entry":["13","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["14","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["15","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["16","++",{}]},{"entry":["17","+",{}]},{"entry":["18","+++","+"]},{"entry":["19","+++","++"]},{"entry":["20","++",{}]},{"entry":["21","+++","+"]},{"entry":["22","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["23","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["24","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["25","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["26","+++","++"]},{"entry":["27","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["28","+",{}]},{"entry":["29","++",{}]},{"entry":["30","++",{}]},{"entry":["31","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["32","++",{}]},{"entry":["33","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["34","++",{}]},{"entry":["35","++",{}]},{"entry":["36","+++","+"]},{"entry":["37","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["38","++",{}]},{"entry":["39","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["40","++",{}]},{"entry":["41","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["42","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["43","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["44","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["45","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["46","+++","+++"]},{"entry":["47","+++","+++"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*+ means > 1000 nM;
