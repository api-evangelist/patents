Foote et al., filed on Jul. 11, 2003.","The present invention disclosure relates to a graphical computer interface which allows one or more users to interact with one or more real-world devices via by interacting with video images of the devices and their environment.","Interacting with the real world can be accomplished in various ways. At one extreme, a person can interact with it directly (e.g., push a door to open it). At another extreme, a person can interact with the real world through various levels of indirection such as with a control panel or a software program. Although direction interaction with the real world is probably the most intuitive way for a person to affect changes, sometimes such interaction is not possible due to dangerous conditions (e.g., manipulation of nuclear fuel), problems of scale (e.g., manipulation of the interior of a single cell organism), and problems of distance (e.g., teleconferencing).","Teleconferencing over the Internet is increasingly popular for many applications, such as distance learning. Through remote participation, students can attend classes from their dorm rooms, scientists can participate in seminars held in other countries, and executives can discuss critical issues without leaving their offices. There are many ways to support such activities: one-way audio broadcast, two-way audio communication, and two-way video communication. However, each is limited in the amount of intuitive interaction afforded to the participants.","The invention is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to \u201can\u201d or \u201cone\u201d embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.","In the following description, various aspects of the present invention will be described. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced with only some or all aspects of the present invention. For purposes of explanation, specific numbers, materials and configurations are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details. In other instances, well-known features are omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention.","Parts of the description will be presented in data processing terms, such as data, selection, retrieval, generation, and so forth, consistent with the manner commonly employed by those skilled in the art to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As well understood by those skilled in the art, these quantities take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, and otherwise manipulated through electrical, optical, and\/or biological components of a processor and its subsystems.","Various operations will be described as multiple discrete steps in turn, in a manner that is most helpful in understanding the present invention, however, the order of description should not be construed as to imply that these operations are necessarily order dependent.","Various embodiments will be illustrated in terms of exemplary classes and\/or objects in an object-oriented programming paradigm. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention can be practiced using any number of different classes\/objects, not merely those included here for illustrative purposes. Furthermore, it will also be apparent that the present invention is not limited to any particular software programming language or programming paradigm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"For purposes of clarity, video images are depicted in this illustration with simple drawings rather than with bitmaps of actual video signals. The drawings emphasize the physical devices that would be visible from the video images. The upper window  displays a panoramic video view of the location whereas the lower window  presents a close-up (or zoom) video view of a region  in the panoramic view. The zoom region can be any region in the panoramic view. The smaller the zoom region, the greater the magnification will be in the zoom view. In another embodiment, the zoom region can also be in the zoom view. In this case, the zoom view can be further magnified to show only the zoom region. In the location shown by the views, a number of devices are visible. A device can be controlled and\/or manipulated over a communication channel (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Internet, Bluetooth\u00ae, Infrared, etc.) By way of a non-limiting illustration, panoramic view  contains two displays ( and ), a portable computer  and a printer . There may also be other devices, such as speakers, microphones, lights, etc. Users (or participants) can interact with these physical devices through use of the GUI, as will be illustrated.","By way of a non-limiting example, the GUI can run as an application in a web browser, a stand-alone application or as a combination of the two. In one embodiment, the GUI can be implemented as a Java\u2122 applet. The Java programming language and run-time environment are available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. The GUI can run on any computing device that can connect to a network such as, and by way of a non-limiting-example, the Internet. By way of a further non-limiting example, the device could be a personal computer, a laptop or tablet computer, a personal data assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, a personal communication device, a wearable computing device, etc. Display devices can include plasma poster boards, projectors, video monitors, televisions, image projection systems, electronic whiteboards, etc.","The video streams are provided to the views (, ) by a special camera system (hereinafter referred to as \u201cFlySPEC\u201d) that includes a panoramic camera and a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera. The panoramic camera is fixed and provides a panoramic view of a location whereas the PTZ camera is able to pan, tilt and zoom which enables it to magnify portions of the location beyond the resolution of the panoramic camera. In one embodiment, the panoramic camera is constructed with two normal fixed cameras, and the PTZ camera is mounted on top of the panoramic camera. By locating the PTZ camera close to the panoramic camera, the coordinate system used by the PTZ camera can be approximated with the coordinate system used by the panoramic camera when a device of interest is relatively far away from the cameras. With such coordinate approximation, there is no need for a complicated coordinate transformation from the panoramic camera to the PTZ camera for purposes of moving the PTZ camera. In another embodiment, both cameras can have independent coordinates systems and a function can be provided to map from one system to the other.","In one embodiment, the FlySPEC panoramic camera can cover about 100\u00b0 field-of-view with two fixed cameras. Each fixed camera can have a 58\u00b0 field of view and a \u00bc\u2033 512 by 492 color CCD sensor. The PTZ camera can have a 48.8\u00b0 filed-of-view, a \u2153\u2033 768 by 492 color CCD sensor, and 12X optical zoom. Since the PTZ camera can pan from \u2212100\u00b0 to +100\u00b0, and tilt from \u221225\u00b0 to +25\u00b0, it can move to all positions covered by the panoramic system. Since the smallest filed of view for the PTZ camera is about 4.4\u00b0, the maximum magnification that the PTZ camera can achieve in one embodiment is approximately",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Magnification","max"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":["58","768"],"mo":"\u00d7"},{"mn":["4.4","512"],"mo":"\u00d7"}]},"mo":"=","mn":"19.77"}}}},"br":{}},"The present disclosure is not limited to having a single FlySPEC in a single location. Furthermore, the present disclosure contemplates multiple users accessing a given FlySPEC from different GUI's on different devices. When more than one user is utilizing a FlySPEC, conflicts may arise regarding use of the PTZ camera since different users may want to focus on different zoom regions. In one embodiment, a management algorithm coordinates conflicting camera commands. Commands from users are separated into groups of similar view requests. The PTZ camera can zoom in and allow users to see small devices clearly. On the other hand, the panoramic camera can provide different video streams to multiple users simultaneously, and can provide reasonable video for a wide field of view. A coordination algorithm uses the PTZ camera to serve the group with the most demanding (i.e., requesting highest zoom-in) image requests, and scales the panoramic camera image stream to serve general uses who do not need as much resolution.","Referring again to , there are user-selectable controls available for allowing a user to cycle through FlySPEC cameras within a given location, and to change locations. In one embodiment, the physical location of the FlySPEC in use by the GUI is evident from the window  title bar (\u201cConference Room B\u201d) as is the FlySPEC within the location (\u201cView \u201d). In another embodiment, a FlySPEC camera can be mounted on a mobile platform, such as a robot or other device, so that it can be repositioned within a given location, or change locations entirely. User-selectable control  will allow the user to change the physical location. By way of a non-limiting illustration, it may do so by providing the user with an interactive map of all potential locations. It may also allow the user to choose a FlySPEC within the new location as part of the location selection process. Alternatively, the GUI can connect to a FlySPEC in the new location that has been designated as the default or initial view. User-selectable control  allows the user to change FlySPEC cameras within a given location (if there is more than one) thus allowing the user to cycle through each FlySPEC until a desired view is achieved.","A user interacting with the GUI can choose the zoom region using any of a number of methods.  is an illustration of selection of a zoom region in one embodiment. The zoom region can be determined by using the end points of a diagonal line  drawn by the user in either view to serve as opposite corners of a bounding rectangle . The bounding rectangle  becomes the zoom region. The user can draw the diagonal line (which does not have to be straight) using any number of input devices, including but not limited to a mouse, a pen, a finger, voice commands, hand gesture, etc. If line drawn in the panoramic view , then the resulting zoom region is presented in zoom view . If a line is drawn in the zoom view, then that zoom view is further magnified to present just the region the user selected. In another embodiment, the user can select icon  which will set the zoom region to be centered around a mouse cursor (and having a default magnification) if the user clicks a mouse button while the cursor is one of the views. For example, if the user has selected icon  and then clicks a mouse button while the mouse cursor is in the panoramic view, the zoom region will occupy a region (of default size) centered around the point at which the mouse cursor was at the time of the click. It is contemplated that any input device (including those not yet conceived) used to select and manipulate devices in the video stream(s) is within the scope and spirit of this disclosure.","In addition to merely viewing devices in the panoramic view  and the zoom view , a user can interact with devices if the devices have \u201chot spots\u201d defined in one or more views.  is an illustration of device \u201chot spots\u201d in an embodiment. A hot spot is a region of a view that intersects a device in the video image stream (e.g., display, printer, scanner, speaker, computer, light control, etc.). Devices with hot spots can be manipulated through GUI . Hot spots in  are depicted for illustrative purposes by dashed rectangles. By way of a non-limiting illustration, when a user positions a mouse cursor (or some other input device) over a hot spot, an embodiment makes the user aware of the hot spot by automatically changing the default cursor to an intuitive icon (e.g., a printer icon to indicate a printer device). Instead of or in addition to changing the mouse cursor to an icon, call out boxes can be displayed indicating the name, type of device, and\/or device status. For example, there are two plasma display boards in  having call outs \u201cPlasma Display \u201d and \u201cPlasma Display \u201d, a fax machine (\u201cJoe's Fax Machine\u201d), a laptop computer (\u201cSue's Laptop\u201d) and a printer (\u201cPrinter  (off line)\u201d). In one embodiment, a user can force all hot spots and\/or call outs to appear by selecting icon .","Device hot spots can be defined statically or dynamically. In one embodiment, static hot spots can be defined with a tool that allows a user to specify a bounding region in a view ( or ) and associate device attributes with that region. By way of a non-limiting example, in  a user could specify a hot spot for printer device  by drawing a rectangle around it in view . After doing so, an input window could appear to allow the user to specify the printer's attributes. In this example, such information could include device type (printer), make, model, network address (e.g., uniform resource locator, Internet Protocol address, etc.), and GUI behaviors. GUI behaviors can include the following:\n\n","A device's GUI behaviors as well as its attributes can be naturally represented as a class in an objected-oriented software paradigm. In one embodiment, devices can be defined in a class hierarchy wherein more specific device types can inherit attributes and behaviors from less specific ones. By way of a non-limiting example, a \u201cLexmark E323\u201d printer class could inherit from a general \u201cLaserPrinter\u201d class. Besides the aforementioned GUI behaviors, a device class's methods could also include handlers for GUI events such as when a mouse cursor enters or exits the device's hot spot, mouse drag, mouse drop, mouse button activity, etc. Device definitions can be stored in a device database.","In one embodiment, dynamically defined hot spots can arise when a device with a radio transmitter attached to it emits a signal that is used to locate the hot spot for the device and also identify the device. By way of a non-limiting example, such a signal could conform to IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth\u00ae, or other wireless standards. If a given location has a radio direction finder (RDF) or similar device, devices with transmitters can have hot spots assigned to them dynamically by centering a hot spot region around the source of the transmission. Alternatively, the transmission itself could carry information pertaining to the location of the device. In one embodiment, the RDF can be located on a FlySPEC. The transmission can also identify the device either as a predefined device that exists in the device database or as a generic device. If it is a generic device, a device class that closely models its attributes and behaviors can be created for it dynamically. In another embodiment, the location of a device can be determined based on acoustic signal. A commercially available acoustic location finder is the IS-600 Mark 2 Precision Motion Tracker available from InterSense (Burlington, Mass.). In either case, the device class can have information regarding the physical dimensions of the device and this can be used together with the location information to define the bounding region of the device's hot spot. If the transmitted signal does not provide the device's location, the device's distance from the RFD can be estimated based on the strength of the transmission signal or, in another embodiment, by using radar.","In one embodiment, dynamically defined hot spots can arise through image pattern recognition of devices within the view of a FlySPEC. If the video streams coming out of the FlySPEC are analyzed for shapes that designate devices (e.g., printers, scanners, video monitors, etc.), these devices can be automatically added to the device database by creating device classes on the fly to model the attributes and behaviors of the devices so recognized. In another embodiment, if a dynamically recognized device has an IR (infrared) interface (as many audio\/visual devices do), its device class can include a behavior to render a control panel on the GUI. The control panel can allow GUI users to configure\/control the device by sending it IR commands. Such an embodiment contemplates including an IR transmitter in same location as the device. Optionally, the IR transmitter can be part of a FlySPEC. In another embodiment, a FlySPEC can be mounted on a mobile platform, such as a robot, so that it can be repositioned within a given location, or change locations entirely. Such a configuration would allow the FlySPEC to roam and control devices as it encountered them.","One way for a user to interact with a device in the GUI is through a device-specific control panel.  is an illustration of a pop-up control panel in one embodiment. As part of a device's behavior methods, a device can have a method that renders a control panel in response to a request by the GUI. By way of a non-limiting example, this can be trigged by the user selecting a mouse button while the mouse cursor is in a device's hot spot, through a voice command, through a mouse or hand gesture, etc. By way of a non-limiting illustration, plasma display board  has a control panel  that allows a user to control the display be interacting with the video image stream in view . The control panel includes an on\/off button  to turn the display on or off, a contrast button  to adjust the display's contrast, and a menu button  to access other display functions. All devices can have such pop-up control panels, which may themselves include many nested levels of GUI. Since multiple users may utilize the GUI on multiple computing devices, changes made to devices (e.g., via a control panel) by one user will be reflected in the views of all other users.","In another embodiment, users can interact with real world devices represented in video image streams by manipulating device information through a drag-and-drop metaphor. Drag and drop (D&D) works by a user selecting a source device in a GUI (e.g., by holding a mouse button down when the mouse cursor is over the device), \u201cdragging\u201d a representation (e.g., icon, image, etc.) of the device to another location in the GUI (e.g., by keeping the mouse button pressed down while moving the mouse cursor to the new location), and then \u201cdropping\u201d the representation (usually by releasing the mouse button) on a destination device. D&D is not limited to being accomplished by solely by mouse gestures. It could also be accomplished through voice commands, hand gestures, other mouse gestures, human eye tracking, etc. It will be appreciated that the present disclosure is not limited to a single user input device or method of interacting with a GUI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","100","500","102","104","108","110","114","112","500","502","506","508","510","504"]},"In addition to dragging files\/information from the user's local computing device to devices that appear in the live video views, the opposite also holds true. A user can drag information from a device in a video view ( or ) to the user's local device's desktop metaphor or file system. During the operation, the mouse cursor can change to represent the type of file\/information that is being transferred. By way of a non-limiting example, if the source of the D&D operation is a display device, the mouse cursor can be changed to a thumb-nail sketch of the current display on the display device. A file\/information dragged from a display device and dropped on the user's computing device (, , ) can contain a representation of the graphical information that was rendered on the display device at the time the D&D operation took place. In one embodiment, display devices (or processes that manage them) can implement image stacks. An image stack acts like a stack data structure (i.e., first-in, first-out) where the image on the top of the stack is the image that is actually displayed. When an file is \u201cdropped\u201d on a display, it is added to the top of the stack. When an image is \u201cdragged\u201d from a display, it is removed from the top of the stack and the new top of the stack is then displayed in its place. Again, when one user performs a D&D operation that causes a change in a view, that change will be evident to all other users who happen to be sharing that view (through other instances of the GUI).","In addition to dragging files\/information to and from a user's computing device, files or information can be dragged to\/from a devices that appear in views. By way of a non-limiting example, files\/information can be dragged between displays (, ). In one embodiment, when a file\/information is dragged from one display to another, the top of the source display device's image stack is removed and placed on the top of the destination display device's image stack. This has the effect of dragging an image from one display to another. Information\/files can also be dragged between displays and computing devices (, ), between displays and printers (, , ), and from computing devices to printers (). Again, when one user performs a D&D operation that causes a change in a view, that change will be evident to all other users who happen to be sharing that view (through other instances of the GUI).","In another embodiment, users can interact with devices and views by annotating them.  is an illustration of annotations in one embodiment. In one embodiment, an annotation tool  can be provided to allow users to make annotations (e.g. notes, drawings, etc.) on a view (, ) and\/or on a device as it appears in a view. When one user creates\/changes\/deletes an annotation, the result is visible to all other users who happen to be sharing that view (through other instances of the GUI). Annotation  is a hand-written name of a meeting participant (\u201cJohn\u201d) that in one embodiment can be drawn with a mouse after selecting annotation tool  in GUI . Annotation  is an example of an annotation drawn on display device  as it appears in a view. In this case, a user has circled a portion of the graph being displayed in one of the views (, ). If the display device (or its display management process) has implemented an image stack, the annotation can be applied to the image on the top of the stack (i.e., the currently displayed image). In one embodiment, if the annotation even partially overlaps the display device, it will be applied in its entirety to the top of the device's image stack. In another embodiment, only the portion of the annotation that overlaps with the display device will be applied to the device's image stack. All other users viewing that device will see the annotation (including viewers who are actually present where the device is located). In addition, the annotation can also be visible in the zoom view  if it is encompassed by the zoom region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"]},"Physical devices and the processes that enable manipulating them in a shared interactive environment can all be connected by one or more networks  (e.g., the Internet). Devices (-) may be distributed in one or more separate physical locations. Each location that is part of the shared interactive environment that has one or more FlySPEC devices. FlySPEC devices may have attached video server hardware (, ) to improve the performance of delivering image streams to multiple users. In one embodiment, one or more FlySPEC Manager processes  configure and control the FlySPEC devices. In one embodiment, the FlySPEC manager process can capture video streams from fixed cameras (on FlySPEC device(s)) and stitch them into a panoramic video stream in real-time. Video streams from the FlySPEC devices and\/or the FlySPEC manager(s) are provided to one or more end user computing devices (, ), depending on which locations and views are selected for viewing on each. Each end user computing device runs an instance of the GUI . One or more device controllers  are responsible for controlling the devices (-) based on ender user interaction with the GUI (e.g., through control panels, D&D, etc.). One or more device databases  can contain information (e.g., device classes) for each device (-), including devices that are dynamically added via image pattern recognition or RFD. In another embodiment, end user computing devices (, ) running instances of GUI  can be situated in a location and manipulated with other instances of GUI  executing on other devices.","Device tracker  is responsible for keeping track of newly discovered devices (e.g., devices that are discovered through radio frequency transmission or image pattern recognition). The device tracker creates new classes for these devices, defines their hot spots, updates the device database(s), and informs any affected GUI's of the new hot spots so that the end users may then interact with the new devices.
