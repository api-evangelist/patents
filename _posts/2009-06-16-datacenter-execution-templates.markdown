title: Datacenter execution templates
abstract: Deployment and execution of a service in a multiple datacenter environment may be facilitated using datacenter execution templates. Developers, business managers, and other interested parties may select and/or modify a declarative execution template embodying multiple factors. The execution template may then be used to generate an execution plan, which is then executed by datacenters which run the service. The execution template may be optimized after deployment of the service, allowing for ongoing adjustment in response to changing business, regulatory, and operational factors.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Datacenters maintained by a service host provide resources for service providers to operate an increasing variety of information services. Current highly complex datacenters may incorporate hundreds or thousands of computing and networking devices such as servers, routers, load balancers, caches, etc., which may be distributed across many modules, containers, backbones, floors, buildings, etc. As demand increases, the complexity of the datacenter environment will continue to grow.","Before the advent of highly complex datacenters, business managers, developers, and datacenter operators made numerous assumptions in the design, provisioning, and deployment of services. The ability to measure performance and respond to dynamic conditions was crude. Services were built and deployed to particular pieces of hardware in a particular datacenter. Changes to those builds and deployments were possible, but at considerable effort and cost. Government regulation of information services was small to non-existent.","Given these prior conditions contractual arrangements, such as service level agreements (SLAs), to provide resources to service providers were necessarily limited. Primitive conditions resulted in primitive SLAs. As a result, the increasing complexity of the datacenter and the ability to optimize datacenter resources has outstripped those traditional SLAs. Instead of one massive server specified in an SLA executing a service, the service may now execute on an array of virtual machines instantiated on demand across multiple pieces of hardware located in datacenters across many borders. Government regulations have evolved to recognize and regulate services provided by datacenter resources. Monitoring and control has grown richer and more dynamic, allowing better operational control. Service developers may not know, or care to know, where or on what hardware the service will run. Service hosts may not be aware of considerations unique to the service and\/or preferences of the developer. The coarse nature of the traditional SLA prevents optimization of existing resources, as well as the presentation and implementation of new operational boundaries.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A service may be deployed and executed in a datacenter environment using datacenter execution templates. Developers, business managers, and other interested parties may select and\/or modify a declarative execution template embodying multiple factors which may be dependent or independent of one another. These factors may include latency of response, datacenter throughput, energy consumption, data storage, legal impacts, environmental impacts, etc. Additionally, an estimated cost and performance of the service resulting from using various execution templates may be generated and compared.","The execution template may then be used to generate an execution plan. The execution plan may be implemented as a program written in a programming language, graph, extensible markup language (XML), configuration file, and so forth to allow automated provisioning and deployment of the service. The execution plan may then be implemented in one or more datacenters and\/or other network resources. The execution plan may operate at varying levels of granularity including multiple datacenters, individual datacenters, server containers, and discrete pieces of hardware.","While the service is running in one or more datacenters, the execution template may be optimized dynamically, allowing for ongoing adjustment of the service in response to the changing environment of the datacenter(s) and\/or preferences of the interested parties. Optimization includes modification of parameters until reaching a pre-determined threshold. This optimization may use actual or simulated data to test alternatives which are permissible within the constraints of the execution template. Once an optimized execution template is determined, it may be used to generate an updated execution plan, which may then be deployed in the datacenter(s).","This disclosure describes use of execution templates in the deployment of services executing in a datacenter. Developers, business managers, and other interested parties may select and\/or modify a declarative execution template embodying involving multiple factors. These factors may include latency of response, datacenter throughput, energy consumption, data storage, legal impacts, environmental impacts, etc. Templates may be constructed which minimize environmental impact, maximize datacenter throughput, maximize profit, minimize user delay, etc.","Interested parties may also generate scenarios for comparison, such as estimated costs and environmental impact on the service resulting from different execution templates. A business manager may see estimates as to the impact on service levels resulting from different execution templates. For example, the business manager may view estimated service levels for a template minimizing environmental impact and compare to another template configured to minimize user delay. In contrast to the flexibility afforded by execution templates, traditional SLAs were static documents with coarse parameters. Thus it was not possible to easily compare a variety of SLA options and determine impact across multiple dimensions such as financial, operational, environmental, etc.","Once selected, an execution plan is generated from the execution template. This execution plan may be implemented as a program written in a programming language, graph, extensible markup language (XML), configuration file, and so forth to allow automated provisioning and deployment of the service. For example, the execution plan may comprise a script designating the acceptable parameters for the service. The execution plan may be executed, deploying the service across network resources such as discrete hardware devices, servers, containers, datacenters, and so forth. Furthermore, the execution template and execution plan may be used to determine whether the service host has provided the services contracted for by the service provider.","After deployment, the execution template may be optimized dynamically, allowing for ongoing adjustment of the service in response to the changing environment of the datacenter(s). Optimization includes modification of parameters until reaching a pre-determined threshold. This optimization may use actual or simulated data to test alternatives which are permissible within the constraints of the execution template. Once an optimized execution template is determined, it may be used to generate an updated execution plan, which may then be deployed to the datacenters.","Generating and Using Execution Plan",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["100","100"]},"A service provider  is depicted which may include a business manager  and a developer , for example. In collaboration with business manager , developer  may construct service . Service  comprises the code necessary to implement a service application in a datacenter environment including one or more service hosts  or other network resources. By way of example and not limitation, service  may be an online retailer, mapping service, internet advertising service, protein folding service, facial recognition service, etc.","To facilitate datacenter templates, in one implementation, service  may be written without making assumptions about what environment, or in what locale, the service will execute in. This allows the service to be dynamically executed across a variety of systems. The code may also be written without any assumptions about where the data it is intended to access is located. For example, a database may be separate from the processing function allowing optimization of resources. The code may be written to allow for multiple independent copies to be executed simultaneously, with the code handling the possibility that it may execute more than once. Finally, the code may be written to allow for the possibility that the result it generates will not be completely accurate according to the absolutely latest version of the data it uses.","Examples of such tradeoffs between latency and correctness include an online airline reservation system. The reservation system cannot guarantee that in the time it takes a user to decide to make a reservation that the seat they are reserving has not been booked to another customer. If this happens, then the reservation system has overbooked the flight, which has a cost that the airline is willing to pay (e.g., offering benefits to customers willing to switch flights). Another example of the latency\/correctness tradeoff is an online news service. In fast breaking news, the information is not updated instantaneously, so the information available from a news site might be 10-30 minutes out of date. A similar situation may also occur in an online stock purchasing system. In all these cases, some mitigation is useful in the corner cases where unexpected things happen (e.g., the price of the stock drops dramatically in the period of a few minutes).","Business manager  may have in mind several requirements in how the service  is to be provided by service host . Service host  provides the architecture necessary for service  to run. Traditionally, the business manager  may have little knowledge of the operational capabilities of service host . Likewise, the service host  had limited information about the requirements of the service provider . With a traditional SLA these requirements may have been coarsely defined, and may only exist as a conversation between the two, which were never codified, and were thus easily lost. Furthermore, traditional SLAs were based on facilities and networks with a \u201cfive nines\u201d mentality which scaled up by adding resources to particular nodes (such as smaller and more remote datacenters) or datacenters. However, these complete infrastructure systems are redundant and expensive. In contrast to scaling up, next generation datacenters scale out by adding additional nodes to provide availability.","Business manager  may access an execution template manager (ETM) . The ETM  may provide business manager  with a selection of execution templates from an execution template library , such as maximum profitability, maximum sustainability, etc. Available templates are discussed in more detail below with respect to . ETM  may also provide cost and performance estimates based on those execution templates.","An operations manager  may be responsible for maintaining the overall health of service host 's overall architecture. Operations manager , or an automated process, may provide constraints to the ETM  based on current and projected conditions of the architecture.","Once the business manager  has reviewed the potential execution templates and selected and\/or modified one to meet the necessary requirements for service , an execution template  is generated. Execution template  may include environmental restrictions, geolocation restrictions, latency requirements, etc, and is discussed in more depth below with regards to . This execution template, as well as the code and\/or executable for service  are provided to an execution optimizer .","The execution optimizer  utilizes information about service , execution template , and access data  to build an optimized execution plan . Access data  may include which service components have been requested, actual latency of response, actual throughput of a datacenter, and so forth. Access data  is describe in more detail below with regards to .","Execution optimizer  may utilize several inputs including service , execution template , and access data  to generate an execution plan . Execution optimizer  is discussed in more depth below with regards to . While shown internal to service host , ETM  and\/or execution optimizer  may be provided by a third party.","Once execution plan  is generated, it is used to deploy service  across network resources (), . . . , (S). As used in this application, letters within parentheses, such as \u201c(S)\u201d or \u201c(C)\u201d, denote any integer number greater than zero. While shown internal to service host , network resources ()-(S) may be provided by one or more third parties. For example, service host  may be unable to provide a specialized payment processing function called for by service , thus this function may be accomplished using another service provider.","Once service  has been deployed across network resources ()-(S), network  may be used to provide service customers (), . . . , (C) with access to service  and\/or allow communication with remote network resources . Network  may be any type of communication network, including the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network, a wireless wide area network (WWAN), a cable television network, a wireless network, a telephone network, etc.","Execution Template",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["116","114","108","102","110","116"]},"A latency of response execution template () may be available. For example, this template would optimize the overall latency distribution, target latency distribution for specific customers, shift data to datacenters closer to the user, etc. In one implementation, this may take a declarative form as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Execute Service.Open(Customer: c, Data: d)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003overall latency distribution= \u201cbest effort\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003where c.CustomerType = \u201cgold\u201d set latency"]},{"entry":[{},"threshold < 50 milliseconds,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003data placement = \u201cclosest\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["202","1"]},"A throughput of datacenter execution template () may be available. For example, this template would focus on the scalability of the service with respect to a fixed set of resources.","A data storage execution template () may be available. In one implementation, this allows specification of assumptions regarding the importance of data and the cost of data loss. For example, lossy compression might be used for storing backup instances of photos\/videos if it was deemed sufficiently unimportant to maintain full copies.","A quality of response execution template () may be provided. In some services, it may be an appropriate business goal to provide reduced response quality for improved latency. For example, in a mapping service, it is more important to provide real-time responses than it is to make sure that traffic updates are up-to-the-minute.","A tax or legal impact execution template () acknowledges jurisdictional differences. While it is better if developer  is not required to take into account the tax implications of service , laws regarding requirements about audit trails, national boundaries, tax consequences etc. may have a significant impact on the business of the service provider . Capturing these requirements in a form that is not contained in the service  code itself allows re-optimization of the implementation as such requirements change. Unlike the traditional SLA, such changes may be done quickly and also provide awareness to the service host  of conditions which might otherwise go unheeded. This is particularly valuable in the context of the current rapid changes in business models, political and legal shifts, and social changes.","An environmental impact (or \u201cgreen\u201d) execution template () may be provided. There is a class of service providers, service hosts, and service customers that value environmental sustainability and will trade performance impacts against reduced environmental impact. Note that this is not the same as specifying the \u201clowest overall cost\u201d because environmental sustainability may in fact increase costs. For example, a particular datacenter that uses wind power might be preferred to one that does not even though it costs more to use it. Thus, this template may seek to maximize environmental sustainability by preferring network resources powered by renewable resources, having lowest power consumption, lowest carbon footprint, etc.","Service provider  may choose a maximum security execution template (). For example, this template may seek to minimize transmission of data over international communication links, require storage of data on highly secure storage devices in appropriate facilities, and require all data transfers be encrypted.","Where profitability is a concern, service provider  may select a maximum profitability execution template (). In one implementation, this template may try to maximize profitability by using more expensive resources to minimize customer delays under certain conditions, such as during a holiday.","A high customer privacy execution template () may be provided. For example, this template may seek to maximize anonymity of service customers  by placing data in other countries, splitting transactions across multi-national network resources, not logging service provider customer-specific information, etc.","Where cost is a concern, service provider  may select a minimum cost template (). In one implementation, this template may try to minimize overall costs by shifting processing to network resources which are cheapest, increasing latency to service customers which are consuming disproportionate quantities of resources, minimizing redundancy, etc.","Finally, custom execution templates () are possible. A service provider  may choose to combine multiple templates, modify an existing template, or otherwise set forth the statements regarding execution of their service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["114","108","114","108","102","114","302"]},"Execution template  may also contain service customer levels (), . . . (L). For example, there may be \u201cgold\u201d level () customers who pay a premium for service, \u201cbronze\u201d level customers () who pay a minimal amount for service, \u201ccopper\u201d level customers () who pay nothing for service, and other levels (L).","Execution template  may also contain execution constraints (), . . . , (B). For discussion purposes, the following constraints may be included.","Latency boundaries () may be defined in the execution template . For example, requests for web pages are to be provided between 20 and 100 milliseconds (ms).","Environmental sustainability () may be addressed. In one implementation, a service customer  may have the option to select a \u201cgreen\u201d plan which uses the minimal resources operating on renewable energy sources. As with any of these execution constraints, dynamic adjustment is possible. For example, as renewable energy resources vary in availability, the service may be executed on only those datacenters or devices which use renewable energy.","Data redundancy () may be constrained. For example, data of paying customers at Gold () and Bronze () levels may be replicated at one or more other datacenters, while data for Copper () level clients is not replicated. Furthermore, this constraint may also be varied dynamically. For example, where a natural disaster is anticipated, the constraint may be relaxed to replicate all customer data at other datacenters.","Financial limits () may be addressed. For example, a service provider  may wish to cap total costs at a certain monetary value per day, or utilize datacenters using power with the lowest rates.","Consideration of legal restrictions () is possible. For example, financial transactions may only be executed by processors located in Country B. In another example, a service provider  may choose to avoid execution in a particular jurisdiction to avoid taxes.","Frequency of data updates\/data \u201cfreshness\u201d () may be selected. For example, cached data may be permitted which is up to 30 minutes old. In another example, accuracy of results may be traded for speed of response, such as providing quick response to street navigation requests while only updating traffic conditions every hour.","Uptime () constraints may be specified. For example, service  must be available 99.99% of the time for paying customers (such as gold () and bronze ()) and 99.0% for non-paying customers (such as copper ()).","Service providers  may also specify a security level (). For example, certain types of highly sensitive data such as payment information must only be stored in a highly secure storage location.","Other execution constraints (B) may be used, such as limiting tasks by geolocation, whether data should be moved to the code or code to the data, how many copies of data are required, whether use of out of date copies of code\/data is permissible, etc.","Unlike clumsy traditional SLAs, the flexibility of the execution template  allows easy addition or modification. Business manager  may choose to rename a service level from \u201cCopper\u201d to \u201cAntimony\u201d by simply updating the execution template  in the execution template manager . Developer  may adjust or add new execution constraints  and have the service host  comply with those new execution constraints more easily than the traditional SLA's process of proposal, discuss, negotiate, implement.","Optimization of Execution Template",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["400","114","120","400","114","122","124","1"]},"Execution optimizer  may receive multiple inputs to determine the optimal set of parameters in an execution template for a service . For discussion purposes, inputs include execution template , service , and access data . Access data  may be actual data from activity in the datacenter, simulated data generated for test purposes, etc. In another implementation, inputs may include a set of possible algorithms or strategies for generating competing execution plans. Strategies may include a \u201cgreedy\u201d algorithm, exhaustive search of possible combinations, hill-climbing, simulated annealing, etc. For example, the \u201cgreedy\u201d algorithm may compute a total cost, assign a single result, and recompute a total cost.","Once the inputs have been received, at  an instance of the service is generated and executed using execution template . This execution may take place in a designated portion of the datacenter(s), simulated datacenter, etc.","At , performance of the instance executing the execution template  may be assessed by the execution optimizer . For example, response times, processor requirements, cache hits, etc., may be determined and compared against the constraints and boundaries of the execution template .","At , a cost estimate of the service running under execution template  may be generated by the execution optimizer . This cost estimate may be used to compare performance and cost of one template against another as well as different execution plans for the same template As actual cost data is received from access data , the estimate may be updated to more closely reflect actual costs.","At  a determination is made by the execution optimizer  as to whether optimized performance within the execution template has been achieved. Optimized performance occurs when the maximum number execution template constraints ()-(B) are closest to desired outcomes and are within the constraints placed by the execution template . When optimal performance is not achieved (i.e., the \u201cNo\u201d branch of ), at  the execution template parameters are modified within the execution constraints of the execution template  by the execution optimizer . This execution template with modified parameters is then returned to  for generation of an instance and assessment.","When optimal performance is achieved (i.e., the \u201cYes\u201d branch of ), at  the execution template is used by the execution optimizer  to generate an execution plan . This execution plan may include data and code specifying how the service is to be executed. The execution plan  is discussed in more detail below with regards to .","Illustrative Composition of Optimization Inputs",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["126","120","114","108","126"]},"Access data  may include which service components have been requested (). For example, data regarding what portions of service  have been called most frequently. This information may be used to cache that component to increase response time.","Actual latency of response () may be determined. For example, how long responses to service customers  actually took. This information may be used by business manager  to determine customer experience, and by developer  and operations manager  to determine potential bottlenecks.","Actual throughput of the datacenter () may be determined. For example, datacenter \u201cStateline\u201d was operating at 51% of available throughput. In particular, operations manager  may use this information to maximize usage of the datacenters and better allocate capacity.","Actual energy consumption () may be measured. For example, performing a processing task for 1000 users consumed 10 watts of electrical energy. This may be used by all parties to minimize power consumption, reduce overall costs, etc.","Measurements of actual data operations () performed. For example, what data was replicated between datacenters, how much data was read from remote storage, cache hits, etc. Knowledge of the ebb and flow of data throughout the datacenter(s) provides for better planning and management of resources. For example, perhaps datacenter A has a large data storage capacity, but is underutilized while datacenter B is at capacity.","Actual cost () of operations may also be part of access data . For example, what were the total financial costs of bandwidth, processor cycles, power, etc., which have been consumed.","Other access data (Z) may be used for optimization. For example, actual quality of response such as out of date information was delivered 35% of the time to users.","Illustrative Execution Plan",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["122","122","122","122","122","124","306","114","122"]},"Execution plan  may specify \u201cDo not replicate Copper level () customer data to other Datacenters\u201d (). This may be implemented because replication is expensive, and not considered worthwhile for customers who are not paying.","Execution plan  may also specify \u201cMinimize environment impact\u201d () by using the most sustainable, \u201cgreenest\u201d resources. For example, using hardware with long life cycles and\/or that use less power. Additionally or alternatively, the environmental impact script () may specify using a certain datacenter because it is powered by renewable energy sources.","\u201cReplicate Gold level () customer data at least hourly\u201d (). Perhaps Gold customers pay a premium for service, and demand greater fault tolerance, calling for the increasing replication demand.","\u201cRespond to all requests by paying customers within 100 milliseconds\u201d (). Thus, in this example, Gold () and Bronze () customers may be serviced out of closer, high performance datacenters while Copper customers are served from a more remote, less expensive, and less responsive datacenter.","\u201cStore financial data in high security storage\u201d (). This may be in response to contract requirements from credit card companies, requiring certain levels of performance.","\u201cExecute financial transactions only in a certain country\u201d (). This may result from a government regulation in one or more countries mandating such transactions occur only within the boundaries of the country. Or perhaps to realize tax advantages.","Implications of these statements in execution plan  on network resources  are illustrated in the following example.","Other execution plan statements may also be used. For example, \u201cset transfer size of data items between datacenters\u201d may be used. To minimize costs of datacenter-to-datacenter transfers, a minimum transfer size may be set to take advantage of the lower cost in transferring larger blocks, with a tradeoff of an increased delay in data accessibility to customers.","In another example, a \u201cbatch CPU tasks\u201d statement may be implemented. Requests for CPU usage would be aggregated into a batch to improve CPU performance at the cost of increased latency to customers. Thus, 1,000 requests from \u201cCopper\u201d level customers may be batched together and be computed at one time. As a result, some of the requests are waiting in the queue while it is filling up, but the CPU is more efficiently used by handling many similar requests at once than one at a time.","Illustrative of Execution Templates",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-6"],"b":["102","110","108","130","1","130","1","103","2","130","3","102","104","114","114","102","114","112","104","102","104","120","122"]},"In this example, assume that there are three service customer levels for service customers ()-(C). These are described above with respect to : \u201cGold\u201d level () customers who pay a premium for service, \u201cBronze\u201d level customers () who pay a minimal amount for service, and \u201cCopper\u201d level customers () who pay nothing for service .","These service customers  are distributed across North America.

The \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  includes a low power server () suitable for simple tasks, a high power server () capable of handling computationally intensive tasks, and has medium capacity storage () for data. \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  derives the majority of its power from the Arrow Lake hydroelectric plant . This power is moderately expensive, and also considered to be \u201cgreen\u201d because it is generated from a renewable source. \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  also benefits from the cool climate of Arrow Lake, and does not require additional cooling equipment.","User () is a Copper level customer who lives near the \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter  in Country B. The \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter  includes a high power server () suitable for handling computationally intensive tasks, and has large capacity storage () for data. \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter  derives the majority of its power from the Mohave coal power station . This power is generally moderately priced but may spike as coal prices change. Furthermore, the hot and dry climate in Mohave requires large, power hungry cooling equipment.","User () is a Gold level customer who lives near the \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter , which is also in Country B. The \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter  includes a low power server () suitable for simple tasks, and has high security storage () for data. \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter  derives the majority of its power from the Stateline Wind Project  which uses wind turbines to generate electricity. This power is generally highly priced, but is considered highly sustainable and thus very environmentally friendly, or \u201cgreen.\u201d","In this illustration, the datacenter environment comprises the three datacenters , , and , the network , and the access devices (not shown) of the service customers ()-(C). Thus, any service customer  may access any resource in any datacenter via network .","Execution plan  contained the statements as described above with respect to .

Other network resources  such as routers, storage area networks, sensor nodes, etc., have been omitted from this illustration for clarity in presentation only.","Upon receipt of execution plan , each datacenter has reacted differently, in accordance with the statements present in execution plan . For example, no datacenter will replicate data for Copper level service customers, in keeping with statement (). Execution plan  includes a priority to use the \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter  when available, then \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter , and finally \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter  when no other capacity is available given the statement to minimize environmental impact (). Each datacenter will update Gold level data at least every hour (). All requests by Gold and Bronze level customers will receive responses within 100 ms (), thus tasks for service customers  may be moved the datacenters closest to the service customers . However, in the event of an outage of \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter , to maintain the requirement to respond within 100 ms (), tasks may be handled by \u201cMohave\u201d Datacenter  which has faster high power servers capable of making up for latency of network .","Furthermore, financial data involving transactions in high security storage () will be stored only at \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter  as that is the only high-security storage area. Thus, requests to store financial data at any other datacenter would thus be refused. Finally, financial transactions are only to be executed in Country B () given current laws. Thus, only \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter  and \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter  may handle these transactions, even at the expense of greater environmental impact.","In practice, service customer () would thus have most of their requests processed at \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  due to the low latency afforded by proximity, low environmental impact, and high power server capacity available. However, financial transactions of service customer () would be processed in Country B, and financial data would be stored only at \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter .","Data for non-paying service customer () would be stored at \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  because of the greater environmental benefits () and as the 100 ms requirement () does not apply. Furthermore, in the event of an outage of \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter , service customer ()'s data would be unavailable due to the prohibition on replicating Copper level customer data () to other Datacenters.","Gold service customer () would see most tasks performed at \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  for the reasons given above with respect to service customer (). However, unlike service customer (), in the event of a failure at \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter , service customer ()'s data would have been replicated to, and available from, \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter . Thus, service customer () would not experience a service outage.","Assume that over time the requirements of service provider  have changed, as well as the legal environment and capabilities of the datacenters. A new treaty now permits financial transactions for Country B residents to be processed in Country A. \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  has been upgraded to include a high-security storage capability. \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter  now is powered entirely by solar panels after burning coal was banned. Customers in a new \u201cPlatinum\u201d customer service level are willing to pay a premium for response times less than 50 millisecond. Finally, access data  from users indicates \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter  suffers frequent outages due to lulls in the wind which turns the wind turbines.","Rather than re-coding service  to reflect these changes and re-deploying across the network resources , service provider  may simply update their execution template  with the new requirements. Execution optimizer , recognizing these changes in service provider  requirements and of the network resources , constructs a new execution plan optimized to the new conditions.","For example, because financial transactions may occur in Country A and the \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  now has high security storage, this datacenter takes on more tasks, including many of those previously handled by the unreliable \u201cStateline\u201d datacenter . A larger percentage of tasks which are processor intensive may now be balanced to the new \u201cgreener\u201d \u201cMohave\u201d datacenter , rather than only being used as a last resort. Data for Platinum customers is distributed to the closest datacenter and additional cache resources are allocated at each to meet the new response time requirements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["702","702","802","1","802","2","802","3","802","702","802","1","802","2","702","1","702","3","802","3","702","2","702","3"]},"Datacenter  may be divided into various physical and\/or logical sections. As discussed earlier, execution template  and execution plan  may operate at levels of granularity includes these sections and\/or discrete components within them. Shown here within datacenter  is a high availability section , indicated with a broken line. Operational elements such as server container () and () within this high-availability section  benefit from additional infrastructure to maximize uptime. For example, server container () has a redundant server container () to provide a hot spare which is available to take over the functions of () in the event of a failure. A backup power  system such as a battery bank and generator are available to handle electrical outages. A backup cooling system  is also available should a primary cooling system fail.","Datacenter  may also include a regular availability section , indicated in this illustration by an alternating dotted and dashed line. Operational elements such as server containers ()-(Q) within this section do not enjoy the additional infrastructure provided in the high availability section . For example, in the event of a power outage, server containers ()-(Q) in the regular availability section  would be offline as they are not connected to backup power .","Datacenter  may be divided into various other sections, such as a \u201cgreen\u201d section  which utilizes renewable power sources, a high security section having more stringent physical security barriers and restricted access to personnel, etc.","The execution templates described in this application have operated at a datacenter level. However, execution templates may act on a variety of levels including collections of datacenters, individual datacenters, containers, modules, and discrete hardware. This additional granularity provides flexibility to the management of service  within the boundaries of execution template .","For example, server container () in the \u201cArrow Lake\u201d datacenter  may normally operate on solar power, and thus reside within a \u201cgreen\u201d section of the datacenter. Execution plan  may be extended to a container level within the datacenter. Given execution plan 's statement () to minimize environmental impact, resources in server container () may be preferred for use over those of server container () running in the non-\u201cgreen\u201d section in the same datacenter , or even non-\u201cgreen\u201d sections in other datacenters.","Although specific details of illustrative methods are described with regard to the figures and other flow diagrams presented herein, it should be understood that certain acts shown in the figures need not be performed in the order described, and may be modified, and\/or may be omitted entirely, depending on the circumstances.
