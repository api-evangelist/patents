{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to a mounting system. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to a mounting system for military shelters.","Military operations often require a shelter that is easily transported. Shelters are often modified and populated with electronics, and other equipment, to satisfy a mission peculiar application. Standard shelters come equipped with a limited number of tie down and lift provisions. Typically each shelter comes equipped with one tie-down and one lift ring located at each corner.","Shelters can be transported by air, ground or sea. When transported by air, shelters are secured to an airborne certified mission pallet, and the pallet is secured to the aircraft's cargo handling system rails and detents. At the time military shelters were introduced to the United States military, shelter tie down provisions were sufficient for structurally securing the shelter in the cargo area of an aircraft. However, command evaluation of military aircraft service history has resulted in more restrictive crash load criteria. This criteria enhances survivability in the event of a hull loss incident, but limits the applications of newly modified shelters without the installation of additional tie-down points on the shelter and\/or structural modifications\/re-designs. This results in weight increases to accommodate hard point additions in the shelter frame, in addition to the weight of the pallet itself. In addition, this adds additional problems of prepositioning the pallets, as well as additional wear and tear on the pallets and aircraft, as well as risks in the shelter shifting in transit.","Ground transportation of shelters requires the use of chain tie-down assemblies to secure the shelter to a transport vehicle. Use of chains presents a safety risk for shelter shifting in transit.","Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a mounting system for shelters that incorporates the listed benefits without the limitations inherent in present methods.","The instant invention is directed to a mounting system that satisfies the needs enumerated above and below.","The present invention is directed to a mounting system that includes an angle assembly and a supporting understructure. The angle assembly is mountable on longitudinal sides of the shelter and the shelter is mountable on the understructure. The angle assembly is attached to the understructure.","The present invention is directed to a mounting system that allows a shelter to be installed on transport equipment with a standard cargo handling system.","The present invention is directed to a mounting system that minimizes use of special handling equipment or special mounting equipment such as pallets or chains.","The present invention is directed to a mounting system that ties into the main frame of the shelter.","The present invention is directed to a mounting system that minimizes wear and tear on transport equipment.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by way of example below and in . As seen in , B and , the mounting system for a shelter  includes an angle assembly  and a supporting understructure . The angle assembly  is mountable on longitudinal sides  of the shelter , specifically the bottom portion  of the longitudinal sides . The shelter  is mountable on the understructure .

The side base plate strip  may be located at an end of the side base plate  and protrude above the rest of the side base plate . In the preferred embodiment of the side base plate  there may be two side base plate strips , each located on opposite ends of the side base plate .","The bottom base plate  may include a bottom base plate aperture  and a bottom base plate notch . There may be two or more bottom base plate apertures  and they may be lineally somewhat evenly spaced along the bottom base plate . There may be two or more bottom base plate notches  which may be somewhat evenly spaced along the outer bottom base plate  (on the side opposite to the one adjacent to the side base plate ).","As seen in , the fitting assembly  comprises of a bottom plate , a side plate , and a stiffener brace . The bottom plate  is attached to the bottom base plate , while the side plate  is attached to the side base plate . The bottom plate  may be attached to the bottom base plate  by any type of fastener , while the side plate  may also be attached to the side base plate  by any type of fastener . The bottom plate  is substantially parallel to the bottom base plate , while the side plate  is substantially parallel to the side base plate . In the preferred embodiment, the bottom base plate  extends past the bottom plate . The stiffener brace  is able to brace the bottom plate  and the side plate  such that the bottom base plate  and side base plate  are substantially perpendicular to each other when in the extended or open position.","As seen in , the fitting assembly  further includes a closed or stowed position such that the bottom plate  (and the bottom base plate ) and the side plate  (and the side base plate ) are substantially parallel. As seen in , the fitting assembly  includes an open or extended position such that the bottom plate  (and the bottom base plate ) and the side plate  (and the side base plate ) are substantially perpendicular. The closed or stowed position may be utilized in the ground mode while the open or extended position may be utilized in the transport mode. As seen in , in the open or extended position, the mounting system  can be used to secure the shelter  to a standard aircraft cargo handling system  located on the aircraft floor .
