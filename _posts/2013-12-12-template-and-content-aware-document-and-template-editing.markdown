For example, the user device  may execute a portion or portions of the networked application  using information previously received from the server  and stored on the user device . Although the user device  and the server  are shown separately, they may be combined. For example, a physical device, such as the computing device  shown in  may execute the user device  as a first logical device and may execute the server  as a second logical device.","In some implementations, the networked application  may generate files, folders, or documents, such as spreadsheets or word processing documents. The files, folders, or documents, may be created and stored on the user device , the server , or both. For example, a document may be created and stored on the server  and a copy of the document may be transmitted to the user device .

For example, in , the text \u201cMembers:\u201d may be express content. In some implementations, the express content \/\/ may be static, constant, or otherwise protected from modification in the document .","In some implementations, a document  may include placeholder content , which may include content specified as placeholder content in a template associated with the document .

For example, the data source information may indicate another object in the current document or an object in another document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","500","500","600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"For example, Template 1 shows an example of a portion of a task list template using a whitespace, such as a carriage return, to delimit rules. Although each rule is delimited on an individual line, rules may be delimited using any symbol, or combination of symbols, which may include whitespace, capable of distinguishing rules. For example, a semicolon may be used to delimit rules, such that the first two rules of the template specification shown in Template 1 may be expressed as shown in Template 1B.","In some implementations, a rule, such as the first rule in a template specification may include an identifier of the template, such as a name of the template. For example, in Template 1, the first rule \u201cTaskList=Task+\u201d includes a name, \u2018TaskList\u2019, for the template.","In some implementations, a rule may indicate an object and an object definition, or replacement setting, for the object. For example, in Template 1, the first rule \u201cTaskList=Task+\u201d may indicate an object, \u2018TaskList\u2019, and an object definition, \u201cTask+\u201d. In some implementations, an object, which may represent a discrete collection of information, may be expressed as a symbol, such as \u2018TaskList\u2019, which may be a terminal or nonterminal symbol. In some implementations, an object definition may be expressed as an expression that may include one or more symbols, such as objects and modifiers. Although rules are described herein using the equality operator (=) to distinguish an object from an object definition, any symbol, or combination of symbols, which may include whitespace, capable of distinguishing an object from an object definition may be used. For example, the first rule shown in Template 1 may be expressed as \u201cTaskList:Task+\u201d.","In some implementations, an object definition may include one or more objects, such as system objects, which may be expressed as terminal symbols, or custom objects, which may be expressed as nonterminal symbols. For example, a template specification may include the rule \u201cTask=Title\u201d and the rule \u201cTitle=text\u201d. The object definition indicated in the rule \u201cTask=Title\u201d includes the \u2018Title\u2019 object, which may be a custom object, such as an object that is defined in another rule in the template specification, such as the rule \u201cTitle=text\u201d. The object definition indicated in the rule \u201cTitle=text\u201d includes the \u2018text\u2019 object, which may be a system object.","In some implementations, a custom object may be defined in the template specification. For example, in Template 1, the custom object \u2018Task\u2019 may be defined by the second rule \u201cTask=Status Title Description?\u201d, which may indicate that the \u2018Task\u2019 object may include a \u2018Status\u2019 object, a \u2018Title\u2019 object, and a \u2018Description\u2019 object. In some implementations, a template specification may include a rule defining each custom object included in the template.","In some implementations, an object definition for a system object may be omitted from a template specification. For example, in Template 1, the rule \u201cTitle=text\u201d may indicate that the object \u2018Title\u2019 may include the system object \u2018text\u2019. In some implementations, the template and content aware document and template editing system, or a portion thereof, such as the productivity application, may define one or more system objects. For example, the system object \u2018text\u2019 may be defined by the productivity application as a paragraph of text.","In some implementations, an object indicated in an object definition may be associated with one or more modifiers. For example, the one-or-more modifier, which may be expressed as using, for example, the plus symbol (+), may be associated with an object and may indicate that a document generated based on the template may include one-or-more of the object. For example, the rule \u201cTask Template=Task+\u201d may indicate that the \u2018TaskList\u2019 object may include one or more \u2018Task\u2019 objects.","In some implementations, the zero-or-more modifier, which may be expressed using, for example, the asterisk (*), may be associated with an object and may indicate that a document generated based on the template may include zero or more of the object. For example, the rule \u201cTask=text*\u201d, may indicate that the \u2018Task\u2019 object may include zero-or-more \u2018text\u2019 objects. In some implementations, a modifier may indicate the minimum and maximum instances of an object in a document generated based on a template. For example, the modifier {2,4} may indicate that a document may include two, three, or four instances of an object.","In some implementations, the optional modifier, which may be expressed using, for example, the question mark (?), may be associated with an object and may indicate that the object is optional. For example, in Template 1, the second rule \u201cTask=Status Title Description?\u201d, may indicate that the \u2018Task\u2019 object may include a \u2018Status\u2019 object, a \u2018Title\u2019 object, and an optional \u2018Description\u2019 object.","In some implementations, the set modifier, which may be expressed using an opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis (( )), may be associated with a set of objects and may indicate that the objects are related. In some implementations, the alternate modifier, which may be expressed using, for example, a vertical line (|) may be associated with a set of objects and may indicate that the objects are alternates. For example, in Template 1, the third rule \u201cStatus=(Pending|Finished)\u201d may indicate that the \u2018status\u2019 object may include a \u2018Pending\u2019 object or a \u2018Finished\u2019 object. In some implementations, the alternates modifier may be used in combination with the set modifier, as shown in the third rule of Template 1. In some implementations, the alternates modifier may be used independently of the set modifier. For example, the third rule of Template 1 may be expressed as \u201cStatus=Pending|Finished\u201d. Although the objects associated with the alternates modifier are shown in Template 1 as having object definitions that include express content, objects associated with the alternate modifier may have object definitions that include placeholder content or that do not include content.","In some implementations, an object definition may include content, such as express content, which may be included as express content in a document associated with the template, or placeholder content, which may be omitted from a document associated with the template and may be included in a user interface for accessing the document. In some implementations, the content may be defined as a string of text using the string modifier, which may be expressed as a pair of quotation marks (\u201c \u201d).","In some implementations, an object definition may include express content as a string that is not associated with, or proximate to, an object in the object definition.

For example, the current document may include the dynamic content  from the source document  as shown in interface , the productivity application may identify a change in the data source information in Template 6 from \u2018List.Project\u2019 to \u2018List.Project.Name\u2019 and may update the current document to include the content of the instances of the \u2018Name\u2019 object from the source document  and omit the other content of the source document . In another example, the productivity application may identify a change in the source document identifier in Template 6 indicating a change from a first source document generated based on Template 5 to a second source document generated based on Template 5, and the productivity application may update the current document to include the content of the second source document and omit the content of the first source document.","In some implementations, the productivity application may perform dynamic content filtering in response to a change in the source content. For example, the instance of the object identified as the conditional content source in the current document may include the content \u2018JohnDoe\u2019, as shown in interface , and the productivity application may include a first instance of the \u2018Project\u2019 object  from the source document  shown in , a second instance of the \u2018Project\u2019 object  from the source document  shown in , and a third instance of the \u2018Project\u2019 object  from the source document  shown in  in the current document, as shown in interface , based on the dynamic content definition. The source document  may be modified to remove the content \u2018JohnDoe\u2019 from the first instance  of the \u2018Project\u2019 object in the source document . The productivity application may identify the change in the source document , may evaluate the dynamic content definition, and may update the current document to omit the instance  of the first \u2018Project\u2019 object from the current document.","In some implementations, the productivity application may perform dynamic content filtering in response to a change in the source template. For example, the source template, Template 5, may be updated to include a \u2018Date\u2019 object that includes the express content \u201cDate:\u201d, and the productivity application may update the current document to include instances of the \u2018Date\u2019 object that include the express content \u201cDate:\u201d.","In some implementations, dynamic content generation as shown in  and dynamic content filtering as shown in  may be combined. In some implementations, a dynamic content definition may include a source document identifier, data source information, filter criteria, and conditional content source information, and the data source information, the filter criteria, the conditional content source information, or a combination thereof, may include a functor. For example, the data source information for the dynamic content definition shown in Template 6 may be \u201cLength List.Project\u201d and the document shown in  may include the dynamic content \u201c3\u201d. In another example, the filter criteria and conditional content source information for the dynamic content definition shown in Template 6 may be \u201cLength (Project.Members.Employee.text=this.Resume.UserIdentifier.text)<=2\u201d and the document shown in  may include the dynamic content  shown in interface .","In some implementations, template and content aware document and template editing may include generating and sending notifications. For example, monitoring source content, such as the source content monitoring shown at  in , may include generating and outputting one or more notifications in response to detecting a change in the source content. In some implementations, updating target information, such as the target information updating shown at  in , may be performed in response to receiving information, such as user input data, indicating a request to update.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0247","num":"0246"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","300","100","100","3210","3220","3230","3240","3250","3260","3270"]},"In some implementations, a document template may be identified at . For example, a user may initiate a productivity application, such as a networked productivity application, and a template may be identified in response to user input indicating the template, such as the selection of a template from a list of templates.","In some implementations, template rules may be identified at . For example, a template identified at  may be associated with a template specification that may include a sequence of template rules.","In some implementations, dynamic structure may be identified at . For example, the template specification identified at  may include a rule including dynamic content information, such as the dynamic content information  shown in , and dynamic structure may be identified based on the dynamic content information. In some implementations, the dynamic structure may include a template structure, or a portion of a template structure, of a source template. In some implementations, the dynamic content information may indicate a source document generated based on a source template, and identifying the dynamic structure may include a template structure, or a portion of a template structure, for the source template.","In some implementations, a dynamic content definition may include an identifier, such as a GUID, identifying a source template other than the current template. For example, the source template may be a \u2018Project\u2019 template, multiple \u2018Project\u2019 documents, each including information related to a project, may be generated based on the \u2018Project\u2019 template, a template ID identifying the \u2018Project\u2019 template may be included in a dynamic content definition in a \u2018Projects\u2019 template, and a document generated based on the \u2018Projects\u2019 template may include content from each of the \u2018Project\u2019 documents as dynamic content based on the dynamic content definition.","In some implementations, a template structure may be generated at . For example, the template structure may include the objects indicated in the template specification, which may include the dynamic structure identified at .","In some implementations, input data may be received at . For example, the productivity application may generate and present an interface, such as a user interface, for interacting with the template generated at , which may include using the template structure generated at , and may receive input data via the interface. In some implementations, the productivity application may receive input data indicating, for example, a mouse click on a text field, a change of focus, a keystroke, such as the enter key or the tab key, a combination of keystrokes, such as shift-tab, alt-up, or alt-down, or any other input related to the template.","In some implementations, the template structure may be altered at . For example, the template structure may be altered in response to the input received at . In some implementations, alterations to the template structure may be based on a current state of the productivity application interface, the input data received at , the template specification, or a combination thereof. For example, objects may be added, modified, or removed from the template structure.","In some implementations, the template may be output at . For example, the template may be stored on a memory, such as memory  shown in , or transmitted via a communication network, such as the network  shown in .
