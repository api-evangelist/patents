No. 10\/318,749 entitled \u201cSystems, Methods, and Computer Program Products to Manage the Graphical Display of Data Entities and Relational Database Structures,\u201d filed on the same date herewith, by Khatchatrian, et al., assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference, there is described a method of novelly describing and displaying relational database tables and their relationships to OLAP entities. Although not limited thereto, the present invention employs such a method in one of its preferred embodiments.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to the field of graphical displays of database information. It is more particularly directed to efficiently modifying the graphical display of a typically large number of data objects.","2. Description of the Background Art","A computer-implemented database is a collection of data, organized in the form of tables. A table typically consists of columns that represent data of the same nature, and records that represent specific instances of data associated with the table. A relational database is a database that may be a set of tables containing information that is manipulated in accordance with the relational model associated with the data. The product marketed under the trademarks IBM DB2 stores the data associated with the database in tables, and each table has a name.","On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a computing technique for summarizing, consolidating, viewing, analyzing, applying formulae to, and synthesizing data according to multiple dimensions. OLAP software enables users, such as analysts, managers, and executives, to gain insight into performance of an enterprise, such as a corporation, through rapid access to a wide variety of data dimensions that are organized to reflect the multidimensional nature of enterprise data, typically by means of hypotheses about possible trends in the data. More particularly, OLAP techniques may be used to analyze data from different viewpoints by identifying interesting associations in the information in a database. Therefore, OLAP is a decision support technique used in data management for the purpose of modeling and analyzing business information.","An increasingly popular data model for OLAP applications is the multidimensional database (MDDB). Often, data analysts use MDDBs during interactive exploration of business data for finding regions of anomalies in the data. Before this data can be explored, modeling needs to be enabled for the business. Modeling a business for an OLAP application may require typically large amounts of metadata including data entities.","In the past graphics tools have used objects, such as rectangle displays, to represent data entities, such as relational database tables and OLAP data. The objects are displayed so that they present the relationships between the data contained in the relational database tables and between the OLAP data. It is useful to represent these data entities with as much contextual information as possible to enhance the presentation of the data for use in data modeling and analysis. Given the large amount of OLAP data associated with databases, such as multidimensional databases and relational databases, there may be many objects in the graphical representation. Further, the objects may be manipulated by techniques such as enlarging, minimizing, and moving the objects within the graphical display during creation and manipulation of the business data model. Some of the problems caused by object manipulation during the analysis of the data entities in a graphical display are that representations of the objects may be obscured or difficult to read, and that the contextual reference of the objects may be lost.","For example, scrolling of the graphical display windows typically associated with the presentation of the objects allows other objects to be viewed but has the disadvantage of losing the contextual reference for some of the objects. That is, during scrolling some of the objects may not be visible to the user, thereby losing the contextual reference of those objects. Also, zooming out operations to enable viewing of more objects in the graphical display typically results in the indiscriminate reduction in the size of individual objects. This has the disadvantage that the text within the individual objects is typically rendered too small to read so that the user must repeatedly zoom in to see details of the objects and zoom out to view the contextual relationship of the objects.","Yet another example of the difficulty of managing the graphical display of a large number of data entities occurs when the user is allowed to move the objects thereby enabling flexibility in graphical display but having the disadvantage that the user must constantly reposition the objects as they are expanded and minimized. For example, when a large number of objects are moved, typically one or more of the moved objects obscures the display of other objects thereby reducing contextual information on the graphical display. This type of operation also may require the user to iteratively expand and minimize objects to maintain the information about the contextual relationship of the moved objects.","It would therefore be useful to be able to efficiently analyze typically large amounts of entity information with a graphical display that retains all or most of the relevant contextual information and minimizes distortion of the graphical display. More particularly, when employing OLAP processing techniques that manipulate objects it would be useful to be able to efficiently analyze multidimensional data with a graphical display that minimizes the disadvantages associated with current graphical displays. From the foregoing it will be apparent that there is still a need to improve the graphical display of a typically large number of objects to retain contextual information and minimize graphical display distortion thereby enhancing analysis of the objects and the associated data by techniques such as data mining of relational database information and OLAP data.","An embodiment of the present invention relates to systems, methods, and computer products that efficiently present typically large amounts of entity information in a graphical display that retains all or most of the relevant contextual information about the entities. More particularly, the preferred embodiment of the present invention enables efficient analysis of data with a graphical display that improves data analysis by minimizing distortion of the text in the graphical display, retaining contextual information associated with data objects in the graphical display, and positioning the objects to optimally represent relational database associations. Techniques of the past have not been able to sufficiently improve the graphical display of a typically large number of objects that may be used with data analysis techniques such as data mining of relational database information or multidimensional data, and OLAP data.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention employs a technique that enables expansion of some objects that represent entities while also presenting other non-expanded objects within the graphical display in a manner that retains all or most of the contextual information. The preferred embodiment of the present invention may rely on a typical star schema layout of data entities that includes a facts object, typically containing a single facts table, in the center of the display surrounded by dimension objects. A star schema is a set of relational tables including multiple main tables, sometimes referred to as fact tables, and related dimension tables wherein the dimension tables intersect the main tables via common columns and wherein the dimension tables are each associated with a column in the main tables corresponding to each of the rows in the dimension tables. Because a star schema is simple, having few tables, it minimizes the complexity required to process database operations. This helps both to increase performance speed and to ensure correct results of database operations. Therefore many relational databases have been built in a star schema configuration to minimize database management overhead.","More particularly the star schema comprises fact tables, which are joined to one or more dimension tables according to specified relational or conditional operations. The fact tables hold measurement data, while the dimension tables hold attribute data. The dimension tables are usually joined to the fact tables with an equivalence condition.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention takes advantage of the star schema configuration to manage graphical display enlargement and movement of at least one object within a particular area when the object is expanded. That is, the affinity of objects in the same area is recognized and exploited by the preferred embodiment of the present invention that modifies objects that are contained in the area that includes an expanded object and that are therefore associated with the expanded object. The preferred embodiment of the present invention novelly represents the star schema configuration by areas that represent fact objects or dimensions, and an affinity between associated objects in the area is identified and represented in the graphical display.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention splits the graphical display into three areas: a left area, a center area, and a right area. The facts object is placed in the center area and the dimensions are distributed between the left area and the right area. It will be understood that the present invention may operate on a different number of areas, either less than or greater than three areas. When an object is expanded it causes the associated area to also expand, which causes the neighboring areas and their contents, such as objects, to adjust their position, typically by moving, to minimize distortion and to retain contextual information.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the point of origin of the graphical display is the upper left corner of the graphical display. Further and since the point of origin is the upper left corner, the objects contained in areas that are not expanded, and presumably not being analyzed, are moved to the right, and if necessary are moved out of the viewing area of the graphical display. It will be appreciated that the present invention may be embodied in a graphical display that represents greater than two dimensions. Therefore the movement may be in vertical, horizontal, or other directions.","Also, in one embodiment of the present invention that relies on the star schema configuration, the objects in the left area are right aligned and the objects in the right area are left aligned. The objects in the center area are center aligned. This helps optimize the representation of connecting lines in the graphical display that are used to illustrate associations between the facts objects and the dimension objects. That is, positional justification of objects to ensure that the objects are grouped toward the center of the graphical display reduces the instance of connecting lines crossing over other connecting lines.","An embodiment of the present invention is achieved by systems, methods, and computer products that improve the graphical display of a large number of objects that may be used with data analysis techniques such as data mining of relational database information, multidimensional data, and OLAP data. A method comprises: (a) identifying the entities in a collection of data, (b) mapping the entities to objects that are represented in a graphical display, (c) identifying the objects in at least one area; (d) associating the objects within each area together by techniques such as showing connecting lines that illustrate associations between objects; (e) as necessary and to respond to manipulation of an object within an area, minimizing display distortion and retaining contextual information by: (i) enlarging or reducing the size of the area, and moving and realigning the other objects within the same area, (ii) moving objects in other areas that have not been adjusted in size to accommodate change in the area containing the manipulated object, and (iii) adjusting the position of objects within other areas, both in the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction, to accommodate the new position of objects in the area that underwent a size change.","An embodiment of the present invention novelly divides the graphical presentation into areas and allows objects to be manipulated independently within each area. This provides added flexibility when attempting to present many objects concurrently. It will be appreciated that the operation of the present invention is not limited to a relational database, a multidimensional database, or OLAP applications but may be applied to any computer-based graphical presentation that includes a large number of objects. Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.","In the following detailed description and in the several figures of the drawings, like elements are identified with like reference numerals.","As shown in the drawings and for purposes of illustration, an embodiment of the invention efficiently presents typically large amounts of entity information with a graphical display that retains all or most of the relevant contextual information and minimizes distortion of the graphical display. Existing systems have not been able to sufficiently improve the graphical display of a typically large number of objects that represent data entities. The objects may be used with data analysis techniques such as data mining of relational database information, multidimensional data, and OLAP data. The present invention may be implemented with a graphical display having at least one area that includes objects. The present invention enables users to analyze large amounts of data represented as objects in the graphical display by partitioning the graphical presentation into areas and by allowing manipulation of objects within each area as a unit. That is, the objects are manipulated independently of objects in other areas. This provides added flexibility when attempting to present many objects concurrently. Further, an embodiment of the present invention enables efficient analysis of data represented in the graphical display by minimizing distortion of the text in the graphical display, retaining contextual information associated with data objects in the graphical display, and positioning the objects to optimally represent relational database associations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 9"],"b":["100","102","104","120","102","104","104","102","117","120","126","126","117","119","118","110","958","102","104","110","122","958"]},"According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the object manager module  operates by generating a graphical display  that preserves contextual information associated with a large number of objects  in at least one area .

By means of example, data analysis is typically facilitated by scrolling the graphical display . During scrolling some of the objects  may not be visible to the user, thereby losing the contextual reference of those objects .

Such operations may require enlarging and minimizing the objects . When an object  is enlarged the preferred embodiment of the present invention novelly recognizes that the associated objects  in the same area  will also be analyzed and therefore the preferred embodiment of the present invention modifies the associated objects  to facilitate such analysis. When an area  under analysis is enlarged, the operation of the present invention causes the position of neighboring areas  to be adjusted to preserve contextual information and minimize distortion of the objects , typically by moving the neighboring areas  to create more space on the graphical display  for the enlarged area . This retains much of the contextual information in the enlarged area  thereby enhancing the presentation of the data  for use in data analysis operations such as data mining.

The right area  may be moved so far to the right that it is no longer contained in the viewing area of the graphical display .

In the present example the following objects  in the left area  are also moved downwards to accommodate the newly enlarged Product_Dimension Object : Time_Dimension Object  and Country_Dimension Object . Also, the objects  in the center area  and the right area  are moved downward since they are vertically aligned within their areas  toward the center of the graphical display . That is, the new vertical movement of the objects  in the center area  and the right area  realigns these objects.  with the newly aligned objects  in the left area . By expanding and repositioning the representation of objects  in the left area , analysis of the objects  in the left area , which is presumably undergoing increased data analysis, is facilitated.","Also and in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the center area  and the right area  are moved to the right. The movement to the right accommodates the increase in the size of the left area . Further, since the point of origin  is the upper left corner and biasing objects  to the center of the graphical display  enables efficient representation of connection lines , the objects  in the left area  are right aligned. That is, since the preferred embodiment of the present invention operates with a star schema configuration , the justification of objects  within each area  that biases toward the center optimizes the placement of the objects  in the graphical display  for \u201cjoin\u201d representations associated with the star schema configuration  and illustrated herein by connecting lines . Therefore the rightward movement of each area  facilitates the right alignment of objects  in the left area .
