title: Multi-tenant collaborative review service
abstract: A multi-tenant collaborative review service that facilitates collaborative review of a review target artifact set. The service is multi-tenant in that it provides common functions and infrastructure that are available across multiple tenants supported by the review service. Furthermore, the review service is extensible in that it provides an extensibility point into which tenant-specific functions may be incorporated into the review service. For each one or more of the tenants, the corresponding review target artifact set is distributed such that a tenant-accessible subset of the artifact set is maintained uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant, and such that a centralized service subset of the review target artifact set is maintained remote from the corresponding tenant.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Computer systems and services have revolutionized the way people live, work, and do business. The operation of such systems and services are directed, in large part, by computer software. Computer software is often generated by computer programmers drafting source code (i.e., a computer program). That source code is ultimately compiled or interpreted into machine readable code prior to and\/or at execution time.","As the functionality of such computing systems and services has increased, computer programs have become ever more complex. Many computer programs are too complex to be authored by any one person. Accordingly, computer programs are often collaboratively authored by a team of computer programmers. In order to facilitate collaborative authoring of computer programs, a variety of helpful conventional collaborative authoring programs exist. For instance, such tools often permit the team to move from one version of the code to the next, until a final version of the code is achieved.","In addition to being more complex to author, the software should be carefully reviewed for each version of the code. Accordingly, collaborative review programs also exist. Thus, while collaborative authoring programs permit changes to be made in order to move from one version of the code to the next, collaborative review programs enable detailed review of each version of the code so as to understand and plan the changes that should be made in the next phase of authoring.","At least one embodiment described herein relates to a multi-tenant collaborative review service that performs a method for facilitating collaborative review of a review target artifact set that includes a primary goal component of review. As an example, the primary goal component may be a source code document. The service is multi-tenant in that it provides common functions that are available across multiple tenants supported by the review service. Furthermore, the review service is extensible in that it provides an extensibility point into which tenant-specific functions may be incorporated into the review service. For each of one or more of the tenants, the corresponding review target artifact set is distributed such that a tenant-accessible subset of the review target artifact set is maintained uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant, and such that a centralized service subset of the review target artifact set is maintained remote from the corresponding tenant.","In one embodiment, the distribution of this review target artifact set is done to preserve the confidentiality of the tenant such that sensitive data that is proprietary to the tenant is left accessible only to the tenant, while less sensitive or non-sensitive data may be remote from the tenant, perhaps local to the review service. In some embodiments, when certain types of changes are made to the review target artifact set (e.g., perhaps the addition of a comment to a discussion thread), at least some of the other members of the tenant are notified in real-time. Thus, a multi-tenant collaborative and extensible review service is described.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In accordance with embodiments described herein, a multi-tenant collaborative review service is described. The service facilitates collaborative review of at least one review target artifact set for each of multiple tenants. Each review target artifact set includes a primary goal component that is under review. As an example, the primary goal component may be a source code document. The review service is extensible in that it provides an extensibility point into which tenant-specific functions may be incorporated into the review service. Thus, though there may be common functions available to all tenants, tenants are still permitted a unique experience for each tenant. For each one or more of the tenants, the corresponding review target artifact set is distributed such that a tenant-accessible subset of the review target artifact set is uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant, and such that a centralized service subset of the review target artifact set is maintained remote from the corresponding tenant. This distribution may be done to preserve confidences of the tenant. First, some introductory discussion regarding computing systems will be described with respect to . Then, the embodiments of the collaborative review service will be described with respect to . Finally, an example client-side experience will be described with respect to .","First, introductory discussion regarding computing systems is described with respect to . Computing systems are now increasingly taking a wide variety of forms. Computing systems may, for example, be handheld devices, appliances, laptop computers, desktop computers, mainframes, distributed computing systems, or even devices that have not conventionally been considered a computing system. In this description and in the claims, the term \u201ccomputing system\u201d is defined broadly as including any device or system (or combination thereof) that includes at least one physical and tangible processor, and a physical and tangible memory capable of having thereon computer-executable instructions that may be executed by the processor. The memory may take any form and may depend on the nature and form of the computing system.","A computing system may be distributed over a network environment and may include multiple constituent computing systems. For instance, a service (such as a web service) is often a computing system that is distributed over a network. An example of the service is the review service described herein.","As illustrated in , in its most basic configuration, a computing system  typically includes at least one processing unit  and memory . The memory  may be physical system memory, which may be volatile, non-volatile, or some combination of the two. The term \u201cmemory\u201d may also be used herein to refer to non-volatile mass storage such as physical storage media. If the computing system is distributed, the processing, memory and\/or storage capability may be distributed as well. As used herein, the term \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201ccomponent\u201d can refer to software objects or routines that execute on the computing system. The different components, modules, engines, and services described herein may be implemented as objects or processes that execute on the computing system (e.g., as separate threads).","In the description that follows, embodiments are described with reference to acts that are performed by one or more computing systems. If such acts are implemented in software, one or more processors of the associated computing system that performs the act direct the operation of the computing system in response to having executed computer-executable instructions. An example of such an operation involves the manipulation of data. The computer-executable instructions (and the manipulated data) may be stored in the memory  of the computing system .","Computing system  may also contain communication channels  that allow the computing system  to communicate with other computing systems over, for example, network . The computing system may also include a display  that may display one or more user interfaces that a user of the computing system may interface with. For instance, if the computing system  were a client computing system, a user may interact with the computing system using the display . The display may, for example, display portions of the review target artifact set to the client. Applications that run on the client computing system are also referred to herein as \u201cclient-side applications\u201d. In the context of a review application, the client-side application may be responsible for displaying the portions of the review target artifact set, receiving updates regarding the review target artifact set from the review service, interpreting user input, notifying the review service of certain types of user input, and so forth.","Embodiments described herein may comprise or utilize a special purpose or general-purpose computer including computer hardware, such as, for example, one or more processors and system memory, as discussed in greater detail below. Embodiments described herein also include physical and other computer-readable media for carrying or storing computer-executable instructions and\/or data structures. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer system. Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions are physical storage media. Computer-readable media that carry computer-executable instructions are transmission media. Thus, by way of example, and not limitation, embodiments of the invention can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: computer storage media and transmission media.","Computer storage media includes RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.","A \u201cnetwork\u201d is defined as one or more data links that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and\/or modules and\/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmissions media can include a network and\/or data links which can be used to carry or desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission media to computer storage media (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a \u201cNIC\u201d), and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and\/or to less volatile computer storage media at a computer system. Thus, it should be understood that computer storage media can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.","Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which, when executed at a processor, cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. The computer executable instructions may be, for example, binaries, intermediate format instructions such as assembly language, or even source code. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the described features or acts described above. Rather, the described features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including, personal computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, message processors, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, mobile telephones, PDAs, pagers, routers, switches, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed system environments where local and remote computer systems, which are linked (either by hardwired data links, wireless data links, or by a combination of hardwired and wireless data links) through a network, both perform tasks. In a distributed system environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","201","201","100","201"]},"The review service  is multi-tenant, each tenant having members that collaboratively review one or more corresponding primary goal components. For instance, one tenant may collaboratively review one component of a software package, another tenant may collaboratively review another component of the software package, and so forth. That said, confidentiality is preserved between tenants using mechanisms described hereinafter. Accordingly, one tenant may be from one company, and another may be from another company that is working on an entirely unrelated project. Furthermore, since the primary goal component for each tenant may be different, each tenant may be working on different kinds of primary goal components. For instance, one tenant might be working on source code text, while another tenant might be working on a design document, while yet another might be working on a word processing document.","In the example of , the review service  is illustrated as serving three tenants ,  and . However, the ellipses  represent that the review service  may represent as few as one tenant to as many as thousands of tenants, or more, with no theoretical upper bound. However, there are preferably at least two tenants to take full advantage of the multi-tenant and extensibility features of the collaborative review service .","In this example illustrated in , there are three members ,  and  of the tenant  as represented by the dashed-lined box. In addition there are three members ,  and  of the tenant  as represented by the dotted-lined box. Note how member  is a member of two tenants  and , as occasionally a member may be working on two different teams. Finally, there are two members  and  of the tenant  as represented by the intermittent dotted-dashed lined box.","A member may be a human being that is a member of a team corresponding to the tenant, in which case the member may use a client computing system (including perhaps a client-side application) to interface with the review service. Alternatively, the member may be an automated analysis process performed by a computing system that has artificial intelligence capable of (and properly authorized to) perform a review. In one example, suppose that an author has published an iteration (or a version) of a source code document. Suppose further that the source code has an unreferenced variable or a variable with a name that does not match the standard naming conventions. An annotations function (an example of an automated analysis process) might find the unreferenced variable, perform some calculation to determine that this variable should be annotated, and add some comment to a discussion thread corresponding to this variable","The memberships illustrated in  are of course just an example. A tenant may have any number of members, and sometimes the membership dynamically changes. For instance, if the tenant corresponded to a software development team that was working on a piece of source code, a new hire to that team would be added as a member of that corresponding tenant.","Each tenant  through  has their own data store  through  respectively. While these data stores  through  may be local to each corresponding tenant  through , respectively, that need not be the case. Nevertheless, regardless of where the data store is, the data stores  through  are uniquely accessible by the corresponding tenant  through . In this description and in the claims, the corresponding data store is \u201cuniquely accessible\u201d to the corresponding tenant in that entities that are not members of that tenant are not given access to the corresponding data store unless with the specific permission of the tenant. The review service maintains a high level of confidentiality between tenants by keeping the most sensitive tenant data on the corresponding tenant data store (hereinafter referred to as \u201ctenant-accessible data\u201d or a \u201ctenant-accessible subset\u201d), and may maintain less sensitive data, or completely non-sensitive data at a location remote from the tenant and more accessible to the review service  (hereinafter referred to as \u201ccentralized service data\u201d or a \u201ccentralized service subset\u201d). For instance, such less sensitive or non-sensitive data may be maintained at a data store  that is accessible to the review service . However, even though the data located at the data store  is less sensitive, the review service  may still impose security on access to such data providing protection so that such data is only provided to the corresponding tenant that owns that data.","The review service  includes common function(s)  that represent one or more functions that are common across all of the tenants  through . For instance, suppose that tenants  through  each correspond to a software development team, and that the primary goal component for each tenant is source code text. The common function(s) might include functions that would apply regardless of the development team. Perhaps these are functions that may be helpful to software development teams regardless of the preferences of the tenant. As an example, the common functions  might include a change tracking function, a versioning function, a notification function, a discussion thread function, statistics functions, and so forth.","For instance, the statistics function might track statistics such as 1) how many and which members are actively working on reviewing the primary goal component, 2) how much time has elapsed since anyone or a particular member has commented on the primary goal component, 3) who has signed-off on the primary goal component, 4) the average length of time between the time that members start reviewing until the time that they sign-off on the primary goal component, 5) the average time between the time that the review service receives notice of a change to the review target artifact set (described with respect to ) and the time that this change is distributed to other members of the tenant, 6) the processing, memory and other resources used to service a particular tenant, and so forth. The review service  may perform any other desired statistics as well using the information provided to it.","The fact that the review service is multi-tenant and provides common functions across all tenants allows multiple tenants to use the review service, rather than forcing each tenant to find their own collaborative review mechanism. Still, the experience of each tenant is separated from the experience of other tenants such that the appearance to each tenant is that the review service is helping just them. Accordingly, the review service is an efficient way of facilitating collaborative review for multiple tenants.","The review service  also includes tenant-specific functions  that may be incorporated into the review service. These tenant-specific functions  may each apply to only a subset of the tenants  through . In a simple example, the tenant-specific functions  includes three tenant-specific functions  through , though ellipses  represent that that there may be other numbers of tenant-specific functions. Any given tenant may have one or more tenant-specific functions applied to them. In some case, there might be a tenant that is just to have the common functions  applied, with no tenant-specific functions. As a specific example, perhaps tenant-specific function  may be applied only to tenant , tenant-specific function  may be applied only to tenant , and tenant-specific function  may be applied only to tenant .","Tenant-specific functions are functions that maybe do not apply across all of the tenants  through , but may apply specifically to the objectives and preferences of the team. As an example, one team might use sign-offs, whereas another may not. In that case, the sign-off function might be applied to tenant , but not tenants  and . Another example is a policy function. For instance, one tenant might require two sign-offs to mark a review as complete, while another may require only one. Even though both tenants might use the same policy function, they may have different configurations or thresholds. Another tenant may have certain preferences with respect to how revisions are shown when comparing versions of the primary goal component. One might prefer to show added text in one way (e.g., highlighted yellow), while another might prefer another mechanism (e.g., underlining). These preferences may also be expressed as part of the tenant-specific functions. In one embodiment, the tenant-specific functions  through  are each hierarchically structured documents, such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents. However, the tenant-specific functions might alternatively be plug-in code, or any other mechanism that is recognized by the review service .","As previously mentioned, the server-side functions  are provided to facilitate tenant-specific functionality. There may also be client-side functions as well that collaborate with the common functions  and\/or with the tenant-specific functions  to provide further customization for each tenant.","The review service  provides an application programming interface  that the tenants  through  may use to communicate with the review service . For instance, one specific example is that the tenants  through  may communicate with the review service  for purposes of modifying tenant-specific functions  that apply to the corresponding tenant. For example, the tenant may add a tenant-specific function to the tenant-specific functions , or perhaps modify or replace one of the tenant-specific functions. The tenant may also set user preferences, customization, or to set other configuration data that is offered by the common functions .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300","310","311","312","311"]},"The primary goal component  is actually the subject of the collaboration. The primary goal component  may include text, images, icons, or any other renderable component, or combinations thereof. For instance, the primary goal component might be a text document such as a source code document, a design document, or some other type of word processing document.","The secondary components  of the authored data are authored data (e.g., other text) that is in support of the collaborative review of the primary goal component . As an example, the secondary components  may be discussion threads that correspond to a region of the primary goal component . This region may be a word, partial line, any number of lines, or any other portion of the primary goal component .","More specifically, suppose that the primary goal component  were source code text, there might be a thread highlighting a branching statement that includes some discussion about what the conditions of the branching statement should be. There might be multiple contributors to that discussion thread with multiple members of the tenant weighing in on the question.","In another portion of the source code, there may be an integer declaration of a variable. There might be a corresponding discussion thread regarding that declaration concerning the issue of whether the integer declaration should really be a floating point declaration and the discussion of some circumstances in which it may be more accurate for that variable to take on a fractional value. Thus, using such discussion threads, multiple minds can gather concerning a very focused issue in the primary goal component. In one embodiment, such discussion threads are updated substantially in real-time. This allows for consolidated and efficient gathering of thoughts of team members regarding various portions of the primary goal component.","Some discussion threads may be design oriented. For instance, perhaps a reviewer has commented regarding whether an identified class is cohesive, and\/or perhaps has unnecessary coupling to a particular component.","Some discussion threads may be logic oriented. For instance, a reviewer may comment regarding some consequences to the execution of the code (e.g., the system will crash) if a particular parameter value (e.g., a negative value) is passed into the identified method.","Some discussion threads may be stylistically oriented. For instance, a reviewer might comment that an identified portion of the code may read better if the code were to be modified in some way.","Some discussion threads may be general or give some type of constructive feedback. For instance, a reviewer might give praise for a fix to some identified region of code, or may perhaps compliment on how well a region of code is drafted on short notice.","The review target artifact set  also includes metadata , which is tenant-specific metadata regarding the primary goal component  or regarding other administrative tenant-specific matters. The types of such metadata  are not limited, but could be, for example, sign-off data, member status data, tenant membership data, preference data, customization data, primary goal component information such as creation date and size, and so forth. For instance, the member status data may include a status of a review of the primary goal component such as (but not limited to): whether the reviewer has started the review, is in the process of reviewing, is waiting for the author(s), or has signed-off on the review.","The review service  maintains confidentiality of each tenant by distributing the review target artifact set  appropriately between the data store of the tenant (e.g., data store  of tenant ) and the data store  of the review service , as previously mentioned. The tenant itself may specify, as part of their preferences, which data is permitted to reside where, or which data they consider to be too sensitive to store at the review service. For instance, perhaps some of the authored data  is located at the tenant, and some of the authored data  is located at the review service.","In one embodiment, most of or all of the primary goal component  remains in the tenant data store, whereas other secondary components  of the authored data  (such as the discussion thread data) may be stored remotely at the review service data store . In addition, perhaps the metadata  also may be stored at the review service data store . The metadata  may further include other pointers or references that the review service  may use to properly notify the tenant of changes such that the client interfaces may be updated accordingly.","Such pointers and references are particularly useful as the review service  may not have a copy of the primary goal component itself, but may still need to direct the client that the member is using to the appropriate location. For instance, though the review service may not actually have a copy of a source code document that is under review, the review service may have a copy of a discussion thread, and may have a correlation of that discussion thread with a particular address (e.g., line number, column number range) within the source code text. As another example, if the client wants to compare two versions of the primary goal component, the review service may be able to direct the client to the appropriate storage locations for those two versions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","400","401","202","400","402","250","201","403"]},"The \u201creal-time\u201d review service causes, in at least some instances, each of at least some members of the tenant to be updated when a change has occurred to the primary goal component or the secondary components of the authored data. As an example, suppose a tenant member adds a comment to a discussion thread regarding a portion of the primary goal component. The review service may identify that this has occurred, and make a decision to notify each member of the tenant (that is authoring and\/or reviewing the primary goal component) of the change immediately. That way, each relevant review member of the tenant may see the new comment as soon as the review service is able to notify them. In some cases, this may take as little as a few seconds, or even a fraction of a second, perhaps even leading to a real-time two way conversation held through the review service with focus on a particular portion of the primary goal component. On the client machine, that discussion thread may be visually associated with the corresponding portion of the primary goal component to which the discuss thread is related.","This notification may be made directly to a client application assuming that the reviewer has a client-side application open that renders the change. However, the change may also be transmitted alternatively or additionally by e-mail, thereby allowing even those reviewers who do not have the client-side application open to be notified of the change. However, the principles described herein are not limited to the manner in which the reviewers are notified, nor to the number of reviewers that are notified in particular ways.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","320","310"]},"The review service receives a notification of the update (act ) to the target review artifact set corresponding to a tenant. The review service then updates the tenant-specific metadata or centralized service data (act ) as appropriate. In order to do this, the review service  may execute one or more of the common functions , and may also execute any tenant-specific functions  that apply to the corresponding tenant.","For instance, suppose that the client receives a notification (hereinafter called the \u201ccomment example notification\u201d) in which a comment is appended to an existing discussion thread regarding a particular portion of a source code document. The review service would thereby update the thread discussion stored at the review service. As a second example, suppose that the client receives a notification (hereinafter called the \u201csign-off example notification\u201d). In that case, the review service would update the metadata corresponding to the source code document to reflect the new sign-off status.","The review service then determines if member(s) of corresponding tenant are to be notified of change in real-time (decision block ). If there is to be such a real-time notification (\u201cYes\u201d in decision block ), then the relevant member(s) of the tenant (e.g., those who are collaboratively reviewing the corresponding primary goal component) are so notified (act ). The form of the notification may include any information that would be helpful to the client machine in rendering an update to the member. The formulation of this notification may be performed in response to the review service  executing one or more of the common functions  and\/or one or more of the tenant-specific functions  corresponding to the tenant.","In the comment example notification, each member of a review team might be notified of updates in the discussion thread. The notifications back to the client may cause the client to reflect the notification in appropriate ways. For instance, in this case, as the user navigates to the portion of the primary goal component that corresponds to the discussion thread, the discussion thread may appear with the new comment visually emphasized. In this or other cases, another visualization may appear on the client to let each reviewer know as new comments are added to the discussion threads associated with the primary goal component.","In the sign-off example notification, a sign-off can be a significant event, as it indicates that a team member of the tenant considers the primary goal component in final form. Thus, each team member might be notified of this particular event. The client machine may be made to reflect this sign-off status.","If the review service determines that no such notification should be made in real-time (\u201cNo\u201d in decision block ), then the review service may determine whether any notification should occur at all (decision block ). If there is to be a notification, but just not a real-time notification (\u201cYes\u201d in decision block ), then the notification may be queued for later delivery (act ). Alternatively, when there is notification, the notification is immediate and not queued, and is sent to the client-side application, or may be sent by e-mail. In this embodiment, the reviewer would either have the client-side application opened, or would just see the e-mail notification, in which case there would be no need for separate queuing of the notification. Regardless, if there is also not a need for any notification at all (\u201cNo\u201d in decision block ), no further action is taken (act ). The criteria for determining when to send a notification and what to include in the notification may be set by the tenant to customize the experience and\/or to support tenant-specific functions. The determination of whether to notify the other members of the tenant, which members to notify, and what should be included in the notification may be determined by execution of one or more of the common methods  and\/or one or more of the tenant-specific methods .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","250","240","250","601","250","602"]},"Accordingly, a multi-tenant collaborative review system has been described that allows for separation of the collaborative review experience by tenant in both access to data, and also in the overall functional experience.

Furthermore, areas marked with leftward facing hashed boxes are used instead of yellow highlighting in  (but such areas will still be referred to as being \u201cyellow-highlighted\u201d with reference to ). Areas marked with underlining in  are used instead of green highlighting in  (but such areas will still be referred to as being \u201cgreen-highlighted\u201d with reference to ). Areas marked with dots are used instead of pink highlighting in  (but such areas will still be referred to as being \u201cpink-highlighted\u201d with reference to ).","Referring to , the code view area compares two versions of the code called herein an original version, and a revised version. Lines that are entirely highlighted in red (with rightward facing hash marking in ) are lines that have been entirely removed in the current version compared to the reference version. Lines that have both red portions (right hashing) and pink portions (dotted in ) are lines in which there have been removals made, but in which the red portions (right hashing) are the specific portions removed. Lines that are entirely highlighted in green (underlining in ) are lines that have been entirely added in the current version compared to the reference version, although there are no examples of such lines in . Lines that have both yellow portions (left hashing) and green portions (underlined) are lines in which there have been additions made, but in which the green portions (left hashing) are the specific portions added.","The differential view user interface  also illustrates a reviewer status area  and a comments area . The reviewer status area  allows a reviewer to select a control  to indicate that the reviewer has signed off on the current version of the code. The control  allows the reviewer to recall a prior sign-off on the code. The control  permits the reviewer to instant message with others on the review team.","The comments area  permits a different view on the comments that are displayed in the code view area . However, as there are no comments displayed in the code view area  in , there are likewise no comments displayed in the comments area  of .","Accordingly,  illustrates a differential view user interface  that includes revision marking or some other visualization that compares versions of the displayed code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","800","900","912","901","901","902","902"]},"The comments area \u2032 of  is slightly different as compared to the comments area  of  in its content.
