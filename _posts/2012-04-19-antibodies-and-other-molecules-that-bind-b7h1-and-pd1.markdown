Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to antibodies and their antigen-binding fragments and to other molecules that are capable of immunospecifically binding to B7-H1 or PD-1. In some embodiments such molecules are additionally capable of modulating the ability of B7-H1 or B7-DC to bind to PD-1 or are capable of affecting the signaling activity of the B7-H1 or PD-1. The invention additionally concerns the uses of such molecules in the diagnosis and the treatment of cancer and other diseases.","2. Description of Related Art","A. Cell Mediated Immune Responses","The immune system of humans and other mammals is responsible for providing protection against infection and disease. Such protection is provided both by a humoral immune response and by a cell-mediated immune response. The humoral response results in the production of antibodies and other biomolecules that are capable of recognizing and neutralizing foreign targets (antigens). In contrast, the cell-mediated immune response involves the activation of macrophages, natural killer cells (NK), and antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes by T cells, and the release of various cytokines in response to the recognition of an antigen (Dong, C. et al. (2003) \u201c,\u201d Immunolog. Res. 28(1):39-48).","The ability of T cells to optimally mediate an immune response against an antigen requires two distinct signaling interactions (Viglietta, V. et al. (2007) \u201c-,\u201d Neurotherapeutics 4:666-675; Korman, A. J. et al. (2007) \u201c,\u201d Adv. Immunol. 90:297-339). First, antigen that has been arrayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) must be presented to an antigen-specific naive CD4 T cell. Such presentation delivers a signal via the T cell receptor (TCR) that directs the T cell to initiate an immune response that will be specific to the presented antigen. Second, a series of co-stimulatory and inhibitory signals, mediated through interactions between the APC and distinct T cell surface molecules, triggers first the activation and proliferation of the T cells and ultimately their inhibition. Thus, the first signal confers specificity to the immune response whereas the second signal serves to determine the nature, magnitude and duration of the response.","The immune system is tightly controlled by costimulatory and co-inhibitory ligands and receptors. These molecules provide the second signal for T cell activation and provide a balanced network of positive and negative signals to maximize immune responses against infection while limiting immunity to self (Wang, L. et al. (Mar. 7, 2011) \u201c,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 10.1084\/jem.20100619:1-16; Lepenies, B. et al. (2008) \u201c,\u201d Endocrine, Metabolic & Immune Disorders\u2014Drug Targets 8:279-288). Of particular importance is binding between the B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) ligands of the Antigen Presenting Cell and the CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors of the CD4 T-lymphocyte (Sharpe, A. H. et al. (2002) \u201c7-28 ,\u201d Nature Rev. Immunol. 2:116-126; Dong, C. et al. (2003) \u201c,\u201d Immunolog. Res. 28(1):39-48; Lindley, P. S. et al. (2009) \u201c28-,\u201d Immunol. Rev. 229:307-321). Binding of B7.1 or of B7.2 to CD28 stimulates T cell activation; binding of B7.1 or B7.2 to CTLA-4 inhibits such activation (Dong, C. et al. (2003) \u201c,\u201d Immunolog. Res. 28(1):39-48; Lindley, P. S. et al. (2009) \u201c28-,\u201d Immunol. Rev. 229:307-321; Greenwald, R. J. et al. (2005) \u201c7 ,\u201d Ann. Rev. Immunol. 23:515-548). CD28 is constitutively expressed on the surface of T cells (Gross, J., et al. (1992) \u201c28 ,\u201d J. Immunol. 149:380-388), whereas CTLA4 expression is rapidly up-regulated following T-cell activation (Linsley, P. et al. (1996) \u201c4 ,\u201d Immunity 4:535-543). Since CTLA4 is the higher affinity receptor (Sharpe, A. H. et al. (2002) \u201c7-28 ,\u201d Nature Rev. Immunol. 2:116-126), binding first initiates T cell proliferation (via CD28) and then inhibits it (via nascent expression of CTLA4), thereby dampening the effect when proliferation is no longer needed.","Further investigations into the ligands of the CD28 receptor have led to the identification and characterization of a set of related B7 molecules (the \u201cB7 Superfamily\u201d) (Coyle, A. J. et al. (2001) \u201c7 ,\u201d Nature Immunol. 2(3):203-209; Sharpe, A. H. et al. (2002) \u201c7-28 ,\u201d Nature Rev. Immunol. 2:116-126; Greenwald, R. J. et al. (2005) \u201c7 ,\u201d Ann. Rev. Immunol. 23:515-548; Collins, M. et al. (2005) \u201c7 -,\u201d Genome Biol. 6:223.1-223.7; Loke, P. et al. (2004) \u201c7 .\u201d Arthritis Res. Ther. 6:208-214; Korman, A. J. et al. (2007) \u201c,\u201d Adv. Immunol. 90:297-339; Flies, D. B. et al. (2007) \u201c7,\u201d J. Immunother. 30(3):251-260; Agarwal, A. et al. (2008) \u201c,\u201d Curr. Opin. Organ Transplant. 13:366-372; Lenschow, D. J. et al. (1996) \u201c287 ,\u201d Ann. Rev. Immunol. 14:233-258; Wang, S. et al. (2004) \u201c-7-28 ,\u201d Microbes Infect. 6:759-766). There are currently several known members of the family: B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), the inducible co-stimulator ligand (ICOS-L), the programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1; B7-H1), the programmed death-2 ligand (PD-L2; B7-DC), B7-H3, B7-H4 and B7-H6 (Collins, M. et al. (2005) \u201c7 -,\u201d Genome Biol. 6:223.1-223.7; Flajnik, M. F. et al. (2012) \u201c7 -76 307 777,\u201d Immunogenetics epub doi.org\/10.1007\/s00251-012-0616-2).","B. B7-H1\/PD1 Interactions","1. B7-H1","B7-H1 (PD-L1, CD274) is a particularly significant member of the B7 Superfamily as it is pivotally involved in shaping the immune response to tumors (Flies, D. B. et al. (2007) \u201c7,\u201d J. Immunother. 30(3):251-260; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,803,192; 7,794,710; United States Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005\/0059051; 2009\/0055944; 2009\/0274666; 2009\/0313687; PCT Publication No. WO 01\/39722; WO 02\/086083). B7-H1 is an approximately 33 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein. It has been speculated to play a major role in suppressing the immune system during particular events such as pregnancy, tissue allografts, autoimmune disease and other disease states such as hepatitis.","B7-H1 is broadly expressed in different human and mouse tissues, such as heart, placenta, muscle, fetal liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus for both species as well as liver, lung, and kidney in mouse only (Martin-Orozco, N. et al. (2007) \u201c-,\u201d Semin. Cancer Biol. 17(4):288-298). In humans, B7-H1 protein expression has been found in human endothelial cells (Chen, Y. et al. (2005) \u201c7-1 ,\u201d Nephron. Exp. Nephrol. 102:e81-e92; de Haij, S. et al. (2005) \u201c--7-1\u201d Kidney Int. 68:2091-2102; Mazanet, M. M. et al. (2002) \u201c7-1 ,\u201d J. Immunol. 169:3581-3588), myocardium (Brown, J. A. et al. (2003) \u201c-1 ,\u201d J. Immunol. 170:1257-1266), syncyciotrophoblasts (Petroff, M. G. et al. (2002) \u201c7 -,\u201d Placenta 23:S95-S101), resident macrophages of some tissues, or in macrophages that have been activated with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (Latchman, Y. et al. (2001) \u201c-2 -1 ,\u201d Nat. Immunol 2:261-268), and in tumors (Dong, H. (2003) \u201c7-1 ,\u201d J. Mol. Med. 81:281-287). In the mouse, B7-H1 protein expression is found in heart endothelium, islets cells of the pancreas, small intestines, and placenta (Martin-Orozco, N. et al. (2007) \u201c-,\u201d Semin. Cancer Biol. 17(4):288-298).","2. PD-1","Programmed Death-1 (\u201cPD-1\u201d) is a receptor of B7-H1 and B7-DC. PD-1 is an approximately 31 kD type I membrane protein member of the extended CD28\/CTLA4 family of T cell regulators (Ishida, Y. et al. (1992) \u201c-1,\u201d EMBO J. 11:3887-3895; United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0202100; 2008\/0311117; 2009\/00110667; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,808,710; 7,101,550; 7,488,802; 7,635,757; 7,722,868; PCT Publication No. WO 01\/14557). Compared to CTLA4, PD-1 more broadly negatively regulates immune responses.","PD-1 is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and monocytes (Agata, Y. et al. (1996) \u201c-1 ,\u201d Int. Immunol. 8(5):765-772; Yamazaki, T. et al. (2002) \u201c1 ,\u201d J. Immunol. 169:5538-5545) and at low levels in natural killer (NK) T cells (Nishimura, H. et al. (2000) \u201c-1-,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 191:891-898; Martin-Orozco, N. et al. (2007) \u201c-,\u201d Semin. Cancer Biol. 17(4):288-298).","The extracellular region of PD-1 consists of a single immunoglobulin (Ig)V domain with 23% identity to the equivalent domain in CTLA4 (Martin-Orozco, N. et al. (2007) \u201c-,\u201d Semin. Cancer Biol. 17(4):288-298). The extracellular IgV domain is followed by a transmembrane region and an intracellular tail. The intracellular tail contains two phosphorylation sites located in an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif, which suggests that PD-1 negatively regulates TCR signals (Ishida, Y. et al. (1992) \u201c-1,\u201d EMBO J. 11:3887-3895; Blank, C. et al. (Epub 2006 Dec. 29) \u201c-1\/-1 -Cancer,\u201d Immunol. Immunother. 56(5):739-745).","Antibodies capable of immunospecifically binding to murine PD-1 have been reported (see, e.g., Agata, T. et al. (1996) \u201c-1 ,\u201d Int. Immunol. 8(5):765-772).","C. The Interactions of B7-H1 and PD-1","Interaction of B7-H1 and PD-1 has been found to provide a crucial negative co-stimulatory signal to T and B cells (Martin-Orozco, N. et al. (2007) \u201c-,\u201d Semin. Cancer Biol. 17(4):288-298) and functions as a cell death inducer (Ishida, Y. et al. (1992) \u201c-1,\u201d EMBO J. 11:3887-3895; Subudhi, S. K. et al. (2005) \u201c,\u201d J. Molec. Med. 83:193-202).","Interaction between low concentrations of the PD-1 receptor and the B7-H1 ligand results in the transmission of an inhibitory signal that strongly inhibits the proliferation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells; at higher concentrations the interactions with PD-1 do not inhibit T-cell proliferation but markedly reduce the production of multiple cytokines (Sharpe, A. H. et al. (2002) \u201c7-28 ,\u201d Nature Rev. Immunol. 2:116-126). T-cell proliferation and cytokine production by both resting and previously activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, and even naive T cells from umbilical-cord blood, have been found to be inhibited by soluble B7-H1-Fc fusion proteins (Freeman, G. J. et al. (2000) \u201c-1 7 ,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 192:1-9; Latchman, Y. et al. (2001) \u201c-2 -1 ,\u201d Nature Immunol. 2:261-268; Carter, L. et al. (2002) \u201c-1-4(+) 8(+) -2,\u201d Eur. J. Immunol. 32(3):634-643; Sharpe, A. H. et al. (2002) \u201c7-28 ,\u201d Nature Rev. Immunol. 2:116-126).","B7-H1-PD-1 interactions lead to cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 but do not increase cell death (Latchman, Y. et al. (2001) \u201c-2 -1 ,\u201d Nature Immunol. 2:261-268; Carter, L. et al. (2002) \u201c-1-4(+) 8(+) -2,\u201d Eur. J. Immunol. 32(3):634-643). Thus, B7-H1-PD-1 complexing has the ability to antagonize the B7-CD28 signal when antigenic stimulation is weak or limiting, and plays a key role in down-regulating T-cell responses.","The signal transduction mediated by B7-H1 and PD-1 is complex. Both molecules additionally bind to other proteins. B7-H1 is capable of binding to B7-1 (CD80) (Butte, M. J. et al. (2008) \u201c-1 7-1,\u201d Molecular Immunol. 45:3567-3572); PD-1 is capable of binding to B7-DC (PD-L2) (L\u00e1z\u00e1r-Moln\u00e1r, E. et al. (2008) \u201c-1 (-1) -2,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 105(30):10483-10488). B7-1 interacts with CD28 to deliver a co-stimulatory signal for T-cell activation that is important in the early stages of immune response (Elloso, M. M. et al. (1999) \u201cExpression and Contribution of B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) in the Early Immune Response to Infection,\u201d J. Immunol. 162:6708-6715). B7-DC is a strong stimulator of T cells, enhancing T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 production. However, it also exhibits an inhibitory effect on the immune response via its interaction with PD-1 (Ishiwata, K. et al. (epub Jan. 10, 2010) \u201c,\u201d J. Immunol. 184:2086-2094). Microbes and tumors appear to have exploited PD-1 and B7-H1 to evade eradication by the immune system. Differences in binding affinities to the various receptors and ligands that interact with PD-1 and B7-H1 have been proposed to provide distinct functional outcomes of blockade of PD-1 and B7-H1 in disease models (Butte, M. J. et al. (2008) \u201c-1 7-1,\u201d Molecular Immunol. 45:3567-3572). The PD-1 pathway has also been implicated as playing a key role in the impairment of immune function during chronic infection (\u201cT cell exhaustion\u201d), and a blockade of PD-1 function is able to restore many T cell functions (Rodr\u00edquez-Garc\u00eda, M. et al. (Nov. 19, 2010) \u201c-1 -2 --1 -10,\u201d J. Leukocyte Biol. 89: doi:10.1189\/jlb.0610327:1-9).","The role of B7-H1 and PD-1 in inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation has suggested that these biomolecules might serve as therapeutic targets for treatments of inflammation and cancer. The use of anti-PD1 antibodies to treat infections and tumors and up-modulate an adaptive immune response has been proposed (see, United States Patent Application Publication Nos. 2010\/0040614; 2010\/0028330; 2004\/0241745; 2008\/0311117; 2009\/0217401; U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,521,051; 7,563,869; 7,595,048; PCT Publications Nos. WO 2004\/056875; WO 2008\/083174). Conversely, agents that modulate the interaction of PD-1 with B7-H1 have been suggested to have utility in up- or down-modulating the immune response (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,029,674; 7,488,802; United States Patent Application Publications Nos. 2007\/0122378; 2009\/0076250; 2009\/0110667; 2009\/0263865; 2009\/0297518; PCT Publication No. WO 2006\/133396). Likewise, the use of anti-B7-H1 antibodies to treat infections and tumors and up-modulate an adaptive immune response has been proposed (United States Patent Application Publication Nos. 2009\/0055944; 2009\/0274666; 2009\/0317368; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,803,192; 7,794,710; PCT Publications Nos. WO 01\/39722; WO 02\/086083).","Nevertheless, despite all such advances a need remains for compositions capable of modulating the interaction between B7-H1 and PD-1. The present invention is directed to such compositions and their use to treat cancer and other diseases and conditions.","The present invention relates to antibodies and their antigen-binding fragments and to other molecules that are capable of immunospecifically binding to B7-H1 or PD-1.

An antibody that immunospecifically binds to a particular antigen may bind to other antigens with lower affinity if the other antigen has some sequence or conformational similarity that is recognized by the antigen recognition site as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIACORE\u00ae assays, or other assays known in the art, but would not bind to a totally unrelated antigen. Preferably, however, antibodies (and their antigen binding fragments) will not cross-react with other antigens. Antibodies may also bind to other molecules in a way that is not immunospecific, such as to FcR receptors, by virtue of binding domains in other regions\/domains of the molecule that do not involve the antigen recognition site, such as the Fc region.","As used herein the term \u201cmodulate\u201d relates to a capacity to alter an effect or result. In particular, the invention relates to molecules (especially antibodies or their antigen-binding fragments that immunospecifically bind human B7-H1 or human PD-1) that are capable of modulating the binding between B7-H1 and PD-1 and\/or of modulating the signal transduction that occurs as a consequence of B7-H1-PD-1 binding. Such modulation may result in attenuating or in completely blocking the ability of B7-H1 to bind to PD-1. In a further embodiment, such modulation may attenuate or completely neutralize the ability of B7-H1 or PD-1 to mediate signal transduction. In a further embodiment, such modulation may enhance or otherwise agonize signal transduction through B7-H1 or PD-1, either by 1) enhancing the interaction between B7-H1 and PD-1 and facilitating B7-H1-PD-1 binding or ii) directly binding to B7-H1 and PD-1 and thus mimicking the activity of the endogenous ligand, etc. In a still further embodiment, such modulation may alter the nature of the interaction between B7-H1 and PD-1 so as to alter the nature of the elicited signal transduction. For example, the molecules of the present invention can, by binding to B7-H1 or PD-1, alter the ability of such molecules to bind to other ligands and receptor (e.g., affecting the ability of PD-1 to bind to B7-DC or the ability of B7-H1 to bind to B7-1 (CD80)) and thereby alter their overall activity. Preferably, such modulation will provide at least a 10% change in a measurable immune system activity, more preferably, at least a 50% change in such activity, or at least a 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, or still more preferably, at least a 100-fold change in such activity.","As used herein, the term \u201cantibody\u201d is intended to denote an immunoglobulin molecule that possesses a \u201cvariable region\u201d antigen recognition site. The term \u201cvariable region\u201d is intended to distinguish such domain of the immunoglobulin from domains that are broadly shared by antibodies (such as an antibody Fc domain). The variable region comprises a \u201chypervariable region\u201d whose residues are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a \u201cComplementarity Determining Region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (i.e., typically at approximately residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and at approximately residues 27-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and\/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (i.e., residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia, C. et al. (1987) \u201cCanonical Structures For The Hypervariable Regions Of Immunoglobulins,\u201d 196:901-917). \u201cFramework Region\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. The term antibody includes monoclonal antibodies, multi-specific antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, synthetic antibodies, chimeric antibodies, camelized antibodies (See e.g., Muyldermans et al., 200126:230; Nuttall et al., 20001:253; Reichmann and Muyldermans, 1999231:25; International Publication Nos. WO 94\/04678 and WO 94\/25591; U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079), single-chain Fvs (scFv) (see, e.g., see Pluckthun in , vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994)), single chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), intrabodies, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id and anti-anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention). In particular, such antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, IgG, IgAand IgA) or subclass.","As used herein, the term \u201cantigen binding fragment\u201d of an antibody refers to one or more portions of an antibody that contain the antibody's Complementarity Determining Regions (\u201cCDRs\u201d) and optionally the framework residues that comprise the antibody's \u201cvariable region\u201d antigen recognition site, and exhibit an ability to immunospecifically bind antigen. Such fragments include Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), Fv, single chain (ScFv), and mutants thereof, naturally occurring variants, and fusion proteins comprising the antibody's \u201cvariable region\u201d antigen recognition site and a heterologous protein (e.g., a toxin, an antigen recognition site for a different antigen, an enzyme, a receptor or receptor ligand, etc.). As used herein, the term \u201cfragment\u201d refers to a peptide or polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of at least 5 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 15 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 25 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 50 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 60 contiguous amino residues, at least 70 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 80 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 90 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 100 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 125 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 150 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 175 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 200 contiguous amino acid residues, or at least 250 contiguous amino acid residues.","Human, chimeric or humanized antibodies are particularly preferred for in vivo use in humans, however, murine antibodies or antibodies of other species may be advantageously employed for many uses (for example, in vitro or in situ detection assays, acute in vivo use, etc.). Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects.","Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and International Publication Nos. WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO 98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741). Human antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the Jregion prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized using conventional methodologies with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,771). The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (199513:65-93, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 98\/24893, WO 96\/34096, and WO 96\/33735; and U.S. Pat.

In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Medarex (Princeton, N.J.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","A \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a non-human antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, 1985229:1202; Oi et al., 19864:214; Gillies et al., 1989125:191-202; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,311,415, 5,807,715, 4,816,567, and 4,816,397. Chimeric antibodies comprising one or more CDRs from a non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; International Publication No. WO 91\/09967; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539, 5,530,101, and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, 199128(4\/5):489-498; Studnicka et al., 19947:805; and Roguska et al., 199491:969), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332).","The invention particularly concerns \u201chumanized antibodies\u201d (see, e.g., European Patent Nos. EP 239,400, EP 592,106, and EP 519,596; International Publication Nos. WO 91\/09967 and WO 93\/17105; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539, 5,530,101, 5,565,332, 5,585,089, 5,766,886, and 6,407,213; and Padlan, 199128(4\/5):489-498; Studnicka et al., 19947(6):805-814; Roguska et al., 199491:969-973; Tan et al., 2002169:1119-25; Caldas et al., 200013:353-60; Morea et al., 200020:267-79; Baca et al., 1997272:10678-84; Roguska et al., 19969:895-904; Couto et al., 199555 (23 Supp):5973s-5977s; Couto et al., 199555:1717-22; Sandhu, 1994150:409-10; Pedersen et al., 1994235:959-73; Jones et al., 1986321:522-525; Reichmann et al., 1988332:323-329; and Presta, 19922:593-596). As used herein, the term \u201chumanized antibody\u201d refers to an immunoglobulin comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (usually a mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the \u201cdonor\u201d and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the \u201cacceptor.\u201d Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, preferably about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDR's, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. A humanized antibody is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. For example, a humanized antibody would not encompass a typical chimeric antibody, because, e.g., the entire variable region of a chimeric antibody is non-human. One says that the donor antibody has been \u201chumanized,\u201d by the process of \u201chumanization,\u201d because the resultant humanized antibody is expected to bind to the same antigen as the donor antibody that provides the CDR's. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or a non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Framework Region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin that immunospecifically binds to a Fc\u03b3RIIB polypeptide, that has been altered by the introduction of amino acid residue substitutions, deletions or additions (i.e., mutations).","The antibodies used in the methods of the present invention may be monospecific. Also of interest are bispecific antibodies, trispecific antibodies or antibodies of greater multispecificity that exhibit specificity to different targets in addition to B7-H1 or PD-1. In a preferred embodiment, such multispecific antibodies would exhibit specificity to different immune cell target(s). For example, such antibodies may bind to both B7-H1 and B7-DC and thus modulate both PD-1 dependent responses. Conversely, such antibodies may bind to PD-1 and B7-1 and interfere with both B7-H1 dependent responses. In another embodiment, the multispecific antibody binds to molecules (receptors or ligands) involved in alternative immunomodulatory pathways, such as CTLA4, TIM3, TIM4, OX40, CD40, GITR, 4-1-BB, B7-H4, LIGHT or LAG3, in order to enhance the immunomodulatory effects. Furthermore, the multispecific antibody may bind to effecter molecules such as cytokines (e.g., IL-7, IL-15, IL-12, IL-4 TGF-beta, IL-10, IL-17, IFNg, Flt3, BLys) and chemokines (e.g., CCL21), which may be particularly relevant for modulating both acute and chronic immune responses.","Additionally, multispecific antibodies may bind to an antigen that is important for targeting the antibody to a particular cell type or tissue. For example such antibodies that bind both PD-1 and CD27 (or B7-H1 and CD27) can help co-localize activated memory B-cells (mB) and antigen presenting cells (APCs) so that the PD-1 arrayed by such APCs can interact with ligands on the surface of the mBB-cells to promote the survival of the mBB-cells. Since a loss of mBB-cells is a precipitating event in the progression of HIV-infection to AIDS (Titanji, K. et al. (2010) \u201c-1 -120(11):3878-3890), antibodies that bind both PD-1 and CD27 have utility in the treatment of HIV infection and in preventing or delaying the onset of AIDS. As discussed above, the PD-1 pathway has been implicated as playing a key role in the impairment of immune function during chronic HIV infection (\u201cT cell exhaustion\u201d) (Khaitan, A. et al. (2011) \u201c,\u201d Curr. HIV\/AIDS Rep. 8:4-11; Rodr\u00edquez-Garc\u00eda, M. et al. (Nov. 19, 2010) \u201c-1 -2 --1 -10,\u201d J. Leukocyte Biol. 89: doi:10.1189\/jlb.0610327:1-9; Grabmeier-Pfistershammer, K. et al. (2011) \u201c-1 -1-,\u201d J Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 56(2):118-124). Macrophages have been shown to contribute significantly to the initial steps of HIV infection (Carter, C. A. et al. (2008) \u201c-1 ,\u201d Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 62:425-443; Noursadeghi, M. et al. (2006) \u201c-1 ,\u201d Lancet Infect. Dis. 6:794-804). Accordingly, antibodies (particularly if conjugated to a toxin) that bind to PD-1 and to a macrophage-specific marker (such as CD14, CD68, CD163, TLR2 etc.) have utility in preventing HIV infection. Additionally, antibodies that bind to multiple markers of T cell exhaustion (e.g., PD-1 and any or all of: CTLA4, TIM3, TIM4 or LAG-3) have utility in the treatment or diagnosis of immune responsiveness. Other target antigens of interest include cancer cell markers.","Additionally, it has been found that PD-1 CD8 cells have anti-HIV activity (Killian, M. S. et al. (2011) \u201c1 Replication Is Mediated by Memory CD8,\u201d J. Virol. 85(4):1696-1705). Thus antibodies that bind to both PD-1 and CD8 have utility in, for example, an ex vivo means for isolating and producing an enriched population of such cells for ultimate use in the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS in patients.","Other markers that may be used in such anti-PD-1 or anti-B7-H1 bispecific, trispecific or multispecific antibodies include CD4, CD8, CD25 and CTLA-4 (see, De Keersmaecker, B. et al. (2011) (\u201c,\u201d Curr. Molec. Med. 566-5240\/11: 1-25; and Sarikonda, G. (2011) \u201c;\u201d Methods in Molec. Biol. 677:431-447, both herein incorporated by reference).","Similarly, although CD4 T cells are required to slow the growth and spread of , PD-1-mediated inhibition is also required to prevent CD4 T cells from promoting severe disease (Barber, D. L. et al. (2011) \u201c4 -1-,\u201d J. Immunol. 186:1598-1607; Sakai, S. et al. (2010) \u201c-1--1 -22(12):915-925; L\u00e1z\u00e1r-Moln\u00e1r, E. et al. (2010) \u201c-1 (-1)-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 107(30):13402-13407). Thus, antibodies that bind to CD4 and PD-1 have utility in the treatment of tuberculosis and in preventing or delaying the onset of tuberculosis.","DNA sequences coding for preferred human acceptor framework sequences include but are not limited to FR segments from the human germline VH segment VH1-18 and JH6 and the human germline VL segment VK-A26 and JK4. In a specific embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., 1998278: 457-479 for a listing of human framework regions).","A humanized or chimeric antibody of the invention may comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably, an antibody of the invention also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. The constant domains of the antibodies of the invention may be selected with respect to the proposed function of the antibody, in particular the effector function which may be required. In some embodiments, the constant domains of the antibodies of the invention are (or comprise) human IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM domains. In a specific embodiment, human IgG constant domains, especially of the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes are used, when the humanized antibodies of the invention is intended for therapeutic uses and antibody effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity are needed. For example, PD-1 is highly expressed on T cells as well as rare peripheral T cell lymphomas such as Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Anti-PD-1 antibodies with ADCC or CDC activity are particularly relevant as therapeutic agents for treating such cancers. In alternative embodiments, IgG2 and IgG4 isotypes are used when the antibody of the invention is intended for therapeutic purposes and antibody effector function is not required. For example, if you want to increase the activity of T cells by targeting PD-1 on the surface of T cells, then effector functions that would kill the T cell may be undesirable. The invention encompasses Fc constant domains comprising one or more amino acid modifications which alter antibody effector functions such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005\/0037000 and 2005\/0064514.","In some embodiments, the antibody of the invention contains both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. In other embodiments, the antibody of the invention may further comprise one or more of the CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. The antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including IgG, IgG, IgGand IgG. In some embodiments, the constant domain is a complement fixing constant domain where it is desired that the antibody exhibit cytotoxic activity, and the class is typically IgG. In other embodiments, where such cytotoxic activity is not desirable, the constant domain may be of the IgGclass. The antibody of the invention may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype, and selecting particular constant domains to optimize desired effector functions is within the ordinary skill in the art.","The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the donor CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the donor antibody. Such mutations, however, are preferably not extensive. Usually, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental framework region (FR) and CDR sequences, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%. Humanized antibodies can be produced using variety of techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, CDR-grafting (European Patent No. EP 239,400; International Publication No. WO 91\/09967; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539, 5,530,101, and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (European Patent Nos. EP 592,106 and EP 519,596; Padlan, 199128(4\/5):489-498; Studnicka et al., 19947(6):805-814; and Roguska et al., 199491:969-973), chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332), and techniques disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions (see, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; U.S. Publication Nos. 2004\/0049014 and 2003\/0229208; U.S. Pat.

Preferably, the humanized antibodies are produced by recombinant DNA technology. The antibodies of the invention may be produced using recombinant immunoglobulin expression technology.

Additional information concerning the generation, design and expression of recombinant antibodies can be found in Mayforth, Designing Antibodies, Academic Press, San Diego (1993).","An exemplary process for the production of the recombinant chimeric antibodies of the invention may comprise the following: a) constructing, by conventional molecular biology methods, an expression vector that encodes and expresses an antibody heavy chain in which the CDRs and variable region of the murine anti-B7-H1 (or anti-PD-1) monoclonal antibody are fused to an Fc region derived from a human immunoglobulin, thereby producing a vector for the expression of a chimeric antibody heavy chain; b) constructing, by conventional molecular biology methods, an expression vector that encodes and expresses an antibody light chain of the murine anti-B7-H1 (or anti-PD-1) monoclonal antibody, thereby producing a vector for the expression of chimeric antibody light chain; c) transferring the expression vectors to a host cell by conventional molecular biology methods to produce a transfected host cell for the expression of chimeric antibodies; and d) culturing the transfected cell by conventional cell culture techniques so as to produce chimeric antibodies.","An exemplary process for the production of the recombinant humanized antibodies of the invention may comprise the following: a) constructing, by conventional molecular biology methods, an expression vector that encodes and expresses an antibody heavy chain in which the CDRs and a minimal portion of the variable region framework that are required to retain donor antibody binding specificity are derived from a non-human immunoglobulin, such as the murine anti-B7-H1 (or anti-PD-1) monoclonal antibody, and the remainder of the antibody is derived from a human immunoglobulin, thereby producing a vector for the expression of a humanized antibody heavy chain; b) constructing, by conventional molecular biology methods, an expression vector that encodes and expresses an antibody light chain in which the CDRs and a minimal portion of the variable region framework that are required to retain donor antibody binding specificity are derived from a non-human immunoglobulin, such as the murine anti-B7-H1 (or anti-PD-1) monoclonal antibody, and the remainder of the antibody is derived from a human immunoglobulin, thereby producing a vector for the expression of humanized antibody light chain; c) transferring the expression vectors to a host cell by conventional molecular biology methods to produce a transfected host cell for the expression of humanized antibodies; and d) culturing the transfected cell by conventional cell culture techniques so as to produce humanized antibodies.","With respect to either exemplary method, host cells may be co-transfected with such expression vectors, which may contain different selectable markers but, with the exception of the heavy and light chain coding sequences, are preferably identical. This procedure provides for equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA or both. The host cell used to express the recombinant antibody of the invention may be either a bacterial cell such as , or more preferably a eukaryotic cell (e.g., a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell or a HEK-293 cell). The choice of expression vector is dependent upon the choice of host cell, and may be selected so as to have the desired expression and regulatory characteristics in the selected host cell. Other cell lines that may be used include, but are not limited to, CHO-K1, NSO, and PER.C6 (Crucell, Leiden, Netherlands). Furthermore, codon usage may by optimized when host cell is selected to account for species specific codon usage bias and enhance protein expression. For example, for CHO cell expression the DNA encoding the antibodies may incorporate codons used preferentially by (from where Chinese Hamster ovaries cells are derived. Methods of codon optimization may be employed to facilitate improved expression by a desired host cell (see, e.g., Wohlgemuth, I. et al. (2011) \u201c,\u201d Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 366(1580):2979-2986; Jestin, J. L. et al. (2009) \u201c,\u201d J. Mol. Evol. 69(5):452-457; Bollenbach, T. et al. (2007) \u201c,\u201d Genome Res. 17(4):401-404; Kurland, C. G. et al.

S. et al. (1989) \u201c,\u201d FASEB J. 7:437-444; and Nisinoff, A. (1991) \u201c,\u201d J. Immunol. 147(8):2429-2438).","The binding properties of any of the above antibodies can, if desired, be further improved by screening for variants that exhibit such desired characteristics. For example, such antibodies can be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains, such as Fab and Fv or disulfide-bond stabilized Fv, expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage, including fd and M13. The antigen binding domains are expressed as a recombinantly fused protein to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein.

For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT Publication WO 92\/22324; Mullinax, R.

This technique would be useful in obtaining high affinity antibodies that could be used in the combinatorial methods of the invention. This technology, referred to as affinity maturation, employs mutagenesis or CDR walking and re-selection using such receptors or ligands (or their extracellular domains) or an antigenic fragment thereof to identify antibodies that bind with higher affinity to the antigen when compared with the initial or parental antibody (See, e.g., Glaser, S. M. et al. (1992) \u201c-,\u201d J. Immunol. 149:3903-3913). Mutagenizing entire codons rather than single nucleotides results in a semi-randomized repertoire of amino acid mutations. Libraries can be constructed consisting of a pool of variant clones each of which differs by a single amino acid alteration in a single CDR and which contain variants representing each possible amino acid substitution for each CDR residue. Mutants with increased binding affinity for the antigen can be screened by contacting the immobilized mutants with labeled antigen. Any screening method known in the art can be used to identify mutant antibodies with increased avidity to the antigen (e.g., ELISA) (see, e.g., Wu, H. et al. (1998) \u201c3-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 95(11):6037-6042; Yelton, D. E. et al. (1995) \u201c96--,\u201d J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004). CDR walking which randomizes the light chain may be used possible (see, Schier et al. (1996) \u201c---2 -,\u201d J. Mol. Biol. 263:551-567).","The invention thus contemplates the use of random mutagenesis in concert with methods of phage display to identify improved CDRs and\/or variable regions. Phage display technology can alternatively be used to increase (or decrease) CDR affinity by directed mutagenesis (e.g., affinity maturation or \u201cCDR-walking\u201d). This technique uses the target antigen or an antigenic fragment thereof to identify antibodies having CDRs that bind with higher (or lower) affinity to the antigen when compared with the initial or parental antibody (see, e.g., Glaser, S.

The term \u201cderivative\u201d refers to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that immunospecifically binds to an antigen but which comprises, one, two, three, four, five or more amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions or modifications relative to a \u201cparental\u201d (or wild-type) molecule. Such amino acid substitutions or additions may introduce naturally occurring (i.e., DNA-encoded) or non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. Such amino acids may be glycosylated (e.g., have altered mannose, 2-N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, fucose, glucose, sialic acid, 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid, 5-glycolneuraminic acid, etc. content), acetylated, pegylated, phosphorylated, amidated, derivatized by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linked to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. In some embodiments, the altered carbohydrate modifications modulate one or more of the following: solubilization of the antibody, facilitation of subcellular transport and secretion of the antibody, promotion of antibody assembly, conformational integrity, and antibody-mediated effector function. In a specific embodiment the altered carbohydrate modifications enhance antibody mediated effector function relative to the antibody lacking the carbohydrate modification. Carbohydrate modifications that lead to altered antibody mediated effector function are well known in the art (for example, see Shields, R. L. et al. (2002) \u201c--,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 277(30): 26733-26740; Davies J. et al. (2001) \u201c-20 ,\u201d Biotechnology & Bioengineering 74(4): 288-294). Methods of altering carbohydrate contents are known to those skilled in the art, see, e.g., Wallick, S. C. et al. (1988) \u201c(1 - - - 6) ,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 168(3): 1099-1109; Tao, M. H. et al.

Such a humanized antibody comprises amino acid residue substitutions, deletions or additions in one or more non-human CDRs. The humanized antibody derivative may have substantially the same binding, better binding, or worse binding when compared to a non-derivative humanized antibody. In specific embodiments, one, two, three, four, or five amino acid residues of the CDR have been substituted, deleted or added (i.e., mutated).","A derivative antibody or antibody fragment may be modified by chemical modifications using techniques known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formulation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. In one embodiment, an antibody derivative will possess a similar or identical function as the parental antibody. In another embodiment, an antibody derivative will exhibit an altered activity relative to the parental antibody. For example, a derivative antibody (or fragment thereof) can bind to its epitope more tightly or be more resistant to proteolysis than the parental antibody.","Substitutions, additions or deletions in the derivatized antibodies may be in the Fc region of the antibody and may thereby serve to modify the binding affinity of the antibody to one or more Fc\u03b3R. Methods for modifying antibodies with modified binding to one or more Fc\u03b3R are known in the art, see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 04\/029207, WO 04\/029092, WO 04\/028564, WO 99\/58572, WO 99\/51642, WO 98\/23289, WO 89\/07142, WO 88\/07089, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,597 and 5,642,821. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses antibodies that have altered affinity for an activating Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Preferably such modifications also have an altered Fc-mediated effector function. Modifications that affect Fc-mediated effector function are well known in the art (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551, and WO 00\/42072). In one particular embodiment, the modification of the Fc region results in an antibody with an altered antibody-mediated effector function, an altered binding to other Fc receptors (e.g., Fc activation receptors), an altered antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, an altered C1q binding activity, an altered complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity (CDC), a phagocytic activity, or any combination thereof.","Derivatized antibodies may be used to alter the half-lives (e.g., serum half-lives) of parental antibodies in a mammal, preferably a human. Preferably such alteration will result in a half-life of greater than 15 days, preferably greater than 20 days, greater than 25 days, greater than 30 days, greater than 35 days, greater than 40 days, greater than 45 days, greater than 2 months, greater than 3 months, greater than 4 months, or greater than 5 months. The increased half-lives of the humanized antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof in a mammal, preferably a human, results in a higher serum titer of said antibodies or antibody fragments in the mammal, and thus, reduces the frequency of the administration of said antibodies or antibody fragments and\/or reduces the concentration of said antibodies or antibody fragments to be administered. Antibodies or fragments thereof having increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by modifying (e.g., substituting, deleting or adding) amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor. The humanized antibodies of the invention may be engineered to increase biological half-lives (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375). For example, humanized antibodies of the invention may be engineered in the Fc-hinge domain to have increased in vivo or serum half-lives.","Antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by attaching to said antibodies or antibody fragments polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol (PEG). PEG can be attached to said antibodies or antibody fragments with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG to the N- or C-terminus of said antibodies or antibody fragments or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation will be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by, e.g., size exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography.","The antibodies of the invention may also be modified by the methods and coupling agents described by Davis et al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337) in order to provide compositions that can be injected into the mammalian circulatory system with substantially no immunogenic response.","The invention encompasses modification of framework residues of the humanized antibodies of the invention. Framework residues in the framework regions may be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; and Riechmann, L. et al. (1988) \u201c,\u201d Nature 332:323-327).","The present invention also encompasses anti-human B7-H1 and anti-human PD-1 antibodies (and more preferably, humanized antibodies) and antigen-binding fragments thereof that are recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to a heterologous molecule (i.e., an unrelated molecule). The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences.","The Fc portion of the fusion the fusion protein may be varied by isotype or subclass, may be a chimeric or hybrid, and\/or may be modified, for example to improve effector functions, control of half-life, tissue accessibility, augment biophysical characteristics such as stability, and improve efficiency of production (and less costly). Many modifications useful in construction of disclosed fusion proteins and methods for making them are known in the art, see for example Mueller, J. P. et al. (1997) \u201c-24 ,\u201d Mol. Immun. 34(6):441-452, Swann, P. G. (2008) \u201c,\u201d Curr. Opin. Immun. 20:493-499 (2008), and Presta, L. G. (2008) \u201c,\u201d Curr. Opin. Immun. 20:460-470. In some embodiments the Fc region is the native IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 Fc region. In some embodiments the Fc region is a hybrid, for example a chimeric consisting of IgG2\/IgG4 Fc constant regions. Modications to the Fc region include, but are not limited to, IgG4 modified to prevent binding to Fc gamma receptors and complement, IgG1 modified to improve binding to one or more Fc gamma receptors, IgG1 modified to minimize effector function (amino acid changes), IgG1 with altered\/no glycan (typically by changing expression host), and IgG1 with altered pH-dependent binding to FcRn. The Fc region may include the entire hinge region, or less than the entire hinge region.","The therapeutic outcome in patients treated with rituximab (a chimeric mouse\/human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against CD20) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia correlated with the individual's expression of allelic variants of Fc\u03b3 receptors with distinct intrinsic affinities for the Fc domain of human IgG1. In particular, patients with high affinity alleles of the low affinity activating Fc receptor CD16A (Fc\u03b3RIIIA) showed higher response rates and, in the cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, improved progression-free survival. In another embodiment, the Fc domain may contain one or more amino acid insertions, deletions or substitutions that reduce binding to the low affinity inhibitory Fc receptor CD32B (Fc\u03b3RIIB) and retain wild-type levels of binding to or enhance binding to the low affinity activating Fc receptor CD16A (Fc\u03b3RIIIA).","Another embodiment includes IgG2-4 hybrids and IgG4 mutants that have reduce binding to FcR which increase their half-life. Representative IG2-4 hybrids and IgG4 mutants are described in Angal, S. et al. (1993) \u201c(4) ,\u201d Molec. Immunol. 30(1):105-108; Mueller, J. P. et al. (1997) \u201c-24 ,\u201d Mol. Immun. 34(6):441-452; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,982,323. In some embodiments the IgG1 and\/or IgG2 domain is deleted for example, Angal et al. describe IgG1 and IgG2 having serine 241 replaced with a proline","In a preferred embodiment, the Fc domain contains amino acid insertions, deletions or substitutions that enhance binding to CD16A. A large number of substitutions in the Fc domain of human IgG1 that increase binding to CD16A and reduce binding to CD32B are known in the art and are described in Stavenhagen, J. B. et al. (2007) \u201c-,\u201d Cancer Res. 57(18):8882-8890. Exemplary variants of human IgG1 Fc domains with reduced binding to CD32B and\/or increased binding to CD16A contain F243L, R929P, Y300L, V305I or P296L substitutions. These amino acid substitutions may be present in a human IgG1 Fc domain in any combination. In one embodiment, the human IgG1 Fc domain variant contains a F243L, R929P and Y300L substitution. In another embodiment, the human IgG1 Fc domain variant contains a F243L, R929P, Y300L, V305I and P296L substitution. In another embodiment, the human IgG1 Fc domain variant contains an N297Q substitution, as this mutation abolishes FcR binding.","In one embodiment such heterologous molecules are polypeptides having at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids.

In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, the hemagglutinin \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson, I. A. et al. (1984) \u201c,\u201d Cell, 37:767-778) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag (Knappik, A. et al. (1994) \u201c,\u201d Biotechniques 17(4):754-761).","The present invention also encompasses antibodies or their antigen-binding fragments that are conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent or any other molecule for which serum half-life is desired to be increased. The antibodies can be used diagnostically (in vivo, in situ or in vitro) to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a disease, disorder or infection as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Such diagnosis and detection can be accomplished by coupling the antibody to detectable substances including, but not limited to, various enzymes, enzymes including, but not limited to, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; prosthetic group complexes such as, but not limited to, streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; fluorescent materials such as, but not limited to, umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; luminescent material such as, but not limited to, luminol; bioluminescent materials such as, but not limited to, luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; radioactive material such as, but not limited to, bismuth (Bi), carbon (C), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), fluorine (F), gadolinium (Gd, Gd), gallium (Ga, Ga), germanium (Ge), holmium (Ho), indium (In, In, In, In), iodine (I, I, I, I), lanthanium (La), lutetium (Lu), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), palladium (Pd), phosphorous (P), praseodymium (Pr), promethium (Pm), rhenium (Re, Re), rhodium (Rh), ruthemium (Ru), samarium (Sm), scandium (Sc), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), sulfur (S), technetium (Tc), thallium (Ti), tin (Sn, Sn), tritium (H), xenon (Xe), ytterbium (Yb, Yb), yttrium (Y), zinc (Zn); positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions.","The molecules of the present invention can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. Such heteroconjugate antibodies may additionally bind to haptens (such as fluorescein, etc.), or to cellular markers (e.g., 4-1-BB, B7-H4, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD25, CD27, CD40, CD68, CD163, CTLA4, GITR, LAG-3, OX40, TIM3, TIM4, TLR2, LIGHT, ICOS, B7-H3, B7-H7, B7-H7CR, CD70, CD47, etc.) or to cytokines (e.g., IL-7, IL-15, IL-12, IL-4 TGF-beta, IL-10, IL-17, IFN\u03b3, Flt3, BLys) or chemokines (e.g., CCL21), etc.","The molecules of the present invention may be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen or of other molecules that are capable of binding to target antigen that has been immobilized to the support via binding to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the present invention. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.","The present invention additionally includes nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA) that encode any such antibodies, fusion proteins or fragments, as well as vector molecules (such as plasmids) that are capable of transmitting or of replication such nucleic acid molecules. The nucleic acids can be single-stranded, double-stranded, may contain both single-stranded and double-stranded portions.","A. Preferred Modulator Compositions of the Present Invention","The invention particularly concerns antibodies that immunospecifically bind to B7-H1 or to PD-1 and\/or modulate the ability of B7-H1 to bind to PD-1 in a subject. As used herein, a \u201csubject\u201d is preferably a mammal such as a non-primate (e.g., cows, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, rats etc.) and a primate (e.g., monkey and human), most preferably a human. The invention thus particularly relates to humanized antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, that immunospecifically bind to human B7-H1 or to human PD-1 and modulate the ability of B7-H1 to bind to PD-1 in a human or in human tissue (in situ or ex vivo).","Most preferably, such antibodies and antigen-binding fragments will possess sufficient avidity to modulate the ability of B7-H1 (especially when expressed at an endogenous concentration and) arrayed on the surface of a subject's APC to bind to PD-1 (especially when expressed at an endogenous concentration and) arrayed on the surface of a T cell of such subject and vice versa. The term \u201cendogenous concentration\u201d refers to the level at which an endogenous molecule is natively expressed (i.e., in the absence of expression vectors or recombinant promoters) in a normal, cancer or infected cell.","In one embodiment, such modulation will comprise inhibiting or otherwise interfering with the binding of such (preferably endogenously expressed and) arrayed B7-H1 and such (preferably endogenously expressed and) arrayed PD-1. In an alternative embodiment, such modulation will comprise an enhancement or otherwise facilitate the binding of endogenously expressed and arrayed B7-H1 and endogenously expressed and arrayed PD-1. In yet another embodiment, such modulation includes direct agonism whereby binding of the anti-B7-H1 or anti-PD-1 triggers signal transduction through the corresponding receptor.","(1) Preferred Anti-Human B7-H1 Antibodies and Their CDRs","In accordance with the present invention, such molecules can be produced by screening hybridoma lines for those that produce antibody that are immunospecific for human B7-H1, and then optionally screening amongst such lines for those exhibiting modulating activity (e.g., neutralizing activity, agonizing activity, altered signal transducing activity, etc.). The invention particularly provides anti-human B7-H1 clones: 1E12, 1F4, 2G11, 3B6, and 3D10.","The antibodies expressed by the anti-human B7-H1 clones were sequenced to reveal their variable domains.

present invention permits the formation of novel antibodies and antigen-binding fragments having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 variant CDRs. Because the methods of the present invention have identified a substantial number of distinct CDRs, the invention permits a recognition of CDR residues that are likely to be required in any variant of a particular identified CDR. Such residues are shown in boldface in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5. For those residues that are found to vary among the compared CDRs, the substitution scores of Table 1 provide a means for determining the identities of permitted substitutions. For example, if a particular residue of a particular CDR is found to vary as R or S, then since R and S have a substitution score of \u22121, any substitution for R or S having a substitution score of \u22121 or greater are as likely as the observed variants (R or S) (or are more likely than R or S) to create a variant CDR having binding attributes that are sufficiently similar to those of the particular CDR to permit the variant CDR to be employed in lieu thereof so as to form a functional anti-B7-H1 or anti-PD-1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment. For each position, the selection of a residue having a higher substitution score is preferred over the selection of a residue having a lower substitution score.","Table 2 presents an analysis of the

Therapeutic and Prophylactic Uses of the Preferred Compositions of the Present Invention","The invention particularly relates to the therapeutic and\/or prophylactic use of molecules (especially antibodies or their antigen-binding fragments) that immunospecifically bind human B7-H1 or human PD-1, and\/or that are capable of modulating the binding between B7-H1 and PD-1 as such molecules (B7-H1 or PD-1) are endogenously expressed and arrayed in a subject (e.g., a human patient) and\/or are capable of modulating signaling via PD-1 or B7-H1.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreating,\u201d \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201ctherapeutic use\u201d refer to the elimination, reduction or amelioration of one or more symptoms of a disease or disorder exacerbated by the interactions of B7-H1 and PD-1. As used herein, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to that amount of a therapeutic agent sufficient to mediate a clinically relevant elimination, reduction or amelioration of such symptoms. An effect is clinically relevant if its magnitude is sufficient to impact the health or prognosis of a recipient subject. A therapeutically effective amount may refer to the amount of therapeutic agent sufficient to delay or minimize the onset of disease, e.g., delay or minimize the spread of cancer. A therapeutically effective amount may also refer to the amount of the therapeutic agent that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of a disease. Further, a therapeutically effective amount with respect to a therapeutic agent of the invention means that amount of therapeutic agent alone, or in combination with other therapies, that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of a disease, e.g., sufficient to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of a therapeutic antibody sufficient to treat or manage a disease.","As used herein, the term \u201cprophylactic agent\u201d refers to an agent that can be used in the prevention of a disorder or disease prior to the detection of any symptoms of such disorder or disease. A \u201cprophylactically effective\u201d amount is the amount of prophylactic agent sufficient to mediate such protection. A prophylactically effective amount may also refer to the amount of the prophylactic agent that provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of disease. Further, a prophylactically effective amount with respect to a prophylactic agent of the invention means that amount of prophylactic agent alone, or in combination with other agents, that provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of disease.","The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered, the severity and type of cancer, the route of administration, as well as age, body weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following, for example, dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the (56ed., 2002).","1. Uses of Up-Modulators of the Immune System","In a preferred embodiment, such antibodies and fragments bind to these antigens at one or more sites to B7-H1 or PD-1 proximal to and disruptive of the B7-H1-PD-1 binding site. As discussed above, interactions between PD-1 and B7-H1 inhibit the proliferation of T cells and reduce the production of multiple cytokines (see, Sharpe, A. H. et al. (2002) \u201c7-28 ,\u201d Nature Rev. Immunol. 2:116-126). Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the administration of the molecules of the present invention to a subject up-modulates the immune system of the subject by antagonizing B7-H1-PD-1 binding. In another embodiment, the avidity and\/or affinity of the anti-PD-1 antibody may be such that it only binds to (and blocks B7-H1 binding to) T cells that express very high levels of PD-1, which are the exhausted or dysfunctional T cells, and thus allow specific targeting of this cell population. Thus, the invention relates to the use of the antibodies of the present invention to mediate increased production of IFN-\u03b3. Thus, it relates to the use of such antibodies in the treatment of diseases and conditions that are treatable with IFN-\u03b3, such as ovarian and other forms of cancer, chronic granulomatous disease, osteopetrosis, Friedreich's ataxia, etc. Additionally, the invention particularly relates to the use of the antibodies of the present invention to mediate increased T cell proliferation. Thus, it relates to the use of such antibodies in the treatment of diseases and conditions that are treatable by increasing T cell proliferation, such as: AIDS; severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID); Omenn syndrome; Cartilage-hair hypoplasia; T cell loss or ablation incident to organ or tissue transplantation or chemotherapy; hypogammaglobulinemia; X-linked agammaglobulinemia; Transient hypogammaglobulinemia; dysgammaglobulinemia; IgA deficiency \u2022IgG deficiency; \u2022IgM deficiency; \u2022hyper IgM syndrome; \u2022Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; \u2022hyper-IgE syndrome; common variable immunodeficiency; ICF syndrome; thymic hypoplasia (e.g.; Di George's syndrome; Nezelof syndrome; Ataxia telangiectasia); purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency; adenosine deaminase deficiency; \u2022ZAP70 deficiency; \u2022Bare lymphocyte syndrome; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia (e.g.; idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia); or a complement deficiency. The invention particularly relates to the use of the antibodies of the present invention to mediate both increased production of IFN-\u03b3 and increased T cell proliferation.","Up-modulation of the immune system is particularly desirable in the treatment of cancers and chronic infections, and thus the present invention has utility in the treatment of such disorders. Both PD-1 and B7-H1 are over-expressed upon HIV infection (Xu, Huanbin et al. (2010) \u201c7-1 1 -,\u201d J. Immunol. 185:7340-7348; Grabmeier-Pfistershammer, K. et al. (2011) \u201c-1 -1-,\u201d J Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 56(2):118-124). Thus, expression of B7-H1 on such cells may be used to diagnose HIV in humans. Thus, the anti-PD-1 and anti-B7-H1 antibodies of the present invention have particular utility as therapeutics for HIV infection and AIDS treatment. As used herein, the term \u201ccancer\u201d refers to a neoplasm or tumor resulting from abnormal uncontrolled growth of cells. As used herein, cancer explicitly includes, leukemias and lymphomas. The term \u201ccancer\u201d refers to a disease involving cells that have the potential to metastasize to distal sites and exhibit phenotypic traits that differ from those of non-cancer cells, for example, formation of colonies in a three-dimensional substrate such as soft agar or the formation of tubular networks or web-like matrices in a three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation.

In specific embodiments, malignancy or dysproliferative changes (such as metaplasias and dysplasias), or hyperproliferative disorders, are treated or prevented by the methods and compositions of the invention in the ovary, bladder, breast, colon, lung, skin, pancreas, or uterus. In other specific embodiments, sarcoma, melanoma, or leukemia is treated or prevented by the methods and compositions of the invention.","Cancer cells acquire a characteristic set of functional capabilities during their development, albeit through various mechanisms. Such capabilities include evading apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, tissue invasion\/metastasis, limitless explicative potential, and sustained angiogenesis. The term \u201ccancer cell\u201d is meant to encompass both pre-malignant and malignant cancer cells. In some embodiments, cancer refers to a benign tumor, which has remained localized. In other embodiments, cancer refers to a malignant tumor, which has invaded and destroyed neighboring body structures and spread to distant sites. In yet other embodiments, the cancer is associated with a specific cancer antigen (e.g., pan-carcinoma antigen (KS 1\/4), ovarian carcinoma antigen (CA125), prostate specific antigen (PSA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CD19, CD20, HER2\/neu, etc.).","The antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention are particularly useful for the treatment of cancers that are associated with cells (e.g., exhausted T cells, B cells, monocytes, etc.) that express abnormally high levels of PD-1 (Youngblood, B. (2011) \u201c-1 -8(+) ,\u201d Immunity 35(3):400-412; Spahn, J. et al. (2011) \u201c8(+) --,\u201d Amer. J. Pathol. 179(5):2370-2381; Wang, C. et al.

(USA) 107(33):14733-14738).","Similar to its application to tumors as discussed above, the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the present invention can be used alone, or as an adjuvant, in combination with vaccines or with antimibrobial agents, to stimulate the immune response against toxins or self-antigens or against pathogens (e.g., viruses, such as HIV, HTLV, hepatitis virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, vaccinia virus, rabies virus; bacteria, such as those of , and particularly such pathogens associated with cholera, tetanus, botulism, anthrax, plague, and Lyme disease; or fungal or parasitic pathogens, such as (, etc.), (, etc.), Genus (), (), (), (), () and (), sp., sp., , etc.), , or , etc. Thus, the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the present invention have utility in the treatment of infectious disease.","2. Uses of Down-Modulators of the Immune System","In an alternative embodiment, the anti-B7-H1 or anti-PD-1 antibodies of the present invention are employed to produce anti-idiotypic peptides or antibodies (Wallmann, J. et al. (2010) \u201c-,\u201d World Allergy Organiz J 3(6):195-201; Nardi, M. et al. (2000) \u201c--1-,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 191(12):2093-2100) or mimetics (Zang, Y. C. et al. (2003) \u201c-3-,\u201d Int. Immunol. 15(9):1073-1080; Loiarro, M. et al. (Epub 2010 Apr. 8) \u201c-1,\u201d Mediators Inflamm. 2010:674363) of B7-H1 or PD-1. Such molecules serve as surrogates for B7-H1 or PD-1, and thus their administration to a subject down-modulates the immune system of such subject by mimicking or facilitating B7-H1-PD-1 binding. Such molecules have utility in the treatment of graft vs. host disease. Similarly, agonist antibodies that i) enhance binding between such antibodies and such receptor\/ligand or ii) trigger signal transduction when bound directly to B7-H1 or PD-1, have utility as agonists of B7-H1-PD-1 signaling and thus have utility in the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune disease, by directly or indirectly agonizing receptor activity.","Bi-specific antibodies, exhibiting immunospecific binding to both PD-1 and B7-H1 are capable of binding to both APC and T-cells, and thus facilitate the co-localization of APCs and T-cells. Such co-localization facilitates the ability of such cells to bind together via B7-H1 and PD-1 molecules that are not complexed with antibody, or by co-inhibitory molecules. Such binding provides down modulation of the immune system of the recipient.","Down-modulation of the immune system is desirable in the treatment of inflammatory and auto-immune diseases, and graft vs. host disease (GvHD). Examples of autoimmune disorders that may be treated by administering the antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to, alopecia greata, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune Addison's disease, autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Behcet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, cardiomyopathy, celiac sprue-dermatitis, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatrical pemphigoid, CREST syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, Crohn's disease, discoid lupus, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia-fibromyositis, glomerulonephritis, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), IgA neuropathy, juvenile arthritis, lichen planus, lupus erthematosus, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), type 1 or immune-mediated diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus vulgaris, pernicious anemia, polyarteritis nodosa, polychrondritis, polyglandular syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Raynauld's phenomenon, Reiter's syndrome, Rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, stiff-man syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus erythematosus, takayasu arteritis, temporal arteristis\/giant cell arteritis, transverse myelitis, ulcerative colitis, uveitis, vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis, vitiligo, and Wegener's granulomatosis.","Examples of inflammatory disorders which can be prevented, treated or managed in accordance with the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, asthma, encephilitis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic disorders, septic shock, pulmonary fibrosis, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, undifferentiated arthropathy, arthritis, inflammatory osteolysis, and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacterial infections.","Thus, the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the present invention have utility in the treatment of inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.","C. Methods of Administration","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the therapeutic or prophylactic compositions of the present invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or fusion protein, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987262:4429-4432), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc.","Methods of administering a humanized antibody of the invention include, but are not limited to, injection, as by parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural, and mucosal (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In a specific embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,20; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92\/19244; WO 97\/32572; WO 97\/44013; WO 98\/31346; and WO 99\/66903. In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering an antibody of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the antibody or the fusion protein does not absorb.","In some embodiments, the humanized or chimeric antibodies of the invention are formulated in liposomes for targeted delivery of the antibodies of the invention. Liposomes are vesicles comprised of concentrically ordered phopsholipid bilayers which encapsulate an aqueous phase. Liposomes typically comprise various types of lipids, phospholipids, and\/or surfactants. The components of liposomes are arranged in a bilayer configuration, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes are particularly preferred delivery vehicles due, in part, to their biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and low toxicity. Methods for preparation of liposomes are known in the art and are encompassed within the invention, see, e.g., Epstein et al., 198582: 3688; Hwang et al., 1980 77: 4030-4; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545.","The invention also encompasses methods of preparing liposomes with a prolonged serum half-life, i.e., enhanced circulation time, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. Preferred liposomes used in the methods of the invention are not rapidly cleared from circulation, i.e., are not taken up into the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The invention encompasses sterically stabilized liposomes which are prepared using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, sterically stabilized liposomes contain lipid components with bulky and highly flexible hydrophilic moieties, which reduces the unwanted reaction of liposomes with serum proteins, reduces oposonization with serum components and reduces recognition by MPS. Sterically stabilized liposomes are preferably prepared using polyethylene glycol. For preparation of liposomes and sterically stabilized liposome, see, e.g., Bendas et al., 2001 15(4): 215-224; Allen et al., 1987 223: 42-6; Klibanov et al., 1990 268: 235-7; Blum et al., 19901029: 91-7; Torchilin et al., 19966: 99-116; Litzinger et al., 19941190: 99-107; Maruyama et al., 199139: 1620-2; Klibanov et al., 19911062; 142-8; Allen et al., 199413: 285-309. The invention also encompasses liposomes that are adapted for specific organ targeting, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,544,545, or specific cell targeting, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005\/0074403. Particularly useful liposomes for use in the compositions and methods of the invention can be generated by reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. In some embodiments, a fragment of an antibody of the invention, e.g., F(ab\u2032), may be conjugated to the liposomes using previously described methods, see, e.g., Martin et al., 1982257: 286-288.","The humanized or chimeric antibodies of the invention may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Immunoliposomes refer to a liposomal composition, wherein an antibody of the invention or a fragment thereof is linked, covalently or non-covalently to the liposomal surface. The chemistry of linking an antibody to the liposomal surface is known in the art and encompassed within the invention, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,787,153; Allen et al., 1995, Stealth Liposomes, Boca Rotan: CRC Press, 233-44; Hansen et al., 19951239: 133-144. In most preferred embodiments, immunoliposomes for use in the methods and compositions of the invention are further sterically stabilized. Preferably, the humanized antibodies of the invention are linked covalently or non-covalently to a hydrophobic anchor, which is stably rooted in the lipid bilayer of the liposome. Examples of hydrophobic anchors include, but are not limited to, phospholipids, e.g., phosoatidylethanolamine (PE), phospahtidylinositol (PI). To achieve a covalent linkage between an antibody and a hydrophobic anchor, any of the known biochemical strategies in the art may be used, see, e.g., J. Thomas August, ed., 1997, Gene Therapy: Advances in Pharmacology, Volume 40, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., p. 399-435. For example, a functional group on an antibody molecule may react with an active group on a liposome associated hydrophobic anchor, e.g., an amino group of a lysine side chain on an antibody may be coupled to liposome associated N-glutaryl-phosphatidylethanolamine activated with water-soluble carbodiimide; or a thiol group of a reduced antibody can be coupled to liposomes via thiol reactive anchors, such as pyridylthiopropionylphosphatidylethanolamine. See, e.g., Dietrich et al., 199635: 1100-1105; Loughrey et al., 1987901: 157-160; Martin et al., 1982257: 286-288; Martin et al., 198120: 4429-38. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, immunoliposomal formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are particularly effective as therapeutic agents, since they deliver the antibody to the cytoplasm of the target cell, i.e., the cell comprising the receptor to which the antibody binds. The immunoliposomes preferably have an increased half-life in blood, specifically target cells, and can be internalized into the cytoplasm of the target cells thereby avoiding loss of the therapeutic agent or degradation by the endolysosomal pathway.","The immunoliposomal compositions of the invention comprise one or more vesicle forming lipids, an antibody of the invention or a fragment or derivative thereof, and, optionally, a hydrophilic polymer. A vesicle forming lipid is preferably a lipid with two hydrocarbon chains, such as acyl chains and a polar head group. Examples of vesicle forming lipids include phospholipids, e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, and glycolipids, e.g., cerebrosides, gangliosides. Additional lipids useful in the formulations of the invention are known to one skilled in the art and encompassed within the invention. In some embodiments, the immunoliposomal compositions further comprise a hydrophilic polymer, e.g., polyethylene glycol, and ganglioside GM1, which increases the serum half-life of the liposome. Methods of conjugating hydrophilic polymers to liposomes are well known in the art and encompassed within the invention. For a review of immunoliposomes and methods of preparing them, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003\/0044407; PCT International Publication No. WO 97\/38731, Vingerhoeads et al., 19944: 259-72; Maruyama, 200023(7): 791-799; Abra et al., 200212(1&2): 1-3; Park, 200222(2): 267-281; Bendas et al., 2001 14(4): 215-224, J. Thomas August, ed., 1997, Gene Therapy: Advances in Pharmacology, Volume 40, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., p. 399-435.","The invention also provides that the humanized or chimeric antibodies of the invention are packaged in a hermetically sealed container, such as an ampoule or sachette, indicating the quantity of antibody. In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g., with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, the antibodies of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized antibodies of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8\u00b0 C. in their original container and the antibodies should be administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, antibodies of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the antibody, fusion protein, or conjugated molecule. Preferably, the liquid form of the antibodies are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg\/ml, more preferably at least 2.5 mg\/ml, at least 5 mg\/ml, at least 8 mg\/ml, at least 10 mg\/ml, at least 15 mg\/ml, at least 25 mg\/ml, at least 50 mg\/ml, at least 100 mg\/ml, at least 150 mg\/ml, at least 200 mg\/ml of the antibodies.","The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. For antibodies encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.01 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.01 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg, 0.01 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg, 0.01 mg\/kg and 5 mg\/kg, 0.01 and 2 mg\/kg, 0.01 and 1 mg\/kg, 0.01 mg\/kg and 0.75 mg\/kg, 0.01 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.01 mg\/kg to 0.25 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.10 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.05 mg\/kg, or 0.01 to 0.025 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. In particular, the invention contemplates that the dosage administered to a patient is 0.2 mg\/kg, 0.3 mg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg, 3 mg\/kg, 6 mg\/kg or 10 mg\/kg. A dose as low as 0.01 mg\/kg is predicted to would show appreciable pharmacodynamic effects. Dose levels of 0.10-1 mg\/kg are predicted to be most appropriate. Higher doses (e.g., 1-30 mg\/kg) would also be expected to be active. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","In yet another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more antibodies of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; PCT publication WO 91\/05548; PCT publication WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996, \u201cIntratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel,\u201d & 39:179-189, Song et al., 1995, \u201cAntibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long-Circulating Emulsions,\u201d & 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 1997, \u201cBiodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application,\u201d 24:853-854; and Lam et al., 1997, \u201cMicroencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery,\u201d 24:759-760. In one embodiment, a pump may be used in a controlled release system (See Langer, supra; Sefton, 198714:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; and Saudek et al., 1989321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled release of antibodies (see e.g., Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 198323:61; See also Levy et al., 1985228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 19897 1:105); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,679,377; 5,916,597; 5,912,015; 5,989,463; 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99\/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99\/20253). Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target (e.g., the lungs), thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). In another embodiment, polymeric compositions useful as controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,155). This particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another embodiment, a non-polymeric sustained delivery system is used, whereby a non-polymeric implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in the body, the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate, disperse, or leach from the composition into surrounding tissue fluid, and the non-polymeric material will gradually coagulate or precipitate to form a solid, microporous matrix (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,533). Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; International Publication Nos. WO 91\/05548 and WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996& 39:179-189; Song et al., 1995& 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 199724:853-854; and Lam et al., 199724:759-760.","In a specific embodiment wherein the therapeutic or prophylactic composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding an antibody of the invention or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded antibody, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (See e.g., Joliot et al., 199188:1864-1868), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.","Treatment of a subject with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of antibodies of the invention can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments.","D. Pharmaceutical Compositions","The compositions of the invention include bulk drug compositions useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions (i.e., compositions that are suitable for administration to a subject or patient) which can be used in the preparation of unit dosage forms. Such compositions comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agent disclosed herein or a combination of those agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, compositions of the invention comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of humanized antibodies of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant (e.g., Freund's adjuvant (complete and incomplete), excipient, surfactant, cryoprotectant or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol, polysorbate-80 and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.","Generally, the ingredients of compositions of the invention are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","E. Kits","The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with humanized antibodies of the invention. Additionally, one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included in the pharmaceutical pack or kit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises one or more humanized antibodies of the invention. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer, in one or more containers. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more cytotoxic antibodies that bind one or more cancer antigens associated with cancer. In certain embodiments, the other prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic. In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a biological or hormonal therapeutic.","F. Diagnostic Methods","The antibodies of the invention and their antigen-binding fragments can be used for diagnostic purposes, such as to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases, disorders or infections associated with B7-H1 or PD-1 expression. The invention provides for the detection or diagnosis of a disease, disorder or infection, particularly an autoimmune disease comprising: (a) assaying the expression of B7-H1 or of PD-1 in cells or in a tissue sample of a subject using one or more antibodies (or fragments thereof) that immunospecifically bind to such antigens; and (b) comparing the level of the antigen with a control level, e.g., the level in a normal tissue sample, or before treatment, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed level of antigen compared to the control level of the antigen is indicative of the disease, disorder or infection, or of the subject's response to treatment. Thus, the invention also provides for monitoring the progression of a disease, disorder or infection, comprising: (a) assaying the expression of B7-H1 or of PD-1 in cells or in a tissue sample of a subject at one point in time using one or more antibodies (or fragments thereof) that immunospecifically bind to such antigens; and (b) comparing the level of expression of B7-H1 or of PD-1 in cells or in a tissue sample of a subject at another point in time, or over a time course, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed level of antigen is indicative of the progression of disease, disorder or infection. The invention additionally provides for monitoring the response to treatment, comprising: (a) assaying the expression of B7-H1 or of PD-1 in cells or in a tissue sample of a subject prior to treatment with one or more antibodies (or fragments thereof) that immunospecifically bind to such antigens; and (b) assaying the expression of B7-H1 or of PD-1 in cells or in a tissue sample of a subject prior at one or more time points after treatment, and comparing the level of the antigen over time, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed level of antigen compared to the pre-treatment level of the antigen is indicative of a response to treatment. Such antibodies and fragments are preferably employed in immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).","One aspect of the invention relates to the use of such antibodies and fragments, and particularly such antibodies and fragments that bind to human B7-H1, as reagents for IHC analysis in cells of an in vitro or in situ tissue sample or in vivo. For example, since B7-H1 is expressed by cancer cells but not by normal tissue (Dong, H. (2003) \u201c7-1 ,\u201d J. Mol. Med. 81:281-287), detection of its presence on a cell by such cell's binding to such antibodies or fragments is indicative and diagnostic of a cancer cell. Thus, the present invention provides a cytologic assay for diagnosing the presence of cancer in a subject.","The presence of B7-H1 on tumor cells has been found to enhance apoptosis of T cells that respond to the tumor (U.S. Pat. No. 7,794,710). Thus, by determining the extent or degree to which tumor cells of a cancer patient exhibit B7-H1 on their surfaces, the present invention provides a means for determining the clinical significance of the cancer, and the extent to which it will be refractory to an immune response.","Similarly, B7-H1 is expressed on lymphoid and mucosal dendritic cells (both myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells), and its expression significantly increases after SIV infection (Xu, Huanbin et al. (2010) \u201c7-1 1 -,\u201d J. Immunol. 185:7340-7348). Thus, expression of B7-H1 on such cells may be used to diagnose HIV in humans. Additionally, it has been found that PD-1 expression on CD8+ cells is increased in the context of HIV infection (Killian, M. S. et al. (2011) \u201c1 8,\u201d J. Virol. 85(4):1696-1705). Thus antibodies that bind to both PD-1 and CD8 have particular utility in the diagnosis of HIV infection and AIDS progression.","A further aspect of the invention relates to the use of such antibodies and fragments, and particularly such antibodies and fragments that bind to human PD-1. PD-1 has particular utility as a marker of chronic immune activation and T-cell exhaustion. Its expression is enhanced on T cells of viremic HIV-infected patient and correlates with the viral load in these patients (Khaitan, A. et al. (2011) \u201c,\u201d Curr. HIV\/AIDS Rep. 8:4-11; Grabmeier-Pfistershammer, K. et al. (2011) \u201c-1 -1-,\u201d J Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 56(2):118-124). Thus, PD-1 has particular utility as a marker of HIV progression. Most preferably PD-1 expression will be assessed using flow cytometry. Through the use of such antibodies and fragments, T cells (which express PD-1) can be analyzed for multiple parameters (e.g., cell counting, cell size, phenotype and cellular health, etc.) even though present in heterogeneous preparations. Thus, in concert with antibodies to PD-1 and their antigen-binding fragments, such methods can be used to diagnose the extent or severity of AIDS, leukemias, and other disease affecting T cell number and health. Methods of flow cytometry that may be adapted to the purposes of the present invention are disclosed in and in Peters, J. M. et al. (2011) \u201c,\u201d Arch. Pathol. Lab.

In one embodiment, such diagnosis comprises: a) administering to a subject (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) an effective amount of a labeled antibody or antigen-binding fragment that immunospecifically binds to B7-H1 or PD-1; b) waiting for a time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where B7-H1 or PD-1 is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c) determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled antibody in the subject, such that detection of labeled antibody above the background level indicates that the subject has the disease, disorder, or infection. In accordance with this embodiment, the antibody is labeled with an imaging moiety which is detectable using an imaging system known to one of skill in the art. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).","Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.","In one embodiment, monitoring of a disease, disorder or infection is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease, disorder or infection, for example, one month after initial diagnosis, six months after initial diagnosis, one year after initial diagnosis, etc.","Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the subject using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography.","In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patient using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention unless specified.","In order to isolate high affinity neutralizing anti-human B7-H1 antibodies, mice were first immunized and then boosted with human B7-H1-Fc. Splenocytes from anti-B7-H1 positive animals were fused with myeloma cells following standard protocol. The resulting murine hybridomas were screened for those that express B7-H1-immunoreactive monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies were additionally evaluated to determine whether they were IgG or IgM antibodies. Accordingly, B7-H1-Fc or negative control was immobilized to a solid support. Hybridoma supernatants were then placed in contact with the support, and the presence of anti-B7-H1 antibody was determined using labeled anti-mouse IgG or anti-mouse IgM.  shows the results of tested hybridoma supernatants and indicates the isolation of multiple hybridoma lines that express antibody immunoreactive with human B7-H1.","The identified hybridomas were screened to determine whether their expressed antibodies were neutralizing antibodies and as such capable of blocking the binding between B7-H1 and PD-1. PD-1-Fc was immobilized to a solid support, which was then incubated in the presence of diluted conditioned media containing biotinylated B7-H1-Fc. The ability of the B7-H1 and PD-1 to bind to one another was detected by assaying for the binding of streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (SA-HRP) to the solid support. Anti-B7-H1 antibody capable of modulating the binding of B7-H1 to PD-1 thus mediate a decrease in SA-HAS binding in this assay. The results of the experiment are shown in , and indicate that several of the isolated hybridomas expressed human B7-H1 neutralizing antibodies. Antibody MIH-1 (anti-human CD274 (B7-H1) (Chen, Y. et al. (Epub 2005 Nov. 11) \u201c7-1 ,\u201d Nephron. Exp. Nephrol. 102(3-4):e81-e92) was used as a positive control. 29E.2AE is an anti-PD-1 antibody but was shown to be non-neutralizing in this assay. Conditioned media from an unrelated hybridoma (rand Ab) and a vector control (VC) were used as negative controls.","In order to determine whether the expressed neutralizing antibodies were capable of binding to B7-H1 that was arrayed on the surface of a cell, a cell binding assay was conducted. Supernatant from each hybridoma clone was diluted 1:4 and incubated in the presence of parental CHO cells and a clonal CHO line that overexpressed full length human B7-H1. After permitting binding to occur, the cells were washed and the presence of residual cell-bound anti-B7-H1 antibody was detected using fluorescently labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for binding to CHO-hB7-H1 is shown in . None of the tested clones were found to cross-react with the parental CHO line, indicating that the expressed antibody was specific for human B7-H1.","As a further assessment, different concentrations of three clones were compared to anti-B7-H1 antibody MIH-1. Antibody was purified using protein G and assessed for ability to bind to B7-H1 when present at endogenous levels and as arrayed on the surface of an APC. CHO cells that expressed human B7-H1 were incubated with varying concentrations (10, 1 or 0.1 \u03bcg\/ml) of anti-B7-H1 antibody followed by incubation with APC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody. Binding was reported by measuring median fluorescence intensity. The results show that the tested antibodies exhibited greater avidity toward B7-H1 than the control antibody (MIH1) () and that antibody 1E12 exhibited greater avidity toward B7-H1 than a control anti-B7-H1 antibody (5H1) (Dong, H. et al. (2002) \u201c-7-1 -,\u201d Nature Med. 8(8):793-800) ().","In summary, the data show that multiple anti-human B7-H1-expressing hybridomas were obtained. All clones are IgG antibodies that recognize B7-H1-Fc. Clones 1B3, 1D11, 1E2, 1E4, 1E10, 2A6, 2E12, 2F2, 2F5, 2F11, 3A4, and 3B1 are weak in the screening binding assay. Low signal could be due to low expression levels and\/or weak affinity.","Significantly, several clones (e.g., clones: 1D5, 1E12, 1F4, 2A7, 2G11, 3B6, 3D10) showed strong neutralizing activity. All are neutralizing at all concentrations tested and appear to bind to antigen well. MFI for binding to CHO-B7-H1 cells is as follows: 1D5=50,821; 1E12=56,152; 1F4=62,015; 2A7=49,008; 2G11=55,947; 3B6=59,638; 3D10=53,114.","In order to isolate high affinity neutralizing anti-human PD-1 antibodies, mice were first immunized and then boosted with human PD-1-Fc. Splenocytes from anti-PD-1 positive animals were fused with myeloma cells following standard protocol. The resulting murine hybridomas were screened for those that express high affinity human PD-1-immunoreactive monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies were additionally evaluated to determine whether they were IgG or IgM antibodies. Accordingly, PD-1-Fc or negative control (B7-H4-Fc) was immobilized to a solid support.

B7-DC-Fc, a fusion protein that binds PD-1, was immobilized to a solid support, which was then incubated in the presence of diluted conditioned media containing biotinylated PD-1-Fc. The ability of the B7-DC and PD-1 to bind to one another was detected by assaying for the binding of streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (SA-HRP) to the solid support. Anti-PD-1 antibody capable of blocking the binding of B7-DC to PD-1 thus mediates a decrease in SA-HRP binding in this assay. The results of the experiment are shown in , and indicate that several of the isolated hybridomas expressed human PD-1 neutralizing antibodies ( shows the same graph as , but at a different scale).","A cell binding assay was conducted in order to determine whether the expressed neutralizing antibodies were capable of binding to PD-1 arrayed on a cell surface. Supernatant from each hybridoma clone was diluted 1:4 and incubated in the presence of parental CHO cells and a clonal CHO line that overexpressed full length human PD-1. After permitting binding to occur, the cells were washed and the presence of residual cell-bound anti-PD-1 antibody was detected using fluorescently labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for binding to CHO-hPD-1 is shown in . The results demonstrate that antibodies 1E3, 1E8, and 1H3 were particularly capable of binding to human PD-1 expressed on a cell surface. None of the tested clones were found to cross-react with the parental CHO line, indicating that the expressed antibody was specific for human PD-1. J116 is commercially available anti-human PD-1 control antibody (eBioscience, Inc.). Isotyping revealed that 1E3, 1E8, 1H3 are IgG1\/kappa.","Two clones (1E3 and 1H3) were selected for further study. As a further assessment, different concentrations of two clones were compared to anti-PD-1 antibodies M3 and EH-12. Antibody was purified using protein G and assessed for ability to bind to PD-1 expressed on the surfaces of CHO cells. CHO-hPD1 cells were stained with unlabeled anti-PD-1 antibody (10, 1, and 0.1 \u03bcg\/mL) followed by APC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody and the median fluorescence intensity was reported. The results of the assay are reported in . The negative control is murine IgG (mIgG1); the positive controls are M3 (a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against human PD-1 (Wu, K. et al.

The median fluorescence intensity is shown in . The competition was repeated at a fixed antibody concentration of 20 \u03bcg\/mL ().","In summary, the results show that clones 1E3, 1E8, and 1H3 exhibit neutralizing activity and recognize antigen well. Clone 1E6 is able to cross-link PD-1 without neutralizing it, thereby giving enhanced binding. However this clone does not appear to bind PD-1 on the cell surface.","As indicated above, for certain purposes, including for example, use in the in vivo treatment of human disease, it is preferred to employ a humanized derivative of the above-described anti-human B7-H1 and\/or anti-human PD-1 antibodies.","To form such derivatives, the framework sequences of the 3D10 or 1H3 antibodies (the \u201cParental\u201d sequences) were first aligned with framework sequences of a set of \u201cAcceptor\u201d human antibodies in order to identify differences in the framework sequences. Humanization was accomplished by substituting non-matching framework residues between the Parental and the Acceptor. Substitutions at potentially important positions such as those in the Vernier zone, the VH\/VL inter-chain interface or CDR canonical class determining positions were analyzed for prospective back mutations (see, Foote, J. et al. (1992) \u201c,\u201d J. Molec. Biol. 224:487-499). A total 14 humanized variant sequences were identified.","The Conserved Domain Database (COD) (Marchler-Bauer, et al. (2011) \u201c,\u201d Nucleic Acids Res. 39:D225-D229) was used to determine the domain content of each amino-acid chain and the approximate boundaries of each domain. Variable domain boundaries were exactly determined along with the boundaries of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) according to several commonly used definitions (Kabat, E. A. et al. (1991) \u201c,\u201d Fifth Edition. NIH Publication No. 91-3242; Chothia, C. et al. (1987) \u201c,\u201d J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917); Honegger, A. et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d J. Molec. Biol. 309(3):657-670; Chothia's CDR definition (Chothia, C. et al. (1987) \u201c,\u201d J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917) will be used below with respect to such humanized sequences.","Multiple alignments of the Parental sequence to the mouse and human germline sequences were generated using MAFFT (Katoh, K. et al. (2002) \u201c,\u201d Nucleic Acids Res. 30: 3059-3066) and entries in each alignment were ordered according to the sequence identity to the Parental sequence. Reference sets were reduced to a unique set of sequences by clustering at 100% sequence identity and excluding redundant entries.","The optimal Acceptor framework selection was based on the overall Parental antibodies sequence identity to the Acceptor across the framework of both chains; however the positions that compose the VH\/VL inter-chain interface are of particular interest. Additionally, the CDR-loops lengths and CDR positions responsible for the discrete set of canonical structures that has been defined for 5 of the CDRs (Chothia, C. et al. (1987) \u201c,\u201d J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917; Martin, A. C. et al. (1996) \u201c,\u201d J. Molec. Biol 263:800-815; Al-Laziniki, B. et al. (1997) \u201c,\u201d J. Molec. Biol. 273:927-948) were compared to the germlines, in order to determine which germline frameworks had both the same interface residues and were known to support similar CDR-loop conformations.

The choice of the preferred human germline was based on the ordered criteria: (1) Sequence identity across the framework; (2) Identical or compatible inter-chain interface residues; (3) Support loops with the Parental CDRs canonical conformations; (4) The combination of heavy and light germlines are found in expressed antibodies; and (5) Presence of N-glycosylation sites that have to be removed.","A structural model of antibody 1H3's Fv-region was generated. Candidate structural template fragments for the framework (FR) and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) as well as the full Fv were scored, ranked and selected from an antibody database based on their sequence identity to the target, as well as qualitative crystallographic measures of the template structure such as the resolution, in Angstroms (\u212b).","In order to structurally align the CDRs to the FR templates, 5 residues on either side of the CDR were included in the CDR template. An alignment of the fragments was generated based on overlapping segments and a structural sequence alignment generated. The template fragments along with the alignment were processed by MODELLER (SalI, A. et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d J. Molec. Biol. 234:779-815). This protocol creates conformational restraints derived from the set of aligned structural templates. An ensemble of structures which satisfied the constraints was created by conjugate gradient and simulated annealing optimization procedures. Model structures were selected from this ensemble on the basis of an energy score, derived from the score of the proteins structure and the satisfaction of the conformational constraints. The models were inspected and the side chains of the positions which differed between the target and template were optimized using a side chain optimization algorithm and energy minimized. A suite of visualization and computational tools were used to assess the CDRs conformational variability, local packing and surface analysis to select one or more preferred models.","A structural model of the Parental antibody was constructed and inspected for imperfections such as poor atomic packing, strain in bond lengths, bond angles or dihedral angles. These imperfections may indicate potential issues with the structural stability of the antibody. The modeling protocol seeks to minimize such imperfections. The initial structural model of the Humanized Fv contains all safe substitutions (i.e., substitutions that should not affect binding affinity or stability) and cautious substitutions (i.e., the position substitution is made but the position may be important for binding affinity). Substitutions at positions that are considered to be associated with a risk a decreased binding affinity or reduced stability are not altered. The template search and selection was performed separately to the Parental template search in order to create a good stand-alone model rather than a closely matching variant model of the Parental. As the assessment of potential substitutions was performed the model was updated to reflect the preferred substitutions and the effect of back mutations.","To illustrate the production of such humanized derivatives, humanized derivatives of anti-human B7-H1 antibody 3D10 was produced in accordance with the above-described procedure.","Sequence alignments comparing 3D10 light chain variable

ten residue CDR L1 similar to canonical class I loops. Human germlines do not have such a short CDR L1. Each of the selected germlines, IGKV3-11*01 and IGKV1-9*01, have shorter L1 loops containing the correct framework residues to support this type of loop. A good overall sequence similarity is observed between both Acceptor frameworks and the Parental sequence, however important differences are observed at the interface positions Y33 and P45. Residue Y33 is in CDR L1 and whilst the two selected Acceptor families do not contain tyrosine at this position, other germline sequences do. The difference between the Acceptor frameworks and the Parental sequence at position P45 is a consequence of the Parental germline possessing a FR2 dissimilar to any human germline. As a result changes in this region were proposed regardless of the Acceptor framework chosen, so IGKV3-11*01 and IGKV1-9*01 were advanced as the Acceptor frameworks.","Three humanized chains were created for each of the two preferred Acceptor frameworks, IGKV3-11*01 and IGKV 1-9*01.

light of the above-discussed criteria, two candidate germline Acceptor frameworks: IGHV3-48*01 (IGHV3 Germline) and IGHV1-3*01 (IGHV1 Germline) were selected for the humanization of the heavy chain of antibody 1H3 Var1.","Acceptor Framework 1GHV3-48*01 was selected as the primary heavy Acceptor framework due to its overall sequence similarity. The interface residues match except for H35, a position at where some variation is allowed and it contains the correct residues for determining canonical class for CDR H1. CDR H2 does not fall into any sequence-based canonical class due to a tyrosine at position 56. The choice of the second heavy chain Acceptor framework was made after removing any germ line closely related to IGHV3-48*01. The closest germ line then became IGHV1-3*01.
