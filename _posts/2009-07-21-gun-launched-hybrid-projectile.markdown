title: Gun launched hybrid projectile
abstract: A Hybrid Projectile is provided for delivering an explosive payload to a target wherein the Hybrid Projectile may be steered in flight using relatively inexpensive means. The Hybrid Projectile is exteriorly configured in the same physical exterior configuration of conventional ammunition of various standard types so it can be launched in conventional manner from the same weapon systems. However, internal features allow the Hybrid Projectile to be transformed in flight from a command signal to deploy wings and fins, and in some projectiles to telescope open to deploy such wings and fins. An inexpensive televisual means is activated in the fore region of the round which through RF uplink command can be used to select a path, while motors on the wings can then be used to more precisely glide the projectile to a target, or otherwise to abort the target run.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be made, used, or licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","Currently, projectiles are fired (gun launched) from military guns to defeat targets such as enemy soldiers, buildings and vehicles. These projectiles depend on either an energetic in the projectile, defeating the target with projectile shrapnel or blast overpressure, or by the kinetic energy of the projectile. Grenade, Shoulder Launched, Tank, Mortar, and Artillery projectiles may also be fired to defeat targets. A projectile can carry a heavy payload of high explosives, and is cannon launched with great force, so the projectile can travel up to long distances (such as 10 miles, e.g.) and deliver the destructive payload to the target. However, such projectile essentially cannot be steered in flight or recalled once launched. This lack of steering is with the possible exception of prohibitively expensive current proposed systems. Some of the new mortar and artillery projectiles have thrusters or canards that provide course correction capability. However, they require sophisticated programming, electronics, sensors, and seekers to define, select, then to hit a target; they therefore are extremely expensive. These guided projectiles do not pass visual information back to the user (the soldier). These projectiles cannot be recalled and do not allow the user to select target based on visual information. They are also much larger and heavier than existing projectiles of the same caliber. They do not have the appearance and shape of the existing projectile of the same caliber. By contrast an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) which can be tube or hand launched can be steered while in flight, however essentially a UAV cannot carry the desired heavy payloads of high explosives, moreover the UAV requires large motorized propellers which take space, consume large energy, may require batteries, and usually make noise which makes them easy to detect and track. The UAV takes a long time to reach the target and can be blown off course by the wind, e.g., the hand or tube launched UAV does not have the appearance and shape of an existing projectile of the same caliber. They cannot complete the same mission as conventional ammunition or the missions of the hybrid type projectile of this invention.","This Hybrid Projectile invention utilizes the best inherent features of existing projectiles while adding a simple comparatively less expensive feature for glide steering. This can be accomplished by transforming the projectile in flight (on command), having the projectile deploy wings and fins which can be simply used to glide and further steer the projectile. The projectile, includes simplified TV means in the fore that can be ground monitored, and the projectile can be ground commanded through an RF link to glide and selectively thus \u201cflown\u201d (using a joystick or the like). Gun launching or shoulder launching the Hybrid Projectiles utilizes the dramatic energy from the gun launch to get the projectile to targets, within a few seconds, or utilize the shape change at apogee to get a Hybrid Projectile to a great distance in a fraction of the time of a hand or tube launched UAV. Due to the energy of the gun, a much bigger lethal and non-lethal payload, per UAV aerodynamics, can be delivered to the target at greater distances than conventional ammunition or projectiles. If not chosen to so transform the projectile in flight, then the projectile would ordinarily continue on its routine flight to a target, as is usual for that projectile. The soldier can use this Hybrid Projectile of selected caliber alongside of, or in place of, existing Grenade, Shoulder Launched, Tank, Mortar, and Artillery projectiles. The user may set the projectile's fuze prior to launch for a mode of not to transform; and this will result in the ordinary use of that projectile, from launch to target without guidance as in this invention.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a Hybrid Projectile for delivering an explosive payload to a target, utilizing an adaptation of existing 40 MM grenade projectile rounds, and adaptations of existing 66 MM, 83 MM, or 84 MM shoulder launched projectiles.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a Hybrid Projectile for delivering an explosive payload to a target wherein the Hybrid Projectile may be steered in flight using relatively inexpensive means, and;","It is a further object of the present invention to provide said Hybrid Projectile to as close as practical be exteriorly configured in the same physical exterior configuration of conventional ammunition, and;","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide said Hybrid Projectile to be exteriorly configured in the configuration of conventional caliber mortar projectiles, and;","It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide said Hybrid Projectile to be exteriorly configured in the configuration of conventional caliber telescoping projectiles, and;","It is another object of the present invention to provide said Hybrid Projectile to be exteriorly configured in the configuration of conventional large caliber ammunition cartridges, and;","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a Hybrid Projectile which in flight can be commanded to deploy wings and fins for gliding said Hybrid Projectile through uplink remote commands, and;","A yet further object of the present invention is to have a selectable fuze feature on the Hybrid Projectile where a soldier can set mission as ordinary or guided.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in view of the within detailed descriptions of the invention and in light of the following drawings. It should be understood that the sizes and shapes of the different components in the figures may not be in exact proportion and are shown here for visual clarity and for purpose of explanation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","301","306","305","1","305","306","321","310","322","2","303","308","310","312","311","313","307","309","3","323","4","4","324"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["109","107","105","101","121","109","103","117","118","310","112","110","109","115","114","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["209","201","221","225","227","228","211","209","203","217","218","310","213","216","212","215","214","209","228","214"]},"In a further embodiment in , the glidable round  could be stored as cargo within a large mortar projectile (105 to 120 MM caliber), or as cargo within a projectile grenade (such as 40 MM size). Then upon command from the ground station, such projectiles could simply release the glidable round. The method of release is for the body section (such as  and ) of these projectiles to simply fall away, springing apart, releasing the cargo round  by conventional means not shown here. The cargo is the glidable round analogous to those previously shown in the figures. Wings  and fins  are made to snap out after  is launched. A full UAV in foldable position could be launched this way, as cargo in a relatively large projectile.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
