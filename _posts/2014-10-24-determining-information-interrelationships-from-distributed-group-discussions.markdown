title: Determining information inter-relationships from distributed group discussions
abstract: Techniques are described for analyzing user-supplied information and/or predicting future aspects of additional information that will be supplied by users. The analyzed information may include distributed group discussions involving numerous users, occurring via user comments and other content items supplied to social networking site(s) and/or other sources. Analysis of user-supplied information may, for example, include determining particular topics and/or categories of interest during one or more time periods and quantifying corresponding amounts of user interest; determining trends for, relevant terms and attributes for, and inter-relationships between the topics and categories; predicting future amounts of user interest in the topics and categories; tracking user interactions with information about the topics and/or categories; and taking further actions based on the analyzed and/or predicted information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/906,827, filed Nov. 20, 2013 and entitled \u201cAutomated Discovery Of Information Inter-Relationships From Distributed Group Discussions;\u201d and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/948,388, filed Mar. 5, 2014 and entitled \u201cUser Journeys Through Inter-Related Categories From Distributed Group Discussions;\u201d each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for performing automated operations to analyze user-supplied information related to distributed group discussions and\/or to analyze user interactions with information about the distributed group discussions, as well as to use information from the analyzing in various manners.","Discussions of current topics of interest by various distributed users are increasingly occurring via social networking sites and other computer-accessible sites that are available to the users, whether by users replying to and commenting on information supplied by other users, or by various users independently submitting information that in aggregate reflects topics of interest. In some situations, a particular distributed group discussion may occur between a particular selected subset of users (e.g., users that are members of a common group, club, service, etc.), while in other situations a distributed group discussion may include any user with access to one or more sites via which that discussion occurs.","Information about discussions that have occurred and\/or are occurring may have value to various types of entities, and may be useful to perform various types of additional activities. However, various problems exist with obtaining and disseminating and using such information in a timely manner, including due to the distributed nature of the discussions.","Techniques are described for analyzing user-supplied information in various ways, including in some embodiments to predict future aspects of additional related information that is expected to be supplied by users, such as during one or more future time periods. In at least some embodiments, the user-supplied information that is analyzed corresponds to distributed group discussions that involve numerous users and occur via user posts or other user comments or submissions made to one or more computer-accessible sites, such as one or more social networking services. The analysis of user-supplied information may, in at least some embodiments, include determining particular topics that are being discussed for a specified category during one or more periods of time, quantifying an amount of user interest in particular topics and the category during the period of time from the discussion, and predicting future amounts of user interest in the particular topics and the category as part of an expected future discussion during one or more future period of times. As one illustrative example, millions of user Twitter tweets, user posts to social networking sites, and other user-supplied comments or other content items may be analyzed over a prior window of time (e.g., the last 72 hours) in a real-time or near-real-time manner, including to determine trends and other changes in information corresponding to particular topics and categories of interest over the prior window of time, and\/or to automatically predict future trends and other changes in information corresponding to particular topics and categories of interest for a future span of time (e.g., the next 24 hours)\u2014in addition, various types of further actions then being taken based on the analyzed current information and\/or on the predicted information. Additional details related to analyzing and using user-supplied information in particular manners are described below, and some or all of the described techniques are performed in at least some embodiments by automated operations of a Group Discussion Analysis and Prediction (\u201cGDAP\u201d) system, such as while providing a GDAP service for use by various types of users and other external entities.","In at least some embodiments, the described techniques include performing an automated discovery process that involves analyzing user-supplied information from one or more time periods to determine particular categories of interest for those time periods and to identify inter-category relationships for those time periods based on the user-supplied information associated with those categories. As distributed group discussions in the user-supplied information change over time, the determined categories of interest and\/or determined inter-category relationships may similarly change. Similarly, analysis of user-supplied information associated with particular categories and\/or with particular topics in particular categories for one or more time periods may be used in at least some embodiments to identify further inter-relationships between particular topics (e.g., topics in different categories) and\/or between particular topics and other categories to which those topics do not belong, with such further inter-relationships also subject to change over time as the distributed group discussions in the user-supplied information change. Additional details related to performing an automated discovery process in particular manners are described below, and some or all of the described techniques are performed in at least some embodiments by automated operations of the GDAP system, such as while providing a GDAP service for use by various types of users and other external entities.","The described techniques further include displaying or otherwise presenting information to various users about the distributed group discussions and related analyzed information in at least some embodiments, such as via a GUI (\u201cgraphical user interface\u201d) of the GDAP system\u2014the users to whom the information is presented may in some embodiments include some or all of the users who have supplied the information related to the distributed group discussions, while in other embodiments, some or all of the users to whom the information is presented may be distinct from the users who have supplied the information related to the distributed group discussions. In addition, various types of interactions by users with the presented information may be tracked and analyzed in various manners in various embodiments. As a non-exclusive example, a user may be able to display various information about a particular group of comments corresponding to a topic of interest in a particular category (referred to generally herein as a \u201ctopic-specific comment group\u201d or \u201ccomment group\u201d) or about a particular category of interest, including to change the display to another selected category or topic-specific comment group, such as based on inter-relationships between the initial and subsequent categories and\/or comment groups. As another non-exclusive example, a user may be able to specify multiple terms or other attributes of interest, and view a graph or other display indicating the relevance of various topics to such specified terms or other attributes for one or more time periods of interest, such as by viewing information about comment groups of particular categories that correspond to such topics. As another non-exclusive example, a user may be able to view displayed information about inter-relationships between various information categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups, such as to enable the user to interact with the displayed information to explore a succession of such inter-related information categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups. Additional details related to such display or other presenting of information in particular manners and such tracking and analysis of user interactions with presented information are described below, with some or all of the described techniques being performed in at least some embodiments by automated operations of the GDAP system, such as while providing a GDAP service for use by various types of users and other external entities.","Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, the described techniques include tracking and using information about user interactions with information that is displayed or otherwise presented to the users via a GUI of the GDAP system, such as by tracking user journeys through displays of information about multiple inter-related information categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups. Such a user journey may in some embodiments include a sequence of a specified number of distinct categories and\/or comment groups that are selected by and displayed to a user, while in other embodiments user journeys may have other forms and may be determined in various manners. After such user journeys are identified, they may be analyzed and used in various manners in various embodiments, including to enable other users to select and playback particular user journeys taken by other users. Additional details related to performing journey-related activities in particular manners are described below, and some or all of the described techniques are performed in at least some embodiments by automated operations of the GDAP system, such as while providing a GDAP service for use by various types of users and other external entities.","Moreover, in at least some embodiments, the described techniques include interacting with advertisers and\/or other entities external to the GDAP system to provide various benefits, such as to enable the external entities to provide promotional content to users of the GDAP system in particular indicated situations, to provide the external entities with brand-related information based on analysis of determined inter-relationships between categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups and\/or to provide the external entities with brand-related information based on user interactions with related information via the GUI of the GDAP system. For example, in at least some embodiments, external entities may select to provide particular promotional information in particular situations (e.g., when information is being displayed via the GUI involving particular terms, topics and topic-specific comment groups, categories, inter-relationships between categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups, relevance relationships of topics to terms or other attributes, user journeys, user groups, etc.), such as to display such promotional information via the GUI to users who are interacting with corresponding indicated information. Additional details related to performing promotional-related activities in particular manners are described below, and some or all of the described techniques are performed in at least some embodiments by automated operations of the GDAP system, such as while providing a GDAP service for use by various types of users and other external entities.","The user comments and other user-supplied information that are obtained and analyzed may have various forms in various embodiments, such as to reflect information that is supplied by human users and made available to other users. For example, the user-supplied information may, in at least some embodiments, include posts and other user submissions to sources of such user-supplied information (generally referred to as \u201ccomment data sources\u201d herein) that include one or more social networking services or sites, such as tweets to the Twitter service, and\/or posts to Facebook, MySpace, Google+, LinkedIn, etc., in which other users may receive or otherwise access such user-supplied information. In addition, in at least some embodiments and situations, the user-supplied information may include comments or other content items submitted to various other types of computer-accessible sites that may act as comment data sources, such as Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Flickr, Vine, Picasa, YouTube, 43 Things, Foursquare, Yelp, etc., in which other users may select and access such user-supplied information. In other embodiments and situations, any type of user-supplied information that is made available to one or more other users may be analyzed and used, including in text form, audio form and\/or visual form, such as user emails, SMS (\u201cShort Message Service\u201d) messages, Internet chat messages, telephone voice messages and other audio recordings, video recordings, images, search engine searches, news articles and other news releases, commerce-related submissions (e.g., user wish lists or gift registries, user shopping carts, etc.), Wiki-based submissions (e.g., to Wikipedia), etc., and is generally referred to herein as a \u201cuser-supplied comment\u201d or \u201cuser comment.\u201d","By gathering such user-supplied information during one or more time periods of interest, information may be assessed about distributed group discussions that occur during those time periods, including for discussions in which users actively review and respond to comments of others, and more generally for discussions that occur via various user comments that each reflects independent thoughts or opinions of a user that is not in direct response to any other particular user comment of another user (e.g., is not a reply to or comment about another such user comment of another user). Such assessed information may correspond to one or more selected factors about one or more distributed group discussions, including one or more of the following factors for user comments or other content items being supplied with respect to one or more topics and\/or categories of interest: a quantity of user comments or other content items for the topic(s) and\/or category(ies) that are supplied during a time period (or another measure of distributed user interest in those topics and\/or categories rather than content item quantity); subsets of such an overall quantity (or other measure of distributed user interest) supplied during a time period for the topic(s) and\/or category(ies) that are associated with particular geographic locations or geographic areas, and\/or with particular author users, and\/or with particular content item data sources; changes in assessed values for one or more such factors between two or more time periods; etc. In addition, such assessed information corresponding to one or more selected factors for the topic(s) and\/or category(ies) may be used to predict future information about user comments or other content items that will be supplied for the topic(s) and\/or category(ies), such as predicted future values for a particular one or more of the selected factors for each of one or more future time periods, or instead for other types of predicted future information. Additional details related to assessing values for factors of interest and using such information to make corresponding predictions are included below.","In some embodiments, a variety of types of information may be displayed or otherwise provided to users or other entities about analyzed information and\/or predicted information for one or more categories and\/or topics or other attributes of interest, such as to reflect constituent member content items that are associated with those categories, topics and\/or attributes for one or more time periods\u2014in at least some such embodiments, the information display or other providing may occur in a real-time or near-real-time manner with respect to corresponding events or activities to which the information corresponds (such as within seconds, minutes or hours of such events or activities). A display of information may, for example, indicate multiple categories, and visually indicate information about relative or absolute values for respective categories based on each of multiple selected factors, such as based on use of one or more of the following information for a displayed representation of a category: size, horizontal location, vertical location, color, an associated halo (or shadow), horizontal movement, vertical movement, displayed tags or other visual indicators, etc. \u2014as one example, such information may be provided for a current time period and\/or next future time period and for selected factors that include total quantity of constituent member content items, rate of change in total quantity, and aggregate sentiment. A display of information may, for example, indicate multiple comment groups that each represents an associated topic or other attribute of constituent member content items in the comment group (whether instead of or in addition to one or more category indicators), and visually indicate information about relative or absolute values for respective comment groups based on each of multiple selected factors, such as based on use of one or more of the following information for a displayed representation of a category: size, horizontal location, vertical location, color, an associated halo, horizontal movement, vertical movement, displayed tags or other visual indicators, etc. \u2014as one example, such information may be provided for a current time period and\/or next future time period and for selected factors that include total quantity of constituent member content items, rate of change in total quantity, and aggregate sentiment. A display of information may, for example, indicate multiple inter-related categories and\/or topics, and visually indicate information about relative or absolute values for respective categories and\/or topics based on each of multiple selected factors, such as based on use of one or more of the following information for a displayed representation of a category or topic: size, horizontal location, vertical location, color, an associated halo (or shadow), horizontal movement, vertical movement, displayed tags or other visual indicators, etc. As one example, such information may be provided for a current time period and\/or next future time period (or more generally for one or more user-specified or system-selected time periods) and for selected factors that include relevance of particular topics and\/or categories to one or more targets of interest, such as to one or more terms or other attributes (e.g., one or more particular geographical locations, one or more particular author users, etc.) or to particular content items (e.g., images, videos, links to external content, etc.). As another example, such information may be provided for a current time period and\/or next future time period (or more generally for one or more user-specified or system-selected time periods) that relates to a succession of multiple inter-related categories and\/or topics that one or more users have previously followed, etc. Additional details related to such display of information about analyzed aspects of distributed group discussions and\/or about further predicted aspects of the discussions is included herein, including with respect to example GUI screens or pages of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["150","130","150","100","150","150","195","190"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["140","125","100","125","110","115","120","140","125","150","125","100","160"]},"As part of the operation of the GDAP service , it may further analyze the user-supplied content items to identify particular topics and terms and other non-term attributes of the content items, and to store corresponding information . The content item information  and topics information  may further be used to create corresponding comment groups, and to store corresponding information . The GDAP service  may also use the comment group information  to determine particular topics that are associated with a particular category during one or more periods of time, such as based on the created comment groups associated with those topics, and then store corresponding category information . The GDAP service  may further quantify the user-supplied content items included in a particular comment group and\/or associated with a particular category, and use such information for one or more time periods to predict expected additional content items that will be received over one or more later time periods, with corresponding information being stored with the comment group information  and\/or the category information  in this example embodiment\u2014in some embodiments, the quantified information for one or more of the comment groups and\/or categories about constituent member content items for a time period may include encoded summary information for that time period, such as with respect to one or more encoding schemes specified in the comment group encoding information . As part of performing the prediction, the GDAP service  may use one or more defined prediction templates from information , and may further generate and store such prediction templates for later use based on actual content items that are received\u2014in some embodiments, the prediction template information may include an aggregation of encoded summary information for constituent member content items that are part of a comment group and\/or category for each of multiple time periods (e.g., consecutive time periods during a time window of interest), such as to be matched to aggregated encoded summary information from the comment group information  and\/or the category information . In addition, the GDAP service  may further analyze the user-supplied content items, identified comment groups having associated topics, and\/or identified categories to determine particular terms and\/or non-term attributes (e.g., particular geographical locations, particular author users, etc.) and\/or content items (e.g., images, videos, links to external content, etc.) that are highly relevant (e.g., above a defined relevance threshold) for particular identified comment groups and\/or identified categories, and may store corresponding information  and\/or . Such determined relevance information and\/or other types of information may further be used in some embodiments to determine inter-relationships between particular categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups, as discussed further below, and to store corresponding information  and\/or . Furthermore, the GDAP service  may further take a variety of types of automated actions based on analyzed and\/or predicted information, such as in accordance with client instructions or other client-specified criteria. Additional details related to operation of the GDAP service in particular embodiments are included herein.","As noted above, the GDAP service may in some embodiments provide information to clients  about predicted information and\/or other analyzed information regarding distributed group discussions and identified information of interest (e.g., categories, comment groups, terms non-term attributes, inter-relationships between categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups, etc.), such as in exchange for one or more fees from the clients to the GDAP service, including to display or otherwise present such information via a GUI (not shown) of the GDAP service that is displayed on client devices (not shown) of the clients . In a similar manner, various other types of users may interact with the GDAP service and similarly receive predicted information and\/or other analyzed information regarding distributed group discussions and identified information of interest, optionally without payment to the GDAP service, including via a GUI (not shown) of the GDAP service that is displayed on client devices (not shown) of the users\u2014such users who receive and interact with information from the GDAP service may include some or all of the users  who provide user-supplied information and\/or may include optional other users . As the clients and\/or other types of users receive and interact with information from the GDAP service via the GUI, such interactions may be tracked and analyzed by the GDAP service to determine additional types of information of interest (e.g., related to user journeys through multiple inter-related categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups), as discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein.","In addition, in at least some embodiments, other advertisers or other external entities  that are not part of the GDAP service may also optionally interact with the GDAP service to obtain similar types of information to that of the clients and other types of users, and\/or to receive additional types of information related to particular brands or other categories of interest, such as for categories and\/or topic-specific comment groups corresponding to commerce-related activities of interest. Such additional types of information may include, for example, brand analysis information  about categories and\/or comment groups that are related to an indicated brand or other indicated category or comment group in accordance with any indicated criteria\u2014such brand analysis information may be determined in various manners by the GDAP service (e.g., based on the automated discovery process indicating current structural inter-relationships between indicated categories and\/or comment groups within a specified number of degrees of separation, such as to be directly connected (1 degree of separation) or to be within some other N degrees of separation; based on user activity data from user interactions with the GUI that indicates users interacting with categories and\/or comment groups in related manners, such as to include a succession of multiple such interaction targets within user journeys; etc.). Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, the advertisers or other external entities may be allowed to register with the GDAP service (with optional advertiser information  including corresponding information about the advertisers), and to select or otherwise specify particular situations in which particular types of promotional information are requested to be provided to users who are receiving particular types of information via the GUI (with optional advertisement information  including corresponding information about advertisements and other promotional information and about situations in which to display such promotional information). Additional details corresponding to advertising-related activities are discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein.","The one or more networks  may, for example, be a publicly accessible network of linked networks, possibly operated by various distinct parties, such as the Internet. In other embodiments, at least one of the network(s)  may be a private network, such as, for example, a corporate or university network that is wholly or partially inaccessible to non-privileged users. In still other embodiments, at least one of the network(s)  may include one or more private networks with access to and\/or from the Internet. In the illustrated embodiment, the GDAP service  may include one or more modules that perform particular operations, as discussed in greater detail with respect to , and the GDAP service  and any such modules may each include software instructions that execute on one or more computing systems (not shown) to configure those computing systems to perform some or all of the described techniques.","Thus, user-supplied information of interest may be obtained in various manners in various embodiments, including by the GDAP service or system accessing a particular comment data source to retrieve information from that comment data source (e.g., periodically, when the data is needed for analysis, etc.). For example, a GDAP service may obtain information from a particular comment data source in various manners, such as via an API (\u201capplication programming interface\u201d) provided by that data source, by retrieving information stored in a database or other storage mechanism, by scraping one or more Web pages of a Web site provided by the comment data source, etc. The GDAP service may further obtain some or all of the available data from a particular comment data source, such as for one or more particular users and\/or time periods, for all users and\/or time periods, for users and\/or information that meet specified criteria (e.g., publicly available information that does not have privacy restrictions), etc. In other embodiments and situations, at least some comment data sources may perform actions to supply at least some user-supplied information to the GDAP service, such as in response to one or more prior requests of the GDAP service (e.g., via an RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, feed, or other subscription request of the GDAP service). In addition, in some embodiments and situations, at least some user-supplied comments may be received directly from a user that supplied them to one or more comment data sources, such as if a mobile application executing on a client device of the user also sends the comments to the GDAP service. Furthermore, in some embodiments and situations, information that was initially supplied to one or more comment data sources may be available to the GDAP service from another source, such as from an aggregator service that combines information from multiple comment data sources. In other embodiments, other types of user-supplied information may be obtained and\/or other types of comment data sources may be used, and additional details are included below about obtaining user-supplied information of interest to analyze.","Once user-supplied information has been obtained for a particular time period, the user-supplied information may be analyzed in various manners. In some embodiments, the analysis includes analyzing user comments or other user-supplied content items to create corresponding comment groups for the time period, with each such comment group corresponding to a particular topic (and optionally to further reflect that topic within a particular category, as discussed further below). For example, each user-supplied content item may be analyzed to identify any topics of interest in the content, such as terms or phrases, hashtags, links to other data, or other n-grams, and optionally for topics that are determined to be of sufficient importance or relevance to the content item (e.g., by using a TF-IDF, or term frequency-inverse document frequency, analysis, or other content analysis technique). In addition, each user-supplied content item may be analyzed to identify any other types of attributes of interest that are associated with the content item (e.g., in the contents of the content item, in metadata associated with the content item, etc.), such as a location of where the content item was submitted from, an author user who generated or otherwise supplied the content item, a comment data source from which the content item was obtained, any n-grams from metadata associated with the content item, etc. After topics or other attributes of interest are identified, a comment group is created for each such topic or other attribute (or for a selected subset, such as to reflect a percentage or fixed quantity of the most relevant topics or other attributes) for a time period, with the created comment group including any analyzed content items from the time period that include the associated attribute for the comment group. In addition, in at least some embodiments, if additional user-supplied content items are available that were not used in the initial analysis (e.g., from one or more additional or supplemental comment data sources), additional such user-supplied content items that were supplied during the time period are retrieved, and additional content items that include the topic or other associated attribute for each created comment group are added to that comment group. Thus, each created comment group may be considered to represent its associated topic or other associated attribute for that time period. In other embodiments, information about content items may be analyzed and grouped in other manners, and additional details are included below about analyzing user comments or other user-supplied content items to create corresponding comment groups for a time period.","The analysis of user-supplied information for a time period may also include determining current topics that correspond to a particular content category for the time period. For example, a definition for a category of interest may be supplied or otherwise determined, such as to include one or more terms or other attributes corresponding to the category. User-supplied content items for the time period that include one or more of the definition terms or other definition attributes for the category are then identified (e.g., content items having one of the definition attributes, or all of the definition attributes, or a minimum defined quantity or percentage of the definition attributes), and the created comment groups to which those identified content items belong are then determined, with those determined comment groups being candidates to be associated with the content category for the time period. At least some of the determined comment groups are then excluded in some embodiments and situations, such as to remove comment groups that are under-inclusive or over-inclusive with respect to the subject matter relevant to the content category. The topics or other attributes associated with the remaining determined comment groups may then be identified as being the current topics for the content category during the time period. In at least some embodiments, the determination of candidate comment groups to exclude includes determining, for each candidate comment group, the frequency that its included user-supplied content items are in the identified content items for the content category. An average frequency and a standard deviation may then be determined across the candidate comment groups and used to establish lower and\/or upper boundaries for the content category, such as to define a minimum exclusion threshold that is the average frequency minus half the standard deviation, and\/or to define a maximum exclusion threshold that is the average frequency plus half the standard deviation. In other embodiments, comment groups to include for a content category may be determined in manners other than based on frequency of included user-supplied content items, and additional details are included below about determining current topics that correspond to a particular content category for a time period.","In addition to identifying topic-specific comment groups and categories, the analysis of user-supplied information for a time period may further include identifying relevant terms or other attributes (e.g., particular geographical locations, particular author users, etc.) for particular comment groups and\/or categories, such as based at least in part on the comments and other user-supplied content items included in those comment groups and\/or categories. For example, as noted above, the analysis of a particular comment or other user-supplied content item may include assessing the relevance of various terms and\/or non-term attributes of that content item to the subject matter of the content item as a whole, with a TF-IDF analysis being one example of a technique of assessing such term or other attribute relevance. After assessing such attribute relevance for each user-supplied content item within a comment group, the relevance of particular terms or other attributes to the comment group may then be determined, such as by aggregating the relevance of the terms or other attributes for the user-supplied content items in the comment group, with a selection of relevant aggregated terms or other attributes (e.g., a top %, such as the top 10%; a top quantity, such as the top 10 terms or other attributes; a top statistical sampling, such as above a standard deviation above the mean; all terms or other attributes; etc.) being identified as being highly relevant for the comment group\u2014as one example, the attribute relevance for the attributes of those content items may be normalized, and then the normalized attribute relevance scores for each occurrence of a term or other attribute in the content items may be added together (optionally with the resulting sum divided by the number of occurrences of the term or other attribute). In a similar manner, after assessing such attribute relevance for each user-supplied content item within a category, the relevance of particular terms or other attributes to the category may then be determined, such as by aggregating the relevance of the terms or other attributes for the user-supplied content items in the category, with a selection of relevant aggregated terms or other attributes (e.g., determined in a manner similar to that discussed for a particular comment group) being identified as being highly relevant for the category. One example for such aggregating of the relevance of the terms or other attributes for the user-supplied content items in the category includes aggregating normalized attribute relevance scores for the attributes of the individual content items (in a manner similar to that discussed for a particular comment group), and another example includes first determining the highly relevant terms or other attributes for the comment groups within the category and then aggregating those comment group-specific attribute relevance scores to determine the category-specific attribute relevance scores (e.g., in a manner similar to that discussed with respect to aggregating relevance scores of particular content items within a comment group).","After determining relevant terms or other attributes for particular comment groups and\/or categories, such relevance information may be used in various manners in various embodiments. As one example, a user may be provided with a GUI in which the user specifies one or more terms or other attributes (e.g., particular geographical locations, particular author users, etc.) of interest (optionally after the user is presented with relevant terms or other attributes shared by two or more comments groups and\/or categories, such as in a manner similar to information ,  and\/or  of , or instead in other formats), and particular comment groups and\/or categories that include relevant terms or other attributes matching the specified terms\/attributes may then be displayed or otherwise provided to the user\u2014 illustrates non-exclusive examples of such a display. By identifying to a user multiple comments groups from different categories that are all related to one or more terms or other attributes (optionally along with a degree of relevance of each such comment group to each such term or other attribute, such as based on the relative or absolute relevance scores of those terms or other attributes for those comment groups), or by identifying to a user multiple categories that are all related to one or more terms or other attributes (optionally along with a degree of relevance of each such category to each such term or other attribute, such as based on the relative or absolute relevance scores of those terms or other attributes for those categories), the user may be able to identify relationships between such displayed comment groups and\/or categories that would not otherwise be apparent, as well as further explore additional comment groups and\/or categories (e.g., such as by selecting displayed information about a comment group and\/or a category and\/or an inter-relationship between two or more comment groups and\/or categories, in order to obtain additional information about that selection, such as in a manner described in greater detail below).","In addition to using such determined term or other attribute relevance information for particular comment groups and\/or categories to display related information to a user, such determined relevance information may also be used in various other manners in various embodiments. For example, inter-relationships between particular comment groups and\/or categories may be identified based at least in part on those comment groups and\/or categories sharing relevant terms or other attributes. As one example, comment groups in different categories may share the same or overlapping terms or other attributes used to identify the topics for those comment groups, such as if those comment groups represent the same or overlapping topics in different categories\u2014if so, a first type of inter-relationship between those comment groups may be identified on that basis, and those comment groups may further be identified as being related with a second type of relationship to a category (if any) that similarly represents the same or overlapping terms or other attributes for its category definition. As another example, comment groups in different categories may share the same or overlapping terms or other attributes that are highly relevant to each comment group but are different from the term(s) or other attribute(s) used to identify the topics for those comment groups\u2014if so, a third type of inter-relationship between those comment groups may be identified on that basis. As yet another example, different categories may share the same or overlapping terms or other attributes that are highly relevant to each category but are different from the term(s) or other attribute(s) used to define those categories\u2014if so, a fourth type of inter-relationship between those categories may be identified on that basis. In addition, a fifth type of inter-relationship between two or more categories may be identified based on comment groups within those categories being related in one or more manners (e.g., based on the first and\/or third types of inter-relationships identified above). Furthermore, other types of inter-relationships between comment groups and categories may be identified, including a membership type of inter-relationship for comment groups that are members of categories, as well a comment group in one category that is identified as being related to another category (e.g., based on that comment group and related other category sharing one or more relevant terms or other attributes). As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, at least some such inter-relationships may be identified based at least in part on an automated discovery process. Additional details related to determining and illustrating various types of inter-relationships between categories and\/or comment groups are described elsewhere herein, including with respect to .","The analysis of user-supplied information for a time period may further include predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users for a comment group and\/or content category, such as during each of one or more future time periods of interest. For example, the analysis may include quantifying information about the user-supplied content items included in the comment group and\/or associated with the content category for the time period, such as based on a quantity of such user-supplied content items, or more generally for each of one or more selected factors of interest. In some situations, the quantification is further performed for particular subsets of the user-supplied content items included in the comment group and\/or associated with the content category for the time period, such as to correspond to an intersection of that comment group and\/or content category with a particular geographical location (for those content items supplied from each of one or more geographical locations), to correspond to an intersection of that comment group and\/or content category with a particular author user (for those content items supplied by each of one or more author users), to correspond to an intersection of that comment group and\/or content category with a particular comment data source (for those content items supplied to each of one or more comment data sources), etc. Such quantification information for the constituent member content items supplied during the time period may then be combined with other corresponding quantification information for other related time periods, such as for all of the time periods during a sliding time window of interest (e.g., for every 30-minute time period during a 72-hour time window), and used to generate a histogram or other aggregation of that combined quantification information. In some embodiments, the quantification of information for a time period includes summarizing and encoding information about multiple selected factors for the constituent member content items supplied during the time period, and the aggregation of that combined quantification information that is generated for multiple time periods during a time window of interest includes a succession of the encoded summary information for the selected factors for each of multiple successive time periods during the time window. The aggregated quantification information may then be used to generate predicted information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users for the comment group or content category (or particular intersection) corresponding to the aggregated quantification information, such as with respect to one or more of the selected factors that are quantified and optionally summarized and encoded.","For example, a non-exclusive list of types of information that may be predicted with respect to a corresponding selected factor for a comment group and\/or a category include the following: a predicted amount of (or change in) a total quantity of the comments included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted direction of increase or decrease in the quantity of the comments included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted change in which topics or other attributes will be associated with the category in one or more future time periods; a predicted amount of (or change in) influence of one or more author users who supply content items included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted amount of (or change in) one or more types of sentiment in the content items included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted amount of (or change in) comments from one or more geographical locations that are included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted direction of increase or decrease in the quantity of the comments from one or more geographical locations that are included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted amount of (or change in) comments from one or more comment data sources that are included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted direction of increase or decrease in the quantity of the comments from one or more data sources that are included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted amount of (or change in) comments from one or more author users that are included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; a predicted direction of increase or decrease in the quantity of the comments from one or more author users that are included in the comment group and\/or associated with the category (or particular intersection) in one or more future time periods; etc.","In some embodiments and situations, the generating of the prediction information includes performing trend prediction based on the aggregated quantification information for a comment group and\/or category (or particular intersection), such as by doing a 2degree polynomial least squares fit to the quantification information in the generated histogram or other aggregation (e.g., using weighting to reflect time and\/or one or more other factors for the quantification information in the generated histogram or other aggregation), and using the resulting trend line to determine the predicted information. In other embodiments and situations, the generating of the prediction information includes matching a generated histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation to a portion of a defined prediction template (e.g., to an initial subset of an additional histogram that is based on quantified information for prior actual user-supplied content items that have been received), and using an additional portion of the defined prediction template (e.g., a later subset of the additional histogram, a later portion of the aggregation of encoded summary information, etc.) to indicate the predicted information. In other embodiments, other types of information may be quantified and used to generate prediction information for a comment group and\/or content category (or particular intersection), and additional details are included below about predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users for a comment group and\/or content category (or particular intersection).","The analysis of user-supplied information for a time period may further include generating a prediction template that reflects actual user-supplied content items that are received over time for a comment group and\/or content category, such as for later use in predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users. For example, a histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other aggregation of quantification information that is generated to reflect user-supplied content items received for a comment group and\/or a content category (or particular intersection) may be analyzed to determine if the histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation is successful in predicting other expected content items that will be received in other situations. In addition, or alternatively, trend prediction information that is generated based on a generated histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation for a comment group and\/or a content category may be analyzed to determine if the corresponding predicted information reflects later user-supplied content items that are actually received for the comment group or content category. When a generated histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation and\/or corresponding trend prediction information is found to be successful in predicting other user-supplied content items, it may be put into use as a prediction template in predicting additional future user-supplied content items that will be received, such as to further evaluate its performance. In other embodiments, prediction templates may be generated in other manners, and additional details are included below about generating a prediction template for later use in predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users.","After the analysis of user-supplied information for one or more time periods is performed, various types of resulting automated actions may be taken, such as based on analyzed information about the user-supplied content items that have already been received and\/or based on predictions about additional user-supplied content items that are expected to be received. For example, information from the analysis may be provided to one or more clients of the GDAP service, such as users or other entities who pay fees to receive information about specified content categories of interest, or more generally to various types of users of the GDAP service, including advertisers and other external entities. In addition, in some embodiments and situations, information from the analysis is used by the GDAP service to take automated actions to supply additional content items that correspond to a comment group or category of interest (e.g., additional comments that are generated by the GDAP service and made available to users), or to otherwise supply information corresponding to the comment group or category (e.g., initiating or changing related Internet-based advertising or other advertising), optionally in accordance with instructions or other criteria specified by one or more clients of the GDAP service\u2014such additional information may, in some situations, alter or otherwise affect future direction of a particular distributed group discussion, such as by including additional supplemental information to further support particular topics, by including additional information to refute or otherwise alter a discussion about particular topics, etc. Similarly, in some embodiments and situations, information about user-supplied content that is being displayed or otherwise provided to a user is used to select corresponding promotional information to also provide to the user, such as based on a specified advertising campaign or other advertising-related request received from each of one or more advertisers or other external entities. In other embodiments, various other types of actions may be taken by the GDAP service in appropriate circumstances, and additional details are included below about taking automated actions based on information generated from the analysis of user-supplied information for one or more time periods.","In addition, other types of analysis of user-supplied information for one or more time periods may be performed in at least some embodiments, such as to generate additional types of information related to distributed group discussions. As a first example, information about users who supply content items in one or more comment groups and\/or associated with one or more categories during one or more time periods may be analyzed, such as to determine particular author users who have a high or low amount of influence within the comment groups or categories (e.g., relative to other author users for the same or other comment groups and\/or categories), such as to be able to direct how a discussion evolves or changes. As a second example, information about content items in one or more comment groups and\/or associated with one or more categories during one or more time periods may be analyzed, such as to perform a sentiment analysis with respect to contents of the content items (e.g., by using term\/symbol list matching; topic decomposition and subspace projection; Bayesian classification or other classification techniques, such as using training data from human-annotated sentiment assignments of particular user comments; etc.). Such additional types of discussion-related information for one or more comment groups and\/or one or more categories over one or more time periods may be used in various manners, including to encode summary information about one or more such additional types of discussion-related information for one or more corresponding selected factors, to take some or all of the same types of automated actions as discussed above, or instead to take other types of automated actions. In other embodiments, various other types of analyses may be performed by the GDAP service to generate various other types of additional discussion-related information, and additional details are included below about performing analyses with respect to author user influence and\/or sentiment analysis.","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments are described below in which specific types of user-supplied information is analyzed to provide particular types of resulting information related to distributed group discussions in specific ways, including to predict various types of information about expected future user-supplied information that will be received. However, it will be understood that such information related to distributed group discussions may be generated in other manners and using other types of input data in other embodiments, that the described techniques may be used in a wide variety of other situations for other types of data, that other types of information related to distributed group discussions may similarly be generated and used in various ways, and that the invention is thus not limited to the exemplary details provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2K"},"In particular,  illustrates several example user comments , along with information about some corresponding initial comment groups  that may be created based at least in part on these user comments. In this example, the user comments  include comments supplied by different users to a single comment data source (referred to in this example as \u201ccomment data source XXX\u201d), such as the Twitter social networking service, although user-supplied information from multiple sources may be obtained and analyzed when creating initial comment groups in some embodiments. In addition, in this example, the illustrated user comments are submitted during a single time period (e.g., within a 30-minute time period), although particular timing information is not illustrated.","In particular, in this example, a first user comment is shown, which includes various metadata and other content (which in this example includes a title and accompanying textual content). The metadata that is available to the GDAP service in this example includes an author user name , an author user source-specific identifier , information about a geographical location from which the comment was supplied, and information about the comment data source to which the user comment was supplied\u2014at least some such information may not be displayed to other users, however, such as the geographical location information and\/or the comment data source information . In this example, an analysis of the user comment may identify a variety of topics or other attributes that may be used for subsequent analysis, including in some embodiments and situations to treat each word or phrase in the contents as a topic, and to include each of the indicated types of metadata information , , and as a comment attribute. Examples of topics that may be used from the comment's contents include words in the title (e.g., \u201crepublican\u201d ), words in the content body (e.g., \u201cpresident\u201d , \u201cObama\u201d , \u201care\u201d , \u201cthe\u201d , etc.), and phrases (e.g., \u201cdebt limit\u201d ). In other embodiments, a subset of the words\/phrases and other attributes may be selected using one or more of a variety of types of information analysis techniques (e.g., TF-IDF), such as to eliminate words that are too common to be useful in identifying the subject matter of the comment (e.g., \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cof\u201d, etc.), and to ignore differences in capitalization, hyphenation, stemming, etc.","The user comments and similarly include metadata  and other contents, and include various types of information that may be used as topics or other attributes for those comments. For example, user comment includes the term \u201cObama\u201d in a manner similar to term of comment , as well as various other terms (e.g., \u201ceagle\u201d and \u201c10860\u201d ). Comment is also illustrated as including two in-line metadata hashtags that may be used as topics for the comment, which in this example are \u201c#OvalOffice\u201d and \u201c#Obama\u201d . In some embodiments and situations, terms such as \u201cObama\u201d and \u201c#Obama\u201d may be grouped together and treated as the same topic, while in the illustrated embodiment the terms are handled separately. User comment similarly includes various terms, which in this example includes a user-selectable link (e.g., an HTML hyperlink, such as a link to additional external content)\u2014in some embodiments, such links and\/or associated metadata for the links (e.g., terms that are included as part of the link, tags or other metadata associated with the link, etc.) may be used as topics, and in some embodiments contents available from such a link may be retrieved and analyzed for use as contents and\/or metadata of user comment in a manner similar to other inline contents, while in other embodiments one or more both such types of information may not be used. In some embodiments, a user comment may further have additional information supplied by other users (e.g., commentary from the other users on the user comment) that may similarly be used as a topic or attribute for the comment (e.g., hashtags, such as #president or #funny; other types of tags, such as \u201cfunny\u201d or \u201clike\u201d or \u201cuseful\u201d or \u201c\u201d; etc.), although such types of additional information are not illustrated in this example, and may not be included as part of the content of the user comment in some embodiments. It will be appreciated that the identification of topics or other attributes for one or more user comments may be performed in a variety of manners in various embodiments. For example, in some embodiments the analysis is performed in a language-neutral manner (e.g., when extracting n-grams from the contents of a user comment), and thus the user comments may include comments in multiple languages\u2014in some such embodiments, translation capabilities may further be employed to translate at least some user comments into one or more target languages before the identification of topics or other attributes for those user comments. As one non-exclusive example of a particular set of techniques for identifying at least some topics or other attributes for at least some user comments, the following steps may be employed: n-grams are extracted from comment title and body text by first converting the text to a collection of n-grams (e.g., bi-grams or tri-grams); the n-grams containing predefined common words in at least some positions are removed from consideration; a most significant set of X n-grams are then selected based on scoring (e.g., via a pointwise mutual information, or PMI, algorithm), with X being a configurable predefined number or otherwise being determined based on the available data (e.g., a specified percentage); and changes in significance of the n-grams are tracked as more comments containing them are identified. Furthermore, such terms or other n-grams that are identified as being relevant for such a user comment may be used not only in associating particular user comments with one or more particular comment groups and\/or categories as discussed below, but also to identify relevant terms or other n-grams for those comment groups and\/or categories, such as based at least in part on the scores generated for those terms or other n-grams (e.g., using a PMI algorithm or in other manners), as discussed further below.","After the topics and other attributes are identified for a variety of user comments being analyzed, comments groups may be created for each of some or all of the topics and other attributes (e.g., particular geographical locations, particular author users, etc.). A few example comment groups  are illustrated, along with information about particular example comments included in each comment group. For example, the \u201cPresident\u201d comment group is based on the topic \u201cpresident\u201d, and includes at least comments and , since those comments include terms and , respectively, that match the topic (but does not include comment in this example, despite its contents being related to the president of the United States, since the term \u201cpresident\u201d is not included in comment ). As discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein, the contents and\/or metadata associated with the comments in the comment group may further be used to identify terms and other attributes distinct from \u201cpresident\u201d that are relevant for the comment group\u2014for example, based on the contents of comment , possible other relevant attributes for the comment group might include \u201cObama\u201d, \u201cRepublican\u201d, \u201cdebt limit\u201d, \u201cpolitics\u201d, \u201cAndy Jones\u201d, \u201cWashington DC\u201d, \u201cComment Data Source XXX\u201d, etc., optionally with relevance scores for each such term with respect to comment being used as a starting point for the relevance of the term to the comment group, and with such relevance of particular such other attributes increasing for the comment group as other comments in the comment group also include such other attributes, although relevance of particular attributes for the comment group may be ranked relative to other relevant attributes for the comment group in other manners in other embodiments). Comment groups and further correspond to the topics \u201cObama\u201d and \u201c#Obama\u201d, respectively, and the comment group based on the topic \u201cthe\u201d reflects that most or all comments may include such common terms. Comment groups and provide examples of comment groups corresponding to topics based on comment attributes from metadata rather than contents of at least some user comments, such as for comment group corresponding to a particular geographical location (in this example, the city of \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d) and including any comments supplied from that geographical location (with other comment groups, not shown, corresponding to other geographical locations), and for comment group corresponding to a particular author user (in this example, user \u201cAndy Jones\u201d) and including any comments supplied by that author user (with other comment groups, not shown, corresponding to other author users). It will be appreciated that geographical locations and users may be represented in a variety of manners in various embodiments, including at differing degrees of specificity (e.g., to represent geographical locations by individual addresses, GPS coordinates, neighborhoods, cities, regions, counties, states, countries, etc.; and to represent users via legal names, source-specific login names or screen names or other identifiers, numeric or other unique identifiers, etc.). While not illustrated here, comment groups may also be created for each of multiple distinct comment data sources, to include comments supplied to those comment data sources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":"230"},"In the example of , additional user comments are obtained from two additional comment data sources, referred to in this example as \u201ccomment data source YYY\u201d (as shown in information ) and \u201ccomment data source ZZZ\u201d (as shown in information ). For example, comment data source YYY may include primarily textual comments, in a manner similar to that comment data source XXX (e.g., posts to the Facebook social networking service), while the comment data source ZZZ may include primarily non-textual comments that include some textual tags or other commentary (e.g., images posted to the Pinterest or Instagram social networking sites). Various other types of comments and content items may be analyzed in other embodiments, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","In this example, the additional user comment from comment data source YYY includes an additional comment from author user \u201cAndy Jones\u201d who also supplied comment of , although the metadata available to the GDAP service from comment data source YYY does not include geographical location information or a source-specific identifier. Nonetheless, if the GDAP service is able to identify the two users as the same person, such as by creating, maintaining and using a mapping between different identifiers for a particular user, the \u201cAndy Jones\u201d comment group will be modified to include this comment , as shown in the modified comment group information  of \u2014alternatively, in some embodiments, such a comment would be added to the comment group without attempting to verify a common identity, such as based on the author name matching for both comments. Comment is also added to the \u201c#Obama\u201d comment group based on its inclusion of a #Obama hashtag in its comments.","Additional user comment from comment data source ZZZ includes a photo and related supplementary text, and is added to the \u201cObama\u201d comment group (based on the term being included in the textual commentary) and the \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d geographical location comment group (based on geographical location information ) for the comment . While not illustrated here, in some embodiments an analysis of data in a user comment may be performed to identify additional attributes that may be used to associate the user comment with one or more appropriate comment groups. For example, with respect to the example user comment , an image recognition process and\/or other analysis of the photo may be performed to identify additional metadata attributes (e.g., based on identified objects, people, locations, etc.) for the user comment\u2014illustrative examples include the following: to recognize President Obama within the photo, and thus associate the user comment with comment group even if the provided commentary was absent; to recognize Washington DC or the Capitol building from the photo, and associate the user comment with corresponding comment groups; to examine location and time metadata embedded in the photo or otherwise associated with the photo, and use the location data to associate the user comment with a corresponding comment group; etc. If additional comments and were, for example, added to the \u201cPresident\u201d comment group of , the additional contents of those additional comments could be used to add additional relevant attributes for the comment group (e.g., \u201cinauguration\u201d, \u201cEuro\u201d, etc.) and\/or to increase the relevance scores or other relevance measure of other relevant attributes for the comment group (e.g., \u201cObama\u201d, \u201cdebt limit\u201d, \u201cAndy Jones\u201d, etc.). In some embodiments, a comment group will include both comments that are supplied from the geographical location of Philadelphia and comments that include the term \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d in the contents or other attributes of the comment, while in other embodiments the comment group will only include comments that are supplied from the geographical location of Philadelphia. The modified comment group information  further illustrates an example of a data source comment group in this example, which corresponds to comment data source XXX, although such a comment group would not be modified in this supplemental operation in this example since the additional user comments are not from the comment data source XXX. In addition, if new topics or attributes are included in the additional user comments that were not present in the initially analyzed user comments (e.g., comments from author user \u201cJenny Smith\u201d ), new comment groups may be created for such new topics or attributes in some embodiments, while in other embodiments such new comment groups will not be created.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["250","205","205","250","205","245","245"],"i":["c ","c ","a","a","a ","b "]},"After the matching user comments are associated with a category in section , all of the created comment groups to which those matching user comments belong are then identified, as shown in part in section  for the President Obama category. It will be appreciated that each user comment may be associated with multiple comment groups, and thus a large number of comment groups may be initially identified for a category. In the example of section , the identified comment groups are then analyzed to determine their relevance to the associated user comments shown in section . In particular, in this example, the frequency is determined for each identified comment group that the associated user comments in section  are included within that comment group. As an example, information  illustrates that 10,000 user comments have been identified as being associated with the \u201cPresident Obama\u201d category in section  (although only a small fraction are shown in section ). Using the \u201cThe\u201d comment group discussed in  as an example, of the 10,000 user comments that are associated with the \u201cPresident Obama\u201d category in section , almost all of those associated user comments include the term \u201cthe\u201d and are thus included in the \u201cThe\u201d comment group. In this example, the identified comment groups for the \u201cPresident Obama\u201d category are listed in section  in order of decreasing frequency, with the \u201cThe\u201d comment group having the highest listed frequency, and a \u201cChip Kelly\u201d comment group having a lowest listed frequency of 5 comments of the 10,000 associated user comments. For example, user comment of  represents one of those 5 comments, since it includes the terms \u201cChip Kelly\u201d and \u201cpresident\u201d, causing it to be included in the associated user comments in section , but to have only 4 other comments in this time period that included both \u201cChip Kelly\u201d and one of the category definition terms as topics or other attributes of those user comments.","Additional processing is then performed to select a subset of the identified comment groups as being associated with the \u201cPresident Obama\u201d category for this time period. In particular, as shown in information , an average frequency is determined for the identified comment groups, and frequency-based minimum and maximum inclusion thresholds are determined based in part on the average frequency. As one example, the standard deviation (not shown) may be further determined for the frequency values, and the minimum and maximum inclusion thresholds may be determined based in part on the standard deviation. In this example, the lines and in section  denote the lines for the maximum and minimum inclusion thresholds, respectively. Accordingly, a term such as \u201cthe\u201d is excluded in this example as being too ubiquitous or general for the category, and a term such as \u201cChip Kelly\u201d is excluded as being too rare or specific (or irrelevant) for the category. The topics or other attributes of the remaining identified comment groups may then be identified as topics that are relevant to the \u201cPresident Obama\u201d category for this time period, including topics such as \u201cObama,\u201d \u201cPresident,\u201d \u201cdemocrat,\u201d \u201cinauguration,\u201d \u201cdebt limit,\u201d and \u201crepublican,\u201d as well as geographical location attributes \u201cWashington DC\u201d and \u201cChicago\u201d\u2014while no author user attributes or comment data source attributes are illustrated in this example, it will be appreciated that such attributes may similarly be identified and included. It will further be appreciated that some of the identified topics for this category may be fairly constant over different time periods (e.g., \u201cPresident\u201d and \u201cdemocrat\u201d), while other identified topics may change over time to reflect subject matter that is or is not of sufficient current interest at a given time (e.g., such that \u201cinauguration\u201d and\/or \u201cdebt limit\u201d may not be included in this category during some time periods). In addition, in at least some embodiments, some or all of the comment groups associated with a category may be used to determine relevant terms or other attributes for the category that are distinct from the terms included in the category definition, such as based on aggregating information about the relevant terms or other attributes for those comment groups, in a manner similar to that discussed above for aggregating relevance of terms or other attributes for a comment group from the multiple comments included in the comment group. In this example, possible relevant terms or other attributes for the category may include \u201cRepublican\u201d, \u201cdebt limit\u201d, \u201cpolitics\u201d, \u201cAndy Jones\u201d, \u201cWashington DC\u201d, \u201cComment Data Source XXX\u201d, \u201cinauguration\u201d, \u201cEuro\u201d, etc. \u2014it will be appreciated that some or all such relevant terms or other attributes for the category may in some circumstances match the topics of the comment groups included in the category (e.g., \u201cRepublican\u201d, \u201cdebt limit\u201d, \u201cinauguration\u201d, etc. in this example), and that some or all such relevant terms or other attributes for the category may in some circumstances not match the topics of the comment groups included in the category (e.g., \u201cpolitics\u201d, \u201cAndy Jones\u201d, \u201cWashington DC\u201d, \u201cComment Data Source XXX\u201d, \u201cEuro\u201d, etc. in this example).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIGS. 2A-2C","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2C"],"b":["260","260"]},"While such quantified information may be of use to reflect recent events and status, such quantified information may further be used to predict information about additional user comments that are expected to be received, including changes with respect to topics that are part of a category, and\/or changes with respect to how many, when, where and by whom that expected future user comments will be received for a particular comment group or content category.  further illustrates one example of how such prediction may be performed based on the histogram graph , which involves matching the histogram graph  to a defined prediction template . The prediction template  may, for example, be one of multiple defined prediction templates that are available to be used, with some or all such defined prediction templates being based at least in part on prior actual user comments have been received. In particular, in this example, a portion of the histogram graph  is matched to a corresponding portion of a prediction histogram that is part of the template \u2014such matching may be performed in various manners, such as by measuring differences for values for corresponding time periods in the two histograms being compared, or more generally using techniques to compare two curves or other shapes. It will be appreciated that the matching of a histogram graph to a prediction template may be performed in a variety of manners in various embodiments. A non-exclusive list of techniques that may be used as part of the matching includes the following: root-mean-square (\u201cRMS\u201d) error or deviation; vector inner product; absolute difference; information-theoretic measures (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence); etc. In addition, in some embodiments, the prediction templates are selected in a manner that is not specific to particular categories and\/or comment groups, such as to instead identify and use patterns over time that are repeatedly observed across comment groups and\/or categories (e.g., by promoting and using the prediction templates that are successful over time, while decreasing and removing the use of prediction templates that are not successful). Furthermore, in some embodiments and situations, a histogram template of a given length of time (e.g., 72 hours) with data points for each time period of interest (e.g., 30 minutes) may consider one or more prediction templates with respect to each data point (e.g., with each such prediction template being for the same given length of time).","Based on the match to portion of prediction template , some or all of the additional portion of the prediction template  may be used to predict additional expected future comments that will be received for the comment group or category represented by histogram graph , such as after any appropriate scaling is performed. In particular, in this example, the additional portion of the prediction template  may be used to predict that the quantity of user comments will continue to fall for five more time periods, and to then level off for about eight additional time periods, after which the quantity will rise again somewhat before gradually decreasing. It will be appreciated that a variety of types of shapes may be represented by prediction templates in a variety of manners, such as to reflect a variety of types of distributed group behavior related to an underlying discussion that is occurring.","By generating such quantified information for each determined comment group for a content category, and by predicting additional corresponding information for each such comment group, a variety of types of information may be determined for the content category. As one example, if the quantity of comments that are predicted to occur for a first comment group decreases sufficiently, while the comments that are predicted to occur for a second comment group increases, the increasing influence of the topic for the second comment group to the content category may be determined. In addition, the time at which a particular topic will stop and\/or start being a sufficiently relevant topic for a content category may be predicted. Based on such information, the GDAP service or a client that receives such information may be able to take various types of corresponding actions, such as to reduce or stop activities related to topics that are losing relevance, to increase or start activities to try to increase interest in a topic of importance that is otherwise losing relevance, to target additional activities related to topics that are increasing in relevance, etc. In addition, when such quantified information is generated for geographical location attributes, comment data source attributes, and\/or author user attributes that are determined topics for a content category, and when additional corresponding expected future information is predicted for such attribute-based comment groups, a variety of additional types of information may be determined for the content category. For example, not only can relative differences be determined in the relevance of different topics to a category, but such differences can similarly be tracked and predicted across different geographical areas (e.g., this topic is increasing in relevance in location A, but remaining constant in location B), different comment data sources, and\/or different author users. Differences across other types of attributes may similarly be tracked and predicted, and such information about attribute-based comment groups may similarly be used by the GDAP service or a client that receives such information to take various types of corresponding actions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 2E","FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 2E","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2E"],"b":["270","260","280"],"sup":"nd "},"In addition to using a trend line prediction to generate prediction information for future time periods, the same or similar types of trend line prediction information may be used to assist in generating new defined prediction templates. For example, considering the histogram graph , various portions of the histogram graph may be selected for additional analysis, such as the last 24 hours (the portion labeled \u201c72\u201d that includes histogram data), the last 48 hours (the portions labeled \u201c48\u201d and \u201c72\u201d that include histogram data), the first 24 hours (the portion labeled \u201c24\u201d that includes histogram data), the first 48 hours (the portions labeled \u201c24\u201d and \u201c48\u201d that include histogram data), etc. For each such portion of the histogram, a prediction trend line may be generated based on the data in that portion, and the subsequent portions of data about actual user comments may be used to determine if the prediction trend line accurately predicted information about those actual user comments. If the prediction trend line for a portion of the histogram does accurately predict such information, that portion of the histogram may be selected to be used or evaluated as a prediction template for performing future predictions, and\/or that portion of the histogram plus the later actual matching predicted data may be selected for use as such a prediction template. In the example of , a prediction trend line has been generated to correspond to the portion of the histogram for the first 24 hours, a prediction trend line has been generated to correspond to the portion of the histogram for the second 24 hours, and a prediction trend line has been generated to correspond to the portion of the histogram for the third (or last) 24 hours, with neither of the prediction trend lines and appearing to accurately predict data for the next 24 hour period in this example. When evaluating a prediction trend line that uses the most recent actual data (e.g., trend lines or ), the evaluation based on actual data may be deferred until a future time when that actual data is available, such as after an additional 24 hours have passed. It will be appreciated that such matching of a predicted trend line to actual user comment data may be performed in various manners, such as by measuring differences for values for one or more time periods between the predicted values and the actual values, or more generally using techniques to compare two curves or other shapes.

Thus, a visual inspection easily identifies that sub-item has a larger absolute or relative value for the selected factor of interest than does, for example, sub-items or .

For example, in the example GUI  of , distinct selected factors are associated with each of the X and Y axes, which both differ from the quantity-related factor associated with the size visual aspect\u2014the X and Y axes are represented by axes lines  in this example, although such axes lines may not be illustrated in at least some embodiments. As one example, the X axis may be currently associated with a selected factor that corresponds to a degree of sentiment, with the horizontal center of the overall item  representing a neutral sentiment in this example, such that a sub-item  that is farther to the right has a larger positive sentiment value, while a sub-item  that is farther to the left has a larger negative sentiment value (or alternatively a smaller positive sentiment value in other embodiments in which sentiment is measured only on a scale of more or less positive sentiment). Thus, for example, a visual inspection can readily identify that the sub-item has a greater positive sentiment than does, for example, sub-items or . Alternatively, in other embodiments the X and\/or Y axes may each correspond to one or more selected determined relevant terms or other attributes (e.g., particular geographical locations, particular author users, etc.), with the included sub-items corresponding to particular comment groups (e.g., from different categories) and\/or categories that are relevant to those selected determined relevant terms or other attributes, as discussed in greater detail with respect to \u2014if so, other visual aspects (e.g., size, color, movement, etc.) may or may not be used to represent other factors related to the displayed sub-items.","In addition, in this example, the Y axis is associated with a selected factor that corresponds to a rate of change (e.g., a percentage increase or decrease) in the quantity of constituent member content items with respect to a prior time period, with the vertical center of the overall item  representing a constant rate of change in quantity in this example\u2014in other embodiments, the Y axis may instead correspond to an absolute amount of change in quantity of constituent member content items with respect to a prior time period. In this example, a sub-item  that is higher in the display than the x-axis has a progressively higher positive rate of change in quantity, while a sub-item  that is lower in the display than the x-axis has a progressively higher rate of a negative change in quantity (i.e., a reduction in rate of change in quantity). Thus, a visual inspection can readily determine that sub-item has a higher growth rate in quantity of constituent member content items than does, for example, sub-item (which has a zero rate of quantity change, or a constant quantity), and with sub-item having a higher growth rate in quantity than the negative growth rates for sub-items and ","In addition to the displayed vertical location, different colors are also mapped to different vertical locations in this example to emphasize different rates (or alternatively, amounts) of quantity change. In particular, the blue color of sub-item represents a mostly constant quantity (or zero rate, or amount, of quantity change) for the constituent member content items, the purple color of sub-item represents a relatively high value for the rate (or amount) of quantity change (and with varying degrees of color between blue and purple indicating increasing positive values), and with the black of sub-item indicating a relatively large negative value for the rate (or amount) of quantity change (with corresponding degrees of darker blue and gray between the blue of sub-item and the black of sub-item indicating increasing negative values). By using both color and vertical location to illustrate a single selected factor in this example, corresponding information can be easily determined by a user in multiple visual manners, although in other embodiments color and vertical location may represent different types of information for different selected factors.","As with the size-related visual aspect, the visual aspects corresponding to vertical location, horizontal location and\/or color may in some embodiments have associated legends, keys, and\/or scales that are displayed to the user, and one or more of the vertical location, horizontal location and color visual aspects may be further configurable by the user in various manners in various embodiments (e.g., to allow the user to specify a different selected factor with respect to one or more of the visual aspects, etc., to change a scale with respect to a particular selected factor, etc.).","In addition to size, vertical location, horizontal location, and color, the example GUI  could further use movement in the vertical and\/or horizontal directions that is represented within a single time period (e.g., via animation) to represent further selected factors of interest in at least some embodiments, although such movement-based visual aspects within a single time period are not used in this example GUI (although changes in location for different time periods do reflect changes in corresponding information over those time periods). For example, a horizontal movement visual aspect within a single time period could be used to illustrate a rate of change in sentiment or other selected factor assigned to the X axis (e.g., for actual information over one or more prior time periods to the current time period, for predicted information from the current time period through one or more future time periods, etc.), or instead could be used to illustrate information for a selected factor other than the one assigned to the X axis. As an alternative to animation, visual arrow indicators  could be displayed to reflect information about vertical movement, such as with the length of the arrow indicating an amount of movement. Similar types of horizontal movement visual aspect may also be displayed, whether in addition to or instead of the vertical movement information.","In addition to size, horizontal location, vertical location, and color, the illustrated example GUI  further includes information not only about the current real-time information for one or more time periods of interest, but also predicted future information for one or more future time periods of interest. In particular, in this example, some of the sub-items  have an associated halo  (or alternatively, a shadow that does not fully encompass the sub-item) that corresponds to predicted future information for that sub-item, with the size and\/or color of the halo providing additional information about the corresponding predicted future information. For example, with respect to sub-item , if the size of the sub-item corresponds to the quantity of constituent member content items for that sub-item, then the size of the prediction halo for the sub-item may indicate that the quantity of constituent member content items for that sub-item is predicted to increase over the one or more future time periods of interest, with the size of the prediction halo indicating the predicted quantity. As can be visually determined, the predicted future quantity for the sub-item is thus roughly the same amount as the current quantity for sub-item , as both are a similar size. In a similar manner, the prediction halo for sub-item indicates that the predicted quantity of constituent member content items for the sub-item is expected to decrease over the one or more future time periods of interest, with the size of the prediction halo indicating that predicted smaller future quantity. The colors of the prediction halos may also convey various types of information, such as to be selected to be different from the color of the corresponding sub-items (e.g., to enable easy identification of the prediction halo, such as to use the color orange of the prediction halo for all prediction halos, or for prediction halos whose predicted future quantity is larger than the current actual quantity of the corresponding sub-item), or to further use different colors for a given prediction halo to display additional information about the predicted future quantities (e.g., to use different colors for a prediction halo to indicate a predicted future rate of change). As with other aspects discussed, additional legend, key, and scale information may be displayed corresponding to the prediction halos, and some or all of the aspects of the prediction halo display may be configurable by the user in at least some embodiments.","Thus, given a variety of different visual aspects, a visual inspection of the example GUI  of  illustrates a variety of information about the different sub-items. For example, if sub-item corresponds to a first comment group of interest for a category represented by overall item , the visual information about that first comment group quickly identifies various information, as follows: the large size of the first comment group indicates a relatively large quantity of constituent member content items; the absence of a prediction halo indicates that a change in quantity is not predicted for the one or more future time periods of interest; the centered horizontal location indicates that a neutral sentiment currently exists for the first comment group; and the centered vertical location as well as color indicates that the rate of change in quantity since one or more prior time periods of interest is near zero, with the quantity remaining essentially constant. Conversely, the visual information about a second comment group corresponding to sub-item identifies various information, as follows: the second comment group has a lower current quantity of constituent member content items compared to the first comment group due to its smaller size; the lack of a prediction halo indicates that the quantity of constituent member content items for the second comment group is not predicted to change over the one or more future time periods of interest; the horizontal position on the left side of overall category item  indicates that the current sentiment for the second comment group is relatively negative; and the vertical location above the x-axis as well as the color indicate that the rate of change in quantity for the second comment group is a relatively high positive value (and is higher than that of the first comment group). As another example, the visual information about a third comment group corresponding to sub-item identifies various information, as follows: the third comment group has a smaller current quantity of constituent member content items than do the first and second comment groups, based on its smaller size; the lack of a prediction halo indicates that the quantity of constituent member content items for the third comment group is not predicted to change in quantity over the one or more future time periods of interest; the horizontal position that is slightly to the right side of center of the overall category item  indicates that the current sentiment for the third comment group is slightly positive; and the vertical location below the x-axis as well as the color indicate that the rate of change in quantity for the third comment group is a relatively large negative value (and is lower than that of the first comment group). Similar information can be easily determined visually for the other example sub-items , , and ","While various example visual aspects and corresponding selected factors and information are illustrated with respect to , it will be appreciated that a variety of types of modifications can be made to these aspects, that various additional visual aspects may be used, and that one or more of the existing visual aspects may not be used in other embodiments. As one example, and as previously noted, selected factors that are used for particular visual aspects may be configurable by the user in at least some embodiments.","In addition, in some embodiments, different shapes may be used rather than circles to convey additional types of information for a corresponding sub-item based on the corresponding shape. As one example, the shapes used may not be symmetrical in both the X and Y axes, such as to use the different X and Y vales to convey additional information. For example, a circle may be replaced with an oval, such as an oval that is longer along the X axis than the Y axis, or that is instead longer along the Y axis than the X axis. If so, the length along the X axis could illustrate additional information about the selected factor for the X axis (e.g., a rate of change in sentiment), while the position along the X axis continues to indicate a current sentiment value, and while the distance along the Y axis could continue to be used to indicate a quantity size for constituent member content items. In a similar manner, other types of shapes could be used that differ in the X and Y dimensions, such as diamonds, triangles, etc. Furthermore, a different shape that is not symmetrical could be used to optionally illustrate information over time. For example, a teardrop shape could be used to represent changes over time of a particular factor of interest. Consider, for example, a teardrop shape whose central axis runs left to right, such that the shape at the left end (whether the teardrop point or the teardrop bulb) corresponds to a past period of time and the shape at the right end of the teardrop corresponds to a current or future time, such that the length of the teardrop along the x-axis represents a length of time, and with the width of the teardrop in the y-axis direction at a given point indicating a value in sentiment or some other selected factor at a corresponding time\u2014in this manner, the overall teardrop shape may be used to indicate changes in the sentiment value over the length of time corresponding to the teardrop length. It will be appreciated that other types of shapes can similarly be used in other manners and other embodiments.","In addition to shapes of individual sub-items, the information that is displayed within particular sub-items may further provide an additional visual aspect that conveys additional information, with the examples of  illustrating examples of such additional information. In particular,  continues the examples of , and illustrates a GUI screen or page  with an overall item  similar to item  of , but with particular sub-items , , ,  and  being modified to include additional types of information.","As one example, sub-item  illustrates displaying pie chart information within the sub-item to illustrate additional information about different subsets of the constituent member content items for the sub-item. Thus, for example, the pie chart could correspond to an additional selected factor, with the different pie slices -indicating the relative size of different subsets of the constituent member content items corresponding to different values for that selected factor (e.g., with different pie slices representing different geographical locations associated with the constituent member content items, different author users associated with the different constituent member content items, different data sources associated with the different constituent member content items, etc.). As with other visual aspects discussed, additional legend, key, and\/or scale information could further be illustrated for such a visual aspect.","Sub-item  illustrates an alternative type of information that could be displayed within the sub-item, and in particular illustrates timing-related information to show information for the constituent member content items over time. As one example, the upper right quadrant could represent information about a current time for a selected factor, while the additional slices -could illustrate the same type of information but for successive predicted future periods of time, or instead the different quadrants (or other divisions of the circle) could correspond to other combinations of two or more past and\/or future time periods. Accordingly, each quadrant or other slice could indicate a particular value for a corresponding selected factor for a corresponding time period, such as to indicate an identifier of a highest data source or highest geographical location or highest author user during that time period, to indicate an actual or predicted rate of change for the corresponding time period, etc.","Sub-item  illustrates yet another alternative type of information that could be displayed within a sub-item, and in particular illustrates a different type of timing-related information to show information for the constituent member content items at a particular indicated time. For example, the illustrated information may be used to represent a clock and to indicate a particular time that a corresponding value of interest has occurred or is predicted to occur for a selected factor, such as a time at which a maximum or minimum value occurs for the selected factor, a time at which a change is expected to occur between two indicated values, etc. It will be appreciated that a variety of other types of information could similarly be displayed within a sub-item, including bar charts, line charts, textual information, etc.","Sub-items  and  illustrate other alternative types of information that could be displayed within a sub-item, and in particular illustrate two types of map-related information that may be used to show information for the constituent member content items at a particular indicated time. For example, location-related information may be displayed within the sub-item corresponding to the constituent member content items for the sub-item, such as to use coloring, shading, location indicators, etc. within the map to indicate different geographical locations that correspond to the constituent member content items (e.g., to show relative quantities of constituent member items in different geographical locations, or to instead show other types of location-related information).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 2R","b":["2120","2128","2120","2122","2124","2126","2125","2124","2126","2128","2128","2128","2128","2128","2128","2124","2126"],"i":["c","d","b","a","c "]},"While the illustrated GUI  of  and GUI  of  are displayed along two dimensions, in other embodiments the display may be altered to have a single dimension (e.g., a slider or ruler along the X or Y axes), to have three dimensions (e.g., to add a depth, or Z, dimension to that illustrated in ), to use animation to reflect changing values at different times, to use animation to reflect changing values over different possible subsets of the constituent member content items for a selected factor (e.g., different geographical locations associated with the constituent member content items, different author users associated with the different member constituent content items, different data sources associated with the different constituent member content items, etc.), etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":["FIG. 2S","FIGS. 2L-2R","FIG. 2N"],"b":["2200","2210","2200","2220","2210"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 2T","FIGS. 2L-2S","FIG. 2M","FIG. 2M"],"b":["2300","2305","2300","2320","1720","2321","2320","2315","2310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIG. 2U","FIGS. 2L-2T","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["2400","2410","2410","2415","2410","2420","2425","2430","1710","1915","1910","1920","1925","1930","2420","2425","2430","2415","2410","2410","2400","2435","2410"],"i":["a ","a","a","a.

In addition, based on those new categories corresponding to comment groups that were constituent members of the Seattle category , inter-category relationships are identified between the new categories -and the Seattle category , such that the new categories -may be considered to be sub-categories of the Seattle category or otherwise part of the Seattle category . Similarly, the Chicago category has been identified as another sub-category of the Seattle category in this example. For example, the constituent member comment groups of the Seattle category may have also included a Chicago comment group (not illustrated in ), such as due to one or more distributed discussions that involve both Seattle and Chicago (e.g., related to the Boeing company, whose corporate headquarters are in Chicago and whose largest operational locations are near Seattle; related to an upcoming sports contest between Seattle and Chicago teams; etc.)\u2014if so, a new Chicago category would not be created during the automated discovery due to the Chicago category already being present, but the indicated inter-category relationship between the categories and may be automatically identified as part of the automated discovery.

For example, consider the new EmeraldCityComics category , which may be defined to have one or more associated definition terms, for example, of \u201cEmeraldCityComics\u201d or of (\u201cEmeraldCityComics\u201d OR \u201cEmerald City Comics\u201d OR #EmeraldCityComics)\u2014such definition term(s) may be identified in various manners, such as from the term(s) or other attribute(s) used to create the comment group, a title of the corresponding comment group, the contents of comments within the comment group, etc. In addition, while Boolean And-Or Logic is used in the second example above to combine multiple terms, it will be appreciated that multiple terms can be specified and used together in various manners in various embodiments, and that some embodiments may include only a single definition term for each category. In a manner similar to that described with respect to  and elsewhere herein, the definition term(s) used for the new EmeraldCityComics category may be used to identify corresponding user-supplied comments or other content items that are associated with the definition term(s), and to identify some or all of the comment groups that include those identified user-supplied comments or other content items to be included as constituent members of the new EmeraldCityComics category . Such constituent member comment groups are not illustrated in this example, but may, for example, include an \u201cIron Man\u201d comment group (e.g., based on an Iron Man promotion or event that the Emerald City Comics store is hosting), a \u201cPower Man\u201d comment group (e.g., based on the Power Man comic book character living in Seattle), etc. Information about the new EmeraldCityComics category may be displayed to users and\/or used for predictions or other analysis in a manner similar to that of any other defined category. For example, in a manner similar to the displayed GUI of  for an example Seattle category,  illustrates an example displayed GUI for the new EmeraldCityComics category ","Continuing with the example, after defining the new EmeraldCityComics category and identifying constituent member comment groups, the automated discovery process may continue and consider the topic for each comment group that is a constituent member of the new EmeraldCityComics category as a possible category of its own, such as to create new \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cPower Man\u201d categories and (along with any other constituent member comment groups, not shown, that did not already have corresponding categories). In addition, inter-category relationships may be defined to indicate that the new \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cPower Man\u201d categories and are sub-categories of the EmeraldCityComics category . In a manner similar to that described for the EmeraldCityComics category , each of the new \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cPower Man\u201d categories and may be analyzed to identify corresponding user-supplied comments or other content items that are associated with definition term(s) used to define the new categories and , and to identify some or all of the comment groups that include those identified user-supplied comments or other content items to be included as constituent members of the new categories and .

In other embodiments, new categories may be identified in other manners, such as to first identify various comment groups from user-supplied comments or other content items during one or more time periods in a manner previously described, and to then treat each such comment group as a category in the manner discussed above. In addition, the automated discovery process may in some embodiments allow new categories to be identified and used that would not otherwise have been identified, including for new trending topics and related categories. Thus, in the example of , the new discovered categories include a defined Typhoon Haiyan category that includes the Tacloban City comment group , and has a defined inter-category relationship with the corresponding new Tacloban city category . To further facilitate the discovery of rapidly changing information, the GDAP system may in some embodiments, as part of the automated discovery process, also examine information about trending topics and select some or all of them to use as new categories, such as to use statistical methods to determine the trending topics of most interest (e.g., those with the highest current or predicted following, those that are changing the fastest, those that are the most differentiated from other topics, etc.). In addition, while not illustrated in , some or all of the illustrated comment groups and\/or categories may each have determined relevant terms or other attributes (e.g., particular geographical locations, particular author users, etc.), including to be used in some embodiments to identify at least some inter-relationships between categories and\/or comment groups, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein.","The ability to discover new categories and\/or inter-category relationships may provide a variety of benefits, including to allow users to browse through related categories and discover additional new comment groups and topics that may be of interest. Similarly, the ability to discover new comment groups and to discover inter-relationships between comment groups and\/or between comment groups and categories may provide a variety of benefits, as discussed further below.","For example, a user may be using the GUI  of  to review current comment groups and topics that correspond to the city of Seattle, and may identify that comment group  corresponding to EmeraldCityComics is of interest, such as to find out information about individual or aggregated user-supplied comments or other content items about the Emerald City Comics store in Seattle. If so, the user may select that comment group  to obtain various information about that comment group within that Seattle category, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. It will be appreciated that the comments included within the comment group  may in some embodiments and situations be limited to user-supplied comments or other content items that correspond to both Emerald City Comics and Seattle, such as to not include information about the Emerald City Comics store in Eugene, Oreg. Similarly, if a separate Eugene Oreg. category existed and had its own EmeraldCityComics comment group, that comment group may include at least some user-supplied comments or other content items that differ from those in the EmeraldCityComics comment group , such as for content items that include information about the Emerald City Comics store in Eugene, Oreg. but to not include content items that are specific to Seattle.","Rather than using the comment group  of  to obtain information specific to that comment group, a user may instead use that comment group  or another GUI control (e.g., via a pop-up menu accessible from the comment group ) to obtain information about the new EmeraldCityComics category that has been defined using the automated discovery process. It will be appreciated that the comment groups included within the new EmeraldCityComics category in some embodiments and situations include additional information that is not part of the comment group  within the Seattle category. For example, as part of the example discussed above, the comment group  within the Seattle category may include information about the Iron Man event or promotion that is occurring within the Seattle Emerald City Comics store. Conversely, an Iron Man comment group within the EmeraldCityComics category may include additional information, such as related to events or promotions within a chain of multiple Emerald City Comics stores that are not limited to the Seattle area.","Thus, after a user uses the comment group  of  to select information about the new EmeraldCityComics category (or otherwise selects that category, such as via a search or browse process), a new GUI screen or page  of  may be displayed to the user for the new EmeraldCityComics category. In particular, the GUI  of  corresponds to a category-level view with an example category item  for the EmeraldCityComics category, corresponding to category of , and with the category item  including a number of sub-items  corresponding to particular comment groups within the category. The comment groups  include a comment group for Iron Man and a comment group for Power Man, as well as various other example comment groups that are not identified for the sake of brevity. These various comment groups  may be selected and used in a manner similar to that previously described elsewhere, including to obtain individual and\/or aggregated information about user-supplied comments or other content items related to the topics of those comment groups within the EmeraldCityComics category. While not illustrated in , the GUI  may further have various textual information and user-selectable controls to enable the user to obtain additional information, in a manner similar to that discussed elsewhere herein.","In addition, the user may continue to explore related categories and topics in a similar manner. For example, the user may use any of the displayed comment groups to obtain more information about the topics of those comment groups within the EmeraldCityComics category, or may instead use a particular comment group such as the comment group of  to select to see information about the new Iron Man category that corresponds to that comment group . If the user selects to see information about the category corresponding to comment group , a new GUI screen or page  of  may be displayed to the user for the new Iron Man category. In particular, the GUI  of  corresponds to a category-level view with an example category item  for the Iron Man category, corresponding to category of , and with the category item  including a number of sub-items  corresponding to particular comment groups within the category. The comment groups  in this example include a comment group for Robert Downey Jr. and a comment group for the Hawaiian Ironman triathlon race, as well as various other example comment groups. These various comment groups  may similarly be selected and used in a manner similar to that previously described elsewhere, including to obtain individual and\/or aggregated information about user-supplied comments or other content items related to the topics of those comment groups within the Iron Man category, or instead or in addition to obtain information about new categories corresponding to the comment groups (e.g., to select comment group to obtain information about a new Robert Downey Jr. category). While not illustrated in , the GUI  may further have various textual information and user-selectable controls to enable the user to obtain additional information, in a manner similar to that discussed elsewhere herein.","Thus, the user may similarly continue to explore related categories and topics from the GUI  of , such as to use any of the displayed comment groups to obtain more information about the topics of those comment groups within the Iron Man category, or to instead use a particular comment group to select to see information about a corresponding category that is not limited to the context of the current Iron Man category. For example, if the user selects to see information about the category corresponding to comment group , a new GUI screen or page  of  may be displayed to the user for the corresponding new Hawaiian Ironman Race category. In particular, the GUI  of  corresponds to a category-level view with an example category item  for the Hawaiian Ironman Race category, corresponding to category of , and with the category item  including a number of sub-items  corresponding to particular comment groups within the category. The comment groups  in this example include a comment group for Kona, a comment group for Triathalons, and a comment group for Nike Ironman shoes, as well as various other example comment groups. These various comment groups  may similarly be selected and used in a manner similar to that previously described elsewhere, including to obtain individual and\/or aggregated information about user-supplied comments or other content items related to the topics of those comment groups within the current category, or instead or in addition to obtain information about new categories corresponding to the comment groups. While not illustrated in , the GUI  may further have various textual information and user-selectable controls to enable the user to obtain additional information, in a manner similar to that discussed elsewhere herein.","The user may similarly continue to explore related categories and topics from the GUI  of , such as to use any of the displayed comment groups to obtain more information about the topics of those comment groups within the Hawaiian Ironman Race category, or to instead use a particular comment group to select to see information about a corresponding category that is not limited to the context of the current Hawaiian Ironman Race category. For example, if the user selects to see information about the category corresponding to comment group , a new GUI screen or page  of  may be displayed to the user for the corresponding new Nike Ironman shoes category. In particular, the GUI  of  corresponds to a category-level view with an example category item  for the Nike Ironman shoes category, corresponding to category of , and with the category item  including a number of sub-items  corresponding to particular comment groups within the category. The comment groups  in this example include a comment group for Nike, a comment group for Lebron X, a comment group for Adidas, a comment group for Nike Air Jordan, a comment group for Gatorade, and a comment group for Ironman Elite shoes by Newton, as well as various other example comment groups. These various comment groups  may similarly be selected and used in a manner similar to that previously described elsewhere, including to obtain individual and\/or aggregated information about user-supplied comments or other content items related to the topics of those comment groups within the current category, or instead or in addition to obtain information about new categories corresponding to the comment groups. While not illustrated in , the GUI  may further have various textual information and user-selectable controls to enable the user to obtain additional information, in a manner similar to that discussed elsewhere herein.","The GUI screen or page  of  further provides non-exclusive examples of how promotional information may be provided to users within the GUI of the GDAP system. For example, a representative of the Nike company may have acted as an advertiser, and previously provided a request to the GDAP system for specified Nike-related promotional information (e.g., information related to the Nike company, information related to the Nike brand, information related to one or more Nike products, information related to one or more Nike services, etc.) to be supplied to users in specified circumstances. The specified circumstances may, for example, correspond to any display of information in the GUI that includes a \u201cNike\u201d comment group (such as comment group ), or instead that satisfies other specified types of circumstances (e.g., any information display that has a comment group that includes the term \u201cNike\u201d, such as comment groups or ; any information display about the \u201cNike Ironman shoes\u201d category , such as a category-level view for that category as illustrated in ; any information display about a category that includes the term \u201cNike\u201d, such as the \u201cNike Ironman shoes\u201d category ; based on the determined relevant terms or other attributes for a comment group or category including the term \u201cNike\u201d or one or more other indicated attributes; etc.). In addition, the specified circumstances may include various other details, such as particular times, particular numbers of instances of presenting the promotional information, particular types or groups of users to whom to present the promotional information, particular portions of the GDAP service's GUI in which to display the promotional information (e.g., as part of category-level views but not comment group-level views), etc., as discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein.","In addition, promotional information may be provided to users in various ways. For example, in some embodiments and situations, additional promotional information may be displayed externally to or separately from the other information being displayed, such as promotional information  being separate from category item information  in the example of . Furthermore, such promotional information  may be displayed or otherwise presented in various manners, such as in a manner similar to a banner ad, a hover-based ad, another type of pop-up ad, etc., as well as by presenting textual information, images, audio, video, etc. Alternatively, in some embodiments and situations, promotional information may be included as part of user-requested information that is otherwise being displayed, whether instead of or in addition to other additional promotional being displayed\u2014in , for example, the representation for the Nike comment group within the category information  may be enhanced as part of the providing of promotional information for advertiser Nike, such as by increasing the size of the representation and\/or by otherwise increasing the prominence of how the representation is displayed (e.g., via highlighting, bold, color, blinking or other visual animation or enhancement, etc.). It will be appreciated that promotional information may be displayed in various other manners in other embodiments.","The user may similarly continue to explore related categories and topics from the GUI  of , such as to use any of the displayed comment groups to obtain more information about the topics of those comment groups within the Nike Ironman shoes category, or to instead use a particular comment group to select to see information about the category that corresponds to that comment group. For example, if the user selects to see information about the category corresponding to comment group , a new GUI screen or page  of  may be displayed to the user for the corresponding new Gatorade category. In particular, the GUI  of  corresponds to a category-level view with an example category item  for the Gatorade category, corresponding to category of , and with the category item  including a number of sub-items  corresponding to particular comment groups within the category. The comment groups  in this example include a comment group for BVO food additive, a comment group for Superbowl XLVIII celebration, a comment group for NCAA football, a comment group for University of Florida, and a comment group for Powerade, as well as various other example comment groups. These various comment groups  may similarly be selected and used in a manner similar to that previously described elsewhere, including to obtain individual and\/or aggregated information about user-supplied comments or other content items related to the topics of those comment groups within the current category, or instead or in addition to obtain information about new categories corresponding to the comment groups. While not illustrated in , the GUI  may further have various textual information and user-selectable controls to enable the user to obtain additional information, in a manner similar to that discussed elsewhere herein. It is noted that, if advertiser Nike had specified circumstances for its Nike-related promotional information similar to those discussed with respect to , such Nike-related promotional information may not be selected for use in the GUI screen or page  of , such as due to the lack of any Nike-related terms, comment groups or categories displayed in the GUI screen or page .","Thus, by using inter-relationships between multiple categories and between categories and their comment groups, a user may review a wide variety of types of information, including to quickly review information that may be unrelated to an original starting point (e.g., by reaching information about Iron Man in  and\/or about Gatorade in  that may be unrelated to the original Seattle-related information of the Seattle category in  from which this user's exploration of categories began). While not illustrated in these example figures, a user may similarly explore a succession of multiple inter-related comment groups, or a succession of inter-related comment groups and categories, with similar types of information about such selected comment groups and\/or selected interspersed comment groups and categories being displayed to the user.","As discussed with respect to  and , a particular user in this example has explored a series of inter-related categories, which in this example include Seattle, EmeraldCityComics, Iron Man, Hawaiian Ironman Race, Nike Ironman shoes, and Gatorade. The information page  of  includes example information -that represents this exploration, such as for use as a possible defined user journey. For example, the user who explored these inter-related categories may indicate to define this series of six categories as a user journey, including to save it for possible later use by the user. While not illustrated here, a user may similarly explore a succession of multiple inter-related comment groups, or a succession of inter-related and interspersed comment groups and categories, and such a succession may similarly be defined as a user journey and used in the manners discussed below.","While not illustrated in this example, the current user may in some embodiments be allowed to designate a particular user journey in various other manners, such as by receiving information that illustrates some or all activities previously taken by the current user during a current interaction session with the GUI, with user-selectable controls to allow the user to select some or all of those activities to include as part of a current defined user journey. Thus, with respect to the example of , the current user may be presented with information such as categories -, and determine to designate a defined user journey that includes categories -, a defined user journey that includes categories -, and\/or a defined user journey that includes categories -and -. Thus, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere, in some embodiments the current user may define a user journey other than in a manner of sequential categories and\/or comment groups. In addition, in at least some embodiments, the GDAP service may automatically identify at least some user journeys based on activities of particular users that meet specified criteria (e.g., to identify a sequence of selections of inter-related categories and\/or comment groups that are independently made by at least a specified number of different users).","In addition, in at least some embodiments, a user who defines a user journey may also optionally provide information about the user journey to other users. For example, in , the current user who explored the inter-related categories may use user-selectable GUI controls in order to specify one or more hashtags for the user journey, and to submit those hashtags using control for other users to search for or otherwise discover via the GUI of the GDAP system. In addition to or instead of such user-selectable controls , the example GUI screen  also includes user-selectable controls with which the current user can provide information about the defined user journey to one or more other specified users. In particular, in this example, the current user may specify a textual message to be provided to the other user(s), and may further designate one or more specified users to whom to send the textual message and information about the user journey using user-selectable controls . Alternatively or in addition to sending such information to particular specified users, a current user may indicate using user-selectable control to share this information with other users, such as to post the information to an account of the current user that is accessible to at least some other users (e.g., to designated friends of the current user). It will be appreciated that the current user may specify ways to provide information about the defined user journey to other users in other manners in other embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0143"},"figref":["FIG. 2AE","FIG. 2AD","FIG. 2AE","FIG. 2X"],"b":["3300","2710","2710","2720","2725","2725","2725","2725","2710","2710"],"i":["a","a","b","f","h","k "]},"While not illustrated here, the GDAP service may further provide various GUI screens to users to allow them to perform other types of journey-related activities, such as to search for defined user journeys (e.g., based on hashtags, or determined relevant terms or other attributes included in at least one or some or all categories and\/or comment groups of a journey, or other specified search criteria), to display lists or other information about at least some defined user journeys (e.g., rankings or other lists of popular and\/or trending defined user journeys), to vote on or otherwise specify positive or negative interest in particular defined user journeys, to review defined user journeys associated with particular users and\/or particular categories and\/or particular comment groups (e.g., by providing comments and\/or ratings with respect to a defined ratings metric), to retrieve and review information about defined user journeys or other information sent directly to the user by others, to review posts made by other users with which the current user has a defined friendship or other relationship, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0146","num":"0145"},"figref":["FIG. 2AF","FIG. 2Z","FIG. 2AF","FIG. 2S","FIGS. 2Y-2AD"],"b":"3400"},"In the example of , the playback of the defined user journey is performed in a manner that allows the second user to control the rate at which the playback and movement between the inter-related categories occurs, but does not allow the second user to deviate from the series of inter-related categories of the example defined user journey, although in other embodiments the playback may occur without any user control (e.g., by displaying each category-level view of the example defined user journey for a defined amount of time before automatically progressing to the next category-level view of the example defined user journey), or instead the GUI may allow the second user to leave the playback at any time (e.g., by indicating to the second user which selection to make to move to the next category-level view in the inter-related categories for the example defined user journey, or optionally a next comment group-level view for another defined user journey in which the next selected item was a comment group, but allow the second user to make another selection if so desired). In particular, in this example, the comment group of the GUI  corresponds to the next category-level view for the defined user journey, and in this example embodiment is displayed in a highlighted and user-selectable manner, while other comment groups  are deemphasized and in this example are not user-selectable controls. In this manner, when the user is ready to move to the next category-level view of the example defined user journey, the user may select the displayed comment group to move ahead, although in other embodiments may control the playback of the example defined journey in other manners (e.g., to have a user-selectable \u2018Next\u2019 control that is displayed separately from the category information ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"figref":"FIG. 2AF","b":"3405"},"In addition, as previously noted, the GDAP service may in some embodiments and situations generate predicted information related to future user-supplied comments that are expected to be received, such as with respect to particular comment groups and\/or categories. In a similar manner, the GDAP service may in some embodiments similarly generate predicted information about the playback or other use of a particular defined user journey that is expected to occur over one or more future periods of time, such as by tracking the usage and\/or popularity of the defined user journey over multiple prior time periods (e.g., based on the number of users who playback, who positively vote on the defined user journey, etc.), and use prediction templates or other types of prediction methods to predict how the usage and\/or popularity of the defined user journey will continue over one or more future time periods. Thus in a manner similar to that displayed with respect to  and , the GDAP service may predict the future use of particular defined journeys, and provide corresponding information to at least some users.","In addition to such prediction of future use of a defined user journey by various users of the GDAP service, the GDAP service may further use information about defined user journeys to affect the display of information to users who are not currently performing a playback of or otherwise using a particular user journey. For example,  illustrates a GUI  screen in which a current user is currently displaying a category-level view of the Iron Man category, with category icon  including related information for the category, including indications of various comment groups  that are part of the current category. Moreover, in the current example, while the user is not performing a playback of the previously discussed user journey, the GDAP service has identified the previously discussed user journey as being of possible interest to the current user (e.g., based on the current user having previously viewed the Seattle and EmeraldCityComics categories before the current Iron Man category, and thus having independently participated in the first three inter-related categories of the defined user journey).","Accordingly, the GDAP service has modified the current display  in this example based on such identification of possible interest of the current user in that defined user journey. In particular, the comment group corresponding to the Hawaiian Ironman Race comment group, which corresponds to the next category along the example defined user journey, has been modified in the current display to be visually enhanced, such as to have a larger size and\/or bolded visual display, to reflect that the comment group may be of enhanced interest to the current user. If the current user then proceeds to select the category corresponding to comment group for display, the GDAP service in some embodiments may automatically initiate playback of the example defined user journey to the current user (optionally with an indication to the user of the playback that is being performed), while in other embodiments may display the information about the next Hawaiian Ironman Race category to the current user without such journey playback being initiated (but optionally with the display of that next category being similarly modified to enhance its comment group corresponding to the following category of the defined user journey, and\/or with a control that allows the user to select to initiate the playback). In other embodiments, the comment group could be indicated to the current user in other manners, such as to have its visual display the same as shown in , but with other user-selectable controls or information displayed in the GUI  to indicate the possible user journey of interest (e.g., to allow the user to begin playback of the user journey from the current category, and to continue through the three remaining inter-related categories). In yet other embodiments, the information about the possible relevance of the defined user journey may be used to enhance the display of the comment group in the manner shown in , but without any user-selectable controls to allow the user to playback the defined user journey.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0151"},"figref":["FIG. 2AG","FIGS. 2Z and 2AF"],"b":["3500","3510","3520"],"i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0152"},"figref":["FIG. 2AH","FIG. 2AC","FIG. 2X"],"b":["3600","3600","3605","2700","2725","2725","2700","2725"],"i":["k ","i","j"]},"As previously noted, user journeys may be defined in various manners in various embodiments, including to allow a user who has participated in a series of interactions with the GUI to specify that a particular series of past interactions are part of a new user journey. In other embodiments and situations, the GDAP service may automatically identify some or all such defined user journeys based on analyzing usage data from the GDAP system and its service, such as by tracking the aggregate popularity across all users of the GDAP service of any sequence of sequential inter-related category views and\/or comment group views of a specified minimum or exact length, such as to identify a most popular group of such user journeys (e.g., a top N number of such user journeys, a top P percentage of such user journeys, etc.). In addition, in some embodiments, such user journeys may be defined in manners other than a sequential set of a specified number of category views and\/or comment group views, such as a user journey that includes a specified number X categories and\/or comment groups within a total number of Y category and\/or comment group selections (e.g., by including a particular group of 5 categories and\/or comment groups in any combination of 8 category and\/or comment group selections), whether with those 5 categories and\/or comment groups being in any order, or instead with those 5 categories and\/or comment groups being in an indicated order relative to each other (e.g., with category A being before category B and category B being before category C, but optionally with other categories between A and B and\/or between B and C). Another alternative would be to include at least M of a set of N categories and\/or comment groups together, such as any 5 of these 7 identified categories and\/or comment groups, whether in a sequence of only 5 categories and\/or comment groups, or in a larger group of L categories and\/or comment groups (e.g., any 5 of those 7 being included in any 9 total categories and\/or comment groups). Another alternative is to include a sequence of particular categories and\/or comment groups, but to include multiple alternatives for a particular category view and\/or comment group view, such as a defined user journey that includes category A, followed by category B, followed by any one of categories C or D or E, followed by category F, etc. It will be appreciated that user journeys may be specified in various other manners in various embodiments, and may be defined in any manner that allows a determination of whether a series of user activities correspond to a particular defined user journey.","As previously noted, advertisers or other entities may specify promotional information to include in various manners in various embodiments. For example, an advertiser or other entity may specify or request that a particular piece of promotional information be displayed in a particular situation, and may optionally pay a corresponding fee to the GDAP service for that to occur. Alternatively, such advertisers or other external entities may provide bids as to an amount of money that they are willing to pay to have a particular piece of promotional information displayed in a particular situation, with the highest bid for a particular situation being selected and used when such situations arise, and the advertisers or other external entities being billed accordingly. As previously noted, such advertisers or other external entities may specify various factors related to situations in which their promotional information is to be displayed, including time periods during which a campaign is effective, particular times of day during which a campaign is effective, etc. In addition, advertisers or other entities may specify particular terms or other attributes (e.g., definition terms, determined relevant terms or other attributes, etc.), comment groups, categories, journeys, user groups, user types, etc., as factors to define a particular situation in which promotional information is to be displayed. Advertisers or other entities may further specify additional factors to be used in determining circumstances in some embodiments and situations, such as to include particular promotional information with a particular comment group or category that is included in a journey that is trending or sufficiently popular, with any trending categories or comment groups or popular journeys, with a particular comment group or category regardless of whether it is being displayed as part of a user journey, etc. In addition, information about popularity or trending information may be combined with other types of information, such as to include a particular piece of promotional information with any trending topic or comment group within a particular category of interest, for any comment group and\/or category that is predicted to increase in popularity over an upcoming specified period of time, etc.","As noted above, in some embodiments a defined category may be associated with a single definition term, while in other embodiments a defined category may have multiple associated definition terms (or may be defined in a manner other than via associated terms). If multiple definition terms are used, they may be specified and combined in various manners, including by using Boolean Logic. For example, multiple terms may be used to capture alternative representations of a single idea (e.g., \u201cEmeraldCityComics\u201d and \u201cEmerald City Comics\u201d, \u201cAT&T\u201d and \u201cATT\u201d, etc.), to capture related representations (e.g., \u201cEmeraldCityComics\u201d and \u201c#EmeraldCityComics\u201d), etc. In addition, multiple definition terms may be combined in manners to affect a quantity and\/or type of comment groups that are identified as belonging to a particular category. For example, if a category is initially defined with a single term but it has too few associated user-supplied comments or other content items that are associated with the term, the category definition may be expanded to include one or more alternative or related representations, as indicated above. Conversely, if a category is initially defined with a single term but it has too many associated user-supplied comments or other content items that are associated with the term, and\/or comments that appear to be directed to multiple independent groupings, the category definition may be narrowed using one or more additional terms, such as to effectively split the category into multiple smaller categories. For example, if an Apple category is defined related to the computer company with a single \u201cApple\u201d term, it could be separated into a category that is more specifically focused on the company's phone products via a change in the definition to (\u201cApple\u201d AND \u201ciPhone\u201d), and other related categories for other Apple product lines could optionally be created (e.g., \u201cApple\u201d AND \u201ciPod\u201d, \u201cApple\u201d AND (\u201cMac\u201d OR \u201ciPad\u201d), etc.). Conversely, if an Apple category is defined with a single \u201cApple\u201d term and is including comments about both the computer company and the fruit, the category definition could be expanded to focus on just the computer company (e.g., \u201cApple\u201d AND NOT (\u201cfruit\u201d or \u201ccook*\u201d or \u201cjuicy\u201d), \u201cApple\u201d AND (\u201ciPad\u201d OR \u201ciPhone\u201d OR \u201cMac\u201d OR \u201ciPod\u201d OR \u201cJobs\u201d), etc.). In at least some embodiments, such category definition modification may be automatically performed, such as part of the automated discovery process, based on factors such as the number of comments or other content items in the category being too small (e.g., below a defined threshold) or being too large (e.g., above a defined threshold), and optionally by identifying topics within the content items of the category as part of identifying possible additional terms to add as part of the category definition.

Similarly, while the example below discusses term-based attributes that may be used to identify at least some of the determined types of inter-relationships, it will be appreciated that other non-term-based attributes may similarly be used to determine and identify various types of inter-relationships in other embodiments, whether instead of or in addition to user comments.","As one example, each of the Iron Man, Gatorade, and Hawaiian Ironman Race categories has been identified to include a comment group with a topic related to the term \u201ctechnology\u201d in this example, with those comment groups , and being illustrated respectively for categories ,  and . Due to the three comment groups sharing a common topic (e.g., having one or more overlapping or identical definition terms, not shown, for the comment groups, such as \u201ctechnology\u201d and\/or \u201ctechnological\u201d), the three comment groups have been identified as being inter-related on that basis, and have been linked to each other, as shown by lines  of a first type. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, it will be appreciated that the different technology comment groups may include different comments (in whole or in part) from each other, based on their inclusion in their respective categories. Thus, the technology comment group of the Gatorade category  may include comments that relate to technology within the Gatorade category (e.g., technology used to develop the Gatorade formula), while the comments in the technology comment group of the Iron Man category  may include comments related to technology corresponding to Iron Man (e.g., technology of the Iron Man suit, technology used in making the Iron Man movies, etc.).","In addition to the three illustrated technology comment groups being inter-related via links  of the first type, each of those technology comment groups is also related to the Technology category  via a link of a second type, such as to reflect a child-parent or subset-superset relationship. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, the Technology information category  may include a variety of technology-related comment groups, including comments that are not necessarily related to other of the Gatorade, Iron Man, and Hawaiian Ironman Race categories, although particular such comment groups and comments are not illustrated here. In a similar manner, the Hawaiian Ironman Race comment group of the Iron Man category  is related to the Hawaiian Ironman Race category  via a link of the second type, in a manner similar to that previously discussed with respect to .","In addition to the illustrated inter-relationships of the first and second types between particular comment groups and other categories to which those comment groups do not directly belong, the illustrated types of inter-relationships also include one or more inter-relationships from categories to other categories. For example, the illustrated link  indicates that the Iron Man category  and the Hawaiian Ironman Race category  have been determined to be related to each other. Such an inter-category relationship may be determined in various manners, such as based at least in part on the link in this example between the comment group of category  and the category , and\/or based at least in part on the link  between the technology groups and in the two categories  and \u2014for example, in one embodiment, the strength of the relationship between two such categories may be based at least in part on a quantity of comment group-to-category and\/or comment group-to-comment group links between those two categories. In addition, such an inter-category relationship may be determined on other factors in at least some embodiments, whether in addition to or instead of such a link and\/or such a link , such as based on the two categories sharing topics, comment groups, determined relevant terms and\/or non-term attributes (e.g., one or more particular geographical locations, one or more particular author users, etc.), etc., as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","In addition to such an inter-category relationship between categories  and , the illustrated types of inter-relationships in this example further include multiple inter-comment group relationships. For example, the Hollywood comment group of the Iron Man category  is determined in this example to be related to the NCAA football comment group of the Gatorade category , as reflected by the illustrated link  of a third type. Such inter-comment group relationships may be determined in various manners in various embodiments, such as based on shared terms or other attributes (e.g., particular geographical locations, particular author users, etc.) that are determined to be relevant to both comment groups and\/or shared comments (e.g., textual comments, photos, videos, information links, etc.) between the comment groups, with additional details regarding such relevance discussed elsewhere herein. As one non-exclusive illustrative example, the two comment groups and may be determined to both have highly relevant terms of \u201cTV revenue\u201d and \u201cTMZ\u201d based on the comments included in the comment groups, and\/or to both be highly relevant to one or more geographical location attributes (e.g., based on including comments from the one or more geographical locations) and\/or to one or more author user attributes (e.g., based on including comments from the one or more author users), although such determined relevant terms or other attributes for the comment groups are not illustrated in this example. In a similar manner, the Hollywood comment group of the Iron Man category  is also determined to be related to the technology comment group of the Gatorade category , as illustrated by the link  of the third type between the comment groups and , although the Hollywood comment group is not identified in this example as being related to the other example technology comment groups and . As with the link , the inter-comment group relationship between comment groups and may be based on various factors in various embodiments\u2014as one non-exclusive illustrative example, the comment groups and may share one or more relevant attributes based on having one or more determined relevant author users who submit comments included in both comment groups and\/or based on having a determined relevant geographical location from which comments included in the two comment groups originate.","In addition to the illustrated inter-comment group relationships,  further includes an additional example inter-category relationship  of a fourth or fifth type that reflects that the Iron Man category  and the Gatorade category  are related.

For example, with respect to the GUI view , a graph is illustrated that includes a first attribute along the X-axis, and a different attribute along the Y-axis, with the X-axis in this example representing the determined degree of relevance of particular comment groups to the attribute for the comment location of the city of \u201cLA,\u201d and with the Y-axis in this example representing the determined degree of relevance of particular comment groups to the attribute for a particular author user \u201cXYZ\u201d. While only a single attribute is indicated in this example for each of the X- and Y-axes, it will be appreciated that multiple terms or other attributes could be included for one or both axes in other examples, such as to aggregate the relevance of multiple such terms or attributes with respect to the comment groups that are illustrated, as shown and discussed with respect to GUI view .","In this example, the relevance for each of the indicated attributes is on a scale of 0 to 1, with the illustrated comment groups and both having a relatively high degree of relevance along both of the X- and Y-axes. In particular, in this example the comment groups and correspond to the technology comment group of the Gatorade category  and the Hollywood comment group of the Iron Man category  that were previously determined to be related in , such as based on those two comment groups sharing a high degree of relevance with respect to these two attributes illustrated on the axes of the graph , as further discussed with respect to link of . In addition, other example comment groups and are illustrated in this example, such as with comment group having a relatively high degree of relevance with respect to the attribute for the Y-axis (e.g., based on including a large quantity of comments from Author XYZ, based on including one or more comments from that author user that are of high relevance for the comment group, etc.) while having a relatively low degree of relevance with respect to the attribute for the X-axis (e.g., based on including few or no comments from the LA geographical location, based on including one or more comments from the LA geographical location but that are of low relevance for the comment group, etc.), and vice versa with respect to the comment group ","It will be appreciated that the selection of particular comment groups to display may be performed in various manners, including to filter comment groups that lack a sufficiently high degree of relevance in some embodiments with respect to one or more of the indicated attributes for the axes (e.g., using a user-specified or otherwise defined relevance threshold, based on a quantity of comment groups to display, etc.). Furthermore, additional user-selectable controls may be displayed in some embodiments to allow the user to control the display in additional manners, such as to specify a minimum and\/or maximum degree of relevance with respect to one or both axes, or to otherwise alter the display. In addition, the illustrated comment groups may be selectable by the user in the illustrated example, such that the user may select the illustrated comment group , for example, to obtain additional information about the technology comment group of the Gatorade category, such as illustrated and discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0173"},"figref":"FIG. 2AK","b":["3920","3910","3910","3920"]},"With respect to the X axis of the example graph displayed in GUI view , the right end of the X-axis is assigned the term \u201cTMZ\u201d in this example, and the left end of the X-axis is assigned the unrelated terms \u201cdebt limit\u201d and \u201cBeyonce\u201d\u2014as will be appreciated, in such an embodiment, there may be no requirement of a relationship between two such unrelated terms assigned to the same end of an axis (e.g., a relationship that reflects synonymous, similar or otherwise related aspects of a given type, such as \u201ccold\u201d and \u201cfreezing\u201d with respect to temperature), although in other embodiments and situations such a relationship may exist. In some embodiments, any combination of terms and\/or non-term attributes may be specified for any end of any axis, such as based on corresponding selections or instructions by a user to whom the corresponding graph is displayed. Thus, considering only the X-axis for a moment, the displayed indicator of the comment group \u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d in the \u201cfinance\u201d category shows that the comment group has a relatively high degree of relevance to the terms \u201cdebt limit\u201d and \u201cBeyonce,\u201d and a relatively low degree of relevance to the term \u201cTMZ\u201d, given its position in the left eighth of the X-axis. When multiple unrelated terms such as \u201cdebt limit\u201d and \u201cBeyonce\u201d are included together in such a manner, the relevance of a comment group to such multiple unrelated terms may be determined in various manners in various embodiments. For example, if two terms or other attributes are determined to be sufficiently related (e.g., synonyms or near synonyms, or otherwise sufficiently similar, such as based on statistical analyses of content items), the relevance of a comment group or category to a combination of such related attributes may be determined in some embodiments and situations by using the highest relevance of the comment group or category to either attribute, by aggregating (e.g., averaging) the relevance of the comment group or category to each attribute, by increasing the relevance of the comment group or category to the most relevant attribute based on the determined relevance of the comment group or category of some or all of the other attributes, etc. As another example, if two terms or other attributes are determined to be sufficiently unrelated (e.g., based on not being determined to be sufficiently related; based on being antonyms or near-antonyms, or otherwise sufficiently dissimilar, such as based on statistical analyses of content items; etc.), the relevance of a comment group or category to a combination of such unrelated attributes may be determined in some embodiments and situations by using the lowest relevance of the comment group or category to either attribute, by aggregating (e.g., averaging) the relevance of the comment group or category to each attribute, by decreasing the relevance of the comment group or category to the most relevant attribute based on the determined relevance of the comment group or category to some or all of the other attributes, etc. Furthermore, the relevance of a comment group to a single particular term or non-term attribute may similarly be determined in various manners, such as discussed with respect to the Y-axis and elsewhere herein. As another example, and again considering only the X-axis, the displayed indicator of the comment group \u201cGov. Smith scandal\u201d in the \u201cAlabama Politics\u201d category shows that the comment group has a relatively high degree of relevance to the term \u201cTMZ\u201d and a relatively low degree of relevance to the combination of the terms \u201cdebt limit\u201d and \u201cBeyonce\u201d. When adding in a consideration of the Y-axis in addition to the X-axis, it can be seen that both the \u201cFederal Reserve Board\/finance\u201d comment group and the \u201cGov. Smith scandal\/Alabama Politics\u201d comment group are a little more relevant to the combination of terms \u201cTV revenue\u201d and \u201cTV advertising dollars\u201d than to the combination of the term \u201cEbola\u201d and the non-term geographical location attribute \u201cWest Africa\u201d, as reflected by their respective positions slightly above the vertical center of the Y axis. Conversely, the \u201cHollywood\/Iron Man\u201d comment group , which corresponds to comment group of  and comment group of , is highly relevant to both the terms \u201cTV revenue\u201d and \u201cTMZ\u201d (as discussed with respect to ), and is not very relevant to the terms \u201cEbola\u201d, \u201cdebt limit\u201d and \u201cBeyonce\u201d or the non-term geographical location attribute \u201cWest Africa\u201d. Similar information may be determined for the other illustrated comment groups.","By providing displays such as those illustrated in the example GUI views  and  of , various types of benefits may be achieved. For example, a user may quickly and easily obtain a visual reflection of the relevance of various comment groups (including comment groups from different categories) to any arbitrary combination of selected terms and\/or non-term attributes. For example, by listing different terms and\/or non-term attributes at different ends of a given axis, the relative relevance of comment groups to those listed terms\/non-term attributes may be determined, such as to identify comment groups that are much more relevant to one term\/non-term attribute versus the other term\/non-term attribute, and to identify comment groups whose relevance to both terms\/non-term attributes may be similar (whether both having a high relevance, a low relevance, etc.). Conversely, by listing different terms and\/or non-term attributes along different axes, the relevance of a comment group to each of those terms\/non-term attributes can be identified. Furthermore, by combining multiple terms and\/or non-term attributes together at one end of a given axis, the relevance of comment groups to that combination of terms may be determined, such as if an aggregation of the relevance of a comment group to each of those terms\/non-term attributes is used for that axis. In addition, in at least some embodiments, each of the displayed comment group indications may be user selectable, such that a user can select a comment group indicator and obtain additional information about that comment group\u2014such additional information may include, for example more detailed information about the relevance of that comment group to the terms and\/or non-term attributes currently used for the graph axes, more detailed information about some or all determined relevant attributes for that comment group, information about inter-relationships of that comment groups with other comment groups and\/or categories (e.g., any other displayed comment groups that are inter-related with the selected comment group), additional information about content items of the selected group (e.g., in a manner similar to that displayed with respect to -O and U), etc. Furthermore, when a user explores a succession of multiple comment groups and\/or categories (e.g., via interactions with GUI views such as those of , via displayed information about inter-relationships between comment groups and\/or categories, etc.), information about the user's journey through that succession may be saved and used in various manners, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein.","While the example GUI views  and  of  illustrate examples of types of visual displays that may be used to illustrate the relevance of various comment groups (including comment groups from different categories) to particular terms and non-term attributes, it will be appreciated that such information may be displayed or otherwise provided to users in other manners in other embodiments, and that other types of information may similarly be displayed or otherwise provided to users in other embodiments. For example, rather than displaying the relevance of just comment groups to specified terms and\/or non-term attributes, information about the relevance of categories and\/or classifications to particular specified terms and\/or non-term attributes may be displayed, whether instead of or in addition to displayed relevance of comment groups. In addition, while 2-dimensional graphs are used to display relevance in GUI views  and , other types of information displays may be used in other embodiments and situations, such as along a 1-dimensional line or using a graph with more than 2 dimensions, by showing a list of comment groups and\/or categories that are ordered with respect to relevance to one or more specified terms and\/or non-term attributes, etc. Moreover, in at least some embodiments and situations, promotional information may be displayed along with information such as that displayed in one or more of , such as to be selected and displayed in a manner similar to that discussed elsewhere herein.

In addition, in at least some embodiments, the routine may, in block , further take one or more other automated actions for a generated histogram in accordance with defined criteria and client instructions based at least in part on predicted comment quantities and\/or on determined current comment quantities, such as to initiate and add one or more comments to one or more comment sources that include information relevant to a discussion for a category or a comment group associated with the generated histogram (e.g., to provide additional information corresponding to the category or to the topic of the comment group, or to otherwise influence a direction in which the discussion may take place in the future).","If it is determined in block  to use encoded summary comment group information for the selected comment groups and\/or intersections to predict future information for those selected comment groups and\/or intersections, the routine continues to block .

In block , the routine then attempts to match the selected aggregated group of encoded summary information to one or more of the defined prediction templates. In block , it is determined if any of the prediction templates had a sufficient match for the selected aggregated group of encoded summary information, and if so, the routine then continues to block  to select the best matching prediction template, and to use additional encoded summary information from the prediction template to predict future information for one or more future time periods corresponding to the selected aggregated group of encoded summary information. For example, if the summary information for a comment group and\/or intersection is encoded to represent information about five types of attributes for the constituent member content items of the comment group and\/or intersection during each of multiple prior time periods, and the aggregated group of summary information for a matching prediction template similarly encodes information about those five types of attributes, the additional information from the matching prediction template is used to predict future information about one or more of those five types of attributes.

Conversely, if the prior use of a prediction template was not accurate, an accuracy rate for that prediction template may be decreased accordingly, optionally with a corresponding decreased confidence in its accuracy based on the increased accuracy rate, and the prediction template may be taken out of use if its accuracy rate is too low. The prior use of a prediction template that may be assessed may in some situations include waiting until later actual information is available about user comments that are received, for comparison to the prior prediction made for the histogram.

As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, such criteria may be used to identify other categories that are related to the indicated brand or other category in a structural manner, such as based on a recent automated discovery process and\/or other statistical analysis (e.g., based on a statistical analysis of the inclusion of user comments and\/or related user comment groups corresponding to the brand in such other categories, optionally with such categories being grouped based on similarity or structural inter-relationships or other criteria), to identify other categories that are related to the indicated brand or other category based on user activities involving the indicated brand or category and other identified categories (e.g., user journeys that include both the indicated brand or other category and the other identified categories, based on users otherwise accessing information about the other identified categories in relation to the indicated brand or other indicated category, etc.), etc. After block , the routine continues to block  to store the determined information and to optionally provide it to the requester, such as if an advertiser had requested information about an indicated brand of the advertiser. In other embodiments, the analysis with respect to particular brands or other indicated categories may be performed periodically or otherwise based on identified criteria being satisfied, and may be stored for later use by the advertiser and\/or by others.","After block , or if it is otherwise determined with respect to block  that the information or instructions received with respect to block  is not a request or information to initiate analytics about user activities related to an indicated brand or other category, the routine continues instead to block  to determine whether the information or instructions received with respect to block  include a request for information about brand-related information (e.g., about categories and\/or comment groups that are related to an indicated brand or other category, a request for information about other related user activity information, etc.), such as based on analysis previously performed with respect to block  or that is otherwise accessible to the routine . If so, the routine continues to block  to obtain the requested information and to provide it to the requester, including in some embodiments to dynamically generate some or all of the requested information as appropriate. For example, in some embodiments, an advertiser or other client of the GDAP service may request one-time or periodic reports of indicated types, such as related to an indicated brand, and if so, the routine  may generate and provide such information with respect to block .","After block , or if it is otherwise determined with respect to block  that the information or instructions received with respect to block  is not a request for information related to an indicated brand or other category, the routine continues instead to block  to determine whether the information or instructions received with respect to block  include a request to provide promotional information to users of the GDAP service in one or more indicated situations, such as in accordance with a new advertising campaign being specified or as part of a previously specified advertising campaign. If so, the routine continues to block  to receive information about the advertising campaign or other advertising request, such as to identify information for use in identifying particular situations in which the promotional information is to be used (e.g., information about one or more indicated terms, comment groups, categories, journeys, user groups or other types of users, etc., as well as other related types of factors), and to store the information related to the advertising campaign or other advertising request for later use. In addition, in some embodiments, the promotional information to later be provided to users is also supplied and stored with respect to block , while in other embodiments the promotional information to be used may be specified in other manners (e.g., may be stored by the advertiser or other external entity and identified as part of the request being handled with respect to blocks  and , such that the promotional information is later retrieved from the external entity at a later time, such as a time of planned use).","If it is instead determined in block  that the information or instructions received with respect to block  is not a request to provide promotional information to users in indicated situations, the routine continues instead to block  to optionally perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. Such other indicated operations may include, for example, making changes to previously specified advertising campaigns or other advertising requests by particular advertisers, having advertisers retrieve and obtain information about the use of their promotional information within the GDAP service (e.g., metrics with respect to use of the promotional information, effectiveness of the promotional information based on click through rate or other selection of promotional information by users, etc.), etc.","After blocks  or , the routine continues to block  to determine whether to continue, such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue, the routine returns to block , and otherwise continues to block  to return, such as to return to block  of  if the current instance of the routine was invoked from there.","It will also be appreciated that in some embodiments the functionality provided by the routines discussed above may be provided in alternative ways, such as being split among more routines or consolidated into fewer routines. Similarly, in some embodiments illustrated routines may provide more or less functionality than is described, such as when other illustrated routines instead lack or include such functionality respectively, or when the amount of functionality that is provided is altered. In addition, while various operations may be illustrated as being performed in a particular manner (e.g., in serial or in parallel) and\/or in a particular order, those skilled in the art will appreciate that in other embodiments the operations may be performed in other orders and in other manners. It will similarly be appreciated that the data structures discussed above may be structured in different manners, including for databases or user interface screens\/pages or other types of data structures, such as by having a single data structure split into multiple data structures or by having multiple data structures consolidated into a single data structure. Similarly, in some embodiments illustrated data structures may store more or less information than is described, such as when other illustrated data structures instead lack or include such information respectively, or when the amount or types of information that is stored is altered.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by any specified claims and the elements recited therein. In addition, while certain aspects of the invention may be presented in certain claim forms at certain times, the inventors contemplate the various aspects of the invention in any available claim form. For example, while only some aspects of the invention may be recited as being embodied in a computer-readable medium at particular times, other aspects may likewise be so embodied."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.
