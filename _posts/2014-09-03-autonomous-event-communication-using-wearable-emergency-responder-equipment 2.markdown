title: Autonomous event communication using wearable emergency responder equipment
abstract: A system processes a series of incoming message to generate an outgoing message. In exemplary embodiments, the incoming messages comprise a first event from a wearable holster configured to accept a weapon, then receiving a second event from the wearable holster. The first signal and second signal are compared based on their respective content. The received signals derive from sensor data such as a switch, an accelerometer, a GPS sensor, a wrist device, a head device. The comparison invokes additional processing to determine the contents of a message to be sent to at least one recipient. Contents of messages are captured into a learning model, and when comparing contents of the first signal to contents of the second signal comprises the learning model is used to generate a prediction that causes an alert to be emitted.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","DESCRIPTIONS OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/948,167, entitled \u201cSMART HOLSTER\u201d, filed Mar. 5, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The disclosure relates to the field of law enforcement equipment and more particularly to techniques for real-time event communication using wearable emergency responder equipment.","Law enforcement agents and other emergency responders get into difficult situations that require their full attention. In such situations, they might forget to call for backup or perform certain other critical tasks. In legacy situations, the officer uses his\/her or her radio to advise a dispatcher of ongoing events. If the officer becomes incapacitated, the officer might be unable to perform certain tasks, including advising dispatch of ongoing events. Officers receive extensive training to deal with various law enforcement situations, but unfortunately many still get injured or even die in service. In fact, statistics show average officer assaults, injuries, and deaths over the past decade (2003-2012) to be increasing. Such events include 57,892 assaults per year, 15,483 injuries per year, and 154 deaths per year.","Prior solutions are not solutions at all, and rely on the officer to simultaneously perform law enforcement maneuvers while using his\/her radio. In some cases, it is infeasible for an officer to \u201cradio in\u201d. Such cases include when the officer must be silent or stealthy and\/or when the officer has been injured or incapacitated.","What is needed is a way to detect events and disseminate information about those events in a manner that does not require any conscious act by the officer.","None of the aforementioned legacy approaches achieve the capabilities of the herein-disclosed techniques for real-time events communication using wearable emergency responder equipment. Therefore, there is a need for improvements.","The present disclosure provides an improved method, system, and computer program product suited to address the aforementioned issues with legacy approaches. More specifically, the present disclosure provides a detailed description of techniques used in methods, systems, and computer program products for real-time events communication using wearable emergency responder equipment.","Some claims are directed to approaches for configuring a command center to receive and process signals from the wearable emergency responder equipment which claims advance the technical fields for addressing the problem of autonomous event communication and response as well as advancing peripheral technical fields. Some claims improve the functioning of multiple systems within the disclosed environments.","Some claims are directed to a system comprising a signal IO module control component for receiving incoming wireless signals from a wireless-enabled holster. The received incoming wireless signals are routed to a rule server configured to query a database to store and retrieve rules, which rules are applied over the incoming wireless signals. A predictive model is used to process the incoming wireless signals to generate real-time alerts, which alerts are in turn sent to the wireless-enabled holster.","Some claims are directed to a system comprising a signal IO module configured to receive incoming wireless signals from remote wearable wireless-enabled emergency responder equipment. The system includes a rule server configured to query a database to retrieve one or more rules, and to apply the one or more rules over the incoming wireless signals so as to invoke a predictor to process the incoming wireless signals and to generate at least one real-time alert in response to the at least one of the rules. An alerts server sends a real-time alert to at least one device of the remote wearable wireless-enabled emergency responder equipment.","Some embodiments process a series of incoming messages to generate an outgoing message. In exemplary embodiments, the incoming messages comprise a first event from a wearable holster configured to accept a weapon, then receiving a second event from the wearable holster. The first signal and second signal are compared based on their respective content. The received signals derive from sensor data such as a switch, an accelerometer, a GPS sensor, a wrist device, and a head device. The comparison invokes additional processing for determining the contents of a message to be sent to at least one recipient. Contents of messages are captured into a learning model, and when comparing contents of the first signal to contents of the second signal, the learning model is used to generate a prediction which causes an alert to be emitted.","Further details of aspects, objectives, and advantages of the disclosure are described below and in the detailed description, drawings, and claims. Both the foregoing general description of the background and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory, and are not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Some embodiments of the present disclosure address the problem of detecting events and disseminating information about those events in a manner that does not require any conscious act by the officer. More particularly, disclosed herein and in the accompanying figures are exemplary environments, methods, and systems for real-time event communication using wearable emergency responder equipment.","Overview","The herein-disclosed wearable emergency responder equipment (e.g., smart holster) and its peripherals (e.g., smart vest) constantly monitor the emergency responder's situation in order to record events, situations and actions. For example, when a law enforcement officer unlatches the latch of the holster, the smart holster detects this event and reports it to dispatch and\/or to another repository. From there, these events can be forwarded to any number of \u201csubscribers\u201d. For example, the officer's partner might be wearing headgear (e.g., Google Glass\u2122), and the headgear might subscribe to the \u201cunlatch holster\u201d event. Upon receipt of the subscribed-to event, the headgear of the officer's partner turns on the camera within the headgear so that the situation viewed by the officer gets automatically streamed up-line and recorded. The officers do not have to take any specific actions in order for this to occur other than what they have already done (e.g., unlatch their holsters, etc.). A \u201ccentral command center\u201d component (e.g., a web application) might also subscribe to events and might display the event, any spawned events, and any streaming data, together with the officer's location (e.g., superimposed on a map that is displayed via the web application).","As an example, when the officer unholsters his\/her weapon, another event gets automatically triggered and sent to the server. In this case, the nearby officers would get notified that another officer in their vicinity has unholstered his\/her gun (and therefore suggests apparent and imminent danger), then their headgear would turn on and display a map with their location, along with an indication corresponding to the event and\/or status that that the officer has unholstered his\/her gun. Additionally, the officer's location, and possibly directions on how medical personnel can come to the aid of that officer, might be displayed to subscribers (e.g., the command center). In some situations, it is appropriate to send SMS messages to civilians in the immediate vicinity (e.g., warning them to stay out of the area where the officer has unholstered his\/her gun).","As another example, an accelerometer in the holster can also detect when the officer is running (e.g., in foot pursuit) and\/or if\/when the officer were to happen to fall down. Again this event might trigger further events and\/or actions taken in the command center (e.g., an ambulance could get dispatched to the location of the officer).","As can be seen from the above, events and messages and streaming data can be sent to subscribers\u2014all without any intervention from any human.","Definitions","Some of the terms used in this description are defined below for easy reference. The presented terms and their respective definitions are not rigidly restricted to these definitions\u2014a term can be further defined by the term's use within this disclosure.","The term \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather, use of the word exemplary is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion.","As used in this application and the appended claims, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor\u201d. That is, unless specified otherwise, or is clear from the context, \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A, X employs B, or X employs both A and B, then \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances.","The articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or is clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","Reference is now made in detail to certain embodiments.

Further, sensor data can be used singly or in combination to determine many probable situations. Still further, the occurrence of one situation or even many situations or events in a sequence can be used as a predictor of another situation or sequence of events. For example, if an officer were to release the catch on his\/her weapon (e.g., see contact switch sensor ), a model can determine within a statistical certainty that a next event would be to unholster the weapon.

If\/when that occurs, the holster sends a message over network communications , which message describes the event. A unit within operations  receives the message. For example, a control center component  processes the message and forwards the received message and\/or a second message to the dispatch switchboard  (e.g., the second message serving to request backup for officer ). The message can comprise of any one or more of, a location, any situational information, officer vitals, etc. In some cases, the control center component  sends a message to a recording unit to begin recording streams (e.g., video, audio, sensor data, etc.). Some streams can be repeated for display at the head mounted device on officer . The dispatch switchboard  radios an officer . The officer receives the request for back up and situational information. The officer responds to the request for backup, and the control center component  receives a message that officer as well as officer have both drawn their weapons. Lights or other indications in the control center serve to alert personnel in the control center of the severity of the events received. The control center component  uses routing functions  to forward or respond to certain messages (e.g., an officer down message might be sent to any of a local law enforcement , a county law enforcement , a government agency , paramedics, a local fire department, etc.). In this scenario, the local law enforcement  uses a dispatch switchboard  to communicate to a broadcast group, which communication might include instructions to dispatch backup units. Other members of the broadcast group might include a government agency , and might include broadcast group members (e.g., real persons or networked nodes such as a holster). Some participants in a broadcast group can serve to dispatch aid (e.g., an ambulance, paramedics, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","319","302","308","310","311","316","318","330","332","328","328","312","314"]},"The operator  can interact with the web dashboard , and upon receipt of a message or event, visual information can be provided in the form of controlled lighting . The controlled lighting  can perform changes of colors to provide visual information (e.g., yellow to indicate an escalating situation, red to indicate a severe situation, etc.).","The control center component  can communicate with a database server  to perform any of a sending, a receiving, a storing and a retrieving of information. The database server  can comprise any of a web application server  to serve web applications, and a database  to store information. The database server can be implemented as a single server or as a cluster of servers or computing units, and\/or any portions, module or sub-components of the shown database server can be situated in a cloud (e.g., for multi-tenant hosting or private hosting) and\/or any portion or portions can be hosted in a captive or private setting.","The control center component  can communicate with a dispatch switchboard  to send messages to an agency (e.g., local law enforcement, county law enforcement, a government agency, etc.) and a receiving of messages from an agency. Further, operational units in the control center component  can perform any forms of communication with an officer , for example, transmitting or relaying information between an officer and a second officer , and\/or transmitting or relaying information to an Nth officer , and a sending of a public alert  (e.g., evacuation order, danger alert, etc.).","In certain environments, the control center component  hosts a number of servers that are dedicated to a particular function. For example, telemetry to and from the holster and\/or any wearable devices can be handled by sensor telemetry server . Further, a HUD video server  can serve to both receive video from any number of head mounted devices and\/or can deliver video to a head mounted device. Strictly as examples, HUD video server  can record the situation \u201con the ground\u201d, or the HUD video server  can be used to deliver video comprising the scene as experienced by an officer.","Any of the operators  can interact with a dashboard, and the displayed information on the dashboard might include suggestions of actions to be taken by any of the participants during the course of responding to a situation. For example, if a single officer had responded, and then found an escalating situation, it might be appropriate for the control center operators to call for backup to the situation location, even in the absence of any such instruction coming from the single officer.","Rules of engagement may be codified, and rules to be considered or applied in a particular situation can be emitted by a predictive model. Such a predictive model  can be constructed using a learning model, and in turn the predictive model  can be wrapped by a predictor (see ) that is configured to process incoming signals. A learning model can process received signals  in real-time, and can learn continuously. Some embodiments include learning supervision so as to determine when to emit one or more rules  and\/or when to raise one or more alerts . The shown rules server  and alerts server  might be configured so as to only apply rules that have a particular threshold of likelihood resulting in the desired outcomes, and\/or have a particular threshold of likelihood of advancing the situation to a next step (e.g., where additional rules with higher likelihoods of successful outcomes can be applied). The aforementioned predictive model can be embodied as a component within a learning model system. One possible embodiment of a learning model system is given in the following .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","433","433","333","405","406","405","305","310","311"]},"In some cases the predictive model  can be output from a model validator  after such a model validator has determined that a learning model  exhibits sufficient quantitative characteristics (e.g., precision and recall) such that the predictions of the learning model can be relied upon to a particular statistical certainty. The learning model  can be populated over time, using any number of training cycles. Further, the validation of the training model and calculation of quantitative characteristics can be performed over any number of validation cycles. In some cases a predictive model receives stimulation in the form of real-time, incoming telemetry data over incoming telemetry path . The real-time stimulus can be used the generate a prediction within the predictive model  which in turn can cause a rule  to be emitted and\/or an alert  to be raised.","Additional Embodiments of the Disclosure","Additional Practical Application Examples",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["500","510","505","520","530","540","550"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["560","114","102","598","599","562","563","564","565"]},"At some moment in time, an event might occur (see event ) and a sensor might detect the occurrence of and various aspects of the event, and forward event data to the holster (see message ).
