title: Methods and systems for establishing, hosting and managing a screen sharing session involving a virtual environment
abstract: Techniques for establishing a screen sharing session are described. Consistent with some embodiments, a web conferencing application executing at a mobile computing device enables a user to specify the identity of a remote computer. The identity of the remote computer is communicated to a web conferencing service, directing the server operating the web conferencing service to establish a remote desktop connection with the remote computer. Once established, the web conferencing service receives from the remote computer a stream of information representing a user interface of the remote computer, and then broadcasts the user interface to all computing devices participating in the web conferencing session, while enabling the mobile computing device to manipulate the user interface of the remote computer.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to data processing systems. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods, systems and computer program products for establishing, hosting, and managing a screen sharing session involving a virtual environment.","With various advances in computer and networking technologies, mobile computing devices have become smaller, more powerful, full-featured, and omnipresent. In fact, for many working professionals, mobile computing devices such as mobile handsets (e.g., smart phones) or tablet computing devices have become the device of choice for everyday computing tasks. Despite the vastly improved performance and feature sets of smart phones and tablet computing devices, reliance on these mobile computing devices as one's primary computing device still presents a variety of problems and technical challenges.","One frequently occurring problem involves using one of these mobile computing devices with a web conferencing service to demonstrate the look, feel and functionality of a software application executing on a desktop computer. For instance, various enterprise software applications are designed to reside and execute on desktop computers. Invoking a web conferencing session from the desktop computer on which the enterprise software application is residing and executing allows a web conference host to share his or her screen and thereby easily demonstrate the features and functionality of the enterprise software application to participants in the web conferencing session. However, when a person is away from the desktop computer on which the enterprise software application is residing and executing, and is using a smart phone or tablet computing device as his or her primary computing device, demonstrating how the enterprise desktop application operates via a web-based conferencing service provides a variety of challenges, some of which are described below in connection with the description of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","16","10","12","10","14","12","16","16","12","10","18","10","12","20","22","24","1","10","18"]},"Next, the web conference host  uses a second application residing and executing at the tablet computer  to establish a remote desktop connection with the remote desktop computer  on which the enterprise software application is residing and executing. This operation is represented in  by the line (with reference number  enclosed in a circle) connecting the tablet computer  with the remote desktop computer . The remote desktop connection enables the web conference host  to use the touch screen display of the tablet computer  to view and interact with the desktop interface of the remote desktop computer . Accordingly, once the remote desktop connection is established, the web conference host  can use the input mechanisms of the tablet computer  to manipulate the interfaces of various software applications residing and executing at the remote desktop computer , including the software application to be demonstrated.","Finally, using the remote desktop connection between the tablet computer  and the remote desktop computer , the web conference host  invokes a web conferencing application on the remote desktop computer , and causes the remote desktop computer  to join the web conferencing session as a participant. The line with reference number  enclosed in a circle represents this operation. By manipulating the settings of the web conferencing application, either at the tablet computer  or at the remote desktop computer , the web conference host  can select the screen of the remote desktop computer  to be broadcast to all participants in the web conferencing session. Consequently, when the web conference host  uses the remote desktop connection between the tablet computer  and the remote desktop computer  to manipulate the interface of the enterprise software application residing and executing at the remote desktop computer , the user interface of the enterprise software application is broadcast via the screen sharing feature of the web conferencing service  to all web conference participants, including remote participants , , and .","Although the above-described technique generally achieves the desired objective\u2014that is, sharing or broadcasting the screen of the remote desktop computer  while the web conference host  manipulates the interface of the enterprise software application\u2014a number of problems arise with this general approach and technique. First, the remote desktop application residing and executing at the tablet computer  generally does not provide an optimal interface for manipulating the user interface of the software applications residing and executing on the remote desktop computer . Specifically, tablet computers with touch screen displays that rely primarily on a touch interface as a means of receiving user input do not provide very good control over desktop applications that generally rely on receiving input via a pointing device (e.g., computer mouse, or track pad) and\/or keyboard. Second, because the web conference host  must establish and manage the web conference via a first tablet-based application, and then establish and manage the remote desktop session through a second tablet-based application, the web conference host  is required to switch back and forth between the two applications, as necessary, to perform the required tasks. With many mobile computing devices, switching back and forth between applications, if possible at all, is a time consuming and clunky process at best. Finally, as the tablet computer  is required to establish separate communication sessions for both the web conferencing application and the remote desktop application, this technique for screen sharing requires that significant network bandwidth be available to the tablet computer . Because the tablet computer is mobile and may be located where wireless network access and bandwidth are limited, the bandwidth requirements for establishing and supporting both communication sessions may be difficult to satisfy.","The present disclosure describes methods, systems, and computer program products, which individually provide functionality for establishing, hosting, and managing a screen sharing session involving a virtual environment. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of different embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without all of the specific details.","For purposes of the present disclosure, a \u201cweb conferencing service\u201d is any computer-based service that allows two or more participants to communicate and\/or exchange information, including audio, video and graphical information, over a network. A web conferencing service allows information to be shared simultaneously, across geographically dispersed locations in real-time, or near real-time. As such, a web conferencing application allows for conducting meetings, training events, lectures or short presentations from a computer. Communications and information exchanged between the participants in a web conferencing session may be broadcast to all participants, or in some cases, communications and information may flow in only one direction (e.g., from a host-participant to all other participants), such as the case might be with a web-based seminar (frequently referred to as a webinar). The present inventive subject matter is applicable to any and all of the aforementioned web conferencing services, systems and applications.","Screen sharing, which is a particular feature made possible by web conferencing services, allows a participant in a web conferencing session to share the user interface being displayed on the display of the participant's computing device. As such, a \u201cscreen sharing session\u201d involves broadcasting a user interface displayed at a computing device to one or more other computing devices, thereby enabling remote web conferencing participants to view the user interface being presented on the display or screen of a computing device that is remote from the web conferencing participants. As described in greater detail below, with embodiments of the present invention a screen sharing session can be invoked and controlled with a mobile computing device (e.g., a tablet computer or smart phone), where the user interface that is being shared (e.g., broadcast to the web conference participants) is the user interface of a computer that is remote from the mobile computing device and communicatively coupled to a web conferencing service via a remote desktop connection (e.g., a virtual environment).","For purposes of the present disclosure, the terms \u201cweb conference host\u201d and \u201chost-participant\u201d are used synonymously to identify and distinguish the particular conference participant(s) who will generally have privileges and access to functionality that are not available to regular (i.e., non-host) participants. Specifically, consistent with at least some embodiments, a host-participant will have both the ability and the authority to provide the identity (e.g., hostname or Internet Protocol (IP) address) of a remote computer, for the purpose of requesting that the web conferencing service establish a remote desktop connection with the remote computer, thereby enabling the host-participant to view and manipulate the interface or desktop of the remote computer via the host-participant's computing device while the interface is being broadcast to all web conference participants. More generally, a host-participant will be able to organize and initiate a web conferencing session, for example, by specifying the identities of persons who are to be invited to participate in the web conferencing session. Additionally, a computer or computing device that is being used by a web conferencing host or host-participant is referred to herein as a \u201chost-computing device,\u201d whereas a non-host participant's computer or computing device is referred to simply as a \u201cparticipant-computing device.\u201d As described below, with some embodiments of the invention, the host-computing device is a mobile computing device, such as a smart phone or tablet computer. However, with some embodiments, the host-computing device may be a conventional desktop computer, laptop computer, or a computing device with any other form factor.","Consistent with various embodiments of the invention, and as described in greater detail below, a web conferencing application residing and executing on a mobile computing device (e.g., such as a smart phone, or tablet computer) provides functionality that enables a user to very easily and quickly share with participants in a web conferencing session the view of a user interface or desktop interface of a remote, network-connected computer. For example, by simply specifying, via the user interface of the web conferencing application at the mobile computing device, the identity (e.g., hostname or Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other identifying means) of a remote, network-connected computer, the user can invoke a command and direct a server executing a web conferencing service to establish a remote desktop connection with the remote computer. Once the remote desktop connection is established between the server and the remote computer, the desktop interface of the remote computer is received at the server, and then broadcast via the web conferencing service to each web conference participant's computing device, thereby allowing each participant to view the user interface or desktop interface of the remote computer. Additionally, the web conferencing service provides a control interface that allows a user of the mobile computing device to not only view the remote desktop interface, but also to interact with the remote desktop interface via the various input mechanisms of the mobile computing device on which the web conferencing application is executing.","Because the mobile computing device on which the web conferencing application is executing need only establish a single communication session with the web conferencing service, the bandwidth requirements for sharing the remote desktop interface are reduced from what is required with many conventional approaches. Moreover, the web conferencing application residing and executing at the mobile computing device can be optimized to take advantage of native input and control mechanisms to control the remote desktop interface. Specifically, with some embodiments, the web conferencing application will leverage application programming interfaces (API's) associated with the mobile computing device to allow for interaction with and control of the remote desktop interface via the mobile computing device's various input and control mechanisms, for example, to include any one or more of: touch screen displays, microphones, various location sensing devices (e.g., global positioning system (GPS)) and orientation sensors (e.g., accelerometers and gyroscopes), and others. Finally, because the web conferencing application on the mobile computing device provides the functionality to cause the server, on which the web conferencing service is executing, to establish the remote desktop connection with the remote computer, the user of the mobile computing device need not switch back and forth between separate and distinct applications for establishing the web conferencing session, and establishing the remote desktop connection. Other advantages and aspects of the inventive subject matter will be readily apparent from the description of the figures that follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","32","34","36","36","38","40","40","42","44","46","32"]},"For purposes of the example being presented in , one can presume that the web conference host using a web conferencing application executing on the mobile computing device  desires to demonstrate, to the web conference participants ,  and , a software application that is residing at the remote desktop computer . Accordingly, the web conference host invokes a web conferencing application residing on his or her mobile computing device (e.g., the tablet computer with reference number ). Using the web conferencing application executing on the mobile computing device , the web conference host initiates or invokes a web conferencing session and establishes a web conferencing connection  between the mobile computing device  and the web conferencing service . This may involve sending out invitations (e.g., by email or other messaging service) to the web conference participants, or alternatively, simply invoking a command to initiate the web conferencing session, if the web conferencing session parameters (e.g., list of participants, scheduled time, and any additional resources) have already been defined.","After the web conferencing session has been initiated and each web conference participant ,  and  has established a communication session with the web conferencing service  with his or her respective computing device, the participants will be able to exchange information with one another. For instance, with some embodiments, the web conferencing service may facilitate audible communication via any number of communication services and\/or protocols that facilitate such communications over an Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as Voice Over IP (VOIP). With some embodiments, the web conferencing service  may integrate with a telephony server (not shown), enabling participants to use conventional landline telephones to establish an audible connection with the other participants. Accordingly, with some embodiments, the web conferencing service  may allow a mix of IP-based communications, and conventional analog telephone communications.","In addition to facilitating audible communications, the web conferencing service  may also facilitate the exchange of graphical or video information, for example, via one or more video-based communication protocols, to include, any one of the following: Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), Real Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP), Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), or Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP). Using one of the aforementioned protocols, and a video codec, such as H.264, one of the On2 TrueMotion codecs (e.g., VP6, VP7 or VPA), the Sorenson Spark video codec (also known as Sorenson H263 or FLV1), the vlib video codec, or some other similar video codec, a data stream received at the web conferencing service from one computing device may be broadcast to the computing devices of all web conference participants. With some embodiments, using a control interface of the web conferencing application, the web conference host may choose to share a user interface being presented at the mobile computing device , or the user interface of a particular application executing at the mobile computing device . In some embodiments, more granular control may enable a web conference host to specify a particular window, or other graphical user interface element of an application, that is to be broadcast to the other participants. Additionally, at least with some embodiments, the web conference host may authorize another web conference participant to share (e.g., broadcast) information being presented on his or her display screen.","If, during the web conferencing session, the web conference host desires to demonstrate the look, feel and functionality of a software application that is residing on the remote computer , the web conference host can very easily establish a remote desktop connection with the remote computer  via the web conferencing application executing on the mobile computing device , and thus share the screen or user interface of the remote computer  with the other participants ,  and . For instance, during the web conferencing session, the web conference host may manipulate a control interface of the web conferencing application on the mobile computing device , thereby enabling the web conference host to select or otherwise specify the identity (e.g., hostname or IP address) of the remote computer . By pressing a button or interacting with some other graphical user interface element, the web conference host causes the web conferencing application to communicate a command over the network, with the identity of the remote computer, to the web conferencing service . This command directs the web conferencing service  to use the hostname or IP address of the remote computer to establish a remote desktop connection  with the remote computer . In some instances, the web conference host may have previously specified the identity of the remote computer  at the time the initial parameters for the web conferencing session were established. In such instances, the web conference host may simply interact with a graphical user interface element presented on the touch screen display of the mobile computing device, or simply speak a command to the mobile computing device , to direct the web conferencing service  to use the previously provided parameters to establish the remote desktop connection  with the remote computer .","In some instances, the web conferencing service  may prompt the web conference host to enter or otherwise provide authorization information (e.g., username and password) for establishing the remote desktop connection with the remote computer . The web conference host may provide the authorization information via a user interface of the web conference application executing at the mobile computing device . Alternatively, in some instances, the web conference host may have previously provided the authorization information as part of the set-up and configuration process when providing the other parameters for the web conference session. If setup in advance, the parameters for the web conferencing session may be provided via any network-connected computer, to include the mobile computing device .","In any case, when the web conference host directs the web conferencing service  to establish the remote desktop connection , the web conferencing service  will communicate directly (e.g. via a network) with the remote computer  to establish the remote desktop connection . In the context of the present disclosure, a remote desktop connection is a connection established with a software application or an operating system feature that allows applications to be executed remotely (i.e., on a remote computer), while being displayed locally, on a locally operated computer. The desktop or user interface of the remote computer  is communicated to and received at the web conferencing service  via the remote desktop connection , converted or transcoded for broadcasting to the web conference participants, ,  and , and then broadcast to the computing devices of the participants for display on their respective computing devices ,  and . Various embodiments of the invention use any one of several remote connection protocols to establish the remote desktop connection between the web conferencing service , and the remote computer . Examples of these remote connection protocols include: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Independent Computing Architecture (ICA), Remote FrameBuffer (RFB), or Virtual Network Computing (VNC), as well as other proprietary or non-proprietary protocols that serve the same or similar functions.","Once the remote desktop connection  is established, agent software (e.g., a remote connection software application) residing on the remote desktop computer  will communicate information representing the desktop user interface of the remote computer  to the web conferencing service , which will in turn, convert or transcode the information into a format suitable for broadcasting to the computing devices of all web conference participants. For example, the web conferencing service  will convert the information representing the user interface of the remote computer from a format consistent with one of the aforementioned remote connection protocols, to a format consistent with one of the aforementioned web conferencing (or, video) protocols. Once transcoded, the information stream received from the remote computer  is broadcast to the computing devices of the web conference participants.","In addition to simply broadcasting the information representing the user interface of the remote computer , the web conferencing service includes a control interface via which it can receive input from the web conferencing application executing at the mobile computing device. For example, with some embodiments, by default the web conferencing application of the web conference host will be authorized to communicate commands to the remote computer . Accordingly, the web conference host can use the mobile computing device  to manipulate the user interface of the remote computer, while the user interface of the remote computer is being broadcast to all web conference participants. In this manner the web conferencing service  facilitates a screen sharing session with a computer that is coupled to the web conferencing service via a remote desktop connection (a virtual environment) and can be manipulated via a remote, network-connected, mobile computing device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["50","32","36","50","32","52","52","54","56"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["58","60","60","36","60","50","60","62","36"]},"The web conference engine  includes the various modules that enable the exchange of information between participants during a web conferencing session. Specifically the web conference engine  includes a video broadcast module  for receiving information representing a user interface of a desktop software application, and then broadcasting the user interface to all participants in the web conferencing session. Accordingly, if a web conference host is using a desktop computer to participate in the web conferencing session, the web conference host can share his or her screen or display to demonstrate the look, feel and functionality of a software application executing on the web conference host's computer. Similarly, if the web conference service has established a remote desktop connection with a remote computer, the user interface of the remote computer, upon being received (e.g., by the listener module ), and converted or transcoded (e.g., by the transcoder module ), can be broadcast to all web conference participants by the video broadcast module .","In certain situations, the web conference host may be using a mobile computer (e.g., a tablet computer or smart phone), or a computer that does not have the particular software application that the web conference host would like to demonstrate to the other web conference participants. Consequently, the web conference host can specify the identity of a remote computer on which the software application resides. As illustrated in , the remote desktop connection module , when invoked, will attempt to establish a remote desktop connection with the remote computer identified by the web conference host. The web conference host can specify the remote computer prior to, or during, a web conferencing session. Upon establishing a remote desktop connection with the remote computer identified by the web conference host, the listener module  of the remote desktop connection module  will receive a stream of information representing a user interface of the remote computer. For example, the user interface may be that of the desktop, or of a particular software application being executed at the remote computer. The transcoder module  transcodes, or converts, the received information from one format to another that is suitable for broadcasting or communicating to the computing devices of the web conference participants. Finally, the broadcast module  broadcasts the now converted information to the computing devices of the web conference participants, allowing all web conference participants to view the user interface of the remote computer.","During the broadcasting of the user interface of the remote computer, the web conference host can use the web conferencing application residing and executing on the mobile computing device to provide user-inputs that control or manipulate the user interface of the remote computer. For instance, these user-inputs generate commands that are communicated to the control interface  of the remote desktop connection module , which will in turn forward the commands to the remote computer for processing.","As described briefly above, with various embodiments of the invention, the remote desktop connection module  of the web conference engine  will use any one of several different remote connection protocols to establish the remote desktop connection between the web conferencing service , and the remote computer . While the following list is by no means exhaustive, examples of these remote connection protocols include: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Independent Computing Architecture (ICA), Remote FrameBuffer (RFB), or Virtual Network Computing (VNC), as well as other proprietary or non-proprietary protocols that serve the same or similar functions. In turn, the transcoder module  will receive and transcode, or convert, the user interface information that is received in a format consistent with one of the above protocols into a format consistent with a video protocol. While the following list of video protocols is not exhaustive, examples include: H.264, or, one of the On2 TrueMotion codecs (e.g., VP6, VP7 or VPA). Finally, the encoded video, representing the user interface of the remote computer, is broadcast to the various computing devices of the web conference participants using any one of the following protocols: Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), Real Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP), Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), or Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["80","82"]},"Next, at method operation , the web conferencing application executing on the computing device of the web conference host receives the identity of the remote computer. The identity may be specified as a hostname, or an Internet Protocol (IP) address, or some other identifier that can be properly resolved to uniquely identify the remote computer with which the web conferencing service is to establish a remote desktop connection. At method operation , the web conferencing application communicates the identity of the remote computer to the server operating the web conferencing service. The identity of the remote computer is communicated to the server with, or as part of, a command directing the server to invoke or establish the remote desktop connection with the remote computer. Finally, at method operation , the web conferencing application residing and executing on the web conference host's computing device receives a stream of information from the server operating the web conferencing service.
