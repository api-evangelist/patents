{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to process control systems and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus to manage process control resources.","Process control systems, like those used in chemical, petroleum or other processes, typically include one or more process controllers and input\/output (I\/O) devices communicatively coupled to at least one host or operator workstation and to one or more field devices via analog, digital or combined analog\/digital buses. The field devices, which may be, for example, valves, valve positioners, switches and transmitters (e.g., temperature, pressure and flow rate sensors), perform process control functions within the process such as opening or closing valves and measuring process control parameters. The controllers receive signals indicative of process measurements made by the field devices, process this information to implement a control routine, and generate control signals that are sent over the buses or other communication lines to the field devices to control the operation of the process. In this manner, the controllers may execute and coordinate control strategies or routines using the field devices via the buses and\/or other communication links communicatively coupling the field devices.","Information from the field devices and the controllers may be made available to one or more applications (i.e., routines, programs, etc.) as runtime data executed by the operator workstation (e.g., a processor-based system) to enable an operator to perform desired functions with respect to the process. Some of these functions may include viewing the current state of the process (e.g., via a graphical user interface), evaluating the process, modifying the operation of the process (e.g., via a visual object diagram), etc. Many process control systems also include one or more application stations. Typically, these application stations are implemented using a personal computer, workstation, or the like that is communicatively coupled to the controllers, operator workstations, and other systems within the process control system via a local area network (LAN). Each application station may execute strategies, routines, or applications that perform campaign management functions, maintenance management functions, virtual control functions, diagnostic functions, real-time monitoring functions, safety-related functions, configuration functions, etc. within the process control system.","Application stations may include a plant asset manager to display information regarding field devices, controllers, and\/or other process control components or resources. Frequently, plant asset managers organize information associated with field devices, controllers, and other process control components into a hierarchical structure that is based on the physical coupling of the field devices, controllers, and other process control components. Further, the hierarchical structure may be based on a physical location of the field devices, controllers, and other process control components. If process control personnel want to access a particular field device, the personnel have to navigate through the hierarchical structure. In some process control systems with many different areas or physical locations, tens of controllers, and thousands of field devices, navigating to a desired field device can be relatively difficult and time consuming.","Example methods and apparatus to manage process control resources are described. In one example, a method includes receiving a selection of a first process control resource within a process control system to be associated with a logical container, the logical container including other process control resources that have a same user defined characteristic in common with the first process control resource. The example method also includes creating an entry within the logical container for the first process control resource by storing an identifier of the first process control resource in the logical container. The example method further includes assigning the first process control resource to the logical container so that the identifier of the first process control resource links to process control information associated with the first process control resource.","In another example, a method includes displaying a pictorial representation of a process control system and determining a location of a process control field device within the pictorial representation by matching location information associated with the process control field device to a corresponding location within the pictorial representation. The example method also includes displaying an icon in proximity to the location within the pictorial representation, the icon being a graphical representation of the process control field device and linking to information associated with the process control field device.","An example apparatus includes a container manager to select an icon representative of a process control resource within a process control system requested to be associated with a logical container, the icon including a link to information associated with the process control resource. The example container manager also is to assign the process control resource to the logical container so that the icon of the process control resource is displayed within the logical container via a user interface, the logical container including other process control resources that have a same user defined characteristic in common with the process control resource.","Although the following describes example methods and apparatus including, among other components, software and\/or firmware executed on hardware, it should be noted that these examples are merely illustrative and should not be considered as limiting. For example, it is contemplated that any or all of the hardware, software, and firmware components could be embodied exclusively in hardware, exclusively in software, or in any combination of hardware and software. Accordingly, while the following describes example methods and apparatus, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the examples provided are not the only way to implement such methods and apparatus. For example, while the example methods and apparatus are described in connection with managing process control resources of a process control system, the example methods and apparatus are more generally applicable and may be implemented to manage process control resources within any automation system, batch processing system, manufacturing system, industrial control system, safety instrumented system, etc.","Process control systems generally include controllers to perform routines, control strategies, and\/or algorithms that manage field devices located in the control system. The field devices may be, for example, valves, valve positioners, switches and transmitters, and may perform process control functions such as opening or closing valves and measuring process control parameters. In addition to managing field devices, controllers may generate process data (e.g., process control information) based on information received from the field devices. The process data may include process statistics, alarms, monitoring information, process trend information, diagnostic information, field device status information, and\/or messages from the field devices.","Controllers transmit process data to applications operating on hosts (e.g., workstations, computers, tablet computers laptops, servers, handheld devices, portable devices, wireless devices, smartphones, and\/or any other computing device) so that operators may manage a process control system. Typically, applications display process data as at least one graphical data representation in a user interface. Data representations are helpful to operators as these data representations typically display process data graphically in the form of charts, graphs, data tables, list boxes, graphical symbols, text, etc. The data representations and corresponding text within the user interface are generally displayed in a format and\/or language associated with a locale of an operator viewing the information.","In many known process control environments, process control personnel utilize asset management tools to manage field devices, controllers, I\/O cards, and\/or any other components within a process control system. The field devices, controllers, I\/O cards, servers, computers, processors, groups of devices, documents, process control personnel, and\/or other components are referred to herein as process control resources. Asset management tools enable process control personnel to view setup information, configuration information, device feature information, and\/or output process data from the process control resources. Further, many common asset management tools enable process control personnel to control the process control resources via an interface displayed on a host and\/or workstation with control functionality.","Currently, many asset management tools order and\/or structure process control resources in a hierarchical arrangement based on a physical coupling and\/or location of resources within a process control system. In one example, a hierarchical structure may have a first hierarchical level that corresponds to a process control plant location, a second hierarchical level that corresponds to an area within the process control plant, a third hierarchical level that corresponds to a controller within the area, a fourth hierarchical level that corresponds to an I\/O card communicatively coupled to the controller, and a fifth hierarchical level that corresponds to field devices communicatively coupled to the I\/O card. In another example, the hierarchical structure may be based on coupling of resources grouped within functional areas. For example, a first hierarchical level may include a process control plant, a second hierarchical level may correspond to water processing functions, a third hierarchical level may correspond to a salination function, a fourth hierarchical level may correspond to controllers associated with the salination function, and a fifth level may correspond to field devices communicatively coupled to each of the controllers associated with the salination function.","Process control personnel that want to view information associated with a field device have to manually navigate though the hierarchical structure until the desired field device is located. In particular, the process control personnel have to know which plant, which area within the plant, relationships between functional areas, connectors of controllers, and\/or connectors of I\/O cards to locate a particular field device. This navigating to a specific device is relatively time consuming and inefficient. Further, the hierarchical structure requires that process control personnel have prior knowledge of where resources are located and how resources are coupled together. As more process control environments rely on distributive computing and management of resources by remote personnel (e.g., operators that are located some distance from the process control environment), there is an increasing likelihood that many process control personnel do not have knowledge of where particular field devices may be located.","Some known systems enable process control personnel to search for a particular resource. However, the process control personnel need enough identifying information to locate the resource. Further, it can become redundant and\/or inefficient for process control personnel to frequently and repeatedly search for desired resources. Other known systems enable personnel to configure an interface to view diagnostics, statuses, and\/or outputs from resources. However, many of these interfaces display information for controlling the resources and may not include information describing the resources and\/or information associated with managing the resources.","The example methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to manage process control resources by creating logical containers. The example logical containers are customizable software and\/or data structures that enable process control personnel to group and\/or associate resources based on preferences of the personnel. The example logical containers may be included within asset management tools to provide customizable structures for grouping process control resources. In some instances, logical containers may be a partition of memory that stores a list of process control resources specified by process control personnel. In other instances, the logical containers may be a partition and\/or group within an asset management tool (e.g., asset management software) that includes a list of process control resources specified by process control personnel. In yet other examples, the logical containers may be files that store a list and\/or identifiers of associated process control resources.","The example methods and apparatus described herein create logical containers based on requests from process control personnel to group resources based on preferences and\/or a common characteristic. A common characteristic may include, for example, a fault type, an issue history, a type of resource, a physical location, a manufacturer, a calibration date (and\/or date range), an installation date (and\/or date range), a communication type, etc. Alternatively, process control personnel may create logical containers based on personal preferences. For example, an operator may create a logical container for resources assigned to the operator to monitor and\/or maintain. In another example, an operator may create a logical container based on favorite and\/or most accessed process control resources. In this manner, the methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to create relatively arbitrary groupings of process control resources.","After creating a logical container, the example methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to select process control resources to assign to the logical container. To add a process control resource to a logical container, the example methods and apparatus described herein create an entry within the logical container for the resource that links to information associated with and\/or generated by the resource. The entry may include a name of the resource and\/or any other identifying information. Further, the entry may include an icon that indicates a type of the resource and\/or text that describe the resource. Thus, the resource entry is a shortcut to information associated with the process control resource, the creation of a resource entry does not change properties of the resource and\/or change how the resource is connected within a process control environment. Additionally, because the resource entry is a shortcut, process control personnel can create multiple entries for the same process control resource stored to different logical containers.","The example methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to recall previously created logical containers to relatively easily locate process control resources. In some examples, the methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to access logical containers created by other individuals. Additionally, the example methods and apparatus enable process control personnel to search for a process control resource to determine which logical containers include the resource. Process control personnel may use this information to classify the process control resource and\/or identify patterns regarding the resource. For example, a process control resource that is included within numerous logical containers for problematic devices may be flagged for inspection to determine if the resource should be replaced and\/or serviced. In this manner, the methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to use logical containers to classify and\/or identify resource functional patterns to improve operation of process control environments.","Further, the example methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to associate process control items (e.g., documents, process control resources, workflows, schedules, etc.) to process control resources within a logical container. For example, a process control operator may associate a safety document to a field device process control resource within a logical container. The operator associates the safety document to the field device by dragging-and-dropping an icon of the safety document to an icon of the field device resource within the logical container. Upon associating the safety document with the field device resource, the operator may access the safety document by selecting the field device resource. The example methods and apparatus described herein may then prompt the operator to determine if other resources included within the same logical container are to be associated with the safety document.","In some examples, the example methods and apparatus described herein display process control resources of selected logical containers within a pictorial representation of a process control environment, plant, and\/or area. Each of the process control resources may include location information that the example methods and apparatus use to determine a corresponding location on the pictorial representation. A pictorial representation may include a picture and\/or photograph of a process control area. Additionally, a pictorial and\/or graphical representation may include a picture, a diagram, a schematic, a layout, a rendering, a map, and\/or a photograph.","The example methods and apparatus display icons representative of process control resources in proximity to locations of the resources on the pictorial representation. In some instances, process control personnel may select a logical container to view locations of associated process control resources within a pictorial representation. In this manner, the example methods and apparatus described herein enable process control personnel to view locations of process control resources within a pictured area. Some process control personnel may use the pictured location information to physically locate process control resources. In other examples, process control personnel may use the pictured location information to determine which process control resources should be managed based on conditions in certain areas of a process control system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","100","104","102","100","104","100","102","102","104","102","100"]},"The example device manager  is communicatively coupled to the workstation  and a process control system  via a local area network (LAN) . The LAN  may be implemented using any communication medium and\/or protocol. For example, the LAN  may be based on a hardwired or wireless Ethernet communication scheme. However, any other suitable communication medium and protocol could be used. Furthermore, although the LAN  is shown, more than one LAN and appropriate communication hardware within the process control environment  may be used to provide redundant communication paths between the workstation  and other workstations (not shown).","The example workstation  of  may include any computing device such as a personal computer, a tablet computer, a laptop, a server, a handheld device, a portable device, a wireless device, a smartphone, etc. The workstation  may be implemented using any suitable computer system or processing system (e.g., the processor system P of ). For example, the workstation  could be implemented using a single processor personal computer, single or multi-processor workstations, etc.","The example process control system  includes a controller , an I\/O card , and field devices  (e.g., process control resources). The controller  and\/or the I\/O card  are communicatively coupled to the field devices  via a communication path . The example communication path  may conform to any wired and\/or wireless process control communication protocol including, for example, Foundation Fieldbus\u2122, Hart\u00ae, and\/or Profibus\u00ae.","The example controller  uses control routines to calculate process data based on outputs from the field devices  for applications including, for example, monitoring applications, alarm management applications, process trending and\/or history applications, diagnostic applications, batch processing and\/or campaign management applications, statistical applications, streaming video applications, advanced control applications, safety instrumented applications, event applications, asset management applications, etc. The controller  forwards process data to the workstation  and\/or any process control databases, servers, and\/or processors (not shown) at periodic intervals and\/or upon processing or generating the process data. The process data transmitted by the controller  may include process control values, data values, alarm information, text, block mode element status information, diagnostic information, error messages, parameters, events, and\/or device identifiers.","The example I\/O card  (e.g., one or more I\/O cards) receives data from the field devices  and converts the data into communications capable of being processed by the example controller . Likewise, the I\/O card  may convert data or communications from the controller  into a data format capable of being processed by the field devices .","The example process control system  of  may include any type of manufacturing facility, process facility, automation facility, safety instrumented facility, and\/or any other type of process control structure or system. In some examples, the process control system  may include multiple facilities located at different locations within the process control environment . In other examples, the process control system  of  may include additional controllers and\/or I\/O cards. Additionally, the process control system  may include additional or fewer field devices.","The example field devices  are components that monitor, analyze, and manage one or more processes. The field devices  may include, for example, valves, pumps, fans, heaters, coolers, and\/or mixers to control a process. Additionally, the field devices  may include measurement or monitoring devices such as, for example, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, concentration sensors, fluid level meters, flow meters, and\/or vapor sensors to measure portions of a process. Generally, the field devices  receive instructions from the controller  via the communication path  to execute specified operations (e.g., measure a pressure of a fluid). The example field devices  use instructions from the controller  to cause a change to processes implemented and\/or controlled by the field devices  (e.g., regulate the pressure of the fluid). The field devices  measure process data, environmental data, and\/or input device data and transmit the measured data via the communication path  to the controller  as process data.","In the example of , the process control environment  includes additional process control systems  and  that may be physically separate from the process control system . For example, the process control systems  and  could be separate areas. The example process control systems  and  include respective controllers  and  that are communicatively coupled to I\/O cards and field devices (not shown). The example device manager  and\/or other process control computing devices are communicatively coupled to the process control systems  and  via the LAN . In this manner, the device manager  enables users (e.g., process control personnel) of the workstation  to access and\/or manage process control resources (e.g., the field devices , the controllers , , and , and the I\/O card ) regardless of a location of the resources.","The example workstation  displays process control applications via a user interface . The process control applications include asset management applications to enable process control personnel to view information associated with the field devices . The asset management applications may also display a pictorial and\/or graphical representation of the process control system . Additionally, the example user interface  enables process control personnel to interact and\/or manage the process control system  by providing graphical instrumentality (e.g., via the process control applications) that the personnel may select and\/or manipulate to cause the workstation  to send instructions to the controller .","The example device manager  of  provides an interface for process control personnel to view and manage process control resources within the process control environment . The example device manager  maintains logical containers of process control resources based on preferences of process control personnel. Additionally, the example device manager  manages and\/or provides access to information regarding process control resources including, calibration information, diagnostic information, physical location information, communication protocol information, manufacturer information, and\/or any other type of information that may be associated with a process control resource. In some instances, the information may include links to process data from, for example, the controller  and which is generated by a corresponding process control resource (e.g., the field devices ). The example device manager  accesses this information from, for example, a resource database .","The example controllers ,  and\/or  may store process data to the resource database . Additionally, process control personnel may store process control resource information to the resource database . While the resource database  is shown in , the process control environment  may include additional databases, servers, and\/or memories for storing process control resource information. Alternatively, the resource database  may be included within the workstation . The example resource database  may be implemented by Electronically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), Random Access Memory (RAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), and\/or any other type of memory.","The example device manager  may also provide a default hierarchal structure of process control resources based on locations and\/or connections of the resources. The hierarchical structure may be created based on the device manager  determining relationships among the process control resources and locations of the process control resources. For example, the device manager  may provide a first hierarchical level for the process control environment , a second hierarchical level for each of the process control systems , , and , a third hierarchical level for the controllers , , and , and a fourth hierarchical level for the field devices . Process control personnel may use this default hierarchical structure to select process control resources to add to logical containers. Alternatively, process control personnel may use the device manager  to search the resource database  for process control resources to add to logical containers.","The example device manager  of  also enables process control personnel to create logical containers based on common characteristics and\/or personal preferences. For example, process control personnel may create logical containers for process control resources that have similar issues, for assigned process control resources, favorite process control resources, etc. The device manager  partitions the example resource database  for each logical container. For each resource added to a logical container, the device manager  creates an entry within the logical container with an icon and\/or other identifying text to represent the added resource. The example device manager  then links the icon and\/or identifying text to the information associated with the resource within the resource database . In other words, the device manager  creates a shortcut in the logical container for each process control resource to process data and other process control resource information within the resource database . In some examples, the device manager  may store logical containers locally to the workstation  that link to corresponding process control resources within the resource database . In this manner, process control personnel can create multiple logical containers that reference the same process control resources.","The example device manager  of the illustrated example creates graphical and\/or pictorial representations of the process control environment  and\/or the process control systems , , and\/or  that include locations of process control resources. The device manager  then displays these pictorial and\/or graphical representations on, for example, the workstation  via the user interface . In some examples, a process control designer may create and\/or generate a picture, map, schematic, photograph, and\/or any other pictorial and\/or graphical representation of, for example, the process control system .","The example device manager  receives the pictorial representation and creates a grid and\/or coordinate mapping for the pictorial representation. In some instances, the grid and\/or coordinate mapping may be associated with global positioning system (GPS) coordinates and\/or latitude\/longitude coordinates. In other examples, the grid and\/or coordinate mapping may be associated with a location system designed, for example, for the process control environment . The example device manager  accesses the resource database  for location information associated with process control resources, and uses the location information to determine where icons and\/or other identifying information is to be displayed on the pictorial representation to accurately represent locations of the resources. The locations of the resources on the pictorial representation may be stored as a mapping file that can be executed in conjunction with logical containers when process control personnel access a pictorial and\/or graphical representation.","Additionally, the example device manager  of  uses logical containers in conjunction with mapping files to display selected process control resources on a pictorial representation. For example, an operator may select to view process control resources associated with a logical container called \u2018Favorites.\u2019 The example device manager  determines which process control resources are included within the \u2018Favorites\u2019 logical container and displays only those resources on the pictorial representation in accordance with the location information stored in the mapping file(s).","The example device manager  also enables process control personnel to associate process control items and\/or process control resources with other process control resources. For example, the device manager  may associate a document with all process control resources in a logical container that includes a resource that has been selected to be associated with the document. Further, the example device manager  enables process control personnel to search for and identify logical containers including certain process control resources. Process control personnel may then use the types of identified logical containers to identify properties and\/or operational patterns of the process control resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","102","200","102","102","108","102","200","102"]},"To provide an interface for process control personnel to create and\/or modify logical containers, the example device manager  of  includes a workstation interface . The example workstation interface  provides functionality for process control personnel to interact with logical containers and\/or process control resources via the device manager . In some examples, the workstation interface  may interface with an asset management application on the workstation  to receive instructions and\/or requests from process control personnel. In other examples, the workstation interface  may function as an application programming interface between asset management tools and\/or functions for managing logical containers and\/or process control resources. In yet other examples, the workstation interface  may host an application for process control personnel to access via the workstation  to view, create, and\/or modify process control resources within logical containers.","To manage process control resources and\/or logical containers, the example device manager  of  includes a container manager . The example container manager  receives selections of process control resources via the workstation interface  and associates those resources with requested logical containers. The container manager  may receive an indication of a logical container that is to receive process control resources by receiving an indicator and\/or a name of the logical container and names of the process control resources from the workstation interface . To select process control resources, process control personnel may search for the resources, navigate to the resources using a file browser, and\/or navigate to the resources through a hierarchical structure.","The example container manager  creates entries within a logical container for each assigned process control resource by storing an identifier of the resource in the logical container. In some examples, the identifier may include a name, identifying text, and\/or an icon representative of the process control resources. The container manager  may then search the resource database  via a database interface  for process control resource information that is to be linked to an entry. After locating process control resource information, the container manager  adds a link to the entry, thereby creating a shortcut between the process control resources and associated process control resource information (e.g., process data). The example container manager  may then transmit the logical container with the newly created process control resource entries to the database interface  for storage within the resource database . In this manner, the example container manager  enables process control personnel to locate process control resources using personally created logical containers without having to know or memorize a resource hierarchy of the process control system.","The example container manager  also enables process control personnel to create logical containers. To create a logical container, the container manager  prompts process control personnel, via the workstation interface , for a name of the container, an identifier for the container, a characteristic of the container, and\/or a directory location for the container. The directory location may indicate if the logical container is to be nested within another logical container or may indicate if the logical container is to be included within a relatively high level structure within, for example, an asset management tool.","A characteristic selected by process control personnel may be any feature, function, location, and\/or property of a process control resource including for example, a fault type, a history of common issues, a type of resource, a physical location, a user preference, a manufacturer, a calibration date, an installation date, and\/or a communication type. In some instances, process control personnel may create a logical container with a common characteristic of process control resources assigned to the personnel or, alternatively, resources of interest to the personnel. In this manner, the example container manager  enables process control personnel to organize process control resources based on preferences separate or distinct from how the resources are provisioned and\/or communicatively coupled.","After prompting process control personnel for information to create a logical container, the example container manager  partitions space within, for example, the resource database  for the logical container. The example container manager  uses the partitioned space for storing entries with identifiers of process control resources associated with the logical container. The container manager  also uses the partitioned space for storing information describing the logical container. In other examples, the container manager  may partition memory space within an asset management tool and\/or application for the logical container.","The example container manager  also manages logical containers by enabling process control personnel to modify which process control items and\/or resources are associated with resources within logical containers. A process control item may include any process control resource, document, and\/or process control information that may be assigned to process control resources. For example, the workstation interface  may receive an indication that a process control item was selected to be associated with (e.g., dragged-and-dropped onto) a process control resource within a logical container. The example container manager  identifies the logical container, the process control resource, and the process control item. The example container manager  then associates the process control item with the process control resource by including a link to the item within the entry for the process control resource. The example container manager  may then prompt the process control personnel to determine if the process control item is to be associated with the other process control resources in the logical container. Based on a response from the personnel, the container manager  may then associate the process control item with the other resources. In some instances, the process control personnel may select which of the process control resources within the logical container are to be associated with the item.","In some examples, the example container manager  associate a process control item with process control resources based on a type of the item. For example, the container manager  enables (e.g., associates) a document process control item to be selectable when process control personnel view a field device process control resource. In another example, the container manager  may assign (e.g., associate) a field device process control item to work schedules of engineer process control resources within a logical container. In another example, an alarm process control item assigned (e.g., associated) with a field device process control resource may be configured by the container manager  as an alarm on other resources within the logical container.","The example device manager  of  also includes a search engine  to process search requests from process control personnel via the workstation interface . The search requests instruct the search engine  to determine which logical containers include a specified process control resource. To identify logical containers, the example search engine  sends an instruction to the database interface  to retrieve logical containers from the resource database . The example search engine  then searches the logical containers for entries with identifiers that match the requested process control resource. The example search engine  then returns the search results to the workstation interface  for display via the user interface .","In some instances, the example search engine  may also analyze the search results to determine any patterns and\/or trends based on which logical containers include a process control resource. For example, the search engine  may determine that a field device resource is included within many logical containers labeled as \u2018Problem Devices,\u2019 \u2018Issues,\u2019 and \u2018Watch List.\u2019 Based on these labels, the search engine  may determine that the field device resource has frequent issues. The example search engine  may then flag the field device process control resource for an inspection and\/or repair. In other examples, the search engine  may determine that some logical containers are to include a process control resource and may prompt process control personnel to add the process control resource to relevant logical containers.","The example device manager  includes the example database interface  to store and\/or retrieve logical containers and\/or process control resource information from, for example, the resource database . The example database interface  may also provide an interface for the device manager  to access and search the resource database  for process control resources, logical containers, and\/or process control resource information. Further, the example database interface  may enable the device manager  to retrieve pictorial and\/or graphical representations of process control systems that may be stored in the resource database  and\/or any other server within, for example, the process control environment .","To associate locations of process control resources with a location of a pictorial and\/or graphical representation of a process control system, the example device manager  includes a location processor . The example location processor  receives a pictorial and\/or graphical representation from process control personnel via the workstation interface  or, alternatively, from the resource database . The pictorial representation may include a photograph of a process control system (e.g., the process control systems , , and\/or ). In other examples, the pictorial and\/or graphical representation may include a rendering, a map, a drawing, and\/or any other type of schematic of a process control system.","The example location processor  of  analyzes the pictorial representation and creates a grid and\/or coordinate system for the pictorial representation. In some examples, the location processor  may use GPS and\/or latitude\/longitude coordinates for the pictorial representation. In other examples, process control personnel may use a site-specific location coordinate system. In these examples, the location processor  applies the specific coordinate system to the pictorial representation.","The example location processor  accesses process control resource information from the resource database  to determine locations of process control resources. In some examples, the location of a process control resource is specified in a device description file and\/or other provisioning file when the resource is installed within a process control system. The example location processor uses this information to determine a corresponding location of the process control resource on the coordinate system of the pictorial and\/or graphical representation.","After determining where process control resources are located on a pictorial representation, the example location processor  selects a location on the pictorial representation in proximity to the determined location to display icons and\/or other identifying information associated with the resources. The example location processor  may then create a map file with entries for each of the process control resources that reference locations on the pictorial representation. The entries may also include links to corresponding process control resource information. For example, the location processor  may determine from a provisioning file that a field device process control resource is located at coordinates \u2018ab.cd\u2019 by \u2018yy.zz.\u2019 The location processor  identifies the \u2018ab.cd\u2019 by \u2018yy.zz\u2019 coordinates on the pictorial representation and stores in a map file where on the pictorial representation the process control resource is to be displayed.","The location processor  of the illustrated example also manages which process control resources are displayed on a pictorial and\/or graphical representation based on process control personnel selecting a logical container. For example, the location processor  may receive an identifier of a logical container requested by an operator via the workstation interface . The location processor  identifies the logical container in the request and accesses the resource database  via the database interface  for the logical container. The example location processor  determines which process control resources are included within the logical container and uses a map and\/or coordinate file to determine locations of those resources on a pictorial and\/or graphical representation. The example location processor  instructs a display processor  to display identifiers of the process control resources on the pictorial and\/or graphical representation. In this manner, process control personnel can select a logical container to view associated process control resources on a pictorial and\/or graphical representation without having to individually select which resources are to be displayed. Thus, the example location processor  may save process control personnel time by enabling the process control personnel to relatively quickly display locations of grouped resources on a pictorial representation.","To prepare process control resources for display, the example device manager  includes the display processor . The example display processor  receives instructions from the location processor  for displaying icons and\/or other identifying information associated with process control resources on a pictorial and\/or graphical representation. The example display processor  formats the icons and\/or identifying information into displayable data structures or objects that are readable by process control personnel. Further, the display processor  creates a display file that indicates which displayable information and\/or icons are to be displayed in which locations of a pictorial and\/or graphical representation.","For example, the display processor  may determine that 20 process control resources are to be displayed at one location. The example display processor  may consolidate the display of the 20 resources by creating a scrollable resource box that includes the 20 resources. The resource box may only obscures a portion of the graphical and\/or pictorial representation. In this manner, the display processor  ensures that process control resources are displayed on a pictorial and\/or graphical representation in a readable manner.","To display a pictorial and\/or graphical representation with process control resources, the example device manager  includes a renderer . The example renderer  receives a display file from the display processor  and renders the information within the user interface . The example renderer  may also display logical containers within a pictorial and\/or graphical representation or, alternatively, display logical containers within an asset management tool.","While the example device manager  has been illustrated in , one or more of the servers, platforms, interfaces, data structures, elements, processes and\/or devices illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, omitted, eliminated and\/or implemented in any way.

The example search panel  includes search fields to instruct the device manager  of  to search for a specified process control resource within logical containers (e.g., \u2018Search Container\u2019) and search for a specified process control resource within process control databases (e.g., \u2018Search Resource\u2019). In other examples, the search panel  may include additional or fewer functions.","The example logical container panel  of the illustrated example shows a device manager tool  that enables process control personnel to manage process control resources (e.g., assets).

The operator may specify that the logical containers - are to be displayed upon opening and\/or selecting the device manager tool . In other examples, the device manager tool  may include additional, fewer, and\/or different types of logical containers based on preferences of process control personnel.","Process control personnel may manage process control resources using the device manager tool  by selecting a desired process control resource to view information associated with that process control resource. For example, process control personnel may select the Sensor CH01 process control resource to cause the device manager  to display within the user interface  diagnostic information, calibration information, monitoring information, etc. associated with the Sensor CH01. Additionally, the user interface  may display a list of documents associated with the Sensor CH01 and\/or a list of process control personnel assigned to the Sensor CH01. In other examples, selecting the Sensor CH01 within the device manager tool  may cause the user interface  to display any process control application that includes the Sensor CH01.","In this example, the process control resources are listed using a text name of the resource and an icon representing a type of the resource. In other examples, the process control resources may be displayed using serial numbers associated with the resources. Alternatively, the process control resources may be displayed using names assigned by process control personnel.","In the example of , a process control user (e.g., an operator) creates the logical containers - based on preferences of the user. This example also shows that the process control user may group process control resources based on a common characteristic. For example, the user creates the Favorite Resources logical container  to include process control resources that the user may monitor frequently. The user creates the Problematic Devices logical container  for process control resources that the user has to troubleshoot and\/or repair frequently. Additionally, the user creates the My Device Watch List logical container  for process control resources that are assigned to an area of control of the user.","The example in  shows that logical containers (e.g., the logical containers -) may include field device process control resources in addition to documents and personnel.
