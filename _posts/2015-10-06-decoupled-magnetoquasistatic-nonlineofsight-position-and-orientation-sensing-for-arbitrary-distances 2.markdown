title: Decoupled magnetoquasistatic non-line-of-sight position and orientation sensing for arbitrary distances
abstract: Methods and systems for non-line-of-sight positioning are disclosed for arbitrarily short to long ranges, where positioning is achieved using a single anchor not requiring tri-/multi-lateration or tri-/multi-angulation. Magnetoquasistatic fields can be used to determine position and orientation of a device in two or three dimensions. Two or three axis coils can be used in receivers and transmitters. The magnetoquasistatic equations are solved in different scenarios, taking into consideration the image signals originating from the interaction between the fields and ground/earth.

These systems have reduced accuracy in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments due to propagation losses, delays, or multi-path effects, see for example Refs. [4, 6, 7]. In contrast, magnetoquasistatic (MQS) fields are not significantly disturbed and can offer accurate radiolocation in NLoS environments, see Ref. [3]. Magnetoquasistatic fields are a class of electromagnetic fields in which a slowly oscillating magnetic field is dominant. A magnetoquasistatic field is typically generated by low-frequency induction from a magnetic dipole or a current loop or coil. In the past, MQS systems using frequencies of up to a few kiloHertz were developed for above ground positioning, see Ref. [8, 9]. These techniques did not account for induced eddy-currents in the ground, which limited the range of operation to a few meters above the ground. However, this simplification in the technology did permit a decoupled solution for position and orientation, see Ref. [9]. The decoupling of position and orientation sensing is important in magnetoquasistatic systems to provide linear unambiguous solutions and also for low-latency or fast solution times.","The solutions are decoupled when both the position and orientation of an object can be determined through equations that are not coupled and can be solved separately and independently. Long-range MQS positioning above ground was recently demonstrated using frequencies of a few-hundred kiloHertz and by accounting for the induced eddy-currents in the ground, see Ref [3]. However, the strong ground effects did not permit a decoupled solution for range and orientation of the device to be radiolocated, and instead required solution of non-linear coupling equations. Due to use of the non-linear field coupling equations, see Ref. [3], previous attempts to extend the long-range MQS technique to 2D and 3D have resulted in solutions that exhibit large errors (1-3 m), which are strongly varying as a function of the orientation and position of the transmitter and receivers, see Ref. [2]. Furthermore, the complexity in the non-linear solution space impedes the ability to converge to a correct solution, or to solve in real-time. Attempts to use orthogonal fields to aid the non-linear convergence has resulted in slight improvements in accuracies at the expense of significantly more complicated algorithms with high computational complexity, see Ref [1].","The present disclosure describes a long-range MQS technique to accurately determine the orientation-invariant range and range-invariant orientation of a device above ground. To achieve this, the non-linear field equations describing the coupling, which includes ground effects, are decoupled into range and orientation field equations that can be directly inverted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["105","110","115"]},"The vector magnetic field of an electrically-small coil driven by a current is given by (see Ref.

[5]) when slightly higher accuracy is needed at \u03c1\u2248H. However, the higher-order images provide diminished returns due to further depths.","The description of the voltage sensed at the receiver given in Eq. (4) is simpler than that used in previous documents, see Refs. [2, 3]. However, it is still non-linear, as the orientation of the transmitter, orientation of the receiver, and range functions are strongly coupled. Previous attempts to extend Eq. (2) to 2D and 3D (see Ref [2]) have resulted in large errors (1-3 m), which are also strongly dependent on the orientation and position of the devices. The non-linear solution space is also complex and often prevents convergence to a correct solution or any real-time solution.","To solve this problem, it can be noted that Eq. (4) has a similar form to the traditional free-space magnetoquasistatic (MQS) coupling equation, and thus can be decoupled in a related manner to that in short-range MQS techniques, see Ref. [9].

The experiment was conducted on the rooftop of a long building at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus. The setup is shown in . A tape measure and orientation table were used to provide range and orientation ground truth for error analysis. In this exemplary system, each axis of the transmitter and receiver consisted of about 50-turns of 28 AWG magnet wire wound in a closely spaced configuration around a square outline with a side of about 20 cm. Both transmit and receive coils were co-located at a height of about 1.5 m. The inserts of  (, ) shows the transmitter and receiver block diagrams. Two direct digital synthesized (DDS) sources are used to generate tones at 198 kHz and 232 kHz each. The output tone of each DDS is amplified using a class-AB amplifier design consisting of a LM386 audio amplifier chip-set from Texas Instruments (TI). The output of each amplifier drives a resonant capacitor network and coil designed to resonate at the center frequency of the tones. The emitted magnetic field of transmitter coil-1 at about 198 kHz, and of coil-2 at about 232 kHz, induces a current in both coils of the receiver. To permit detection of both tones in each coil and to maintain simplicity in the RF design, a digitally controlled switch circuitry was used to switch between coils of the receiver. The output of the switch was amplified using a two-stage Norton amplifier (Z10043A and Z10047A) from Clifton Laboratories. The amplified signals were digitized using a \u00b10.1 V, 16-bit 2MS\/s analog-to-digital convertor (ADC) within the USB-6361 X-Series Data Acquisition system from National Instruments. The USB-6361 X-Series Data Acquisition was also used to set the digital state of the RF switch. Data was streamed to a PC and processed in Matlab by Mathworks. Unknown gain\/losses in each channel of the transmitter and receiver were measured through coupling measurements at very short ranges of about 2 m, to reduce effects of secondary fields that would distort the calibrations.","The digital time-domain signals of about 0.1 s in length captured by the ADC were sent to the PC and converted using a Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm into the frequency domain. The peak power found close to 198 kHz and 232 kHz were captured and calibrated using gain measurements described previously. By selecting the switch digitally, the tones were captured in alternating fashion between both receive coils. The measurements during one round contained power of each tone at both receiver coils. The captured data from the two receiver coils were distinguished by digital switch selection. Since power varies linearly with the voltage squared, all 2\u00d72 or 4 power measurements were summed within each round. The total summed power has the form of Fin Eq. (9), but requires a calibration to remove the unknown gain, b. This is done through a measurement at 18.3 m (60 ft). To solve for the ground conductivity and a within r a measurement of Fwas repeated at 10 m and used to minimize for a, from which a ground conductivity of 0.45 S\/m was found for the rooftop. Next, a model of the geometric range function squared ([1\/r+1\/r]) was obtained numerically as a function of radial distance, \u03c1. The measured total power after calibrating Fwas then inverted based on this model to obtain the radial range, \u03c1, between the transmitter and receiver.","To obtain the orientation of the transmitter, the total summed power of both tones at one receiver was divided by the total summed power of both tones at the second receiver. This ratio had the exact form of Fin Eq. (10) and did not require any further calibration. Using Eq. (11), the ratio given by Fwas converted into the orientation of the transmitter.","The above system and methodology are intended as an example. Other systems with different configurations may also be employed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"To study the orientation-invariant ranging accuracy, the radial range, \u03c1, of the transmitter was varied from 12.2 m (40 ft) to 42.7 m (140 ft) at steps of 10 ft (3.048 m), while attempting to maintain an orientation of \u03c6=90\u00b0. The total power of the orientation-invariant range function, F, is shown in  () to match well with the geometric range function squared ([1\/r+1\/r]) from complex image theory.

Therefore, the technique described above using magnetoquasistatic fields has been shown to enable accurate ranging in non-line-of-sight environments. The system, in the embodiments above, was optimized for measurements close to the 2D xy-plane. Measurements showed peak orientation-invariant ranging errors of 0.2-0.4 m for a range of up to over 40 m. The peak range-invariant orientation errors found were 1-7\u00b0.","In the following, the technique described above using magnetoquasistatic fields is expanded to include decoupling of azimuthal direction of a mobile device. The results are azimuthal direction sensing for long-range magnetoquasistatic systems with a peak error of about 6\u00b0, independent and invariant of the range or orientation of the mobile device. In the following, two-dimensional (2D) positioning is demonstrated by combining the decoupled range and azimuth-direction solutions.","As discussed above, the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) positioning problem is important in both civilian and military applications. Existing techniques that utilize high-frequency propagating radio waves suffer in NLoS use (for example, see Refs. [4, 6-7]).","Magnetoquasistatic (MQS) fields are weakly perturbed by lossy-dielectrics, and thus beneficial when used in NLoS positioning. Direction finding systems require to be progressively moved closer to the transmitter, and therefore cannot provide long range positioning, see Ref. [10]. Short-range MQS systems use a frequency of a few kilohertz to avoid ground effects, see Refs. [8, 9]. However, the use of very low frequency and increased ground effects with range, limits their maximum operation range to a few meters. To enable long-range NLoS sensing, a MQS technique was developed to account for ground effects and by using a higher-frequency (300-400 kHz) to obtain a range of up to about 50 m, see Ref. [3]. The long-range MQS technique enabled ranging with errors of 0.12-0.7 m for ranges up to 40 m, see Ref [3], and was not sensitive to the LoS blockage, see Ref. [1]. However, due to the non-linear position-orientation coupling and ground effects, the technique can have some limitations when extended to 2D or 3D, resulting in errors which are dependent on positions, orientations, and the non-linear solution convergence, see Ref. [2].","As described above in the present disclosure, and as seen from Ref [11], a long-range MQS technique has been described to decouple the range and orientation of the device to be located. The technique can account for ground effects, obtaining decoupled solutions with low error over long ranges.

[11]. The inverted location of the transmitter, relative to the receiver location, can also be readily converted into Cartesian coordinates using the coordinate conversions x=\u03c1cos \u03c6and y=\u03c1sin \u03c6.","To study the accuracy of the decoupled azimuth-direction sensing, a two-axis orthogonal transmit and receive system was developed as shown in , with rotation-tables at their bases to allow for rotations. At the transmitter (), two direct digital synthesized (DDS) sources were used with amplifiers, and fed to resonant coils for increased signal-to-noise. The field transmitted by each axis of the transmitter was a tone at 198 kHz and 232 kHz, respectively. Both tones are detected at each receiver () coil. A switch is used to selectively sense the signal at the receiver coils, which is then amplified and digitized. The setup is described more in details in the present disclosure, above.","To simplify the experiments for azimuth-direction sensing of the transmitter, the transmitter's orientation, \u03c6, its radial range, \u03c1, and its location a, are fixed, and the orientation of the receiver, \u03c6is varied. As described previously and illustrated in , the orientation \u03c6describes the angle between {circumflex over (\u03c1)} and {circumflex over (n)}, which also describes the azimuth-direction of the transmitter relative to the azimuth-reference ({circumflex over (\u03c1)} when aligned to {circumflex over (n)}direction) if the receiver's position and orientation is fixed. To characterize the technique and inversion results, some measurements were taken and compared to the theoretical predictions.","First, the azimuth-direction sensing accuracy for the transmitter at a fix range, \u03c1, and orientation, \u03c6, were studied. The transmitter was placed at a radial range of 10 m from the receiver system. The locations of both the transmitter and receiver were fixed, and the transmitter's orientation, \u03c6, was set to 0\u00b0. To simulate the azimuth-direction, the receiver's orientation, \u03c6, was rotated from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 at steps of 10\u00b0 . The measured Fat each measurement step is obtained by summing the calibrated measured power from both transmitters at receiver , and dividing this by the summed powers of both transmitters measured at receiver , as described by Eqs. (14)-(16). The measured result for Fis compared to the expected theoretical value in  ().  illustrates measurements of the azimuth-direction function compared to theory for variation in azimuth-direction of the transmitter (). The inverted azimuth-direction is also compared to the ground truth (), with the related error ().","Inverting the measured Ffor azimuth-direction, \u03c6, resulted in close agreement with the expected direction referenced through the receiver rotation table (). The difference between the expected azimuth-direction from the rotation table and the inverted solution is the apparent azimuth-direction error. This is shown in () as a function of the azimuth-direction, where the error is typically less than 2\u00b0, except when close to the 0\u00b0 azimuth-direction.","For this first experiment, the decoupled range inversion was also examined using the technique described above in the present disclosure as well as in Ref [11] to confirm that it remains invariant of the azimuth-direction. This azimuth-direction invariant ranging is important to permit a fully decoupled 2D solution. From the same data collected, the range function, F, can be calculated, as described in the present disclosure as well as in Ref [11]. A single calibration measurement was taken at 60 ft. (18.29 m) to remove unknown gains in the system, as described in the present disclosure as well as in Ref. [11]. The result for the measured Fcompared to theory is shown in  () as a function of the variation in azimuth-direction. The inverted range using the technique described above in the present disclosure as well as in Ref. [11], is found and shown in (), while () gives the error in range. The range error is found to be less than about 14 cm.","For the second experiment, the accuracy of the technique at a few different ranges was studied by locating the fixed-orientation (fixed \u03c6) transmitter at distances, \u03c1, of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m. The azimuth-direction is varied from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 at steps of 10\u00b0 for a transmitter range of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m.  () shows the resulting azimuth-direction error found using the same approach described above. The invariance of the ranging solution was also examined at the various ranges. The result for this range error is shown in (). The peak azimuth-direction error found was approximately 6\u00b0, whereas the peak range error found was about 17 cm.","For the third experiment, the inversions due to various transmitter orientations, \u03c6, was studied instead. In this experiment, the transmitter range, \u03c1, was fixed at 20 m, but the experiment was repeated for transmit orientations, \u03c6, of 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0. At each transmit orientation, \u03c6, the azimuth-direction, \u03c6, was varied from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 at steps of 10\u00b0.  () shows the result for azimuth-direction error as a function of azimuth-direction for the various transmitter orientations. The azimuth-direction error is shown to be below about 6\u00b0 in all cases measured.  () shows the result for range error as a function of azimuth-direction for the various transmitter orientations at 20 m. The peak range error was about 0.3 m.","To provide a summary of the experimental results described above, with application to 2D location sensing,  shows the experimental results summarized in Cartesian coordinates. The receiver is located at the origin () of the coordinate system. Circles () denote the ground truth of the measurements. For measurements conducted at a range of 10 m and 30 m, the transmitter orientation, \u03c6, was fixed at 0\u00b0. Measurements conducted at a range of 20 m included transmitter orientations, \u03c6, of 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0, as previously described.","As described above, in some embodiments the long-range MQS positioning technique is extended to provide decoupled azimuth-direction sensing that is invariant of the range or orientation of the transmitter, with a peak error of 6\u00b0. The range inversions were invariant of the azimuth-direction and orientation of the transmitter, with a peak error of 0.3 m. The technique enables decoupled 2D MQS positioning.","In the following section, measurements of the magnetoquasistatic coupling between a co-polarized vertical emitting and receiving coil, both located above earth, are compared to calculations using complex image theory and the exact integral solutions along a direction perpendicular to the surface normal axes of the loops.

The above concludes the derivations for the MQS field theory. The solutions derived in Eqs. (28) and (32) are the foundations of the following section, where the positioning framework is presented.","The orthogonality relations of the transmitter moments are always preserved under any arbitrary rotations, due to the use of orthogonal coils on the transmitter, orthogonal magnetic moments {circumflex over (m)}, {circumflex over (m)}, and {circumflex over (m)}, and field-magnitude only sensing of in the receive coils. As discussed above, it can be assumed that m, fil, and inare all mathematically similar, or in other words that these quantities have the same gains (or calibrated gains) as well as close center frequencies. With this condition, the preservation of orthogonality implies that under any arbitrary rotation there will be two horizontal magnetic moments, which are orthogonal to each other and parallel to the horizontal plane, and one vertical magnetic moment parallel to the vertical plane. It is then possible to obtain the solutions to the elevation-angle direction of the transmitter, and then the azimuth-angle direction of the transmitter. In a first step, the transmitter and receiver centric F equations are defined for the 3D case, which is related to the 2D case, as described above and in Refs. [11,14], where x=1,2,3, referring to each transmitter moment:\n\n\u2003\u2003(24)\n\n.\n","For 3D positioning, in some embodiments it is possible to focus on the receiver-centric F. Under any rotations, as described above, there will be two orthogonal horizontal transmitter magnetic moments. These moments can be denoted as located along {circumflex over (m)}and {circumflex over (m)}, which are orthogonal to each other, but can assume any arbitrary orientation from P. Some orientations for this problem can be defined as follows (and also as in

(69) is not sensitive to Fwhen C\u21920 or cos \u03c6>0, which is also on the 2D x-y plane or for \u03c6\u2192\u03c0\/2. The reason for this difficulty is that the 1\/,is used, which becomes a null field on the 2D x-y plane for long-distances due to multiplication with C\u2248\u03c1z\/r, caused by the boundary conditions. In addition, it is not possible to use the ratio conventions used in Ref [11] because the magnetic moment is no longer on a fixed 2D plane.

algorithm is straightforward. By solving Eqs. (71) and then Eq. (73), it is possible to find the azimuth orientation and elevation orientation the transmitter moment m. It is possible to repeat similar calculations to obtain Fand Ffor transmitter moment m, from which it is possible to solve for \u03c6and \u03b8, and then Fand Ffor transmitter moment m. In turn, it is then possible to solve for \u03c6and \u03b8. With these solutions, the full arbitrary 3D orientation of the mobile transmitter system is known.","The current closed-form solutions for 3D orientation sensing, used with the closed-form solutions for 3D position sensing derived in Ref. [15], completes the problem of 3D position and orientation sensing using magnetoquasistatic fields for short to long ranges using complex image theory. The forms derived allow use of complex image theory or higher order corrections to complex image theory, as noted in Ref [11], and permit closed-form solutions for 3D position and orientation sensing of a mobile device using a single fixed sensor with 3-axis orthogonal coils.","In some embodiments of the present disclosure, an advantage of the methods described herein is the ability to use a single sensor instead of multiple sensors, to carry out the positioning through quasistatic magnetic fields. Another advantage is the decoupling of the equations for the orientation and the position, therefore having decoupled errors in orientation and position. In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure can be carried out by having a receiver or a transmitter with a known location. This can mean that the receiver or transmitter have a fixed location, or they may be moving in a known way, therefore still having a known location. In embodiments with two or three axis, implemented, for example, with two or three orthogonal coils, each coil can sense a signal from the two or three coils in the transmitter. In other words, a first receiver coil can independently sense two or three independent signals from each of the two or three transmitting coils. Several methods can be employed to maintain the independence between the two or three signals. For example, a different frequency may be used for each of the three orthogonal coils, or multiplexing may be used. Multiplexing can comprise sending signals for each direction at a different time, according to a specified sequence. Other methods to differentiate between the three signals can also be implemented, as understood by the person of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the methods described in the present disclosure decouple the horizontal and vertical components of the ground fields.","The methods and systems described in the present disclosure may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware or any combination thereof. Features described as blocks, modules or components may be implemented together (e.g., in a logic device such as an integrated logic device) or separately (e.g., as separate connected logic devices). The software portion of the methods of the present disclosure may comprise a computer-readable medium which comprises instructions that, when executed, perform, at least in part, the described methods. The computer-readable medium may comprise, for example, a random access memory (RAM) and\/or a read-only memory (ROM). The instructions may be executed by a processor (e.g., a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable logic array (FPGA), a graphic processing unit (GPU) or a general purpose GPU).","A number of embodiments of the disclosure have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.","The examples set forth above are provided to those of ordinary skill in the art as a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the embodiments of the disclosure, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventor\/inventors regard as their disclosure.","Modifications of the above-described modes for carrying out the methods and systems herein disclosed that are obvious to persons of skill in the art are intended to be within the scope of the following claims. All patents and publications mentioned in the specification are indicative of the levels of skill of those skilled in the art to which the disclosure pertains. All references cited in this disclosure are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference had been incorporated by reference in its entirety individually.","It is to be understood that the disclosure is not limited to particular methods or systems, which can, of course, vary.
