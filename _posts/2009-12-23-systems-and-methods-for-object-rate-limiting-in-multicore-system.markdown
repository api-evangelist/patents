In particular, the present application relates to systems and methods for object rate limiting in a multi-core system.","A typical enterprise can provide many users access to servers via a networked communication system. With the explosion of web content, such as music and video media, the servers can be subjected to many service requests deliver a wide range of different objects of web content. Some requested objects can be large, and some can be small. Accordingly, certain objects can consume more network resources and bandwidth than other objects. In some cases, a user can request an object that should be delivered with a higher priority than another object requested. For example, in an enterprise, access to certain objects might be more important to operations than other objects, e.g., an enterprise might assign content related to investment and funding information a higher priority than web content related to the history of the enterprise, or to non-business related content. In some cases, users of the enterprise network might request objects that are not business related, and the requests for these types of objects can impact the delivery of objects assigned higher priority. With a wide range of users, a high volume of user requests, and different types of objects, it is challenging to manage users access to objects of web content.","The present application is directed towards controlling access and\/or a rate of request to a web resource in a network. In particular, an intermediary device is disposed in a network between a plurality of clients and a plurality of servers. The intermediary device can receive requests for one or more web resources from a plurality of clients and forward the requests to one or a plurality of servers, or service the requests from a copy of the web resource maintained by the intermediary. In some embodiments, the intermediary device comprises multiple cores handling requests from clients for certain web resources. One core of the intermediary device can be a designated owner of a particular resource requested by a client, and can monitor a rate of requests for the resource. The owner core can block or delay requests for the resource when the owner core identifies that a limit for the resource has been exceeded.","A method for managing a rate of requests for an object transmitted between a server and one or more clients via a multi-core intermediary device is disclosed. In certain embodiments, a portion of the plurality of cores have packet processing engines in operation thereon configured to handle service requests from a plurality of clients for a plurality of web resources or objects provided by a plurality of servers. The method can be executed on the appliance to manage or control a rate of request for a resource or object transmitted between a server and one or more clients. In various embodiments, the method comprises a step of receiving, by a first packet processing engine executing on a first core of a plurality of cores of an intermediary device deployed between a plurality of clients and one or more servers, a request from a client for a first object or resource of a plurality of objects or resources from a server. The method can further include designating, by the intermediary device, the first core as an owner core of the first object, and establishing, by the first packet processing engine, a location in shared memory accessible by the plurality of cores for storing a rate-related counter for the first object. The shared memory can be a global cache or main memory. The method can further comprise receiving, by a second packet processing engine executing on a second core of the plurality of cores, a second request for the first object, and receiving, by the second packet processing engine from the first packet processing engine, the location in shared memory of the rate-related counter. In various embodiments, the method includes determining, by the second packet processing engine via the rate-related counter obtained from the location in shared memory, whether or not a rate limit for the first object has been reached. Systems and apparatuses on which various embodiments of the method can be executed are also disclosed.","The features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which like reference characters identify corresponding elements throughout.

Systems and Methods for Providing a Multi-Core Architecture","In accordance with Moore's Law, the number of transistors that may be placed on an integrated circuit may double approximately every two years. However, CPU speed increases may reach plateaus, for example CPU speed has been around 3.5-4 GHz range since 2005. In some cases, CPU manufacturers may not rely on CPU speed increases to gain additional performance. Some CPU manufacturers may add additional cores to their processors to provide additional performance. Products, such as those of software and networking vendors, that rely on CPUs for performance gains may improve their performance by leveraging these multi-core CPUs. The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and\/or rewritten to take advantage of a multi-threaded, parallel architecture or otherwise a multi-core architecture.","A multi-core architecture of the appliance , referred to as nCore or multi-core technology, allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi-core CPUs.

In some embodiments, this provides up to a 7\u00d7 increase in performance and scalability.","Illustrated in  are some embodiments of work, task, load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme, such as functional parallelism, data parallelism or flow-based data parallelism. In brief overview,  illustrates embodiments of a multi-core system such as an appliance \u2032 with n-cores, a total of cores numbers  through N. In one embodiment, work, load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A, a second core B, a third core C, a fourth core D, a fifth core E, a sixth core F, a seventh core G, and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N (hereinafter referred to collectively as cores .) There may be multiple VIPs  each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines  each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different, varying or similar work load or performance level  across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach, each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine, a VIP  or appliance . In a data parallelism approach, data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card (NIC) or VIP  receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach, processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.","In further detail to , in some embodiments, load, work or network traffic can be distributed among cores  according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments, a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach, the functions to be performed by the multi-core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments, functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases, different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.","In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to functional parallelism , can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input\/output management (NW I\/O) A, secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol (TCP) functions C. This may lead to a work, performance or computing load  based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to data parallelism , can comprise distributing an amount of work  based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to flow-based data parallelism , can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A-N on each core may be similar, substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.","In the case of the functional parallelism approach, each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example, core  may perform network I\/O processing for the appliance \u2032 while core  performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise, core  may perform SSL offloading while core  may perform layer  or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and\/or described in conjunction with . In this the approach, the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse-grained or fine-grained manner. In some cases, as illustrated in , division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .","In the case of the functional parallelism approach, each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine of the appliance. For example, core  may perform network I\/O processing for the appliance \u2032 while core  performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise, core  may perform SSL offloading while core  may perform layer  or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function.

In this the approach, the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse-grained or fine-grained manner. In some cases, as illustrated in  division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.","The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example,  illustrates a first core, Core  A, processing applications and processes associated with network I\/O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I\/O, in some embodiments, can be associated with a particular port number. Thus, outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I\/O A will be directed towards Core  A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I\/O port. Similarly, Core  B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core  D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.","While  illustrates functions such as network I\/O, SSL and TCP, other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example, any of the functions described in conjunction with  may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases, a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments, each core  can handle a particular functionality such that each core  can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example, Core  B may handle SSL offloading while Core  D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.","In other embodiments, work, load or network traffic may be distributed among cores  according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments, data parallelism may be achieved in a multi-core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments, a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments, different threads or instructions control the operation, but may execute the same code. In some embodiments, data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine, vServers (VIPs) A-C, network interface cards (NIC) D-E and\/or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example, each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different, varying or substantially the same amount of data, and as a result may have varying, different or relatively the same amount of load .","In the case of a data parallelism approach, the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs, NICs and\/or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches, the work of the multi-core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example, each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches, the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example, network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases, a core may process data from multiple NICs.","While  illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core , as is the case for VIP A, VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments, a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast, one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core  may include that core  to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments, each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments, each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments, each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.","Like vServers, NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments, NICs can be connected to one or more cores  such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets, a particular core  handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment, a single NIC can be associated with a single core , as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments, one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments, a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments, load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores  such that each core  processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core  associated with a NIC may process all functions and\/or data associated with that particular NIC.","While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency, in some embodiments, this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads  of .","In some embodiments, load, work or network traffic can be distributed among cores  based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches, the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example, network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases, the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments, the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic, such as a transaction, a request\/response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments, data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance \u2032 may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.","In flow-based data parallelism , distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data, such as request\/response pairings, transactions, sessions, connections or application communications. For example, network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases, the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core  carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load, data or network traffic.","In some embodiments, the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic, such as a transaction, a request\/response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments, data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance \u2032 may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment, data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction, in some embodiments, can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example, Core  A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server, therefore the load A on Core  A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core  A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core  A.","While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions, in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments, the appliance  can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core  having the least amount of load. For example, the appliance  could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core  A because the load A on Core  is less than the load B-N on the rest of the cores B-N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core  A, the amount of load A on Core  A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance  intercepts a second data packet, the appliance  will allocate the load to Core  D because Core  D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can, in some embodiments, ensure that the load A-N distributed to each core  remains substantially equal.","In other embodiments, load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above-mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per\/packet basis. In other embodiments, load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10, 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core  having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core  can be a number determined by an application, user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments, load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core  for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments, packets can be distributed to a particular core  for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user, program, system, administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses, data packets are transmitted to a different core  for the predetermined period of time.","Flow-based data parallelism methods for distributing work, load or network traffic among the one or more cores  can comprise any combination of the above-mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance , by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores , such as the packet engine, or by any application, program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .","The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in  can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism , data parallelism , flow-based data parallelism  or any portions thereof. In some cases, the multi-core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.","Illustrated in  is an embodiment of a multi-core system , which may be any type and form of one or more systems, appliances, devices or components. This system , in some embodiments, can be included within an appliance  having one or more processing cores A-N. The system  can further include one or more packet engines (PE) or packet processing engines (PPE) A-N communicating with a memory bus .

For example, should a packet engine  be associated with a first user, that packet engine  will process and operate on packets generated by the first user, or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly, the packet engine  may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine  can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.","In some instances, the packet engine(s) A-N can be configured to carry out any of the functional and\/or data parallelism schemes illustrated in .

Each core A-N, in one embodiment, can be associated with a particular packet engine  such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment, require that each packet engine A-N associated with a core  communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A-N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load.

Policy  can include any functionality to modify the throttling modes in order for the throttling modes to monitor, block, allow, delay or phase over a period of time any requests or objects being transmitted between a client  and server  via the appliance .","Rate threshold  can be any value, signal, variable or a function identifying an amount of objects or requests for objects permitted to traverse via the appliance  within a predetermined amount of time. In some embodiments, rate threshold  is any threshold value for the number of requests below which requests or objects received by the appliance  are not to be interrupted. In other embodiments, rate threshold  is any value, user input, signal from a network entity or a function identifying a threshold value for the number of requests above which requests or objects received by the appliance  are not to be interrupted. When the requests or objects are determined as not to be interrupted, the appliance  may simply forward the requests or objects to their intended destinations. In some embodiments, rate threshold  is a number of requests allowed to traverse the appliance  within a predetermined time period, such as the threshold period . In some embodiments, rate threshold  is a value or a number. In some embodiments, rate threshold  is an array of number or values. Rate threshold  can identify a threshold of allowable transmissions of requests or objects over any time interval. Rate threshold  can identify a threshold for allowable rate of transmission in terms of a number of kilobytes per second, megabytes per second, objects per second or requests of objects per second to be transmitted within any time interval. In some embodiments, rate threshold  identifies a threshold value for an amount of objects, requests, data packets, megabytes, gigabytes, applications, sessions, webpages, or specific amounts of data to be transmitted between the client  and server  over a predetermined period of time.","Threshold period  can be a duration of time or a time interval having any value. Threshold period  can be any period of time, time duration or time interval within which an amount of requests not exceeding the rate threshold  is allowed to be transmitted by the rate throttler  without interruptions. In some embodiments, threshold period  is any period of time, time duration or time interval within which an amount of requests exceeding the rate threshold  is allowed to be transmitted by the rate throttler  without interruptions. In some embodiments, threshold period  is a predetermined amount of time, such as a millisecond, second, minute, hour, month or a year. In some embodiments, threshold period  is any period of time within which a specific amount of requests or objects is allowed to traverse the appliance . Rate throttler  can block the transmission of a request received by the appliance  from reaching the intended destination if the request exceeds the rate threshold  within the time period specified by the threshold period . Threshold period  can be a set amount of time or a varying amount of time. Threshold period  can be modified by the policy  or the policy engine  upon the request of the user via user criteria . Threshold period  can be a period of time set upon encountering a specific request for object, instruction or a command from a client . In some embodiments, threshold period  is a time period set by the policy  or the throttling mode for regulating the flow of requests or objects between the client  and server  and traversing appliance .","Bursty mode  can be any throttling mode of operation of the rate throttler  which allows the client to exhaust a quota for transmission per a selected time period at any time within the time period. In some embodiments, bursty mode  is a throttling mode allowing the client  to transmit any request to the server  via the appliance  over a predetermined period of time provided that the number of requests within the predetermined period of time does not equal, or exceed the predetermined threshold. For example when operating in bursty mode , the rate throttler  allows transmission of any number of requests or objects via the intermediary  over a period of time defined by the threshold period , until the number of the requests or objects transmitted becomes equal to or exceeding the value defined by the rate threshold . In some embodiments, bursty mode  can be changed or modified according to the user criteria  that identifies a new value of the rate threshold  to replace the previous value of the rate threshold . Similarly, the bursty mode  can be changed or modified according to the user criteria  that identifies a new value indicating the period of time of the threshold period  to replace the previous value of the period of time of the threshold period . Updated values of the bursty mode  can be used by the rate throttler  while throttling of the requests and objects, thus affecting the flow of the objects and requests transmitted.","Smooth mode  can be any throttling mode of operation of the rate throttler  which allows the client to exhaust client's quota for transmission at a pace spread out over the entire selected time period. Smooth mode  can utilize a rate threshold  identifying a rate of transmission at any given moment within the threshold period  in order to throttle the rate of objects traversing the appliance . For example, the smooth mode  can utilize a rate threshold  identifying a predetermined amount of objects per second over a threshold period . The smooth mode  will in this case allow the client to receive objects at a maximum rate of less than or equal to the predetermined amount of objects per second over the entire threshold period . However, the smooth mode  would regulate the transmission of the objects to the client never to exceed the amount of objects per second allowed and never to block transmissions to the client. The objects would not have to be blocked en route to the client since the amount of objects per second even if transmitted for the entirety of the threshold period  would not exceed the client's quota.","Connections mode  can be any throttling mode of operation of the rate throttler  limiting a number of active transactions of the client. In some embodiments, connections mode  limits the number of connections between the client  and server  by using the rate threshold  as the maximum number of allowable connections between the client  and server  over the threshold period . In some embodiments, the rate threshold  is the threshold of the number of sessions the client  may establish with the server  via the appliance . If the number of client requests to establish a session with the server  exceeds the value of the rate threshold  within the threshold period , the rate throttler  blocks the request for the session. In some embodiments, when the number of client requests to establish a session with the server  exceeds the rate threshold  within the threshold period , the rate throttler  blocks session from being established between the client  and server .","Bandwidth mode  comprises a throttling mode based on bandwidth usage to determine the client's quota or client's transmission rate. In some embodiments, bandwidth mode  utilizes a bandwidth monitor to determine the bandwidth used by the session between the client  and server  to determine the rate threshold . The rate threshold  can be set in terms of megabytes per second or objects per second. In some embodiments, the bandwidth mode  allow the policy  to adjust the value of the rate threshold  after determining by the appliance  that the available bandwidth of the network has changed. In bandwidth mode , the policy  can adjust or update the rate threshold  to more accurately determine the client's transmission rate by setting a new rate threshold . In some embodiments, the policy  adjusts or updates the threshold period  to more accurately determine the client's transmission rate by setting a new threshold period . For example, in order to increase the client's transmission rate one can either increase the rate threshold  leaving the threshold period  unchanged, or decrease threshold period  and leave the rate threshold  unchanged. Bandwidth mode  can thus manage the client's quota by setting the rate threshold  according the bandwidth available to the client  and server  or according to the bandwidth used by the client  and server . Bandwidth mode  can also manage client's transmission rate by managing or modifying the rate threshold  per threshold period  ratio. In some embodiments, bandwidth mode  manages a client's transmission rate by setting the rate threshold  to a value corresponding to the rate of transmission, such as objects per second, rather than the number of transmission, such as objects for example.","In an example of operation, a selector  from a user includes a selectlet  identifying a timing interval within which bursty mode  should replace any other throttling mode used by the rate throttler . The selector  can also include another selectlet  identifying a specific object of the server . The policy engine creates a policy which is configured to activate the bursty throttling mode at the user specified time. The policy engine  also creates another policy which recognizes the user specified object or a request for the user specified object and chooses a connections mode  once the user specified object or the request of the user specified object is encountered. At the user specified time the policy  activates bursty mode  and the rate throttler  starts operating according to the bursty mode . Upon detecting the request for the user specified object, the policy  deactivates bursty mode  and activates connections mode  for the rate throttler . Rate throttler  then throttles the user specified object according to the connections mode . The rate threshold  and threshold period  can also change with the change of the throttling modes allowing the rate throttler  to keep track of events at both modes if necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0243"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6B","FIG. 5C"],"b":["200","505","548","548","236","605","140","580","122","122","556","650"]},"In operation and by way of example, a packet processing engine (PPE) A, such as a first PPE, can receive a request from a client  for a resource, such as web resource R. As used herein, the term \u201cweb resource\u201d includes any item of content which can be provided as data over a network or any application, interactive or non-interactive, which can be provided over a network. Upon receipt of the request, the first packet processing engine A can determine whether the intermediary device  currently has available the resource, e.g. a cached or stored copy of the resource. If the resource is not currently available, e.g., the resource has not been requested by any client to any core of the appliance in a recent time interval, the first packet processing engine A can obtain the resource and be designated by the intermediary device, or designate itself, as owner of the resource. The first packet processing engine can then store resource data A corresponding to the requested resource in shared memory . In some embodiments, the first packet processing engine stores the resource data A in its cache A or its global cache allocation. As owner of the requested resource, the first PPE A can also create and maintain a counter A which monitors the access rate of the requested resource. The counter A can be stored in shared memory  or cache A. The first PPE A can also generate a hash A for the stored resource data A. The generated hash A and metadata A can be stored by the first packet processing engine A in its cache A.","When another packet processing engine N of the plurality of packet processing engines on the appliance , such as a second PPE, receives a request for the same resource R, the second PPE N can send a core-to-core message to determine whether the resource is available on the appliance via another PPE. Continuing with the example above, since the first packet processing engine has recently received a request for the resource and cached resource data A, the first PPE A can respond to the core-to-core message by sending hash A to the second PPE N. The first PPE can also increment the counter A responsive to the request from the second packet processing engine. The second PPE can store the hash A in its cache N or global cache allocation. The hash A in the cache N can be used by the second PPE N to retrieve resource data A. In various embodiments, each core configured to handle service requests of the multi-core system maintains a hash table in cache wherein hash values in the table identify locations of stored resource data . Accessibility of the resource data A, however, is governed for each packet processing engine  by rate throttlers  as described elsewhere herein.","In certain embodiments, each core which owns an object or resource has one or more cache entries providing information about the object. These entries can be generated by the core's packet processing engine. One type of cache entry can be a record comprising a hash value, a pointer or identifier indicating where the object can be found, an identifier of the owner core, a pointer to where metadata for the object can be found, and additional values relating to rate limiting of the object.

In particular, consumption of shared memory space by stored resource data A is minimized by assigning ownership of the resource to one packet processing engine and storing and sharing only one copy of the resource data. Additionally, data load and time consumed in core-to-core messaging is reduced by communicating only a hash value for a resource among cores.","Referring now to , a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for limiting or throttling a rate of requests between a client and a server is illustrated. The method can be executed by an appliance  having a single processor configured for object rate limiting, or by an appliance having a plurality of cores, of which a portion are configured for service request handling and object rate limiting. For example, each packet processing engine  of a multi-core appliance can execute the method of . In brief overview of method , at step , an intermediary receives a request from a client for an object or resource of a server. At step , the intermediary identifies the object based on one or more user specified selection criteria. At step , a policy engine of the intermediary identifies for the request a policy specifying a mode of throttling, a rate threshold and a period of time for the rate threshold.

For example, an ownership data flag associated with the requested object can be altered to identify the first core. Ownership of an object can be established on a first-to-receive basis, e.g., the packet engine which first receives a request for an object not immediately available from the intermediary  assumes ownership of the requested object and designates its core as owner of the object. In some embodiments, ownership of an object is established based on ownership load or packet processing engine load, e.g., the core having the fewest number of owned objects or for which the packet processing engine has the fewest number of active connections is assigned or self-assigns ownership of the requested object.

The hash can be stored in the cache A for the first PPE A and be available to other packet processing engines via core-to-core messaging . In some embodiments, the first packet processing engine generates a unique hash for each unique service request from a client. A unique hash can be generated by evaluating a portion of, or all of, the request received from the client. For, example, evaluation of a header can identify a unique URL which can be used as is or converted to a numerical hash value.","The step of receiving , by a second PPE of the plurality of packet processing engines, can comprise receiving a request for the same object, i.e., a subsequent request from another or same client for the first resource or object as described in reference to the step of receiving  by the first packet processing engine. In certain embodiments, the step of receiving  comprises determining, by the second packet processing engine, identification of the first core as the owner core of the requested object. In some embodiments, the determining comprises evaluating an expression on the first object and computing the hash value for the first object. The evaluating can comprise evaluating, by the second PPE, a portion of, or all of, the request expression received from the client to yield a unique hash.","In some embodiments, a PPE can determine based on the hash value itself an identifier or number of the PPE that is designated as the owner of the object. In some embodiments, each of the PPE maintains or has access to a lookup table to identify the owner core based on the hash value. In some embodiments, the hast table may be distributed among the cores and\/or PPEs. In some embodiments, the hash table may be stored in shared memory. Based on the hash value pointing to a corresponding bucket in a hash table, the PPE can identify the owner core. In these embodiments, the PPE can send a Core-to-Core message to the owner core.","In some embodiments, the second PPE can issue a core-to-core query to determine whether another core is owner of a requested object having the evaluated hash. If another core owns the object with the evaluated hash, the PPE of that core can return to the second packet processing engine data identifying it as the owner core as well as data identifying the location of the object data  in shared memory. In some embodiments, the step of receiving  further comprises performing, by the second PPE N, a look-up of the first requested object in a memory cache of the second PPE or shared memory using the identification of the first core as owner of the requested object and the evaluated hash. For example, stored object data A can be referenced by two identifiers, a hash and a core owner identifier. In various embodiments, the step of receiving  further comprises storing, by a second PPE N, the location in shared memory of the rate related counter A and\/or the hash value A of the first object to a memory cache N of the second packet processing engine. In certain embodiments, a hash value  can identify a location in shared memory of a corresponding requested object  and identify an memory offset value identifying a location in shared memory at which the rate related counter  for the requested object can be found.","The step of receiving , by the second PPE, can comprise receiving from the first packet processing engine the location in shared memory  of the rate-related counter A for the first requested object. The location in shared memory  can be received as a core-to-core message having data identifying the location of the counter A. The step of receiving  can further comprise receiving, by the second PPE N from the first PPE A, the hash for the first requested object. In certain embodiments, the step of receiving  further comprises determining, by the second packet processing engine, that a memory cache of the second packet processing engine does not store information on the first requested resource or object, and transmitting, by the second PPE, a request for information on the first object. The request for information can be transmitted from the second PPE via core-to-core messaging. In some embodiments, the step of receiving  can further comprise determining, by the second PPE N, identification of the first core A as the owner core of the requested object by evaluating an expression on or related to the first object as described in reference to the step of receiving  a second request for the first object.","In various embodiments, the step of determining , by the second packet processing engine N, comprises determining via the rate-related counter A obtained from shared memory  whether or not a rate limit for the first requested object has been reached. In certain embodiments, the step of determining  comprises evaluating the rate-related counter A, by the second PPE's policy engine N or throttler N, and determining whether the current value is in a range established by the policy engine N that permits access to the requested resource or object. The step of determining  can further comprise placing, by the throttler N, the client issuing the second request on hold or in a queue for the requested service if the rate limit for the first requested object has been reached. The step of determining  can further comprise allowing, by the throttler N, access to the requested object if the rate limit has not been reached, and incrementing or storing an update to, by the second PPE, the rate-related counter A to reflect the additional access to the object by the client issuing the second request. In certain embodiments, each packet processing engine can access the rate-related counter  for an object via a lock or mutex and increment or decrement the counter responsive to requests for access to or termination of access to the object.","The method  can further comprise receiving, by a third packet processing engine B of the plurality of packet processing engines in operation on the appliance , a third request for the first requested object or resource. As will be appreciated, certain method steps executed by the second packet processing engine in response to the second request for the first object can be executed mutatis mutandis by the third packet processing engine. For example, the third packet processing engine can identify the location of the rate-related counter A in the shared memory  for the first object via cache memory of the third packet processing engine and determine whether or not the rate limit of the first object has been reached. The third packet processing engine can also update the rate-related counter A in shared memory. The third packet processing engine can copy the object data A to its cache.","The method  can further comprise steps of removing object data  from a packet processing engine's cache  and decrementing the rate-related counter  in shared memory for the resource or object. For example, in some embodiments a second core N can have a copy of object data A in its cache N. The copy of the object data may have been generated responsive to receiving, by the second packet processing engine N, a request for the resource or object. The second packet processing engine may not receive a request for the object data A for a time interval. The second packet processing engine N can be configured to clear an object data from its cache N when a request for the object has not been received for a selected time interval, e.g., a time interval having a value between about 5 seconds and about 10 seconds, between about 10 seconds and about 30 seconds, between about 30 seconds and about 60 seconds, between about 1 minute and about 3 minutes, between about 3 minutes and about 10 minutes, between about 10 minutes and about 30 minutes, and yet in some embodiments between about 30 minutes and about 60 minutes. In some embodiments, the second packet processing engine clears object data from its cache and transmits a rate-related decrement instruction for the rate-related counter of the cleared object. The owner core of the cleared object, e.g., the first packet processing engine, can receive the decrement instruction and reduce a value of the rate-related counter for the object. In certain embodiments, any non-owner core having a hash  to the cleared object does not clear its hash for that object until the owner core clears the object from shared memory. In some embodiments, a non-owner core having a hash to a cleared object clears the hash at substantially the same time that a cached copy of the object is cleared. In various embodiments, the owner core does not clear its cache or clear the object from shared memory until after all other cores have cleared the object or related data from their caches.","The method  can further comprise generating, by the first packet processing engine A, e.g., the engine owning an object and maintaining its counter , a simple network management protocol (SNMP) trap when a rate limit has been exceeded for the object. In some embodiments, the packet processing engine of the owner core monitors the rate-related counter  and generates an SNMP trap when the rate-related counter indicates that a rate or limit for the object has been exceeded. The rate or limit can pertain to a maximum number of requests within a selected time interval, a bandwidth limit, and\/or a maximum number of connections permitted for an object. In some embodiments, only the owner core has metadata identifying one or more limits for an object, so that the owner core originates the SNMP trap. In some embodiments, a second core, e.g., a core configured for system managing, has data identifying one or more limits for an object. The second core can be configured to identify to the owner core, e.g., via the owner core's PPE, when a limit for an object has been exceeded. The PPE of the owner core can then identify to other cores configured to handle service requests that a limit for the object has been exceeded. The PPE of the owner core can use core-to-core messaging and\/or an SNMP trap to communicate the information.","In certain embodiments, servicing bandwidth for an object is split among plural cores. This can increase the effective bandwidth of a web resource. By way of example, a single server  may provide a resource at a bandwidth of 1 kilobit per 1 millisecond. A core of the intermediary can cache the resource or identify a second server providing the same resource. Each core configured for handling service requests can then provide the resource in parallel. In a system having seven cores configured to handle service requests, the effective bandwidth for the service can be 7 kilobits per 1 millisecond. A sampling time for bandwidth on the intermediary  can then be increased, e.g., increased to seven milliseconds to arrive at a bandwidth rate of 7 kilobits\/7 milliseconds. In some embodiments, bandwidth service can be exceeded or underutilized and system constraints related to bandwidth service can be more relaxed than constraints relating to request rate or number of connections for an object.","It will be appreciated that in certain embodiments unique rate limit identifiers can be used on the multi-core system to limit the rates of access to an object. Since the system can support multiple objects, there can be a plurality of rate limiting data, each associated with a particular object or resource. In such cases, a rate limit identifier can exist without any selectlets, and it is desirable to have a same name for an object across all cores. In various embodiments, the packet processing engine of a core owning an object generates a unique rate limit identifier. The rate limit identifier can be generated based upon a URL and its extensions as described in reference to generating a unique hash value herein.","Although the method steps above have been described in particular reference to , it will be appreciated that any particular step is not bound to a particular core or packet processing engine of the multi-core appliance . Furthermore, as convenience reference to a packet processing engine as a first or second packet processing engine is for convenience only and does not mean a particular order or a particular enumeration of packet processing engines. For any of the packet processing engines A-N can be the first packet processing engine to receive a \u201cnew\u201d request for an object and have its core become owner of the object. Any of the other packet processing engines can be the second packet processing engine, or third."],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["The foregoing and other objects, aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent and better understood by referring to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 1E-1H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6D"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
