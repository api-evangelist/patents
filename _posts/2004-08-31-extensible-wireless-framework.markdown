title: Extensible wireless framework
abstract: An extensible wireless framework for connecting to a wireless network is provided. The extensible wireless framework includes a network roaming service with a registration component and a network service component. The registration component registers extensible service modules and extensible drivers for providing non-standard (i.e., extensible) capabilities to the wireless network. The extensible service module provides a service not provided by a native component of the extensible wireless framework, and the extensible driver may implement a media access control sub-layer of a wireless network protocol and provide a media access control interface. The network service component identifies available wireless networks, selects to join the wireless network when available, requests the extensible driver for the wireless network via its media access control interface to connect to the selected network, and notifies the extensible service module to provide services to the extensible driver.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/544,900, entitled \u201cExtensible Wireless Framework\u201d and filed on Feb. 13, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The described technology relates generally to wireless networks.","The seven-layer OSI network model defines a data link layer and a physical (PHY) layer as the two lowest layers. The data link layer encodes and decodes packets into bits and handles errors in the physical layer, flow control, and frame synchronization. The data link layer is divided into a logical link control (LLC) sub-layer and a media access control (MAC) sub-layer. The LLC sub-layer controls frame synchronization, flow control, and error checking. The MAC sub-layer controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission to transmit. The MAC sub-layer provides a set of rules to determine how to access the transmission medium and transmit data. The physical layer, however, is responsible for physically transmitting and receiving the data.","The IEEE 802.11 specification defines a MAC sub-layer and a physical layer for a wireless network. An 802.11 network consists of a distribution system, access points, a wireless medium, and stations. An individual station, such as a laptop computer, gains access to the network by communicating over the wireless medium via an access point (assuming an infrastructure network). The distribution system connects the access points together so that information can flow from a station communicating with one access point to a station communicating with another access point. In order to connect to a network, a station may actively scan for available networks by sending out probe requests. Alternatively, a station may passively tune to different channels waiting for an access point beacon. The station may then compile a report of networks and may elect to join one of the networks. Once the station elects to join a network, it authenticates itself to the network and then associates with an access point of the network. (Many 802.11 networks allow any station with access to the network to be authenticated prior to association referred to as \u201copen authentication,\u201d but require additional authentication after association by using, for example, an extensible authentication protocol (\u201cEAP\u201d)). Each station \u201cassociates\u201d with one access point through which it gains access to the network. In the process of associating, the unique MAC address of the station is recorded with the access point so that the distribution network knows through which access point to route data destined for the station. Since stations connected to a wireless network may be mobile, a station will need to associate with a new access point when it moves out of range of the access point to which it is currently associated (or for some other reason wants to associate with another access point). A station that moves out of range of its associated access point sends a request to associate with a new access point and receives the identification of the new access point with which to associate in response. The distribution system ensures that the transmission of data occurs seamlessly as stations re-associate with new access points.","At least one operating system currently provides a native wireless framework for connecting to wireless networks such as an 802.11 network. The native wireless framework provides capabilities to identify available wireless networks and select an appropriate wireless network for joining. Once associated with an access point of a network, the native wireless framework controls the communications over the wireless network. When a computing device with such an operating system is moved from location-to-location (i.e., roams), the native wireless framework from time-to-time associates with an appropriate access point of the wireless network. A native wireless framework is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/306,169, entitled \u201cNative WiFi Architecture for 802.11 Networks\u201d and filed on Nov. 27, 2002, which is hereby incorporated by references.","The developer of a native wireless framework may try to include as many capabilities as the wireless network industry may need at the time. The wireless network industry is, however, rapidly evolving. New capabilities driven by new standards or innovations are constantly being developed by independent hardware vendors (\u201cIHVs\u201d) and independent software vendors (\u201cISVs\u201d). These developments may occur at a much faster pace than the release of new versions of the operating system. As a result, when vendors want to use capabilities of a wireless network that are not currently supported by an operating system, they typically develop a monolithic implementation that subsumes some or all of the capabilities of the native wireless framework or any other wireless framework. Because each vendor provides its own implementation, the implementations are often inconsistent with each other. This inconsistency makes it difficult for users to take advantage of these new capabilities. Moreover, these monolithic implementations may not integrate well, or at all, with the native wireless framework. As a result, advanced capabilities of the native wireless framework, such as diagnostics, cannot interface with the monolithic implementations. Such advanced capabilities thus appear to the users to not be functioning as intended or do not operate in a consistent or diagnosable way. In addition, these monolithic implementations do not take advantage of the capabilities of the native wireless framework and may duplicate such capabilities.","It would be desirable to have a wireless framework that would allow vendors to develop new capabilities at their own pace while not hindering the overall capabilities of the native wireless framework.","An extensible wireless framework for connecting to a wireless network is provided. The extensible wireless framework may provide a registration component and a network service component. The registration component registers or in some other way identifies extensible service modules and extensible drivers for providing non-standard (i.e., extensible) capabilities to the wireless network. The extensible service module provides a service not provided by a native component of the extensible wireless framework, and the extensible driver may implement a media access control sub-layer of a wireless network protocol and provide a media access control interface. The network service component identifies available wireless networks, selects to join the wireless network when available, requests the extensible driver for the wireless network via its media access control interface to connect to the selected network, and notifies the extensible service module to provide services to the extensible driver.","An extensible wireless framework that allows third-party components to be installed into and integrate with native wireless components is provided. The extensible wireless framework may support standards such as IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.3a, and IEEE 802.16a, which define wireless technologies for LAN (Wi-Fi), PAN (UWB), and MAN (Wi-Max) communications, respectively. The extensible wireless framework provides a mechanism for vendors to leverage core capabilities of the native wireless components and to install early implementations of new capabilities at their own pace. In addition, because the extensible wireless framework is integrated with the third-party components, the extensible wireless framework can monitor the processing and state of third-party components.","In one embodiment, the extensible wireless framework allows vendors to install their own kernel-mode, extensible drivers and to install user-mode plug-ins. The plug-ins can perform various functions such as configuring profile information (e.g., configuration and authentication information) for non-standard profiles of the wireless network and performing client authentication. The components of the extensible wireless framework control the storing of the configuration and authentication information of vendor plug-ins, the selecting of the wireless network for establishing a connection, and the establishing of the connection, and monitor the ongoing communications via the extensible drivers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","120","130","140","150","160","110","120","130","140","160"]},"The network roaming service may provide a registration component and network service component. The registration component allows vendor (i.e., third-party) profile plug-ins such as extensible driver and extensible user interfaces to register with it. (Alternatively, a third-party component can use a client-side library provided by the extensible wireless framework to identify its services.) The network service component provides a rule-base selection of a wireless network, controls the establishment of a connection to the selected wireless network by interfacing with the extensible driver, and interfaces with a vendor, non-standard EAP plug-in to provide authentication services when the selected wireless network is non-standard. A rule-based roaming technique is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/693,655, entitled \u201cNetwork and Interface Selection on a Computing Device Capable of Establishing Connections via Multiple Network Communications Media\u201d and filed on Oct. 24, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The EAP framework component includes various standard EAP components  and a vendor, non-standard EAP plug-in . The standard EAP components may be implemented natively or implemented by a third party using the standard EAP framework such as EAP Subscriber Identity Module (\u201cEAP-SIM\u201d). The standard EAP components provide only standard EAP capabilities (whether implemented natively or by a third party), and the network roaming service interacts with them directly to coordinate the authentication process. The vendor, non-standard EAP plug-in provides non-standard EAP capabilities in an EAP framework with which the network roaming service interacts after the plug-in is registered.","The administrative components include a provisioning component , an NLA API component , a group policy component , and a user interface component , which are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/306,169, entitled \u201cNative WiFi Architecture for 802.11 Networks.\u201d","The vendor profile plug-in controls registering of the plug-in and setting of its profile information for non-standard network profiles such as Cisco-compatible extensions (\u201cCCX\u201d), the Wired Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure (\u201cWAPI\u201d), and so on. The vendor profile plug-in may provide a user interface for receiving configuration and authentication information from a user. The plug-in provides its configuration and authentication information to the network roaming service for storage as profile information in the profile store to be used when establishing a connection to a non-standard wireless network.","The NDIS component includes a native 802.11 framework , an upper MAC component , a lower MAC\/PHY interface , an upper MAC interface , and a W802.11 miniport driver . The miniport driver includes a native 802.11 AP\/STA driver (that can function as an access point on a station) and an extensible 802.11 STA driver that can provide native-only and\/or extensible-only functionality. The miniport driver can be configured to select either the native or extensible driver to control access to the wireless network.","The native 802.11 framework is an intermediate driver that provides a framework for driving the 802.11 operations of the 802.11 miniport driver. It provides an interface between the user-mode components and the kernel-mode components. It interacts with the network roaming service to provide network port-based access control.","The upper MAC interface provides an interface for controlling the upper MAC operations of an extensible 802.11 STA driver. It also provides upper MAC state management for diagnostic data and monitoring the progress of upper MAC procedures.","The lower MAC\/PHY interface provides an interface for controlling the 802.11 lower MAC and PHY operations needed for the purpose of hosting the upper MAC natively within the extensible wireless framework.","The native 802.11 AP\/STA driver conforms to the lower MAC\/PHY interface specifications. It may conform to both the AP and STA interfaces. Alternatively, it may provide only a subset of the AP or STA interfaces. The native 802.11 AP\/STA driver may be provided by an IHV who needs only the capabilities provided by the native components of the extensible wireless framework.","The extensible 802.11 STA driver is provided by vendor who wants to provide capabilities not provided by the native components of the extensible wireless framework. This driver conforms to the upper MAC interface specification of the extensible wireless framework. The 802.11 upper and lower MAC and the PHY implementations are provided by the extensible 802.11 STA driver.","A vendor who needs capabilities not provided by the native components of the extensible wireless framework can provide an extensible 802.11 STA driver and may also provide a profile plug-in and a non-standard EAP plug-in that provides the needed capabilities in the context of the extensible wireless framework. The extensible wireless framework can be used by a vendor who wants to provide new capabilities only in kernel mode. The new capabilities may be an early implementation of a new standard such as 802.11n. In such a case, the vendor need only implement and install the appropriate extensible 802.11 STA driver. The vendor may, however, provide user made capabilities (e.g., enhanced authentication) by providing a profile plug-in and a service plug-in such as a non-standard EAP plug-in.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","220","211","212","213","221","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","402","403","404","405"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["501","502","503","504","505","506"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","602","603","604"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["701","702","703","704","705"]},"The computing device on which the extensible wireless framework is implemented may include a central processing unit, memory, input devices (e.g., keyboard and pointing devices), output devices (e.g., display devices), and storage devices (e.g., disk drives). The memory and storage devices are computer-readable media that may contain instructions that implement the extensible wireless framework. In addition, the data structures and message structures may be stored or transmitted via a data transmission medium, such as a signal on a communications link. Various communications links may be used, such as the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network, or a point-to-point dial-up connection.","The extensible wireless framework may be implemented in various environments.
