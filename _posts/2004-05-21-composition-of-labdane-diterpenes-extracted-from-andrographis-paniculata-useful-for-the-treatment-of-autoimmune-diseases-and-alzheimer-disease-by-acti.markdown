These reactions may, for example, be caused by the recognition of auto-antigens by the T lymphocytes, which trigger humoral (auto-antibodies production) and cellular (increased lymphocytes and macrophages cytotoxic activity) immune responses. Autoimmune diseases include: rheumatoid diseases, psoriasis, systemic dermatomyocytis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, and exaggerated immune responses to antigens, i.e., asthma, allergies to drugs and food, etc. All these diseases are limiting, chronic, and in some cases lethal, and no effective therapy exists nowadays to treat them. Therefore, any drug, medicine, or media that is able to cause remission or decrease in the course of the disease, represents a significant solution for the patients health.","The search for a treatment for autoimmune diseases has resulted in an important effort to find suitable drugs and methods.","At present, the treatment of these diseases is principally based in the use of immunosuppressant drugs, such as glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, anti-proliferatives and anti-metabolites. However, since these pharmacological therapies act on many different targets, they can reduce the immune function as a whole, or due to long term use, can have the disadvantage of different cytotoxic effects and may therefore can suppress the immune system in a non specific way, exposing the patient to the risk of infections and cancer. Calcineurin and glucocorticoids exhibit an additional disadvantage, due to their nephrotoxicity and diabetogenic effects, that limits their utility in several clinical conditions (e.g., renal insufficiency, diabetes).","The latest therapeutic advances in immuno-suppression are the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies, the anti IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies, and the anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies. Despite the fact that these treatments exhibit marked immunosuppressing effects, anaphylaxis reactions, opportunistic infections (e.g., tuberculosis) and neoplasms, fever, urticaria, hypotension and dyspnea are associated with these medicines, representing a serious problem in the application of said compositions and pharmaceutical products. In injectable applications, one out of three patients can experience itching, swelling and pain.","The present invention is able to diminish the auto-immune response (which characterizes autoimmune diseases and allergies), alleviating the symptoms and the course of these diseases, while mainting \u201cimmunological tolerance,\u201d or a healthy absence of an auto-immune response.","In other words, the composition disclosed in the present invention, may be characterized by the immunological tolerance associated with it, which immune tolerance corresponds to the active state of the absence of a specific reaction against an antigen (in other words, without causing the adverse side-effects associated with currently-used immunosuppressant drugs).","We believe that our composition inhibits the synthesis and expression of interferon gamma and interleukin-2 (\u201cIL-2\u201d), stimulates the PPAR gamma receptor, and reduces the in vivo activity of NF kappaB factor.","Consequently, we believe these new diterpenic labdanes selectively reduce over-expression of cytokines, which over-expression is often involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.","Recent advances in scientific understanding of the mediators involved in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer have led to new strategies in the search for effective therapeutics. Traditional approaches include direct target intervention such as the use of specific antibodies, receptor antagonists, or enzyme inhibitors having all of them an important level of side effects (e.g. allergies, gastrointestinal ulcers, bleedings, etc.). Recent breakthroughs in the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms involved in the transcription and translation of a variety of mediators have led to increased interest in therapeutic approaches directed at the level of gene transcription (e.g. COX2, iNOS, IL1beta, TNFalpha, ICAM, etc.).","One of the most important mediators of the immune system is NF-kappaB. NF-kappa B belongs to a family of closely-related dimeric transcription factor complexes. These are each composed of various combinations of the Rel\/NF-kappaB family of polypeptides. The family consists of five individual gene products in mammals, RelA (p65), NF-kappaB1 (p50\/p105), NF-kappaB2 (p49\/p100), c-Rel, and RelB, all of which can form hetero- or homodimers. These proteins share a highly homologous 300 amino acid \u201cRel homology domain\u201d which contains the DNA binding and dimerization domains. At the extreme C-terminus of the Rel homology domain is a nuclear translocation sequence important in the transport of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In addition, p65 and cRel possess potent trans-activation domains at their C-terminal ends.","The activity of NF-kappaB is regulated by its interaction with a member of the inhibitor IkappaB family of proteins. This interaction effectively blocks the nuclear localization sequence on the NF-kappaB proteins, thus preventing migration of the dimer to the nucleus. A wide variety of stimuli activate NF-kappaB through what are likely to be multiple signal transduction pathways. Included are bacterial products (LPS), some viruses (HIV-1, HTLV-1), inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1), and environmental stress. Apparently common to all stimuli however, is the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IkappaB IkappaB is phosphorylated on two N-terminal serines by the recently identified IkappaB kinases (IKK-alpha and IKK-beta). Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that these phosphorylations are critical for the subsequent activation of NF-kappaB in that once phosphorylated the protein is flagged for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Free from IkappaB, the active NF-kappaB complexes are able to translocate to the nucleus where they bind in a selective manner to preferred gene-specific enhancer sequences. Included in the genes regulated by NF-kappaB are a number of cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and acute phase proteins.","It is well-known that NF-kappaB plays a key role in the regulated expression of a large number of pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8. Cell adhesion molecules, such as ICAM and VCAM, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Such mediators are known to play a role in the recruitment of leukocytes at sites of inflammation and in the case of iNOS, may lead to organ destruction in some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.","The importance of NF-kappaB in inflammatory disorders is further strengthened by studies of airway inflammation including asthma, in which NF-kappaB has been shown to be activated. This activation may underlie the increased cytokine production and leukocyte infiltration characteristic of these disorders. In addition, inhaled steroids are known to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and suppress the inflammatory response in asthmatic airways. In light of the recent findings with regard to glucocorticoid inhibition of NFkappaB, one may speculate that these effects are mediated through an inhibition of NFkappaB.","Further evidence for a role of NF-kappaB in inflammatory disorders comes from studies of rheumatoid synovium. Although NF-kappaB is normally present as an inactive cytoplasmic complex, recent immunohistochemical studies have indicated that NF-kappaB is present in the nuclei, and hence active, in the cells comprising rheumatoid synovium. Furthermore, NF-kappaB has been shown to be activated in human synovial cells in response to stimulation with TNF-alpha. Such a distribution may be the underlying mechanism for the increased cytokine and eicosanoid production characteristic of this tissue. See Roshak, A. K., et al., J. B. C., 271, 31496-31501 (1996).","Further evidence for a role of NF-kappaB in inflammatory disorders comes from studies of rheumatoid synovium.

Chem., 271, 31496-31501 (1996).","The NF-kappaB\/Rel and IkappaB proteins are also likely to play a key role in neoplastic transformation. Family members are associated with cell transformation in vitro and in vivo as a result of over-expression, gene amplification, gene rearrangements or translocations. In addition, rearrangement and\/or amplification of the genes encoding these proteins are seen in 20-25% of certain human lymphoid tumors. In addition, a role for NF-kappaB in the regulation of apoptosis has been reported strengthening the role of this transcription factor in the control of cell proliferation.","The first plant-derived modulators of NF-kB were reported nearly a decade ago by Kopp & Ghosh (1994) who identified sodium salicylate and its semi-synthetic derivative, aspirin. Following this discovery, a number of new natural products, of different chemical classes, have demonstrated NF-kB inhibitory activity.","Several NF-kappaB inhibitors are described in the literature. See e.g., C. Wahl, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 101(5), 1163-1174 (1998), R. W. Sullivan, et al. J. Med. Chem. 41, 413-419 (1998), J. W. Pierce, et al. J. Biol. Chem. 272, 21096-21103 (1997). The marine natural product hymenialdisine is known to inhibit NF-.kappa.B. Roshak, A., et al., JPET, 283, 955-961 (1997). Breton, J. J and Chabot-Fletcher, M. C., JPET, 282, 459-466 (1997). Salicylanilides are known compounds and described by M. T. Clark, R. A. Coburn. R. T. Evans, R. J. Genco, J. Med. Chem., 1986, 29, 25-29.","Recently, an important mechanism of the inhibition of NF-kappaB suggest the possible activation of the receptors for peroxisomes.","The receptors for peroxysomes known as \u201cPeroxysomes Proliferator Activated Receptors\u201d (PPARs), [attending to the usual use of the term expressed in its abbreviation known in the scientific area, said abbreviation shall be used for identifying this receptor] have been implicated in autoimmune diseases and other diseases, i.e diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The current pharmaceutical agents with PPAR gamma agonist are still in the experimental stage and have significant side effects for human health, due to its mechanism of action. Therefore, there is the need to develop new agents with lesser toxic effects that can modulate these receptors more accurately in order to prevent, treat and\/or alleviate the above mentioned diseases or conditions.","This new composition, modulates these receptors more accurately, and therefore allows preventing, treating and\/or alleviating autoimmune diseases more efficiently, without causing undesirable side effects to the patients.","Peroxysomes Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes of PPARs have been discovered. These include PPARalpha, PPARbeta or NUC1, PPAR\u03b3 and PPARdelta.","PPAR\u03b3 was characterized originally as a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. PPAR\u03b3 expression is directed by different promoters, leading to three PPAR\u03b3 isoforms. It is now clear that PPAR\u03b3 is also found in other cell types including fibroblasts, myocytes, breast cells, the white and red pulp of rat spleen, human bone-marrow precursors, and macrophages\/monocytes. In addition, PPAR\u03b3 has been shown in macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques. An important role for PPAR\u03b3 in glucose metabolism was identified when it was demonstrated that a class of antidiabetic drugs, the thiazolidinediones, were high-affinity PPAR\u03b3 ligands. The thiazolidinediones were developed originally for the treatment of type-2 diabetes on the basis of their ability to lower glucose levels (and levels of circulating fatty acids) in rodent models of insulin resistance. The finding that the thiazolidinediones mediate their therapeutic effects through direct interactions with PPAR\u03b3 established PPAR\u03b3 as a key regulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Despite being described initially as a regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR\u03b3 has also been demonstrated recently to have a role in cell proliferation and malignancy. Ligands for PPAR\u03b3 have been shown to mediate positive and negative effects on cell proliferation and malignancy.","In addition to the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs, a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also can function as PPAR\u03b3 ligands, although the latter have relatively low affinity.","The prostaglandin D(PGD) dehydration product PGJwas the first endogenous ligand discovered for PPAR\u03b3. The additional PGDdehydration product, 15-deoxy-\u0394-PGJ(15d-PGJ), is also a naturally occurring substance that binds directly to PPAR\u03b3 and is a potent ligand for PPAR\u03b3 activation.","One of the earliest findings associating PPARs and macrophages was that PPAR\u03b3 was highly expressed in macrophage-derived foam cells of human and murine atherosclerotic lesions. Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that PPAR\u03b3 is expressed in human and murine monocytes\/macrophages. Functionally, PPAR\u03b3 has been shown to play a role in the differentiation and activation of monocytes and in the regulation of inflammatory activities. Many studies have demonstrated that PPAR\u03b3 ligands inhibit macrophage-inflammatory responses. The anti-inflammatory effects of PPAR\u03b3 activation have been demonstrated with human and murine monocyte\/macrophages and monocyte\/macrophage lines. Activation of macrophages normally leads to the secretion of several different proinflammatory mediators. Treatment with 15d-PGJor thiazolidinediones has been found to inhibit the secretion of many of these mediators (including gelatinase B, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2) and also to reduce the induced expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) and the transcription of the scavenger receptor-A gene.","The relevance of PPAR\u03b3 has been studied in several human autoimmune diseases and animal models of autoimmune diseases. Kawahito et al. demonstrated that synovial tissue expressed PPAR\u03b3 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PPAR\u03b3 was found to be highly expressed in macrophages, and modest expression was noted in synovial-lining fibroblasts and ECs. Activation of PPAR\u03b3 by 15d-PGJand troglitazone induced RA synoviocyte apoptosis in vitro.","It has been suggested that PPAR\u03b3 is functionally relevant in freshly isolated T cells or becomes functionally relevant early in activation. In these studies, it was also demonstrated that the two ligands for PPAR\u03b3 mediated inhibition of IL-2 secretion by the T-cell clones and did not inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation of such clones.","Several studies have investigated the role of PPAR\u03b3 ligands in modifying animal models of autoimmune diseases. Su et al. showed that in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease, thiazolidinediones markedly reduced colonic inflammation. It has been proposed that this effect might be a result of a direct effect on colonic epithelial cells, which express high levels of PPAR\u03b3 and can produce inflammatory cytokines. Kawahito et al. demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of the PPAR ligands, 15d-PGJand troglitazone, ameliorated adjuvant-induced arthritis. Nino et al. examined the effect of a thiazolidinedione on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and found that this treatment attenuated the inflammation and decreased the clinical symptoms in this mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Finally, Reilly et al. demonstrated that renal glomerular mesanglial cells are important modulators of the inflammatory response in lupus nephritis, secreting, when activated, inflammatory mediators including NO and cyclooxygenase products, thus perpetuating the local inflammatory response. Given the above studies, the relevance of PPARs and the utility of treatment with PPAR agonists in diseases with an inflammatory or autoimmune pathogenesis will likely continue to remain a research focus.","Recently, the issue of the specificity of 15d-PGJfor PPAR\u03b3 has been at least partially clarified. NF-\u03baB is a critical activator of genes involved in inflammation and immunity. In this activation, the I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK) phosphorylates the NF-\u03baB inhibitors (I\u03baB proteins) leading to their conjugation with ubiquitin and subsequent degradation by proteosome. This then allows freed NF-\u03baB dimers to translocate to the nucleus and induce target genes. Rossi et al. demonstrated that the cyclopentenone PGs, including 15d-PGJ, directly inhibit and modify the IKK2 subunit of IKK. This, in turn, prevents the phosphorylation of the inhibitory I\u03baB proteins that then target these proteins for ubiquitin conjugation and degradation. This then prevents the activation of NF-\u03baB. Similarly, Castrillo et al. showed that in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells treated with LPS and IFN-\u03b1, incubation with 15d-PGJresulted in a significant inhibition of IKK2 activity and an inhibition of the degradation of the inhibitory I\u03baB proteins. This, in turn, caused a partial inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity and an impaired expression of genes requiring NF-\u03baB activation, such as type-2 NOS and cyclooxygenase 2.","Therefore, it can be concluded that PPAR\u03b3 and NF-? B are important mediators involved in autoimmune diseases, resulting in a stimulus to the pharmaceutical industry to search for new selective drugs and medicines that affects these mediators.","On the other hand, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the extracellular deposition of \u03b2-amyloid fibrils within the brain and the activation of microglial cells associated with the amyloid plaque. The activated microglia subsequently secretes a diverse range of inflammatory products. Kitamura et al. assessed the occurrence of PPAR\u03b3 and COX-1, COX-2, in normal and AD brains using specific antibodies and found increased expression of these moieties in AD brains. Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing the incidence and risk of AD and in delaying disease progression. Combs et al. demonstrated that NSAIDs, thiazolidinediones, and PGJ, all of which are PPAR\u03b3 agonists, inhibited the \u03b2-amyloid-stimulated secretion of inflammatory products by microglia and monocytes. PPAR\u03b3 agonists were shown to inhibit the \u03b2-amyloid-stimulated expression of the genes for IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and the expression of COX-2. Heneka et al. demonstrated that microinjection of LPS and IFN-\u03b1 into rat cerebellum induced iNOS expression in cerebellar granule cells and subsequent cell death. Coinjection of PPAR\u03b3 agonists (including troglitazone and 15d-PGJ) reduced iNOS expression and cell death, whereas coinjection of a selective COX inhibitor had no effect. Overall, work in AD seems to suggest that PPAR\u03b3 agonists can modulate inflammatory responses in the brain and that NSAIDs may be helpful in AD as a result of their effect on PPAR\u03b3.","From the previously exposed herein, it can be concluded:","Till now, there are no antecedents of PPAR-\u03b3 agonist compounds isolated from medicinal plants. Nowadays, there are no drugs, compositions or medicines with these properties for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.","Whereas, this new composition is able to reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokines production, that are increased in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.","Additionally, the composition of the present invention has low toxicity, and does not exhibit any harmful side effects.","Given the current \u201cState of Art\u201d in Science, the use of said composition cannot be deduced by an expert in the field, wherein said composition is directed for the above mentioned diseases, with said properties, maintaining the immune tolerance, without causing adverse effects, as occurs with other substances that are currently used for these diseases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0041"},"i":"Andrographis paniculata "},"We have found that certain diterpenic labdanes induce PPAR\u03b3 agonistic effects, and inhibit the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB.

We intend such analogs to be covered by the appended claims as legal equivalents of 3-[2-[decahydro-6-hydroxy-5-(hydroxy-methyl)-5,ha-dimethyl-2-methylen-1-naphthalenyl]ethylidene]di-hydro-4-hydroxy-2(3h)-furanone.","In the claims, we intend the singular to encompass at least one: thus, for example, the phrase \u201ca compound selected from the group consisting of: A, B and C\u201d means at least one of the three listed compounds, and possibly more than one."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
