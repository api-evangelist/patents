{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Generally described, computing devices utilize a communication network, or a series of communication networks, to exchange data. Companies and organizations operate computer networks that interconnect a number of computing devices to support operations or provide services to third parties. The computing systems can be located in a single geographic location or located in multiple, distinct geographic locations (e.g., interconnected via private or public communication networks). Specifically, data centers or data processing centers, herein generally referred to as \u201cdata centers,\u201d may include a number of interconnected computing systems to provide computing resources to users of the data center. The data centers may be private data centers operated on behalf of an organization or public data centers operated on behalf, or for the benefit, of the general public.","To facilitate increased utilization of data center resources, virtualization technologies allow a single physical computing device to host one or more instances of a virtual machine, which virtual machine instance appears to a user of a data center as an independent computing device. With virtualization, the host computing device can create, maintain, delete, or otherwise manage virtual machines instances in a dynamic manner. In turn, users can request computing resources from the data center, including single computing devices or a configuration of networked computing devices, and be provided with virtual machine instances that provide the requested computing resources.","An instance of a virtual machine may be configured to provide specific functionality. For example, a virtual machine instance may be associated with different combinations of software applications and operating systems or operating system configurations to enable a virtual machine to provide different desired functionalities, or to provide similar functionalities more efficiently. One or more virtual machine instance configurations are often contained within a service image, which a host computing device may execute in order to implement the desired specific functionality of the virtual machine instance.","In one embodiment, the service image, when executed by virtual machine instance, provides a network accessible service (a.k.a. Web service) corresponding to the software applications\/configurations included in the service image. A network accessible service provides specific functionality to other applications and computing resources via a network through application programming interfaces (APIs), which APIs can also be considered a network accessible service or Web service. For example, a service image, when executed, may provide a network accessible database or mass storage service. Once a service image is created, it can be provided to users interested in utilizing the applications and computing resources available from a data center for specific purposes.","However, over time providers of software applications contained within service images may update the software applications to correct security issues or other bugs. Therefore, users associated with the affected service images may continue to use outdated software applications.","Generally described, aspects of the present disclosure relate to providing an electronic marketplace for service images and providing notifications, such as notifications of outdated software applications, to customers of the electronic service image marketplace. More specifically an electronic service image marketplace is disclosed that enables customers to browse and acquire a large variety of service images. The service images may be submitted to the electronic service image marketplace by third party providers, or may be submitted to the marketplace by the operator of the marketplace itself. The service images can contain one or more software applications executing therein, which may also be referred to as service image software applications. Once acquired through the marketplace, a service image may be launched on a hosted computing environment maintained by the third party provider of the service image or on a hosted computing environment associated with the marketplace.","As discussed in greater detail below, embodiments of the electronic service image marketplace permit a provider to submit one or more notifications regarding software applications contained within the service images that the provider has submitted to the electronic service marketplace. A notification may include a software update for an outdated software application and\/or additional information that would be useful to a customer of the service image. In some embodiments, the software application may be the service image itself.","Upon receiving the notification from the provider, the electronic service image marketplace may search an electronic catalog containing service images for affected service images (e.g., service images that contain the outdated software application), and a provider\/customer data store for affected customers (e.g., customers associated with the service images containing the outdated software application). Upon retrieving the information regarding the affected customers, the electronic service marketplace can generate a notification for the affected customer including details concerning the notification. Accordingly, customers associated with service images that contain one or more outdated software applications can be notified of the outdated software application(s). As a result, the electronic service image marketplace may receive a request from a customer to update the software application, or the customer may choose to continue using the service image with the outdated software application(s).","Embodiments discussed below may refer to the users of an electronic marketplace for service images as customers. However, it may be understood that users are not limited to customers but may include owners, administrators, end users and providers of service images purchased from the electronic marketplace.","Embodiments of an electronic marketplace for service images may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/248,227, filed on Sep. 29, 2011, and entitled, \u201cELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE FOR HOSTED SERVICE IMAGES,\u201d (the \u201c'227 application\u201d) the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In brief, the electronic service image marketplace may provide an environment with which both providers and customers of service images can interact via a network. In one embodiment, a provider may submit a service image to the electronic service image marketplace for inclusion in an electronic catalog. The provider may submit additional information corresponding to the service image that would be useful to a customer, such as pricing information, usage conditions, a location of a provider hosted computing environment on which the service image can be hosted, or other information.","Customers may employ a user computing device to browse the electronic catalog by interaction with various user interfaces generated by the electronic service image marketplace, described in greater detail below. Upon identifying a service image of interest, the customer may view details of each service image in the electronic catalog, such as the information submitted by the provider of the service image. In some embodiments, a customer may view further information associated with a service image, such as usage statistics by other marketplace customers of the service image, reviews by other customers, or recommendations for similar or complementary service images. Accordingly, service images may be surfaced to customers in a variety of ways by the electronic service image marketplace, such as by navigation through a browse tree of services organized by function, type, size, etc. or through recommendations, reviews, etc.","Once a customer selects a service image, the customer may purchase or otherwise acquire the service from the electronic service image marketplace. In some embodiments, the customer may be required to submit payment information for the service image prior to launch of the service image. After acquisition of the service image by the customer, the service image may be launched and executed by one or more hosted computing environments. The hosted computing environment may be provided by an operator of the electronic service image marketplace or may be otherwise associated with the electronic service image marketplace. In some embodiments, the third party provider of the acquired service image may provide a hosted computing environment for the service image acquired by the customer via the electronic service image marketplace.","Once the service image is launched and running on a hosted computing environment, the electronic service image marketplace can monitor the usage of functionality or services provided by service image and bill the customer\/pay the provider accordingly. Moreover, the electronic service image marketplace may provide the customer with tools to manage, monitor, modify, etc. the service image.","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, the electronic service image marketplace may permit a provider to submit a notification, such as an email notification, SMS or MMS notification, pop-up user interface, voice communication, control panel interaction, etc., related to one or more software applications contained within a service image. In an embodiment, the notification relates to the service image itself and\/or the software application is the service image. A notification may include one or more updates regarding the software application, such as security patches, user interface improvements, bug fixes, and the like. Additional notifications may be submitted, such as future revisions of the software application, changes in usage agreements or pricing, tips for use, and the like. In addition, the notification can include additional information related to the outdated software application. For example, the notification can include a notification type, a name of the outdated software application, a name of the updated software application, notes regarding the changes made to the outdated software application, pricing information, and the like. In an embodiment, the notification can include information regarding the customers associated with service images containing the software application.","As an example, and not to be construed as limiting, the electronic service image marketplace may receive a notification in the form of a control panel interaction from a provider that Database v. 1.0 needs to be updated to v. 1.5. The notification includes the file for the outdated software application (v. 1.0) and the updated software application (v 1.5), as well as additional information regarding the update, such as that the update fixes a number of login security issues and improves the user interface. In addition, the notification provides an identifier for the outdated software application as \u201cX6520\u201d and another identifier for the updated software as \u201cX6525.\u201d In some instances, the electronic service image marketplace may receive multiple outdated software applications from the provider, such as multiple versions of a software application, that need to be updated, as well as identifiers for each software application. Using the example provided, the electronic service image marketplace may receive a notification from the provider that Database v. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 all need to be updated to v. 1.5. Accordingly, the notification may contain a unique identifier for each version of Database.","Upon receiving the notification from the provider, the electronic service image marketplace uses the information from the notification to identify affected service images. The electronic service image marketplace can identify the affected service images based on any number of different identifiers. For example, the electronic service image marketplace can use the software application name \u201cDatabase\u201d and version number \u201c1.0,\u201d the received identifier \u201cX6520,\u201d or use some other identifier. In an embodiment, the electronic service image marketplace compares the name of the outdated software application \u201cDatabase\u201d with the names of the software applications contained within the service images in the electronic catalog, which are also referred to as service image software applications. If a matching name is found, the electronic service image marketplace can further compare the version number of the service image software applications with the version number of the outdated software application \u201c1.0.\u201d If the version number corresponds, the electronic service image marketplace may identify the service image software applications as outdated software applications.","Alternatively, the electronic service image marketplace can compare the outdated software application identifier \u201cX6520\u201d with identifiers for the service image software applications. If a service image software application contains the identifier \u201cX6520,\u201d the electronic service image marketplace may indicate that the service image software application is outdated. As yet another example, the electronic service image marketplace may perform a hash function on the outdated software application and compare the hash result of the outdated software application with the hash results of the service image software applications. A corresponding hash result may indicate that the service image software applications are outdated. With continued reference to the example, upon reviewing the service images, the electronic service image marketplace may identifies service images that contain the outdated software application. In the current example, the electronic service image marketplace identifies two service images (e.g., serviceImage23 and serviceImage26) that include the outdated software application \u201cDatabase 1.0.\u201d","The electronic service image marketplace can further include, or be in communication with, a provider\/customer data store that includes information regarding all of the providers and customers registered with the electronic service image marketplace. For the customers in the provider\/customer data store, the provider\/customer data store can include information regarding which service images are associated with the customer and the software applications contained within the service images. Upon identifying the affected service images (e.g., serviceImage23, serviceImage26), the electronic service image marketplace may retrieve information regarding the affected customers (i.e., customers associated with the service images containing the outdated software application) from the provider\/customer data store. In the current example, the electronic service image marketplace identifies two customers (e.g., Customer5, Custerom8) that are associated with the affected service images (e.g., serviceImage23, serviceImage26).","Once the affected customers (e.g., Customer5 and Customer8 in the current example) are identified, the electronic service image marketplace generates a notification for Customer5 and Customer8. The notification for Customer5 and Customer8 can include information similar to the information in the notification received by the electronic service image marketplace from the provider in the form of an email, control panel message, pop-up user interface, text message, and the like. In addition, the notification for Customer5 and Customer8 can enable the customer to select whether they want the update from Database 1.0 to Database 1.5 to occur. Alternatively, the notification for Customer5 and Customer8 can include information that Database 1.0 has already been updated to Database 1.5.","With reference to , an illustrative operating environment is shown which includes an electronic service image marketplace  that enables customers to browse descriptions of service images. The electronic service image marketplace  may further enable customers to acquire service images made available in the electronic service image marketplace  by providers or the operator of the electronic marketplace.
