title: Hand-held raman laser device for distant life-death determination by molecular peri-mortem plume fuzzy membership function
abstract: Multiple functional systems are integrated to configure a portable handheld decision-aid device for first responder medics. Fuzzy membership functions of “life” and “death” are used to determine the status of fallen people using remote measurements. EO/IR cameras can be used to detect and identify casualties in a mass injury situation, while also estimating body temperature. Using the temperature, along with the remote estimation of a second vital sign, the life membership proportion can be estimated from the ground truth by using a 2D projection of stable vital signs. The other fuzzy membership function, death, can be estimated by the presence or absence of peri-mortem and post-mortem molecules. These molecules are only released after death and provide a certain indication of death. Solid state UV laser resonance Raman backscattering from these molecules allows the device to analyze the molecules present in a plume around the casualty.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","This invention relates in general to molecular plume detection, and more particularly, to a Raman laser device for molecular peri-mortem plume detection.","An in-situ tissue sampling by means of chemical mass spectrum and gas chromatography analysis has been proposed by Dr. Vass at Oak Ridge Body Farm to determine the time after death. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,232 Vass.) There is a need to determine the timeline of death from a distance. In wars, many medics die while trying to save an already dead comrade, whether it is from getting caught in the middle of the fighting or from a baited body that contains hidden danger designed to create more injuries. Mass casualties and disasters in homeland security scenarios are also associated with contagious or radioactive hazardous conditions that may harm first responder medics (FRM) who are there to save the critically injured unstable people. FRMs must attend to those who would die without immediate medical attention and report to headquarters about what further resources are needed. This prevents FRMs from accomplishing their number one priority: save all the critically injured people. To attend to the time-sensitive injuries, FRMs must prioritize the order of which casualties they care for and minimize unproductive verification of death. In other words, the FRM does not want any potentially savable person to die while attending to someone who is already dead. Thus, knowing which casualties are already dead not only helps FRMs prioritize and maximize their medical expertise, it allows them to determine the total number of people who are alive and require attention by subtracting the number of deceased from the total number of bodies. This information helps the FRMs' second priority of informing headquarters of what additional rescue and medical supplies are needed. Based on these responsibilities, one of the current gaps appears to be that FRMs are unable to estimate death at a distance to avoid potentially deadly situations that may endanger their own safety. Such a distant decision-aid device with additional death determination capabilities may help FRMs better manage resources.","Dying is a process that varies over time. People who are alive have higher energy than deceased people. Physiological factors such as physical wellness and exertion create changes in the energy level over the living process. This leads to a much larger variance in energy fluctuation of living people relative to deceased people. Furthermore, the path each individual takes from a high energy life state to a low energy death state can vary drastically from person to person, causing a hysteresis loop. This phase transition phenomenon is analogous to a process in physics in which small magnetic domain walls re-adjust themselves under an increasing external magnetic field. As a result, the net magnetization varies, as does the dying process. In biology, the muscle response in lung tissue has demonstrated a hysteresis loop and people with chronic illnesses may get stuck in hysteresis with their health constantly cycling between high and low energy levels.","Some people may mistakenly declare death in the absence of detectable vital signs. This erroneous reasoning is due to the implicit bi-state assumption (if they are not alive, they are dead) and thus, negating the converse is not always right. In fact, there is a third category where a person who is not dead has no vital signs and these vitals can be restored with medical intervention, like resuscitation. Also, a person in a tow energy state, e.g. comas, persistent vegetative states, or drug overdoses, may have feeble vital signs and are still alive, but in a unstable critical condition. This large variation of vitality signs may lead to false determinations of death. Thus, tow energy indications of death are needed.","In nature, scavenger turkey vultures circulate over forests seeking dead rotten animals. How do birds locate, from above the forest trees, dead animals without seeing them? How do flies discover animals within minutes of death to lay fertilized eggs? They can smell death, which is known as peri-mortem (PM) odorants and which increases over time after death. The root cause of these volatile biomarker PM molecules is the cessation of white blood cell circulation, which leads to the buildup of bacterial byproducts. Bacteria proliferating without physiological inhibition and incomplete oxidation releasing reactive free radicals can break down large quantities of cellular tissues, releasing volatile byproducts in a PM plume around the body. Over time (days to years), PM molecules evolve into smaller post-mortem molecules, e.g. methyl mercaptan (CHSH). Thus, mortem signs are defined, in this disclosure, as the full molecular spectrum of volatile biomarker molecules from peri-mortem to post-mortem.","Multiple functional systems are integrated to configure a portable handheld decision-aid device for first responder medics (FRM). Fuzzy membership functions of \u201clife\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d are used to determine the status of fallen people using remote measurements. State of the art EO\/IR cameras can be used to detect and identify casualties in a mass injury situation, while also estimating body temperature. Using the temperature, along with the remote estimation of a second vital sign, the life membership proportion can be estimated from the ground truth by using a 2D projection of stable vital signs. The other fuzzy membership function, death, can be estimated by the presence or absence of peri-mortem and post-mortem molecules. These molecules are only released after death and provide a certain indication of death. Solid state UV laser resonance Raman backscattering from these molecules allows the device to analyze the molecules present in a plume around the casualty. Based on the results of a Boolean rule-based expert system, these fizzy memberships allow remote determination of death. This information is displayed on a touch screen display that allows user input\/output, as well as global positioning system (GPS) geo-location of the user and all identified casualties. Transceiver capabilities allow multiple FRMs to communicate and collaborate at the scene and transmit situational awareness reports back to headquarters so that medical logistics (personnel and supplies be managed. The ability of this device to identify deceased individuals from a remote (ball field) distance allows FRMs to maximize their medical attention to attend to the critically injured casualties without placing their own lives in danger from conditions such as crossfire and hostile baited traps.","An exemplary handheld portable device combines distant measurements of vital and mortem signs in joint membership sets based on a synergism between physics and physiology. The main vital signs are usually respiration rate (RR), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and temperature. Currently, laser vibrometery determines RR, radar micro-Doppler is used for HR, and body temperature is determined by Infrared images. FRMs also determine in-situ the neurophysiological responses, such as pupil reactivity to a shining blue pen light, muscle reaction to sharp poking stimuli, or hand-applied pressure to the neck for spinal nerve response. This set of measurements is not included in the current distant death consideration for two reasons: cessation of these measured vital signs helps but does not necessarily decide death of a specific body and the SWaP (size, weight and power) of these instrumentations is not yet compatible with a handheld device. Therefore, at a distance, incomplete vital signs become an open set that is difficult to quantify as useful death features.","In one aspect, such a decision-aid at a distance is a sensor-processor platform that fuses some useful features into a portable handheld device that uses resonant Raman ultraviolet (UV) laser (\u02dc240 nm wavelength) to identify a deceased individual from the plume backscattering. Cellular phone-like electro-optical\/infrared (EO\/IR) pin-hole cameras can take day\/night images to automatically determine the geo-locations of warm bodies from the heat contrast signature in a colder environment. The device uses, together with entries of known scene landmarks and the location of the device, differential global positioning system (GPS) to triangulate the location of each body. Such a device can be equipped with an Inertial Guidance Unit (IGU) to further help the FRM accurately aim the Raman laser gun at the correct bearing angle to measure the plume backscattering intensity from the body. Thus, the ability to estimate plume molecules from a distance by Raman UV laser provides FRMs with a more accurate estimation of death.","In another aspect, a UV laser system can use compact solid state circuitry together with a smart Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU accesses a storage memory space where a list of backscattering spectrums is used to determine if any of the molecules present are PM or post-mortem. Since the open set of features cannot be normalized to the unit probability, a fuzzy membership function must be adopted to allow a crisp Boolean logic to address a rule-based lookup system. This is known in Artificial Intelligence as fuzzy logic and is used in this device to determine the likelihood of death. Additionally, the device can subtract from the EOIR cameras' estimation of the total number of immobile but warm bodies the number of deceased people to automatically order medical supplies from the headquarters. FRMs can use the system to re-organize the list of unstable critical people.","Mutual collaboration is possible through a cellular phone-like automatic wireless communication among FRMs and triage headquarters to provide situational awareness of the overall casualty scene. Currently, the digital wireless Medical Communication for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) is being used to link FRMs to a centralized database of military electronic medical records. The device is designed to be integrated with and made compatible to current MC4 hand-held devices.","Currently, first responders assess vital signs in-situ by measuring patients,  illustrates exemplary ranges of stable and unstable vital signs in which vital signs must be within an optimal range to be stable. Anything too high or too low results in unstable vitals and may indicate that there is something wrong with the person. Specifically, as shown in , if the vital sign falls within a certain range , then they have normal stable vitals. However, if the vital signs are too low, , or too high, , they are unstable because the body is not in equilibrium. Some essential vital signs include the four main vitals (HR, RR, BP, and temperature) and pupil reactivity. Other possible vital signs include pain, oxygen saturation, and reaction to painful stimuli.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","202","210"]},"Embodiment 1 shown in  uses body temperature and blood pressure to estimate if those values correspond to stable, , or unstable, , vital signs. These remote estimations can be obtained from infrared (IR) cameras and laser speckle. Quantitative IR cameras, or imaging radiometers, are able to determine the exact temperature of an object remotely. This allows the FRM to remotely estimate body temperature of the suspected casualty. When coherent light reflects off rough surfaces, it creates an interference known as laser speckle. This interference blurs the image; however, if something on or below the reflecting surface is moving, e.g. blood under skin, the motion can be tracked by the further blurring of the image. Knowing the lens geometry of the imaging camera, the blood flow velocity can be calculated by measuring the time it takes the increased Huffiness to move across the field of view. From the conservation of energy, it is know that the sum of potential and kinetic energy will remain constant. (Constant=P+\u00bd\u03c1v). By occluding blood flow (v=0), the pressure measurement is equivalent to the constant. Once the constant is known, the measured blood flow velocity and constant can be used to estimate blood pressure. This estimation is valid due to the non-Newtonian flow characteristics of the viscoelastic rheology of blood.","Fuzzy logic (FL) is a method of determining membership when the boundaries between each group are unclear, ambiguous, and\/or subjective. The logic behind the reasoning is clear; the boundaries between groups are not. Following a Boolean logic truth table, each input is placed in an output category. The FL system described below determines if a person is dead or not based on the vital and mortem signs recorded.  shows a crisp Boolean truth table  that indicates the relationship between vital and mortems. Such an exemplary Boolean logic truth table as shown in  can be used to determine the outcome status of a casualty. The inputs are stable and unstable vitals, along with peri-mortem and post-mortem molecules. The possible outcomes are minor injury , critical , dead , and no-man's zone .","Vital signs are high energy indications of life; mortem signs are low energy indications of death. While there are a large variety of vital signs that can be examined (HR, RR, BP, temperature, pain, eye pupil reactivity, nerve response, etc.), there are two main mortem signs: the release of peri-mortem (PM) and post-mortem molecules. These are molecules that result as the byproduct of bacteria or the cessation of blood flow and are released immediately upon death. Because blood flow has stopped, carbon dioxide waste accumulates in the blood, making the overall internal environment more reductive. This begins the decomposition process after death, which results in the production of volatile molecules. These gases escape through any opening in the body and form a plume around the dead body. The molecules released immediately after death are the larger PM ones. Over time, PM molecules break down and form smaller post-mortem molecules. As decomposition progresses, so does the amount of PM molecules generated and released therefore making the amount of PM molecules approximately proportional to the amount of time since death. Research has identified more than 400 decomposition odor molecules released weeks to years after death, making them post-mortem molecules. (See, e.g., Vass, Arpad, et. al., \u201cDecompositional Odor Analysis Database,\u201d J, of Forensic Sci., Vol. 49, No. 4, July 2004.) Since mortem signs are unique indications of death, examining the combination of vital signs and mortem signs provide an accurate estimation of a person's status (alive or dead).","Looking at each individual combination in , the combination of stable vital signs and PM molecules, , indicates that the person is injured but stable. This is classified as a minor injury, which means that they do not require immediate attention from the FRM. Unstable vitals with PM molecules, , indicate a more serious injury that requires immediate attention. This is a critical injury which means the person may die if no immediate medical attention is provided. The first priority of FRMs is to attend to all these critical injuries. Therefore, this combination of vital and mortem signs is the most significant. The third possible case involves unstable vitals and post-mortem molecules, . This combination corresponds to death. Since post-mortem molecules are formed some time after death, their presence indicates that the person has been dead for awhile and medical attention will not help save them. This is an important category because if FRMs know who is already dead, they will not waste time verifying death while critically injured people who may be saved die. There is a fourth case: stable vital signs and post-mortem molecules, . However, this is not a feasible option since the presence of post-mortem molecules is an irrefutable indication that the person is dead. Therefore, they should not have stable vital signs. To indicate that this combination of inputs is not possible,  is referred to as \u201cNo Man's Zone.\u201d There is no category for uninjured people since they are mobile and can walk away after the incident. The measurements taken by the device are only on immobile bodies.","By applying the truth table, , to the two inputs, the system is able to determine the output (status).  illustrates the process used to convert inputs into outputs. Specifically,  relates to fuzzy logic calculation of output membership in which two exemplary inputs are graphed and the intersection of their values (minimum) is taken to determine the output membership. The final status is identified by the location of the centroid. The two inputs, , are each comprised of two components. The vital signs of a person will be the percentage of stable, , and unstable, , features that are remotely determined by the device. This estimation is obtained by using , a table that calculates the overall stability of vital signs based on remote measurements of two vital signs, e.g. T and BP. Accordingly,  relates to remote estimation of vital signs in which two exemplary vital signs of blood pressure and temperature as remotely measured are tabulated. Likewise, the mortem signs input are comprised of two portions: PM molecule, , and post-mortem molecule, , concentration. The concentration of each is determined by a resonance Raman UV laser system, which analyses the intensity of the plume molecule backscattering. Using the proportions of each input segment (stable and unstable vitals, PM and post-mortem molecules), they are placed into the Boolean 2\u00d72 truth table, , to calculate the intersection of the interaction. This is done by comparing each combination of vital and mortem sign and taking the minimum value. For example,  represents the outcome of unstable vital sign  and PM molecule . The values of  and  are compared and the system takes the smaller proportion value to be the output value Z in . The completed table  corresponds to the logic truth table , with each Z value corresponding to an output status (minor injury, critical, dead, and no man's zone).","Every Z value calculated on table  is then graphed onto the output membership graph . For example, the proportion value given  is used to shade in the same proportion in , which is the Z output value (critical). After the output membership function  has been determined, the location of its centroid indicates what the final output is.","A graphical representation of this method is shown on . Specifically,  illustrates exemplary remotely measured vital and mortem signs, e.g., by medics. Stable  and unstable  vital signs are graphed on the vertical axis while PM molecules  and post-mortem molecules  are graphed on the horizontal axis. The output is determined by taking the two inputs as the coordinates of the outcome. The estimation of stable and unstable vitals obtained from  determines the one coordinate while the proportion of peri- and post-mortem molecules specifies a second coordinate. Taken together, these two coordinates indicate a point location in the output function as a minor injury , a critical injury , a dead person , or in no man's zone .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["8","9","710","711"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 7","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 7","FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["810","820","830","831","832","833","834","1","2","3","4","840","841","1","2","3","4","4","901","810","820","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1","2","11","12"]},"Another component attached to the CPU is two cell-phone-like cameras  that take day and night photos. Some possible embodiments include the OmniVision OV14810-A16A camera chip for day images and the circuitry from the FLIr i7 Infrared camera for night images. A communication chip  is connected to both the CPU and the EO\/IR cameras. A possible transceiver is the OneChip Photonics Gigabit Passive Optical Network SIT our. These two parts,  and , make up the phone-like cameras and communication component of the device .","The EO\/IR cameras  are also part of the man-machine interaction interface . Other components in this interface include the battery , keyboard , GPS , and touch screen display . Each of the components in  is also connected to the CPU . The EO\/IR cameras use the day\/night images to automatically determine the possible locations of casualties by their warm heat signature compared to the colder environment. These locations are marked on the touch screen display  of maps. The GPS takes these locations and triangulates the exact geo-location using the known position of the device and any known scene landmarks, A terrain map with the marked goo-location can be accessed on the touch screen so that medics know which direction each body is located in. The battery is used to power the device, including the keyboard and touch screen display.","A User I\/O fusion  allows ground truth data  to be entered by the user on the touch screen display . The ground truth data  is obtained from the EO\/IR cameras , GPS , and information entered manually by the user on the touch screen display . In future generations of the device, the user can confirm the life\/death decision determined by the user. The information will be stored in the memory  for future use.","The last major component of the device circuitry is the Resonance Raman Processor , which is comprised of the resonance Raman System  and a solid state UV laser I\/O . The laser, such as a RPMC FP-2 solid state 266 nm Nd:YAG microchip laser, is used to obtained the correct resonant Raman frequency needed for the PM molecules. This 4th harmonic laser can be pulsed to obtain to the correct resonance frequency needed to detect PM and post-mortem molecules. The Raman system  measures the inelastic backscattered light from the UV laser hitting the plume molecules. Such a system could use a Raman Spectrometer microsystem on a chip. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,505,128 B2 Zribi et al.) When light hits a molecule, a minute amount is reflected back at a different frequency. The difference between the incidence light and the backscattered light, known as the Raman shift, is unique for each molecule. In resonance Raman, the incidence light's frequency is adjusted so that the scattered light corresponds to the molecule's electronic transition energy. This makes the intensity of the Raman backscattering up to 104 times larger and allows the minute amounts to be detected. After the Raman system has measured the plume backscattering, it accesses a library of known molecular spectrums to determine the identity and concentration of the molecules present. The information is then sent to the CPU, which contains a list of PM and post-mortem molecules stored in memory, to determine if the molecules present are mortem signs.","To determine if the person is dead or alive, the device uses the information from the Resonance Raman Processor  (which remotely measures mortem signs and the EO\/IR cameras (which remotely measures vital signs) as inputs in a fuzzy logic rule based table  that is stored in memory . These rules are set and are used to define what the output status is based on the inputs (as shown in ) in this design, the I\/O data is used in the Boolean truth table to determine the outcome. In future embodiments, the fuzzy logic evolves with the data to sharpen the boundary lines between the decisions so that a no-man's zone decision does not occur. This method would use the I\/O data, which is later verified by the user, to modify the fuzzy logic rules based on ground truth data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["1111","1112","1111","1112","1120","1113"]},"Some common features across every display screen are the top bar with important information such as date, time, and location, and the buttons along the bottom of the screen. The top bar  contains the date, location in words and latitude\/longitude, and the battery status. This bar automatically updates with the device's location and local time using satellite signals from the GPS. The location is also given in latitude and longitude for more precise geo-location. The battery image reflects the amount of energy left in the battery before it must be recharged. Some of the buttons along the bottom of the screen are for a screen backlight , the main menu , a toggle between geo-location and EO\/IR view , an individual statistics , situational awareness summary , logistics summary , resonance Raman system power button , vital sign measurements button , and a button to provide directions to a body . These buttons are always present.","The light button  turns on a small backlight so that the display can be visible in dark or obscured conditions. The main menu  takes the user to a list of all possible functions of the device. Individual statistics  list the injury and medical information for each patient. The file is started when remote measurements are taken and recorded for each body. When the FRM eventually attends to the casualties, the rest of the file, including personal information and injury information, is updated. The situational awareness button  takes the user to a screen summarizing the scene, breaking down each casualty into the possible categories (dead, critical, minor injury) and listing the geo-location for each one. Additionally, a summary of the supplies needed to care for all the people who are not dead is listed. The logistics  function displays a more detailed listing of what medical supplies and help is needed.
