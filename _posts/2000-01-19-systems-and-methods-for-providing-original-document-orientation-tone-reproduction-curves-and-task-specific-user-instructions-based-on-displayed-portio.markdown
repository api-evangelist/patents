Field of Invention","This invention is directed to a graphical user interface for an image capture device, such as a scanner.","2. Description of Related Art","Scanners and other types of image capture devices have become ubiquitous office productivity tools for generating electronic images of physical original documents. Once an electronic image of a physical original document has been generated, the electronic image data can be used in an infinite variety of ways to increase the productivity and the product quality of an office. Such image capture devices include desktop scanners, other stand-alone scanners, digital still cameras, digital video cameras, the scanning input portions of digital copiers, facsimile machines and other multi-function devices that are capable of generating electronic image data from an original document, and the like. These image capture devices can also include image databases that store previously captured electronic image data.","However, as the cost of scanners and other image capture devices has dropped and the output quality of the captured electronic image data has improved, scanners and other image capture devices have been provided with an ever-increasing number of controllable features. Similarly, as users have become comfortable with capturing and using electronic image data obtained from original documents, the uses to which the electronic image data has been put, and thus the needed control over the quality and appearance of the electronic image data, have expanded greatly.","In response, standard interfaces between such image capture devices, including those indicated above, and the various application programs that use such captured electronic image data have been developed. These standard interfaces allow standard-compliant image capture devices and standard-compliant applications to easily communicate. One exemplary embodiment of such a standard interface is the TWAIN\u2122 interface. The TWAIN\u2122 interface allows any TWAIN\u2122-compliant application program to input and use electronic image data using any TWAIN\u2122-compliant image capture device.","The TWAIN\u2122-compliant component protocol facilitates communication between application programs and image capture devices, such as those indicated above. One such TWAIN\u2122 image capture device is the XEROX\u00ae DigiPath\u2122 scanner.","The ever-increasing numbers of features provided by image capturing devices, such as the Xerox\u00ae DigiPath\u2122 scanner, cause users of these image capturing devices to find it increasingly difficult to obtain the desired scanning results.","In particular, the various features provided by imaging capturing devices, such as the Xerox\u00ae FireStar\u2122 are accessible through a complicated graphical user interface that includes a number of tabs and large number of dropdown boxes, pop-up boxes, dropdown menus, and the like. Accordingly, even sophisticated users can have trouble remembering how to accomplish specific tasks that can be accomplished by appropriate interacting with the graphical user interface. While this graphical user interface includes a Help function, the Help function is often inadequate to easily guide the user in accomplishing a desired task. As a result, users often forego performing desired tasks.","This invention provide systems, methods and graphical user interface control elements that allow the user to access task-specific instructions for various tasks.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that display a list of tasks that are specific to the particular graphical user interface control elements currently displayed to the user.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that provide a task-specific user instruction graphical user interface accessible through a task-specific user instruction access button, where the task-specific user instruction graphical user interface provides a detailed description of the steps needed to perform a selected task.","This invention additionally provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that provide, in the task-specific user instruction graphical user interface, a list of selectable related tasks.","This invention further provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that provide in the task-specific user instruction graphical user interface, selectable elements that link terms and phrases in the task description to either or both of conventional help information or lists of tasks related to the selected selectable element.","In various exemplary embodiments of this invention, various displayable portions of the scanner control graphical user interface include a task-specific user instruction access button. Selecting the task-specific user instruction access button causes a pop-up menu to be displayed listing tasks that can be accomplished using, at least in part, various ones of the control elements displayed in the currently displayed portion of the scanner control graphical user interface. Upon selecting one of the selectable task items in the pop-up menu, a task-specific user instruction graphical user interface is displayed. In a task instruction portion of the task-specific user instruction graphical user interface, the user is provided with a detailed set of instructions for accomplishing the selected task. In a related tasks portion, the user is provided with a list of selectable elements that identify tasks related to the selected task.","Additionally, the task description in the task instruction portion may include one or more selectable terms used in the task description. Selecting a selectable term allows the user to either access the help entries on the selected term and\/or causes a new list of selectable tasks to be displayed in the related tasks portion. These new tasks are tasks related to the selected term.","In addition to providing the above task specific user instructions, there is a need for other features to obtain desired scanning results.","In particular, one such feature provided by image forming devices and image capturing devices is the ability to finely control various image quality response curves. One such response curve is the tone reproduction curve (TRC). In particular, in some image forming devices and image capture devices, it is possible to finely control the tone reproduction curve beyond merely providing the conventional lower-resolution indication that the entire output image should be lighter or darker than the entire input image.","Accordingly, to enable this fine control, the user is often provided with a graphical user interface that allows the user to define a number of points to which a response curve is to be fit. Once the various points are defined, a response curve is fit to or through these points. However, even sophisticated users have trouble intuitively appreciating the effects of this adjusted response curve in converting the input image values to the output image values. Thus, it is often different for even sophisticated users to use the graphical user interface shown in  to obtain the desired output image.","This invention thus provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that allow the user to finely control a response curve of an image quality for an image forming or capture device in a more intuitive manner.","This invention separately provides substrate, methods and graphical user interfaces that provide a plurality of slider portions that allow the user to more intuitively control the image quality response curve.","This invention separately provides systems and methods and graphical user interfaces that include slider portions that mimic control elements of conventional control panels.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that provide control elements for controlling portions of an image quality response curve that each closely mimic the conventional lightness\/darkness controls of a photocopier.","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces according to this invention, an image quality response curve control graphical user interface includes a plurality of slider portions. Each slider corresponds to a point, or a range of points, of the image quality response curve. The slider portions are arranged so that the points, or range of points, associated with each slider portion are themselves arranged in an easily understandable order. Each slider portion indicates, for the associated point, or range of points, of the input image the image value of the output image for that point, or for that range of points.","In various exemplary embodiments, the appearance of a portion of each of the slider portions is altered based on the selected image value of the output image for the point, or the range of points, of the input image. Thus, the user can intuitively appreciate the effects of adjustments made to the image quality response curve, such as a tone reproduction curve.","In addition to providing the above task specific user instructions and tone reproduction curves, there is a need for other features to obtain desired scanning results.","For example, original documents are often provided to an image capture device in such a way that the resulting captured images, when provided to an imaging application, are upside down, rotated 90\u00b0, or cut off. These incorrect orientations occur because the original documents were incorrectly loaded into the image capture device. Typically, image capture devices, such as the exemplary production scanner  shown in , have markings on the document handler  that indicate how the original documents are to be put into the scanner. Unfortunately, these markings are often, if not usually, ignored when the original documents are loaded into the document handler  in favor of a desired orientation of the user. As can be imagined, this is particularly troublesome when a large number of original documents are placed into an automatic document handler in the wrong orientation, such that a large number of essentially unusable image capture operations are performed.","This invention thus provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that allow the user to select the orientation of an image capture operation of an original document.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that indicate to an operator the orientation an original document should have when fed into the image capture device to obtain a captured image having the desired orientation","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces of this invention, a document orientation portion, or input document mimic, of the graphical user interfaces provides a visual indication to the user of the orientation of the original documents to be captured that will result in the desired orientation of the captured image being obtained. In particular, based on various selected image capture parameters input by the user, the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces of this invention determine and display one or more visual cues to the user that indicate the orientation of the original document that will allow the image capture device to capture an image of the original document that corresponds to the image capture parameters selected by the user. In various other exemplary embodiments of the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces of this invention, an image orientation portion of the graphical user interfaces allows the user to specify the orientation of the original document to be used when capturing an image of the original documents. In response, the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces of this invention aid the user in selecting the proper other image capture","These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or are apparent from the following detailed description of various embodiments of the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces according to this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00049","num":"00049"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","130","131","132","131","120","133"]},"It should be appreciated that the electronic image data capture device can also be referred to as variously, a scanner, an image capture device, an electronic image data generating device, or the like, and, regardless of the name, can be any one of a stand-alone scanner, a digital copier, a facsimile machine, a multi-function device, a digital still camera, a digital video camera, an electronic image database storing previously generated electronic image data, or any other known or later device that is capable of generating (or supplying) electronic image data from an original document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00051","num":"00051"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","210","220","230","240","210","100","210","212","250","250","210","220","230"]},"The protocol layer  includes a TWAIN\u2122 code portion  of the TWAIN\u2122 driver (or data source) , a source manager  and a TWAN\u2122 code portion  of a TWAIN\u2122-compliant application .
