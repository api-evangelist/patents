Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/509,226 filed Jul. 19, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of Wee-1 kinase, methods of making the compounds, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds.","In order to undergo proper cell division, eukaryotic cells must faithfully replicate their genome and then correctly segregate their chromosomes into two daughter cells. This process of cell division, also called the cell cycle, is a step-wise process that is governed by checkpoints to ensure genomic integrity. Upon completion of DNA replication (S-phase), cells enter a growth phase (G2-phase) prior to proceeding into mitosis for chromosome segregation (M-phase). A key regulator of mitosis is the kinase Cdk1 (as called Cdc2) (Nurse, P. (1990) Universal control mechanism regulating onset of M-phase. Nature 344, 503-508.). Activation of Cdk1 results in the onset of mitosis, and its subsequent inactivation initiates the exit from mitosis. Cdk1 is activated by the binding of Cyclin A or Cyclin B. Both Cyclin A-Cdk1 and Cyclin B-Cdk1 complexes function to initiate mitosis (Lindqvist, A., et. Al. (2009) The decision to enter mitosis: feedback and redundancy in the mitotic entry network. The Journal of cell biology 185, 193-202.). The degradation of Cyclin B triggers the inactivation of Cdk1, resulting in the mitotic exit and entry into a growth (G1) phase prior to beginning a new round of the cell cycle (Glotzer, M., et al. (1991) Cyclin is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway. Nature 349, 132-138.).","In addition to Cyclins, Cdk1 is also regulated by Wee1, an atypical tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates Cdk1 on tyrosine 15 (Y15) and inactivates Cdk1 (McGowan, C. H., et al. (1993) Human Wee1 kinase inhibits cell division by phosphorylating p34cdc2 exclusively on Tyr15. The EMBO journal 12, 75-85.; Parker, L. L., et al. (1992) Inactivation of the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex by the human WEE1 tyrosine kinase. Science (New York, N.Y. 257, 1955-1957.). Wee1 is a critical negative regulator of Cdk1 and functions at the G2-M phase checkpoint to ensure that DNA replication has been completed and the genome is not damaged prior to entering mitosis (O'Connell, et al. (1997) Chk1 is a wee1 kinase in the G2 DNA damage checkpoint inhibiting cdc2 by Y15 phosphorylation. The EMBO journal 16, 545-554.). Loss of Wee1 can result in premature entry into mitosis, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and cell death (Stumpff, J., et al. (2004) Wee1 kinase regulates Cdk1 and mitotic entry during embryogenesis. Curr Biol 14, 2143-2148.). Furthermore, many cancers are defective in their G1-phase checkpoints and are reliant on G2-M phase checkpoints (Sancar, A., et al. (2004) Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints. Annual review of biochemistry 73, 39-85.). Indeed, loss of expression of Wee1 has been shown to lead to the abrogation of the G2-M phase checkpoint and sensitize tumor cells to DNA damage, especially tumors that have lost their G1-phase checkpoint due to a deficiency in the p53 protein (Wang, Y., et al. (2004) Knockdown of Chk1, Wee1 and Myt1 by RNA interference abrogates G2 checkpoint and induces apoptosis. Cancer biology & therapy 3, 305-313.).","Inhibitors of Wee1 have the potential to selectively cause lethality in cancerous cells that are defective in other cell cycle checkpoints, while sparing normal tissues that can activate other cell cycle checkpoints. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of Wee1 would be beneficial for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other cell proliferative disorders.","The present invention has numerous embodiments.

Examples of such substituents include ethynyl, 2-propynyl, 3-propynyl, 2-butynyl, and 3-butynyl and the like.","The term \u201ccarbocyclyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d), partially saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkenyl\u201d), or completely unsaturated (i.e., \u201caryl\u201d) hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms (\u201cring atoms\u201d are the atoms bound together to form the ring or rings of a cyclic substituent). A carbocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure.","A carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure, which typically contains from 3 to 8 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single-ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl (cyclopropanyl), cyclobutyl (cyclobutanyl), cyclopentyl (cyclopentanyl), cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl (cyclohexanyl), cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enyl, and adamantanyl. In a fused-ring carbocyclyl system, two or more rings may be fused together, such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of two- or three-fused ring carbocyclyls include naphthalenyl, tetrahydronaphthalenyl (tetralinyl), indenyl, indanyl (dihydroindenyl), anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, and decalinyl.","The term \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms. A cycloalkyl may be a single carbon ring, which typically contains from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms and more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of single-ring cycloalkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. A cycloalkyl may alternatively be polycyclic or contain more than one ring. Examples of polycyclic cycloalkyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls.","The term \u201caryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic carbocyclyl containing from 6 to 14 carbon ring atoms. An aryl may be monocyclic or polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). In the case of polycyclic aromatic rings, only one ring the polycyclic system is required to be unsaturated while the remaining ring(s) may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated. Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, indenyl, indanyl, and tetrahydronapthyl.","In some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix \u201cC-C-\u201d, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, \u201cC-C-alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C-C-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms.","The term \u201chydrogen\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as \u2014H.","The term \u201chydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014OH.","The term \u201ccarboxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014OH.","The term \u201camino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014NH.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014I).","If a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted\u201d, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","The prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical.

The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and\/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2\u2032-deoxynucleotide, 2\u2032-OCH-containing ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-F-ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand.","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF, or C-met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.","Alkylating agents include altretamine, AMD-473, AP-5280, apaziquone, bendamustine,
