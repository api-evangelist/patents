title: Generic paging service for third-party applications over wireless networks
abstract: System(s), method(s), and device(s) that provide generic paging service for applications, including third-party applications, over a wireless network are presented. A mobile device generates a token that is used to prove an existing relationship with, and is provided to, an application server, which can relate to a third-party application. The server includes a paging initiator component that presents the token to a paging coordinator component in the network to facilitate proving the server's relationship with, and triggering paging of, the mobile device, without the server having to establish a prior relationship with the network. The paging coordinator component can verify the token to ensure that the initiated paging event is a legitimate paging, and, when verified, transmits the paging to the mobile device. In response, the mobile device can switch out of power-saving dormant mode and establish an IP connection to the server to retrieve a notification(s).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject innovation generally relates to wireless communications, and, more particularly, to generic paging service for third-party applications over wireless networks (e.g., cellular wireless networks).","Many wireless communication devices (e.g., cellular phones, laptop computers, etc.) have the ability to access the Internet to receive data from or send data to other communication devices (e.g., servers). Communication networks, such as cellular mobile networks are striving to provide always-on Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to wireless communication devices. For instance, Mobile IP (MIP) and its variants, such as Proxy MIP and Dual Stack MIP, are being employed to provide IP layer continuity across handoffs and reachability to communication devices. MIP also is being utilized to perform routing support for roaming, multi-network interworking, and vertical handoffs.","Meanwhile, the wired Internet has been employing persistent connections to services and\/or client-initiated pull with periodic or more intelligent schedules based on various user and network activities in order to provide reachability at the application layer. In some instances, this can achieve the appearance of constant or near real-time reachability to users. Some examples involve email, instant chat, RSS feeds, and presence services (e.g., email clients polling their servers periodically, instant messaging clients maintaining open sockets to their servers at all times if possible). This is due to the dynamic nature of most end-host IP address assignments, and the extensive use of Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) that prevents application servers from discovering their clients' IP addresses and initiating connections when needed.","MIP can provide IP address preservation during handoff across multiple IP subnets via tunnels to Home Agents (HAs), thus applications and the transport layer (e.g., transmission control protocol (TCP)) do not see IP address changes. This allows existing IP connections (or sockets) to survive subnet changes, thus allowing Voice over IP (VoIP) or streaming media sessions to work without modification, e.g., session continuity. However, besides the above two applications and other similar applications, most IP applications do not require session continuity but rather reachability at the application layer, e.g., to be notified of events of interest rather than having IP packets delivered at all times (which is one way, but not the only way, to achieve reachability). This is applicable, for example, during idle periods under dormant power\u2014a save state widely used in mobile communication devices to achieve long standby performance. Other connections can deal with IP address changes during handoffs via reconnection (e.g., web browsers) and other application specific countermeasures, such as session initiated protocol (SIP) mobility or IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) service continuity (SC).","Paging also can be handled using wide area two-way paging networks, where the paging services use large cells and low rate high-power radio channels to deliver small amount of texts that were combined into email messages on compatible devices. In certain instances, such a system can use networks such as CDPD and MobiTex that can use permanent logical connections (i.e., an assigned IP address that never changes and can serve as a permanent ID mapped to layer  paging). Another conventional paging system involves the use of several datacenters that handle notifications and the delivery of messages in relatively small fragments (e.g., 2 kbytes). These datacenters are connected to specified servers via persistent connections through firewalls. The specified servers interface with email and other desired systems. The actual notification from the infrastructure to the client devices are handled in a manner that requires prior arrangements with wireless data network carriers, by querying HLR and triggering layer  paging (if there is no connection open to a client such as when the client has been idle for awhile).","Another form of conventional paging involves special SMS notifications that automatically trigger email clients to initiate IP connections to their servers. The SMS messages contain specially encoded information to indicate specific actions that the client needs to take and the SMS messages are invisible to users as the messages are not exposed to the normal SMS user interfaces. This form of paging has been disfavored, due to the cost of SMS messages and its non-guaranteed delivery and variable delays.","Yet another form of conventional paging involves using a persistent socket connection to achieve a \u201cdirect push\u201d service for real-time updates for email, calendar, and contacts. By adjusting the timing of heartbeat-like messages between the client software on mobile devices and their exchange servers, the protocol attempts to maintain a persistent transmission control protocol (TCP) socket connection that has been originally initiated by the client, potentially through firewalls, and network address port translation (NAPT) devices. The bearer management protocols over cellular mobile networks may tear down the transport service for the persistent connection, but may provide an on-demand reactivation if the same IP address is reserved for the mobile device for a certain period of time. Otherwise, the bearer transport service may be released unbeknownst to the mobile device's IP stack (although the radio interface may be aware of this), and the IP address of the mobile device returned to a pool of IP addresses. The loss of heartbeat packets from server detected by timeouts indicates that the persistent connection has been broken and triggers a new connection establishment by the mobile device. The failure and the success of heartbeat message deliveries at expected intervals adjust the timing of next messages from the client and the server until the approximate longest heartbeat interval that still maintains the connection is found. The client also initiates a new connection when its main radio interface in use is changed between cellular and Wi-Fi, or obtains a new IP address in any case. As this is performed without informing the user, it is possible to achieve the appearance of nearly real-time notification from the server. While there is a working connection, the notifications from the server reaches the client promptly. If there is not a working connection, the client attempts a new connection at the next opportunity possible, with increasingly less aggressive retry strategies as the number of failures increases, to gracefully handle when the mobile device moves out of coverage and loses all connectivity.","Thus, conventionally, paging of mobile devices has been performed by maintaining a long-living or persistent connection between the mobile device and a server and\/or paging from the infrastructure to a client mobile device has been handled in a manner that requires prior arrangements with wireless data network carriers.","It is desirable to provide paging services to mobile devices for updates, notifications, etc., with regard to applications and services from servers, particularly with regard to third-party applications, without the mobile devices having to maintain long-living or persistent TCP connections with the corresponding servers and without the servers, initiating the paging, having to establish a prior relationship with the operator networks.","The following presents a simplified summary of the innovation in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the invention nor delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The subject innovation provides systems, methods, and devices that provide generic paging service for applications, including third-party applications, over a wireless network are presented. In an aspect, a mobile device (e.g., cellular phone, wireless laptop computer, etc.) can generate a token that can be used to prove an existing relationship with an application server (e.g., email server, multimedia server, audio server, video server, news server, financial or stock information server, etc.), which can relate to or provide an application or service (e.g., a third-party application or service) to the mobile device, for example. The token can be provided by the mobile device to the application server via a network (e.g., a communication network that provides wireless connection and communication), and the application server can store the token, which can be utilized at a future desired time by the application server to facilitate paging the mobile device, when the application server desires to page the mobile device. The application server can be associated with the Internet and the network also can be associated with the Internet, and thus, the application server, via a paging coordinator component, which is associated with the network and Internet.","In another aspect, the application server can comprise a paging initiator component that can be used by the application server to facilitate paging mobile devices associated with the communication network. When the application server desires to page the mobile device, the paging initiator component can retrieve the token previously received from the mobile device and stored by the paging initiator component, and can present the token to the paging coordinator component in the network to facilitate proving the application server's relationship with, and triggering paging of, the mobile device, without the application server having to establish a prior relationship with the network.","In an aspect, the paging coordinator component can receive the token from the application server and can analyze the information contained in the token to facilitate verifying the token to ensure that the initiated paging event is a legitimate paging. If and when the paging coordinator component verifies the token, the paging coordinator component can page the mobile device, for example, utilizing layer  paging services (e.g., where the network is a mobile cellular network that has layer  paging services for voice, IP data, and SMS). In response, as desired, the mobile device, if it is in a power-saving dormant mode, can switch out of power-saving dormant mode and establish an IP connection to the application server to retrieve a notification(s) associated with the page.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the invention, then, comprises the features hereinafter fully described. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the invention. However, these aspects are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

In an aspect, example system  can include a desired number of user equipment (UE) (e.g., mobile and\/or wireless communication device, such as a mobile phone (e.g., 3GPP UMTS phone), personal digital assistant (PDA), computer, IP television (IPTV), gaming console, set-top box, printer, etc.), including UE  in a communication environment. The UE  can be located in a wireless portion (e.g., region) of the communication network, for example. Each UE  can be connected (e.g., wirelessly connected) to respective base stations, such as base station , that serve respective coverage areas to facilitate communication in the wireless communication environment. Each base station  can serve a respective coverage macro cell that can cover a specified area, and each base station  can service mobile wireless devices, such as UE , located in the respective area covered by the macro cell, where such coverage can be achieved via a wireless link (e.g., uplink (UL), downlink (DL)). When an attachment attempt is successful, the UE  can be served by the base station  and incoming voice and data traffic can be paged and routed to the UE  through the base station , and outgoing voice and data traffic from the UE  can be paged and routed through the base station  to other communication devices (e.g., another UE). In an aspect, the UE  can be connected and can communicate wirelessly using virtually any desired wireless technology, including, for example, cellular, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, wireless local area networks (WLAN), etc. It is to be appreciated and understood that, while  depicts one UE being served by one base station, the subject innovation is not so limited, as, in accordance with the subject innovation, there can be more than one UE, more than one base station, and\/or a base station can serve one or more UEs at a given time.","In an aspect, the base station  can be associated with a network  that can facilitate wireless communication of voice and data associated with communication devices, such as UE , in the communication network. The network  can facilitate routing voice and data communications between a communication device(s), such as UE , and other communication devices, such as, for example, a server  (e.g., application server), which can be an email server, a multimedia server, an audio server, a video server, a news server, a financial or stock information server, etc., and can relate to or provide an application or service (e.g., a third-party application or service) to the UE . The network  can be and\/or can comprise a core network(s) (e.g., PS core network, IMS core network, . . . ). The network  also can allocate resources to the UEs in the network, convert or enforce protocols, establish and enforce Quality of Service (QoS) for the UEs , provide applications or services in the network, translate signals, and\/or perform other desired functions to facilitate system interoperability and communication in the wireless communication network. The network  can include desired components, such as routers, nodes (e.g., SGSN, GGSN, etc.), switches, interfaces, controllers, etc., that can facilitate communication of data between communication devices in the communication network.","The network  can be associated with a paging coordinator component  that can facilitate enabling generic paging of communication devices, for example, using layer  paging capabilities, in accordance with various aspects as disclosed herein. The paging coordinator component  and server  each can be associated with the Internet  to facilitate communication, including paging, between the server  and the UE  via the network .","In a conventional communication network, communication devices can run non-operator provided software applications that provide notifications and updates from corresponding servers such as exchange servers or messaging servers. To achieve what approximates real-time notifications and updates, the devices attempt to maintain long-living or persistent TCP connections to the corresponding servers to achieve the appearance of immediate push notifications, where this is typically achieved with heartbeat-like periodic packets to refresh firewall\/network address translation (NAT) and cellular network states with various strategies for their timings. However, as more devices use such an approach, the cellular network will need to maintain bearer states longer and the communication devices will consume more battery power. Further, route optimization, dynamic IP address assignments, local breakout, etc., can be affected by many long-living TCP connections, especially MobileIP based route and session management techniques being adopted by network standards, such as fourth generation (4G) network standards. It is desirable to provide paging services to communication devices for updates, notifications, etc., with regard to applications and services from servers, particularly with regard to third-party applications, without the communication devices having to maintain long-living or persistent TCP connections with the corresponding servers and without the servers, initiating the paging, having to establish a prior relationship with the operator networks.","In contrast to conventional systems and techniques, the subject innovation can utilize existing layer  paging capabilities of mobile cellular networks to facilitate paging of communication devices (e.g., UE ) by a server(s) (e.g., ), for example, by providing a dynamic mapping between application layer identities and layer  identities. In an aspect, the UE  can include one or more client applications , where a client application  can generate and share (e.g., provide, transmit) a token(s) that can cryptographically prove an existing relationship with a corresponding server  (e.g., application server). The server  can include a paging initiator component  and can receive the token, which can be stored by the paging initiator component  in a data store, for example. When the server  desires to page the UE , the paging initiator component  can retrieve the token from its data store and can provide (e.g., transmit, communicate, . . . ) the token to the paging coordinator component , and the paging coordinator component  can analyze the token (e.g., analyze the information contained in the token) and can verify, or attempt to verify, the token to determine whether the server  has an existing and valid relationship with the UE . If and when the token is verified by the paging coordinator component , the paging coordinator component  can communicate the page to the UE . The UE  can receive the page, where, for example, if the UE  is in a dormant mode (e.g., power-saving dormant mode), the UE  can determine whether to transfer out of the dormant mode to an active mode or other desired mode (e.g., semi-active mode) and\/or whether to initiate a connection to the corresponding server . For instance, the UE  can initiate a connection to the server  by going through network entry process, obtaining an IP address (e.g., if no IP address is currently assigned to the UE ), and opening a socket.","As disclosed herein, the subject innovation can utilize existing layer  paging capabilities (e.g., existing data link layer paging capabilities) of mobile cellular networks to facilitate generic paging services. The paging service for voice call delivery has been in use in wireless cellular networks since the very beginning of cellular voice services, and has been extended to support paging to deliver SMS and IP data under certain circumstances (while IP address to layer  mobile identity mapping is active and known). The phone number of a UE  can be mapped to an International Mobile Subscriber ID (IMSI) as a permanent ID and its active International Mobile Electronic ID (IMEI): ID of mobile device hardware) can be known to the network (e.g., ). The location of the UE  can be tracked by the network  (e.g., using Home Location Register (HLR) and\/or Visited Location Register (VLR)) at various desired resolutions based at least in part on activity of the UE  and\/or other factors with the participation of UEs via location update protocols. At the time of call delivery, the base station  that can serve the UE  can be located via the respective paging protocols for respective and various cellular radio technologies. The proposed generic paging service of the subject innovation can take advantage of this existing function by exposing it to the applications (e.g., and corresponding servers ) on the Internet in a controlled manner via the paging coordinator component , which can be accessible from the Internet . In accordance with various embodiments, the paging coordinator component  can be part of, or can have very close relation to, the mobile network operator associated with the network .","In an aspect, a client application  on the UE  can initiate and connect to the server  (e.g., email server, messaging server, etc.) associated with the Internet . The UE  and the server  (and thus the paging initiator component ) can have an existing relationship and share a secret, such as a user name and\/or password, a personal identification number (PIN), etc. In accordance with a specified protocol, the client application  of the UE  can share an ID (e.g., identifier associated with the UE ) with the paging initiator component , the name of the paging coordinator component , and a token, such as more fully disclosed herein, that the paging initiator component  can use to facilitate proving to the paging coordinator component  that the server  has an existing relationship with the UE . The operating system (OS) of the UE  or the client application  can register the ID used for the particular server  with the paging coordinator component . In an aspect, depending on the level of privacy desired, registration of the ID used for the server  with the paging coordinator component  can be omitted by informing the paging initiator component  beforehand of a permanent ID for all servers that the UE  uses.","When the paging initiator component  of the server  desires to contact the UE  but does not have an active connection to the UE  (and associated client application , the paging initiator component  can connect to the paging coordinator component  and present the token associated with the client application  and optionally a short message to be delivered to the UE . This message need not be understood by the paging coordinator component  and can be encrypted if needed or desired. The paging coordinator component  can analyze the token and can verify or attempt to verify the token, such as more fully disclosed herein. If and when the token is verified, the paging coordinator component  can utilize the layer  paging protocol and layer  paging capabilities to locate the UE  and wake up the UE  from a dormant mode.","If and when the UE  connects to the network , the token, the short message, and\/or other information (e.g., the name of the paging initiator component ) can be delivered to the mobile client application  via layer  paging messages, a hidden SMS, or via a retrieval server over IP connection, for example. The client application  can receive the token, the short message, and\/or other information and can decide whether to initiate a connection to its corresponding server  that is initiating the paging, and, as desired, can initiate the connection to that server , for example, by going through network entry process, obtain IP address, and opening a socket. In an aspect, the OS on the UE  can employ a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to connect the information delivered via paging from a server(s)  to a registered client application(s) .","As a result, the subject innovation can allow infrequent notifications to be delivered to UEs  from servers  without having to maintain a long-living or persistent connection (e.g., TCP connection) between the UEs  and servers , and without a server , when initiating paging of a UE , having to establish a prior relationship with the operator network(s). Further, the subject innovation can employ the generic paging service for UEs  while enabling a UE  to be in power-saving dormant mode as long as possible and as often as possible, and can be employed without an IP address assigned to the UE  and with no resources of the network  necessarily being dedicated or allocated for the UE .","In an aspect, the token utilized by the subject innovation can ensure that only notifications stemming from existing relationships between a UE  and a server  can trigger paging of the UE , while not revealing the purpose or, if desired or needed, the identity of the paging initiator component , which initiated the notification, to the network  or other parties, for example, by use of aggregation, or relay services for tokens.","The tokens employed by the subject innovation can facilitate proving an existing relationship between the UE  and the server  (e.g., paging initiator). In an aspect, a token can be created or constructed by the UE  (e.g., the client application  of the UE ) such that the token can contain information that can establish proof of prior relationship between the UE  (and\/or associated client application ) and the server  (and\/or associated paging initiator component ), while revealing no further information, as desired. For example, the client application  can hash the respective identifiers of the UE  and the server  (and\/or associated paging initiator component ) (e.g., which can be arbitrarily created and known between the UE  and server ) and a shared secret between the UE  and the server . The UE  and the server  can generate their shared secret from the subscription trust relationship for the cellular service itself (e.g., shared secret can be based at least in part on the username and\/or password associated with the client application  and the server ), or by another desired arrangement, such as public key infrastructure (PKI). The client application  can generate a hash such that the hash, and the information (e.g., the respective identifiers of the UE  and the server ) that is hashed, can be correctly verified by the paging coordinator component , which can have knowledge regarding the hash function or other technique used to hide or obscure the information contained in the token from discovery by other entities (e.g., server ). When the server  desires to page the UE , in accordance with a specified paging protocol, the paging initiator component  can retrieve the previously received token associated with the UE  from the data store associated with the paging initiator component  and can present the token, comprising the hash along with the identifier information respectively associated with the UE  and the server , which can thereby facilitate proving an existing relationship between the UE  and the server . By using a well-known cryptographic hash function, it is extremely unlikely that a malicious paging initiator can guess many tokens correctly to cause sufficient overload to the paging coordinator component  or the wireless network. Also, it is straightforward to use PKI to sign the identities or other information to create a token of similar nature.","In still another aspect, it is not necessary for the token to be encrypted on its own, although the token can be encrypted, if desired. If the token were to be encrypted, such encryption may require existing trust relationships between the paging initiator component  and the paging coordinator component , which can be undesirable, as it can be desirable to allow for paging of the UE  by the server  without requiring an existing trust relationship between the server  (and associated paging initiator component ) and the paging coordinator component . Since the token can be transmitted without the token being encrypted, if the token is exposed during the transmission between the paging initiator component  and the UE  or the paging coordinator component , the token potentially can be abused to trigger unnecessary paging. Thus, in another aspect, it is desirable (e.g., and in the interest of the UE  and the network ) that the token is transmitted via a secure channel, such as a secure sockets layer (SSL) or other secure path (e.g., an ephemeral security or browser session-like SSL, or mutually authenticated channel can all serve the purpose). Since a paging initiator component may not have a strong incentive to protect a token, as desired, the paging coordinator component  and\/or the UE  can insist on using a secure channel and\/or can assign a desired lifetime to the token or rate-limit use of the token. The lifetime of the token can be added to the hash to protect its validity.","In accordance with another aspect or embodiment, the UE  can generate and use a one-time token that, as the name suggests, can be utilized one time by the server  (and associated paging initiator component ) to page the UE . When one-time tokens are employed, the UE  can issue another new token to the server  after a successful paging event. However, while the one-time token suggests that such token is only used one time, since it is possible that the paging coordinator component  may not be able to verify whether a paging triggered by a particular token has successfully led to a connection establishment between the UE  and the page-initiating server  and the subsequent issuance of a new token, as desired, the paging coordinator component  can allow the same token to be used more than one time (e.g., a specified or low number of times.) In accordance with various other aspects or embodiments, the other desired techniques for abuse detection and\/or blacklisting can be employed with the security measures employed with the tokens, as disclosed herein, to facilitate securing the tokens and minimizing undesired or malicious paging of the UEs .","It is desirable to maintain the privacy of the identity of the UE , for example, by not allowing or enabling the servers  to learn the identity of the UE . It also is desirable to reveal the identity of the UE  used for each server  (and respectively associated paging initiator component ) to the paging coordinator component  associated with the network  (and operated by the cellular service provider), since the identity of the UE  is to be mapped to the permanent layer  identity associated with the UE  used for layer  paging operations. If desired or needed, the UE  can use a different randomly generated ID per server  (e.g., paging initiator), so the permanent layer  identity of the UE  can be hidden from the servers  themselves or groups of servers  to facilitate preventing the servers  from collaborating to correlate or discover the identity of the UE . In yet another embodiment, the UE  can pre-generate and share a number of pseudo identities between the UE  and the paging coordinator component  beforehand, where the server(s)  is not aware of the pseudo identities. As a result, the paging coordinator component  can have knowledge of the identity of the UE , while the server  does not have knowledge of the identity of the UE .","In still another aspect, it is desirable that a client application(s)  or the OS of the UE  discover the DNS name of the paging coordinator component  and generate a shared secret(s). There are many factors to consider when deciding configuration options to facilitate discovery of the DNS name of the paging coordinator component  and generation of a shared secret(s), where the factors can include, for example, subscriber relationships, roaming, load balancing, future changes, etc. It can be desirable to require UEs  to use a home paging coordinator component , or respective UEs  can be allowed to use a local paging coordinator component , as desired, as some configuration schemes potentially are not amenable to conveying dynamic local information (e.g., USIM, factory installation, etc.). Depending at least in part on these factors, one or more of the following can be used to facilitate discovery of the DNS name of the paging coordinator component  and generation of a shared secret(s): the name of the paging coordinator component  can be installed on the UE  before retail, or contained in a SIM card to be employed by the UE . Relating or installing the name of the paging coordinator component  to\/on the UE  also can be performed via DHCP options fields, uPnP, Apple Bonjour or other local service location protocols (although these are local configuration protocols, information from home networks can be inserted, for example, via AAA operations and\/or unicast delivery under certain arrangements between the local network and home networks (e.g., home addresses or prefixes can be assigned via DHCP proxy\/relay and\/or router advertisements)); OMA DM, TR-69, or other in-band dynamic device configuration options can be employed; and\/or a well-known DNS name or multicast\/anycast address can be dedicated to obtaining necessary or desired information associated with the paging coordinator component ; etc.","The subject innovation can provide advantages over conventional systems and methods for paging. The subject innovation can enable resources in the network  to be utilized more judiciously, as for the network , there can be less demand to support long lasting connections between the UE  and the server , thereby lessening the demand on the bearer resources and IP address management, routing, roaming, etc. Also, employing the subject innovation can result in the network  using less instances of MIP, whatever form they may be, as compared to conventional systems and techniques for paging. The subject innovation also may result in the extensive use of MIP not being necessary, when combined with larger layer  networks, and the opportunistic use of MIP and application layer handoff such as SIP mobility or IMS SC.
