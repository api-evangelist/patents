{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates to contact information management and more particularly to methods and electronic devices for facilitating access to a webpage associated with a contact.","Electronic and software-based systems may be designed to store contact information. For example, a contact manger application may allow a user to populate a contact entry with contact information such as a first name, last name, business name, title, address, email address, etc. Contact information may also include one or more webpage identifiers, such as Uniform Resource Locators (\u201cURL\u201d) associated with a contact. Such webpage identifiers may identify the location of one or more webpages associated with the contact. For example, the webpage identifiers may identify a personal webpage, such as a blog operated by the user.","A contact manager application may not provide a user with an easy way of accessing webpages associated with a contact. A user desiring to access a webpage associated with a contact may have to locate and open the contact manager application, navigate to a desired contact entry, retrieve the webpage identifier, and paste it into a web browser in order to access the webpage. This can be a cumbersome process for a user.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","In one aspect, the present application describes a method performed by an electronic device. The method includes: obtaining a first contact entry; determining if the first contact entry includes a webpage identifier; and if the first contact entry includes a webpage identifier, populating a portion of a web browser with the webpage identifier included in the first contact entry.","In another aspect, the present application describes an electronic device. The electronic device includes a memory and a processor coupled with the memory. The processor is configured for obtaining a first contact entry; determining if the first contact entry includes a webpage identifier; and if the first contact entry includes a webpage identifier, populating a portion of a web browser with the webpage identifier included in the first contact entry.","In a further aspect, the present application describes a method of providing access to one or more webpages associated with one or more contacts. The method includes: displaying a list of contacts; receiving a selection of one of the contacts; and opening a webpage associated with the contact.","Other example embodiments of the present application will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.","Example embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system, electronic device architecture, server architecture or computer programming language.","System Overview","Reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present application can be applied. The communication system  includes a number of electronic devices  which may be connected to the remainder of the system  in any of several different ways. In the example embodiment illustrated, the electronic devices  are mobile communication devices. That is, the electronic devices  are configured to communicate with other electronic devices, servers and\/or systems (i.e. they are \u201ccommunication\u201d devices) and the electronic devices  are portable and may be easily moved between different physical locations (i.e. they are \u201cmobile\u201d devices). However, in other example embodiments, the electronic devices  may not be portable (i.e. may not be \u201cmobile\u201d devices) and\/or may not be configured to communication with other electronic devices, servers or systems (i.e. may not be \u201ccommunication\u201d devices).","Accordingly, several instances of electronic devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to the system . The electronic devices  are connected to a communication network such as a wireless network  which may include one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some example embodiments, the electronic devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some example embodiments, the wireless network  may include multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  may be operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the electronic devices . In some example embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further include a wireless network gateway  which connects the electronic devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities  may include one or more private networks or lines, the public internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organisation or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some example embodiments, the network  may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the electronic devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the electronic devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the electronic devices .","The WLAN  includes a wireless network which, in some example embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other example embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be required). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email messages, to and from a set of managed electronic devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and electronic devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the electronic devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a content server  (for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization's internal servers to the electronic devices  in the wireless network ) and optionally other servers . The other servers  may include a messaging server (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email messaging server) and an application server for implementing server-based applications such as instant messaging (IM) applications.","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g. email messages, contact data, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the electronic devices . In some example embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the electronic devices  are encrypted. In some example embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the electronic device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the content server , or other servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the content server  or other servers  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination electronic device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the electronic device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the content server  or other servers .","The network  may include a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination.","An electronic device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer , such as desktop or notebook computer, via the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the electronic device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may include one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may include one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile electronic device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short-range wireless communication interface may include one or a combination of an infrared (IR) connection such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) connection, a short-range radio frequency (RF) connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth\u2122 special interest group, or IEEE 802.15.3a, also referred to as UltraWideband (UWB), or other PAN connection.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system includes one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the electronic devices . The teachings of the present application may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present application.","Accordingly, an electronic device  may have Internet access. That is, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may be configured to connect to the Internet through a communication system, such as the communication system  of . In at least some example embodiments, the communication system  may allow the electronic device  to access one or more content servers  which are publicly or privately accessible through the Internet. Such content servers  may be referred to as web servers. Web servers are servers which are configured to deliver content, such as web pages on request from electronic devices  connected to the Internet. In at least some example embodiments, a web server may be configured to deliver HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents to electronic devices . In at least some example embodiments, one or more of the web servers may be configured to deliver content to an electronic device  in response to receiving a Hypertext Transfer (or Transport) Protocol (HTTP) request from a web browser operating on that electronic device .","A web server may have one or more addresses associated with that web server. An address may, for example, be in the form of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The web server may be configured to map a path component of an address, such as a URL, to a local file system if the request received from an electronic device  is a static request or to a program name if the request received from the electronic device  is a dynamic request. The address may be referred to as a webpage identifier since it may be used to identify the location of a webpage.","Example Electronic Device","Reference is now made to  which illustrates an example electronic device  in which example embodiments described in the present application can be applied. In the illustrated example embodiment, the electronic device  is a communication device, such as a mobile communication device. In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device , in various example embodiments the electronic device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for data and voice communication, a mobile telephone a wearable computer such as a watch, a PDA (personal digital assistant, or a computer system.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may be a smartphone. A smartphone is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capability than a basic non-smartphone cellular phone. For example, a smartphone may have the ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.","Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may be a tablet computer. A tablet computer (which may also be referred to as a tablet) is an electronic device  which is generally larger than a mobile phone (such as a smartphone) or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized. That is, mobile phones or personal digital assistants are generally small enough to be carried by a person easily, often in a shirt or pant pocket while tablet computers are larger and may not fit within pant pockets. For example, many tablet computers have a height with is seven inches (7\u2033) or more. In some example embodiments, the tablet computer may be a slate computer. A slate computer is a tablet computer which does not include a dedicated keyboard. A slate computer may allow for text input through the use of a virtual keyboard or an external keyboard which connects to the slate computer via a wired or wireless connection.","The electronic device  includes a housing (not shown), housing the components of the electronic device . The internal components of the electronic device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The electronic device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the electronic device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), input interfaces  (such as a keyboard, one or more control buttons, and\/or a touch-sensitive overlay associated with a touchscreen display) flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , a data port  (which may be a serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port), one or more speakers , one or more microphones , a short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The electronic device  may include a touchscreen display in some example embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller. The touch-sensitive input surface overlays the display  and may be referred to as a touch-sensitive overlay. The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input interface  and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the electronic device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which electronic device  is intended to operate.","The electronic device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  () of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The electronic device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","In some example embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The electronic device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network. The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may include a pointing or navigational tool (input device) such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  also includes a removable memory module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory module interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device  via the memory module , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory module for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module  may be inserted in or connected to the memory module interface  of the electronic device .","The electronic device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments, the data  may include service data having information required by the electronic device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the electronic device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases or data stores each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer  (). The data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device  by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer  () using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device  to the host computer  () via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the electronic device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer  () for processing.","The electronic device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the electronic device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range communication subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the electronic device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the electronic device's operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the electronic device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the electronic device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the electronic device .","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the electronic device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the electronic device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., a voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  include operating system software , and software applications  including a contact manager  and a web browser . In the example embodiment of , the contact manager  and the web browser  are implemented as separate stand-alone applications , but in other example embodiments, one or both of these applications could be implemented as part of the operating system  or another application .","The electronic device  may include a range of additional software applications , including, for example, a notepad application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display ) according to the application.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The web browser  is capable of accessing and displaying a webpage. The web browser  may use a webpage identifier  () such as a URL to establish a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) connection to a webpage at an address corresponding to a webpage identifier over the internet. The web browser  may be equipped with a scripting engine to run client-side scripts such as a JavaScript engine for accessing HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) webpages that include JavaScript code. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, JavaScript is a scripting language used in client-side web document, for example, in web pages. The JavaScript engine of the web browser  (also known as JavaScript interpreter or JavaScript implementation) is an interpreter that interprets JavaScript scripts embedded in or included from HTML pages and executes the scripts accordingly. Other scripting languages may be used such as, for example, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), VBScript, and Visual Basic .NET all from Microsoft Corporation. The web browser also includes multiple and various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to provide a user with an interface to interact with the web browser . A GUI is a type of user interface that allows the user to interact with a device and\/or an application utilizing images rather than text commands. The GUI represents information and actions available to the user through graphical icons and visual indicators. The GUI can be implemented by various programming languages including JavaScript, .NET, C++, etc.","The web browser  may be Internet Explorer\u2122 by Microsoft Corporation, FireFox\u2122 by Mozilla Corporation, or any other web browser having the necessary capabilities for implementing the functions described herein. In some example embodiments, the web browser  is provided by the designer or manufacturer of the electronic device . The web browser  may also be referred to as an Internet browser in at least some example embodiments.","A contact manager  performs the functions of an address book and allows contact entries , , to be created and stored in memory. For example, the contact manager  may permit contact entries , , to be stored in a contact data store  in the data area  of memory.","Contact entries , , are records which store contact information for a contact. At least some of the contact entries , , may include a webpage identifier field  () for storing a webpage identifier  () associated with a contact. The webpage identifier field  () may be populated with a webpage identifier  () which is an address which may be used for locating a webpage. That is, the webpage identifier is an address associated with a webpage. Contact entries , , may also include other information such as identifying information for a contact. The identifying information may include, for example, one or more names associated with the contact. An example contact entry  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","The contact manager  is configured to receive new contact entries from one or more input interfaces  associated with the electronic device . For example, a user of the electronic device  may interact with an input interface  such as a navigational input device in order to input an instruction to the contact manager  to create a new contact entry , , . Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, the contact manager  is configured to receive contact entries via the communication subsystem . For example, in some example embodiments, a contact entry , , may be received in an electronic message, such as an email. The contact manager  may store contact entries received via an input interface  or a communication subsystem  in the contact data store . Such storage may occur automatically or at the request of the user (e.g. by selecting an option to store a contact entry to memory such as a \u201csave\u201d option).","In at least some example embodiments, after contact entries , , are created they may be accessed by the contact manager . In at least some example embodiments, contact entries , , may be accessed by other applications .
