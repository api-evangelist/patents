title: Method and system for managing a network
abstract: In an exemplary method, a network having first and second network manager devices is managed by independently managing a first operation using a first logic of the first network manager device, including managing a first portion of a database, and by independently managing a second operation using a second logic of the second network manager device, including managing a second portion of the database. A peer-to-peer interface can communicate information between the first and second network manager devices. In an exemplary embodiment, a system for managing a network includes a plurality of network manager devices, each device including a logic for managing a different operation, a database, and a peer-to-peer interface for sending queries to a different network manager device in the plurality and receiving queries from the different network manager device in the plurality.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["In traditional network or e-service agent-server management environments, data collected and events received by the agent are sent back to a single management station server before they can be displayed and accessed by operators. This single management station server can effectively manage only a limited number of nodes on the network. The agents act like slaves of the server, and cannot be accessed or viewed directly by other existing applications or by users. In addition, agents and the management station server must reside on the same side of a firewall. In addition, the number of managed devices and\/or applications that the single management station server can handle is finite.","An exemplary method of managing a network, the network having first and second network manager devices, includes independently managing a first operation using a first logic of the first network manager device, including managing a first portion of a database, independently managing a second operation using a second logic of the second network manager device, including managing a second portion of the database, and communicating information between the first network manager device and the second network manager device using a peer-to-peer interface for sending and receiving queries. An exemplary machine readable medium includes software or a computer program for causing a computing device to perform the exemplary method.","An exemplary system for managing a network includes a plurality of network manager devices, each device including a logic for managing a different operation, a database, and a peer-to-peer interface for sending queries to a different network manager device in the plurality and receiving queries from the different network manager device in the plurality, wherein the peer-to-peer interface used by each of the plurality of network manager devices is the same.","An exemplary system for managing a network includes means for independently managing a first operation using a first logic of the first network manager device, including managing a first portion of a database, means for independently managing a second operation using a second logic of the second network manager device, including managing a second portion of the database, and means for communicating information between the first network manager device and the second network manager device using a peer-to-peer interface for sending and receiving queries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","112","122"]},"Each e-manager , ,  also includes a peer-to-peer interface , , . The interfaces , ,  are identical, and can be implemented so that the e-managers can communicate with each other or other applications, for example across a firewall. The peer-to-peer interface can be implemented using XML\/SOAP over HTTP\/HTTPS, and can support XML RPC calls. \u201cXML\u201d is an abbreviation or acronym for eXtensible Markup Language. \u201cSOAP\u201d is an abbreviation or acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol. SOAP generally can include two parts: a first part that enables programmers to produce and parse SOAP XML messages, and a second part that acts as an end point for SOAP communication at a server, which then uses objects to deliver the requested service. \u201cHTTP\u201d is an abbreviation or acronym for HyperText Transfer Protocol, or world-wide-web protocol. \u201cHTTPS\u201d is an abbreviation or acronym for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure sockets. \u201cRPC\u201d is an abbreviation or acronym for Remote Procedure Call, which can for example be XML-based. The peer-to-peer interfaces , ,  can be used for sending queries to a different network manager device or e-manager, and for receiving queries from the different network manager device or e-manager. Each e-manager can proactively communicate with other e-managers or applications (for example, existing applications) via its peer-to-peer interface. This structure of e-manager communication ensures scalability of e-service management, by allowing an e-manager to collect management data through\/from different, surrogate e-managers.","Each of thee-managers , ,  includes a logic , ,  for managing an operation. The logic , ,  can be a business logic. The operation corresponding to a network manager device or e-manager can include tasks, for example, the tasks of managing device(s) and\/or application(s) connected and\/or assigned to the network manager device or e-manager. For example,  shows the e-manager  managing an e-service device , an e-application server , and a network device . The network device  can be, for example, a network hardware component such as a switch or a router. The e-manager  manages an e-service device  and an e-application server , and the e-manager  manages an e-application server , an e-service device , and e-service device , and a vendor-specific management application . The e-manager  is also connected to an existing management application .","Each of the e-managers , ,  can also support common interfaces that hide all implementation components forming the logic , , . These common interfaces can be used to retrieve management data from managed devices and applications. For example, the e-manager  can support one or more common interfaces by which it communicates with the e-service device , the e-application server , and the network device . These common interfaces can be different from the peer-to-peer interfaces , , .","As referenced herein, \u201ce-services\u201d is an umbrella term for services on the Internet. E-services include e-commerce transaction services for handling online orders, application hosting by application service providers (ASPs) and any processing capability that is obtainable on the World-Wide-Web or Internet. An \u201ce-service device\u201d is a device that helps administer an e-service, and an \u201ce-application server\u201d is a machine that holds e-service related programs and data shared by network users.","As referenced herein, a \u201cbusiness logic\u201d is a part of an application program that performs the required data processing of the business. It refers to the routines that perform the data retrieval, update, query and report processing, and more specifically to the processing that takes place behind the scenes rather than the presentation logic required to display the data on the screen (GUI processing). Client applications are made up of a user interface and business logic. Server applications are mostly business logic. Both client and server applications also require communications links, but the network infrastructure, like the user interface, is not part of the business logic. Implementation of the business logic can be different for each network manager device or e-manager depending on the type of services, for example e-services, that the manager is responsible for managing.","As referenced herein, a database is a set of related files that is created and managed by a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS can manage any form of data including text, images, sound and video. Database and file structures can be determined by software, so that as far as associated hardware is concerned, data in the database is simply bits and bytes.","As referenced herein, an XML Schema is a definition of the content used in an XML document. The XML schema is a superset of DTD (Document Type Definition), which is the standard SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) schema. Various recommendations were submitted to the WC, and a standard was approved in May 2001 that includes the ability to define data by type (date, integer, etc.). Unlike DTD, XML schemas are written in XML syntax. Although the XML schemas can be more verbose than DTD, they can be created with any XML tools.","Each e-manager can also include a database or portion of a database, for example the data storage , , . The database can include information about the operation that the e-manager is handling, including devices and\/or applications that the e-manager is managing. For example, the data storage  can include information necessary for the e-manager  to manage the e-service device , the e-application server , and the network device . The data storage  can also include information regarding other e-managers and\/or other operations (for example those administered by other e-managers). Similar principles apply to the data storage , .","Each of the e-managers can collect and process management data, for example relating to the operation and associated tasks for which it is responsible. The e-manager can collect the data using SNMP\/MIB (Simple Network Management Protocol\/Management Information Base) polling, CLI (Command Line Interface), FTP (File Transfer Protocol) system log files and error log files, measurement data from various probes, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), an external configuration database, local configuration files, central configuration files, and so forth. For example, the e-manager can send an HTTP request, and then analyze the data provided in response to the request. Access methods that the e-manager can apply to collect the data can be defined in a configuration file of the e-manager, which can for example be stored in the data storage of the e-manager. The e-manager can also discover managed elements (e.g., the devices and\/or processes, applications or services that the e-manager has responsibility for managing) identified in configuration file associated with the e-manager. The configuration file can be user-defined. The configuration file of the e-manager can allow the user to a) specify management configuration information for managed devices, for example data\/log access methods, b) specify URLs for web-access, c) schedule data polling, d) set monitoring interval(s), e) specify customer information, and so forth.","The e-manager can also filter and organize the collected data. The resulting data can be pushed to a central entity such as an e-integration manager and\/or a management server, and\/or can be pulled from a persistence (for example the data storage , , ), for example in response to a query from the e-integration manager and\/or the management server. The data can be pulled from the persistence by existing management applications, for example various Hewlett-Packard OpenView applications or sub-applications.","Each e-manager can be implemented with a universal access layer with different methods to access data on heterogeneous network devices and\/or services, for example the devices and\/or services that the e-manager manages. These devices and\/or services can include, for example, content devices, content services, network devices, routers, switches, web servers, streaming media servers, and so forth. Data collected by the e-manager through the universal access layer can be formatted into a common data format, for example by the e-manager using XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and can be forwarded on request to another entity (e.g., can be used to exchange information with, or transfer information to, another e-manager or an e-integration manager) or stored, for example in the data storage of the e-manager. The common data format allows management data to be easily transferred among e-managers and e-integrations managers. The data can be stored in a flat file, in a database, or in any other format, in the data storage of the e-manager. The universal access layer can offer, for example, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) polling, CLI (Command Line Interface), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), XML parsing, log file parsing, configuration file parsing, probe information collecting, and device or service-specific API (Application Programming Interface) support, which can for example facilitate data collection by the e-manager.","The common data format can, for example, have the following form or

The NNM's CDN application can parse and process the data provided by the e-integration manager, and can, for example, draw the CDN devices table on an NNM GUI or use a predefined XML stylesheet to display the information in a web browser. If one of the devices in the CDN devices table has a change in alert status, the NNM can receive an SNMP trap sent by one of the e-managers and use this information to update the table and\/or respond by taking other action.","The e-integration manager maintains a list of all e-managers that it coordinates or monitors. The list can be maintained by a mechanism of each e-manager registering its presence with the e-integration manager, for example upon connection to the network. The registration can also indicate capabilities and\/or responsibilities of the e-manager. E-managers can update the list by sending information to the e-integration manager, for example at the end of a periodic time interval, and\/or when a noteworthy event occurs. For example, an e-manager can alert the e-integration manager when the e-manager delegates a task to, or receives a task from, another (e.g., neighbor) e-manager. The task can be, for example, management of a particular device or application that the e-manager manages. For example, the e-manager  could delegate a task to the e-manager  by delegating management responsibility for the e-service device  to the e-manager . In an exemplary embodiment, the e-integration manager can support a UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) registry service which e-managers can use to register as a managed service.","The e-manager  can also transfer appropriate information for managing the e-service device  from the data storage  to the data storage  via the interfaces ,  over a communication link . The e-integration manager can also query e-managers for information regarding their capabilities and responsibilities, and regarding any information stored in the database or database portions corresponding to the e-managers, for example the data storage , , . The e-integration manager GUI can perform the same functions as the GUIs , , . The GUI can be omitted from the e-integration manager. Management responsibilities can also be omitted from the e-integration manager. For example, where the e-manager  is implemented as an e-integration manager, management responsibilities for the e-service devices , , the e-application server , and the management applications ,  can be omitted so that these entities are managed by a different e-manager.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, an internal flow of an e-manager can include reading configuration information for the e-manager, which can for example be stored in the data storage of the e-manager. The configuration information can include e-integration manager information (for example, an e-integration manager that the e-manager is registered with or should register with), information identifying neighbors of the e-manager, and information identifying one or more \u201credundant\u201d e-managers, or in other words one or more other e-managers that can assume the e-manager's responsibilities and functions in case of failover. A failover occurs when an e-manager cannot fulfill its responsibilities for some reason, for example due to overload, malfunction, crash, or loss of power, and another e-manager assumes its responsibilities and functions. The internal flow of the e-manager can also include building a list of neighbors to the e-manager, and validating the list by sending query messages to entities in the neighbor list (e.g., \u201careYouThere\u201d queries). The internal flow of the e-manager can also include the e-manager registering itself with an e-integration manager by sending a message to the e-integration manager, for example an \u201cIAmHere\u201d message along with hostname, port number and communication methods for the e-manager. In its internal flow, the e-manager can also execute management routine(s) to monitor or collect management data, can process all management data and store them in a common format, and can also process requests from e-integration manager(s) and\/or e-manager GUI (Graphic User Interface) applications. The internal flow of the e-manager can also include discovering CDN (Content Delivery Network) devices to be managed by the e-manager, which can be done using a business logic of the e-manager. The internal flow of the e-manager can also include spawning a thread that functions as a request server to handle requests coming from an e-integration manager (e.g., get a report, get a device table, etc.), where the request server spawns a thread for each request, so that multiple requests can be executed concurrently. The internal flow of the e-manager can also include spawning SNMP polling threads to handle all scheduled SNMP polling, so that a thread is created for each device SNMP polling, where the SNMP polling threads generate SNMP data for each device and store the data locally (e.g., in a data storage of the e-manager). These functions can be done using a business logic of the e-manager. The internal flow of the e-manager can also include processing all collected SNMP and log data and store the data in an XML-format database (e.g., in a data storage of the e-manager or in another storage accessible to the e-manager). These functions can be done using a business logic of the e-manager. The internal flow of the e-manager can also include creating servlets to handle HTTP requests, and creating stylesheets for presenting XML format management data, and implementing XSLT (extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) integration.","The configuration file or configuration information for the e-manager can be in XML.

This can be done, for example, by sending a communication to all the other e-managers indicating that the e-manager  is now an e-integration manager, by delegating any operation and corresponding task(s) (e.g., management responsibilities for the e-service devices , , the e-application server , and the management applications , ) to other e-managers, and by configuring or instructing the e-manager  to assume the responsibilities and functions of an e-integration manager. E-integration managers can be formed from the same base class as e-managers, for example where the managers are implemented in an object-oriented programming language or environment.","The e-integration manager can provide a common communication interface for integration, and can provide a layer of abstraction between the (other) e-managers and existing applications, for example Network Node Manager applications. The e-integration manager can function or serve as a central, integrated management system that receives, consolidates, synchronizes, processes, and analyzes management data provided by the e-managers. The e-integration manager can store the management data in a database (for example in a data storage of the e-integration manager or in another database available to the e-integration manager), and can forward the data to other applications upon request. The e-integration manager can integrate and pass on management data to existing applications, and can also pass information from existing applications to e-managers registered with the e-integration manager.","The e-integration manager can function as a clearinghouse for e-manager requests. For example, if an e-manager does not know who its neighbors are, the e-manager can query the e-integration manager which can consult its list and then provide the requested information to the e-manager. In addition, when an e-manager desires to delegate a task and cannot discern a qualified or able e-manager to accept the task, the delegating e-manager can ask the e-integration manager to identify possible candidates and\/or query the possible candidates on behalf of the delegating e-manager. An e-manager can send a first query or request to the e-integration manager for information or a service, and the e-integration manager can query or otherwise communicate with other e-managers to satisfy the first query or request.","The e-integration manager can provide flexibility to support present and future standards and\/or protocols. For example, XML\/SOAP can be used, and later when any other protocols are adopted, the integration layer (e.g., the e-integration manager) can be changed or updated without affecting the e-manager structure\/architecture. The e-integration manager can function as a virtual desktop for accessing, processing, and viewing a complete set or a subset of management data from all or just a selected subset of distributed management components, for example e-managers.","Generally, the e-integration manager can act as an additional resource to an e-manager, for example to provide information or a service to an e-manager that the e-manager is unable to obtain directly from other e-managers. The e-integration manager can receive and\/or gather, and maintain, status information regarding all the e-managers and the network as a whole. The e-integration manager can provide a UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) Service, for example to respond to user inquiries entered via a GUI connected to the e-integration manager or entered via a GUI connected to another e-manager and forwarded to the e-integration manager. In response to user inquiries, the e-integration manager can provide the reports described further above, regarding devices managed by all or selected ones of the e-managers, an overall view of e-managers in the system, and so forth. The e-integration manager can enable users to select and view a subset of data regarding and\/or provided by the e-managers. The e-integration manager can communicate with existing applications (for example, entities other than e-managers, including existing applications), through a common interface, for example the peer-to-peer interface, and can transfer information between existing applications and one or more of the e-managers. The common interface can be XML-based. Multiple e-integration managers can be provided.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the e-integration manager can use the following internal process flow. The e-integration manager can read its configuration information during startup, and can build an initial list of registered e-managers based on the information retrieved from or provided by the configuration information. The e-integration manager can start an HTTP server waiting for HTTP requests, and can start a registration service, waiting for e-managers to register and adding newly registered e-managers to the e-integration manager's list of registered e-managers. The e-integration manager can also receive and process HTTP requests from applications or from e-managers, can poll or query e-managers, process responses received from e-managers, and send the requested results to applications or e-manager(s).","The configuration file or configuration information for the e-integration manager can be in XML.

An HTTP server in the e-integration manager receives the request, and a servlet running on the server in the e-integration manager processes the request, creates a URL connection to the specific e-manager, and sends a corresponding request to the specific e-manager for the list of managed services. The request sent by the servlet to the specific e-manager can be a reformatted version of the request received from the web browser. A servlet running on the server in the e-manager receives the request from the servlet, identifies the relevant command in the request (e.g., \u201cget services list\u201d), and opens a socket connection with a daemon in the e-manager to obtain the desired information. The daemon responds to the \u201cget services list\u201d command, by obtaining the information and writing it to the socket (e.g., in XML format). To obtain the information, the daemon can spawn a request server to handle and execute multiple, concurrent requests for e-service management. For example, the concurrent requests can include requests such as \u201cget a service list\u201d, \u201cget a report for a specified service\u201d, and \u201cget a general report\u201d. The daemon can also create a data collector to handle and execute all data pollings for all managed services or devices, concurrently. All service data polled can be stored in XML format. The e-manager can also include a data processor that can analyze all collected data and generate useful management information. The daemon can also create a log collector, and spawn an event server, to handle other kinds of requests that may be received from the e-integration manager or another e-manager.","The servlet running on the server in the e-manager receives the information from the daemon via the socket, and passes the information back to the e-integration manager, which in turn passes the information back to the user's web browser. The servlet running on the server in the e-manager can apply service table stylesheet(s) to the information received from the daemon, can transform the information into an HTML page, and then pass the HTML page to the e-integration manager, so that the e-integration manager can pass the HTML page to the web browser which displays the HTML page to the user.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the peer-to-peer interface can be implemented using an interface base class that is defined for XML-based communication.

The information can be transferred to a) respond to a request entered via the GUI , b) complete delegation of a task from the e-manager  to the e-manager , c) to effect a registration of the e-manager  with the e-manager  where the e-manager  is implemented or configured to function as an e-integration manager, and so forth.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that procedures and processes outlined in  and described with respect to selected elements shown in , can be appropriately applied in similar fashion to any of the elements shown in . For example, with respect to subprocess , the GUI  is described as being able to access the device  via the e-manager . In a similar fashion, the GUI  can be used to access the management application  via the e-manager , and so forth.","Regarding failover, the neighbor list kept by each e-manager can provide an efficient and effective mechanism for handling failover management issues. In an example scenario, a first e-manager does not have a redundant system configured at startup, so it sends out a query to each of its neighbors (e.g., neighboring e-managers and\/or e-integration manager(s)) to look for a failover system that can manage the network devices\/processes that it manages, for example Content Delivery Network (CDN) devices. A second e-manager with extra capacity that is capable of managing the devices\/processes currently managed by the first e-manager, replies to the query and indicates it can assume responsibility in the event of failover. The first e-manager receives the reply, and updates its configuration information accordingly to indicate that responsibilities can be transferred to the second e-manager in the event a failover of the first e-manager occurs. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the first e-manager can receive replies from multiple e-managers for different or same types of devices\/processes, so that multiple e-managers can be noted in the first e-manager's configuration information as failover candidates, and upon failover of the first e-manager the responsibilities can be apportioned among multiple other e-managers, according to device\/process type and\/or e-manager capacity.","In another example failover scenario, a first e-manager is about to be shut down for maintenance. The first e-manager checks its configuration information for a redundant system or second e-manager to assume the first e-manager's responsibilities. If the first e-manager cannot find failover system information in the configuration information, it sends a query message (e.g., \u201cidentifyFailOver\u201d) to all its neighbors. A second e-manager responds as the first e-manager's failover system, and starts preparing to assume management responsibilities from the first e-manager. The second e-manager may already have a list of devices currently managed by the first e-manager. The first e-manager sends a list of managed devices and other management information or data to the failover system (i.e., the second e-manager). The e-integration manager is also notified of the impending responsibility transfer. The e-integration manager updates the status indication for the first e-manager in the e-integration manager's database, to a down status. The second e-manager confirms that it has received the management information from the first e-manager, the first e-manager shuts down, the second e-manager assumes the management responsibilities of the first e-manager and informs the e-integration manager, which updates its status for the second e-manager. Then the second e-manager manages and monitors the set of devices\/processes it received from the first e-manager. Later, when the first e-manager comes back on line, it sends an alert message, for example an \u201cIAmLive\u201d message, so the second e-manager. In response, the second e-manager sends current management information to the first e-manager and stops managing the devices\/processes, and the first e-manager resumes managing the devices\/processes it had earlier handed off to the second e-manager. The e-integration manager also updates its status indications for the first and second e-managers.","In another example failover scenario, the first e-manager dies unexpectedly without handing off responsibility for devices\/processes it was managing. A Management Application (MA) discovers that the first e-manager has died, and informs the e-integration manager about the first e-manager's failure. The MA and\/or the e-integration manager determines a suitable candidate to assume management responsibilities for the devices\/processes orphaned by the first e-manager. For example, the second e-manager can be selected to assume the management responsibilities. The e-integration manager sends a failover action message to the second e-manager to cause it to assume the responsibilities, and the second e-manager starts to manage the devices\/processes orphaned by the first e-manager.","The exemplary architectures and mechanisms described herein with respect to the exemplary embodiments provide numerous advantages. For example, exemplary embodiments a) provide centralized management control (e.g., via the e-integration manager) across distributed and localized management (e.g., via e-managers), b) consolidate management information for multiple e-managers into a central management console (e.g., using filtering, processing, regrouping and so forth), c) seed the manageability for different sites, c) enable easy failover deployment, d) provide a standard communication protocol of XML-SOAP over HTTP\/HTTPS, e) enable portable data, f) provide scalability, and g) allow coordination and federation of management. The common interface base classes and predefined XML schemas disclosed herein, can enforce a common communication protocol using XML\/SOAP technologies that enable easy and efficient communications among management systems and easy integration with any existing management application. Defining the common interfaces using XML\/SOAP technology can provide all client applications with a common platform to receive data in a universal language.","The methods, logics, techniques and pseudocode sequences described above for performing or implementing various features of the exemplary embodiments, can be implemented in a variety of programming styles (for example Structured Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and so forth) and in a variety of different programming languages (for example Java, C, C ++, C#, Pascal, Ada, and so forth). Also, the e-managers and e-integration managers described herein can be implemented to include a microprocessor, computer, or any other computing device, and can be implemented in hardware and\/or software, in a single physical location or in distributed fashion among various locations or host computing platforms. For example, the e-managers and e-integration managers can be network software components residing in a computer system, and can be independent.","Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a machine readable medium can include software or computer program(s) for causing a computing device to perform the exemplary method(s) and processes described herein.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein.
