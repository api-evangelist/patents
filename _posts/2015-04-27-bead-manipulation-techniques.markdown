title: Bead manipulation techniques
abstract: The invention provides a method of redistributing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet. The method may include conducting on a droplet operations surface one or more droplet operations using the droplet without removing the magnetically responsive beads from the region of the magnetic field. The droplet operations may in some cases be electrode-mediated. The droplet operations may redistribute and/or circulate the magnetically responsive beads within the droplet. In some cases, the droplet may include a sample droplet may include a target analyte. The redistributing of the magnetically responsive beads may cause target analyte to bind to the magnetically responsive beads. In some cases, the droplet may include unbound substances in a wash buffer. The redistributing of the magnetically responsive beads causes unbound substances to be freed from interstices of an aggregated set or subset of the magnetically responsive beads.

The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The foregoing statement applies only to aspects of this disclosure originating in U.S. Patent Application No. 61\/103,302, entitled \u201cBead Incubation and Washing on a Droplet Actuator,\u201d filed on Oct. 7, 2008, and U.S. Patent Application No. 61\/122,791, \u201cBead Incubation and Washing on a Droplet Actuator,\u201d filed Dec. 16, 2008.","The present invention generally relates to bead manipulation techniques. In particular, the present invention is directed to a method of redistributing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet.","Droplet actuators are used to conduct a wide variety of droplet operations. A droplet actuator typically includes one or more substrates configured to form a surface or gap for conducting droplet operations. The one or more substrates include electrodes for conducting droplet operations. Liquids that are subjected to droplet operations are typically surrounded by an immiscible filler fluid. When the droplet actuator is configured to form a gap, the gap between the substrates is typically filled or coated with the filler fluid. Droplet operations are controlled by electrodes associated with the one or more substrates. Droplets containing particles, such as beads or cells, may be subjected to various droplet operations on a droplet actuator. Droplets associated with particles may require various methods that may include structures, to be manipulated by the droplet actuator.","Beads, whether or not magnetically responsive have a tendency to settle and form aggregates due to one or more forces that may include gravity, friction, electric and magnetic forces. Aggregation may also occur due to surface interactions between beads or between substances bound to beads or interactions between beads and droplet actuator substrates. Regardless of the causes, aggregation has a direct impact on the performance of assays. Immunoassays for example, has critical time consuming stages like incubation and washing that may be influenced by the aggregation of beads.","During incubation, where interaction of different antibodies and antigens result in binding events, the available surface area on the beads for binding is reduced due to aggregation, thereby impeding reaction kinetics and consequently increasing time to result and\/or reducing assay sensitivity. Protocols used for incubation, including but not limited to duration of incubation may be influenced by the mixing efficiency within the droplets and also the reaction and binding kinetics, all of which may be impacted by bead aggregation. When it comes to washing, unwanted unbound substances that are trapped in the interstices of bead aggregates are difficult to separate, remove or wash away, thereby resulting in reduced assay sensitivity. Time to results is impacted if more number of washes are required.","Therefore, there is a need in droplet actuators for resuspending and\/or circulating beads within a droplet to break up or loosen up aggregates when required to improve the overall assay performance without having to compromise on sensitivity and the overall time to result.","The invention provides a method of redistributing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet. The method may include providing a droplet including magnetically responsive beads. The droplet may be provided within a region of a magnetic field having sufficient strength to attract the magnetically responsive beads to an edge of the droplet or towards an edge of the droplet, or otherwise regionalize or aggregate beads within the droplet. The method may also include conducting on a droplet operations surface one or more droplet operations using the droplet without removing the magnetically responsive beads from the region of the magnetic field. The droplet operations may in some cases be electrode-mediated. The droplet operations may redistribute and\/or circulate the magnetically responsive beads within the droplet. In some cases, the droplet may include a sample droplet may include a target analyte. The redistributing of the magnetically responsive beads may cause target analyte to bind to the magnetically responsive beads. In some cases, the droplet may include unbound substances in a wash buffer. The redistributing of the magnetically responsive beads causes unbound substances to be freed from interstices of an aggregated set or subset of the magnetically responsive beads.","In certain embodiments, the droplet operation may be selected to agitate contents of the droplet. The droplet operation may include transporting the droplet. The droplet operation may include elongating the droplet. In some cases, elongating the droplet may include flowing the droplet onto a region of the droplet operations surface atop two or more activated droplet electrodes causing the droplet to take on an elongated configuration. The droplet operation may include merging the droplet with another droplet. The droplet operation may include splitting the droplet to yield two or more daughter droplets. In some cases, two or more of the daughter droplets each may include a substantial subset of the magnetically responsive beads. In some cases, the droplet operation may include merging two or more of the daughter droplets. In some cases, further may include removing the droplet or a sub-droplet thereof including at least a subset of the magnetically responsive beads from the magnetic field. In certain embodiments, one or more droplet operations may be repeated in a series of two or more incubation cycles. The droplet operations surface may be in a droplet operations gap of a droplet actuator. The droplet operations surface may be coated by a liquid filler fluid. The droplet may be surrounded by a liquid filler fluid.","The invention also provides a method of incubating magnetically responsive beads in a droplet. The droplet including magnetically responsive beads may include one or more substances having affinity for one or more of the magnetically responsive beads. The method may include redistributing the magnetically responsive beads in the droplet in accordance with the method of any of the methods described herein.","Further, the invention provides a method of washing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet. The droplet including magnetically responsive beads provided may also include one or more unbound substances selected for removal. The method may include merging the droplet including magnetically responsive beads with a wash droplet to yield a combined droplet. The method may include redistributing the magnetically responsive beads in the droplet in accordance with the method of any of the methods described herein. The method may include splitting the combined droplet to yield a droplet including substantially all of the magnetically responsive beads and a reduced concentration of the unbound substances relative to the starting droplet, and a droplet substantially lacking magnetically responsive beads. The method may be repeated as necessary until a predetermined concentration or quantity of the unbound substances being removed is achieved.","In another method of washing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet, the method may include merging the droplet with magnetically responsive beads with a wash droplet in the magnetic field to yield a combined droplet and to redistribute the magnetically responsive beads within the combined droplet, and splitting the combined droplet to yield a droplet including substantially all of the magnetically responsive beads and a reduced concentration of the unbound substances relative to the starting droplet, and a supernatant droplet substantially lacking magnetically responsive beads.","In another method of washing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet, the method may include conducting one or more droplet operations using the droplet in the magnetic field to redistribute the magnetically responsive beads in the droplet in accordance with any of the other methods described herein, and merging the droplet including the redistributed magnetically responsive beads with a wash droplet to yield a combined droplet. Further, the method may include splitting the combined droplet to yield a first daughter droplet including substantially all of the magnetically responsive beads and a reduced concentration of the unbound substances relative to the starting droplet, and a second daughter droplet substantially lacking magnetically responsive beads.","The invention provides a method of redistributing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet, which method may include providing a droplet including magnetically responsive beads within a first region of a magnetic field having sufficient strength to attract the magnetically responsive beads to an edge of the droplet, and using electrodes to transport droplet to a second region of a droplet operations surface in which the magnetic field may be sufficiently reduced to permit the magnetically responsive beads to circulate in the droplet during the conduct of one or more droplet operations. The method may also include conducting the one or more droplet operations to cause the magnetically responsive beads to circulate in the droplet. In some cases, in the second region of the droplet operations surface, the beads are substantially free from the influence of the magnetic field. In some embodiments, at least a subset of the beads in the starting droplet are magnetically aggregated. The droplet may include a sample droplet including a target analyte. Circulation of the magnetically responsive beads may cause target analyte to bind to the magnetically responsive beads. In some cases, the droplet may include unbound substances in a wash buffer. In some cases, the circulation of the magnetically responsive beads causes disaggregation of an aggregated set or subset of the magnetically responsive beads freeing of unbound substances from interstices of the aggregated set or subset of the magnetically responsive beads. The one or more droplet operations may be selected to agitate contents of the droplet. The one or more droplet operations may include transporting the droplet. The one or more droplet operations may include elongating the droplet. In some cases, elongating the droplet may include flowing the droplet onto a region of the droplet operations surface atop two or more activated droplet electrodes causing the droplet to take on an elongated configuration. The droplet operation may include merging the droplet with another droplet. The droplet operation may include splitting the droplet to yield two or more daughter droplets. In some cases, two or more of the daughter droplets each may include a substantial subset of the magnetically responsive beads. The droplet operation may include merging two or more of these daughter droplets. One or more droplet operations may be repeated in a series of two or more incubation cycles. The droplet operations surface may be in a droplet operations gap of a droplet actuator. The droplet operations surface may be coated by a liquid filler fluid. The droplet may be surrounded by a liquid filler fluid.","In another method of incubating magnetically responsive beads in a droplet may include merging the droplet including magnetically responsive beads with a wash droplet to yield a combined droplet, redistributing the magnetically responsive beads in the combined droplet in accordance with the method of any of the methods described herein, and reintroducing the magnetically responsive beads into the first region of the magnetic field or into a region of another magnetic field having sufficient strength to attract the magnetically responsive beads to an edge of the droplet. In yet another method of washing magnetically responsive beads in a droplet, the method may include redistributing the magnetically responsive beads in the droplet in accordance with the method of any of the methods described herein and reintroducing the magnetically responsive beads into the first region of the magnetic field or into a region of another magnetic field having sufficient strength to attract the magnetically responsive beads to an edge of the droplet. These methods may also include splitting the combined droplet to yield a droplet including substantially all of the magnetically responsive beads and a reduced concentration of the unbound substances relative to the starting droplet, and a droplet substantially lacking magnetically responsive beads.","The invention also provides a method of incubating a droplet, including providing a droplet including magnetically responsive beads within a region of a magnetic field in which the magnetically responsive beads are caused to become aggregated; using electrodes to conduct on a droplet operations surface droplet operations using the droplet wherein the droplet operations may include: one or more droplet operations transporting the droplet away from the magnetic field to a locus of the droplet operations surface in which the magnetically responsive beads are resuspended in the droplet; and one or more droplet operations effecting an incubation cycle in the locus in which the magnetically responsive beads are resuspended in the droplet.","Further, the invention provides a method of washing beads in a droplet, including providing an elongated bead-containing droplet may include one or more unbound substances; providing an elongated wash droplet; restraining movement of beads within the elongated bead-containing droplet; merging end-to-end the elongated bead-containing droplet with the elongated bead containing droplet to yield a combined droplet; and splitting the combined droplet to form a droplet including substantially all of the beads and a droplet substantially lacking in beads. In some cases, restraining movement of beads within the elongated bead containing droplet may include restraining the beads in an end region of the elongated bead containing droplet. The method may also include conducting a resuspension cycle using the bead-containing droplet prior to conducting the merging step. Restraining movement of beads may be accomplished by providing the elongated bead-containing droplet in a magnetic field having a field strength which is sufficient to restrain movement of the beads. In some cases, merging end-to-end the elongated bead-containing droplet with the elongated bead containing droplet causes circulation within the combined droplet which redistributes the beads. In some cases, the restraining, merging and splitting steps are completed in less than about 30 seconds, or less than about 15 seconds, or less than about 10 seconds, or less than about 5 seconds.","The invention provides another method of washing beads, including providing the beads in a sample droplet may include a target substance on a droplet operations substrate within a magnetic field; transporting the sample droplet away from the beads, causing the droplet to split, yielding a supernatant droplet and leaving behind a daughter droplet including substantially all of the magnetically responsive beads; and subjecting the daughter droplet to a merge-and-split bead washing protocol. In some cases, the supernatant droplet includes more than 50% of the unbound substances being removed. In some cases, the supernatant droplet includes more than 75% of the unbound substances being removed.","The steps of any of the washing processes described herein may be repeated until the unbound substances selected for removal from the droplet are reduced by a predetermined amount. In some cases, the predetermined amount will be at least about 99%, or at least about 99.9%, or at least about 99.99%, or at least about 99.999%. The predetermined reduction may in some cases be achieved in 15 or fewer wash cycles, or 10 or fewer wash cycles, or 5 or fewer wash cycles. Further, the predetermined reduction may be achieved while retaining substantially all of the beads. In some cases, at least about 99.9% of the beads are retained, or at least about 99.99% of the beads are retained, or at least about 99.999% of the beads are retained.","The invention also provides a method of removing beads from a region of a magnetic field. The method may include providing a droplet including the beads in a region of the magnetic field in which the beads are aggregated by the magnetic field; elongating the droplet; transporting the droplet away from the region of the magnetic field in which the beads are aggregated out of the magnetic field or into a region of the magnetic field which may be sufficiently weak that the beads become disaggregated within the droplet. The droplet may be provided on a droplet operations surface of a droplet actuator. Elongating the droplet may include activating one or more electrodes to cause the droplet to take on an elongated conformation atop a droplet operations surface of a droplet actuator. In some cases, the droplet operations surface may be situated in a droplet operations gap of the droplet actuator. In certain embodiments, the transporting may include electrowetting-mediated droplet transporting. In certain embodiments, the transporting may include transporting the droplet away from the region of the magnetic field in a direction which follows an approximately lengthwise axis of the droplet.","The invention also provides a method of multiplexing detection in an assay. The method may include providing a set of two or more detection-ready droplets. Each droplet may include two or more sets of assay products. Each set of assay products may include a unique optical marker, such as a color-based marker. The method may include spectrally analyzing each of the two or more droplets to quantify the assay products. In some cases, no single droplet includes the same unique optical marker for two different analytes. In certain embodiments, two different droplets may include the same unique optical marker for two different analytes, one of such analytes in each of the droplets. The spectrally analyzing step may make use of a multi-channel spectral analyzer. The multi-channel spectral analyzer may include an excitation light source arranged to direct light in an excitation spectra into each of the droplets. The multi-channel spectral analyzer may include a electromagnetic radiation sensing device arranged to sense electromagnetic radiation emitted from the droplets. In certain embodiments, each droplet may include four or more sets of assay products, or ten or more sets of assay products. In certain embodiments, the method may include providing a set of five or more of the detection-ready droplets, or set of 25 or more of the detection-ready droplets, or a set of 50 or more of the detection-ready droplets.

In some cases, method may be executed on a fluorescing background substrate, and the quantum dot markers fluoresce at an excitation wavelength which differs from the excitation wavelength of the fluorescing background substrate. In some cases, assay products are bound to fluorescing beads, and the quantum dot markers fluoresce at an excitation wavelength which differs from the excitation wavelength of the fluorescing beads. In some cases, the method may be executed on a fluorescing background substrate, and the quantum dot markers fluoresce at an emission wavelength which differs from the emission wavelength of the fluorescing background substrate. In some cases, assay products are bound to fluorescing beads, and the quantum dot markers fluoresce at an emission wavelength which differs from the emission wavelength of the fluorescing beads.

In certain embodiments, detection-ready droplets are sandwiched between two substrates. The method may also include analyzing light from each droplet to identify and\/or quantify assay products. In some cases, analyzing light from each droplet may include dispersing the light from each droplet along a dispersion axis. In some cases, analyzing light from each droplet may include separately binning light from each droplet to provide a spectrum for each droplet. In some cases, analyzing light from each droplet may include using filters to isolate signals from each droplet.","The invention provides a droplet actuator with a first substrate including a droplet operations surface, electrodes arranged for conducting one or more droplet operations on the surface, and one or more dielectrophoresis electrode configurations arranged for attracting and\/or trapping one or more particles in a droplet situated on the droplet operations surface.

No. 20050179746, entitled \u201cDevice for Controlling the Displacement of a Drop Between two or Several Solid Substrates,\u201d published on Aug. 18, 2005; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain droplet actuators will include a substrate, droplet operations electrodes associated with the substrate, one or more dielectric and\/or hydrophobic layers atop the substrate and\/or electrodes forming a droplet operations surface, and optionally, a top substrate separated from the droplet operations surface by a gap. One or more reference electrodes may be provided on the top and\/or bottom substrates and\/or in the gap. In various embodiments, the manipulation of droplets by a droplet actuator may be electrode mediated, e.g., electrowetting mediated or dielectrophoresis mediated or Coulombic force mediated. Examples of other methods of controlling liquid flow that may be used in the droplet actuators of the invention include devices that induce hydrodynamic fluidic pressure, such as those that operate on the basis of mechanical principles (e.g. external syringe pumps, pneumatic membrane pumps, vibrating membrane pumps, vacuum devices, centrifugal forces, piezoelectric\/ultrasonic pumps and acoustic forces); electrical or magnetic principles (e.g. electroosmotic flow, electrokinetic pumps, ferrofluidic plugs, electrohydrodynamic pumps, attraction or repulsion using magnetic forces and magnetohydrodynamic pumps); thermodynamic principles (e.g. gas bubble generation\/phase-change-induced volume expansion); other kinds of surface-wetting principles (e.g. electrowetting, and optoelectrowetting, as well as chemically, thermally, structurally and radioactively induced surface-tension gradients); gravity; surface tension (e.g., capillary action); electrostatic forces (e.g., electroosmotic flow); centrifugal flow (substrate disposed on a compact disc and rotated); magnetic forces (e.g., oscillating ions causes flow); magnetohydrodynamic forces; and vacuum or pressure differential. In certain embodiments, combinations of two or more of the foregoing techniques may be employed in droplet actuators of the invention.","\u201cDroplet operation\u201d means any manipulation of a droplet on a droplet actuator. A droplet operation may, for example, include: loading a droplet into the droplet actuator; dispensing one or more droplets from a source droplet; splitting, separating or dividing a droplet into two or more droplets; transporting a droplet from one location to another in any direction; merging or combining two or more droplets into a single droplet; diluting a droplet; mixing a droplet; agitating a droplet; deforming a droplet; retaining a droplet in position; incubating a droplet; heating a droplet; vaporizing a droplet; cooling a droplet; disposing of a droplet; transporting a droplet out of a droplet actuator; other droplet operations described herein; and\/or any combination of the foregoing. The terms \u201cmerge,\u201d \u201cmerging,\u201d \u201ccombine,\u201d \u201ccombining\u201d and the like are used to describe the creation of one droplet from two or more droplets. It should be understood that when such a term is used in reference to two or more droplets, any combination of droplet operations that are sufficient to result in the combination of the two or more droplets into one droplet may be used. For example, \u201cmerging droplet A with droplet B,\u201d can be achieved by transporting droplet A into contact with a stationary droplet B, transporting droplet B into contact with a stationary droplet A, or transporting droplets A and B into contact with each other. The terms \u201csplitting,\u201d \u201cseparating\u201d and \u201cdividing\u201d are not intended to imply any particular outcome with respect to volume of the resulting droplets (i.e., the volume of the resulting droplets can be the same or different) or number of resulting droplets (the number of resulting droplets may be 2, 3, 4, 5 or more). The term \u201cmixing\u201d refers to droplet operations which result in more homogenous distribution of one or more components within a droplet. Examples of \u201cloading\u201d droplet operations include microdialysis loading, pressure assisted loading, robotic loading, passive loading, and pipette loading. Droplet operations may be electrode-mediated. In some cases, droplet operations are further facilitated by the use of hydrophilic and\/or hydrophobic regions on surfaces and\/or by physical obstacles.","\u201cFiller fluid\u201d means a liquid associated with a droplet operations substrate of a droplet actuator, which liquid is sufficiently immiscible with a droplet phase to render the droplet phase subject to electrode-mediated droplet operations. The filler fluid may, for example, be a low-viscosity oil, such as silicone oil. Other examples of filler fluids are provided in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2006\/047486, entitled, \u201cDroplet-Based Biochemistry,\u201d filed on Dec. 11, 2006; International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2008\/072604, entitled \u201cUse of additives for enhancing droplet actuation,\u201d filed on Aug. 8, 2008; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080283414, entitled \u201cElectrowetting Devices,\u201d filed on May 17, 2007; the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The filler fluid may fill the entire gap of the droplet actuator or may coat one or more surfaces of the droplet actuator. Filler fluid may be conductive or non-conductive. Filler fluid may also be a wax-like material that can be melted at elevated temperatures to fill the entire chip.","\u201cImmobilize\u201d with respect to magnetically responsive beads, means that the beads are substantially restrained in position in a droplet or in filler fluid on a droplet actuator. For example, in one embodiment, immobilized beads are sufficiently restrained in position to permit execution of a splitting operation on a droplet, yielding one droplet with substantially all of the beads and one droplet substantially lacking in the beads.","\u201cMagnetically responsive\u201d means responsive to a magnetic field. \u201cMagnetically responsive beads\u201d include or are composed of magnetically responsive materials, such as, for example, DYNABEADS\u00ae MYONE\u2122 beads. Examples of magnetically responsive materials include paramagnetic materials, ferromagnetic materials, ferrimagnetic materials, and metamagnetic materials. Examples of suitable paramagnetic materials include iron, nickel, and cobalt, as well as metal oxides, such as FeO, BaFeO, CoO, NiO, MnO, CrO, and CoMnP. The magnetic field may be produced by any magnetic field generating device which is suitable for causing the intended effect. Examples of magnetic field generating devices include permanent magnets and electromagnets. The product of the field magnitude and the gradient generate the force on magnetically responsive beads. In configuring systems of the invention, the field magnitude or gradient may be altered as needed to achieve a desired result. In some cases, a combination of electromagnet plus rare earth magnet may be used to manipulate magnetically responsive beads.","\u201cWashing\u201d with respect to washing a bead means reducing the amount and\/or concentration of one or more substances in contact with the magnetically responsive bead or exposed to the magnetically responsive bead from a droplet in contact with the magnetically responsive bead. The reduction in the amount and\/or concentration of the substance may be partial, substantially complete, or even complete. The substance may be any of a wide variety of substances; examples include target substances for further analysis, and unwanted substances, such as components of a sample, contaminants, and\/or excess reagent. In some embodiments, a washing operation begins with a starting droplet in contact with a magnetically responsive bead, where the droplet includes an initial amount and initial concentration of a substance. The washing operation may proceed using a variety of droplet operations. The washing operation may yield a droplet including the magnetically responsive bead, where the droplet has a total amount and\/or concentration of the substance which is less than the initial amount and\/or concentration of the substance. Examples of suitable washing techniques are described in Pamula et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,439,014, entitled \u201cDroplet-Based Surface Modification and Washing,\u201d granted on Oct. 21, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The unbound substances being removed from the liquid surrounding the beads","The terms \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cover,\u201d \u201cunder,\u201d and \u201con\u201d are used throughout the description with reference to the relative positions of components of the droplet actuator, such as relative positions of top and bottom substrates of the droplet actuator. It will be appreciated that the droplet actuator is functional regardless of its orientation in space.","When a liquid in any form (e.g., a droplet or a continuous body, whether moving or stationary) is described as being \u201con\u201d, \u201cat\u201d, or \u201cover\u201d an electrode, array, matrix or surface, such liquid could be either in direct contact with the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface, or could be in contact with one or more layers or films that are interposed between the liquid and the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface.","When a droplet is described as being \u201con\u201d or \u201cloaded on\u201d a droplet actuator, it should be understood that the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates using the droplet actuator to conduct one or more droplet operations on the droplet, the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates sensing of a property of or a signal from the droplet, and\/or the droplet has been subjected to a droplet operation on the droplet actuator.","The invention provides devices and methods for resuspending or circulating beads in a bead-containing droplet on a droplet actuator. During an incubation or washing protocol, for example, a bead-containing droplet may be subjected to one or more droplet operations to resuspend or circulate beads within the droplet. These droplet operations may, for example, be mediated by electrowetting or other electric field mediated phenomena. Suitable droplet operations may be selected to improve reaction kinetics, such as by agitating, redistributing, and or circulating droplet contents and\/or controlling droplet temperature. Redistribution or circulation of beads within a droplet may increase binding of a target analyte to the beads and\/or free up unbound substances from within magnetically aggregated beads.","8.1 Bead Incubation and Washing","Magnetically responsive beads have a tendency to settle and form aggregates due to gravity and\/or exposure to magnetic forces. Non-magnetically responsive beads may also aggregate due to surface interactions between beads or between substances bound to beads. Aggregation reduces the available surface area for binding and slows reaction kinetics, increasing time to result and\/or reducing assay sensitivity. Interstices in magnetically responsive bead aggregates can also hold unbound substances. These trapped substances may be difficult or impossible to separate from the beads during washing processes, reducing sensitivity of assay results. The invention provides techniques for circulating or mixing beads within a droplet to overcome these issues. The invention also provides incubation protocols that make use of these recirculation techniques for improving binding of molecules to the magnetically responsive beads. Moreover, the invention provides washing protocols that make use of these recirculation techniques for removing unbound molecules from the magnetically responsive beads.","8.1.1 Incubation Protocols","As observed above, beads in a droplet on a droplet actuator are subject to bead aggregation issues. These bead-containing droplets may be provided on a droplet operations surface of a droplet actuator. The droplet operations surface may, in some cases, be provided within a droplet operations gap of a droplet actuator. The droplet may be partially or substantially completely surrounded by a filler fluid. The droplet may be provided in a reservoir associated with a droplet actuator. The reservoir may be in fluid communication with a liquid path configured for transporting liquid from the reservoir onto a droplet operations surface of a droplet actuator. Here again, the droplet operations surface may, in some cases, be provided within a droplet operations gap of a droplet actuator.","The bead-containing droplet may be subjected to bead resuspension protocols on the droplet actuator. During an incubation or washing protocol, for example, the bead-containing droplet may be subjected to one or more droplet operations to resuspend or circulate beads within the droplet. These droplet operations may, for example, be mediated by electrowetting or other electric field mediated phenomena. Suitable droplet operations may be selected to improve reaction kinetics, such as by agitating, redistributing, and or circulating droplet contents and\/or controlling droplet temperature. Redistribution or circulation of beads within a droplet may increase binding of a target analyte to the beads and\/or free up unbound substances from within magnetically aggregated beads.","Droplet transport is an example of a droplet operation selected to redistribute or circulate beads within a droplet. During transport from electrode-to-electrode, contents of the bead-containing are circulated and redistributed within the droplet. Other examples of droplet operations suitable for enhancing incubation or washing include splitting and merging droplet operations. Any combination of droplet operations may be used. Multiple droplet operations may be combined to provide a complete incubation cycle (e.g., transport-split-merge, transport-split-transport-merge-transport). Incubation cycles may be repeated any number of times to achieve a desired result, such as a desired degree of mixing of beads with contents of the droplet.","The incubated droplet may include any suitable components that require incubation. For example, the droplet may include reagents and\/or sample for conducting an immunoassay. A droplet including beads having a binding affinity for an analyte may be subjected to one or more incubation cycles to improve binding of the analyte to the beads. Beads bound to an analyte may be subjected to one or more incubation cycles in a droplet with secondary antibody to improve binding of the secondary antibody to the target. In another case, the magnetic beads already containing the sample of interest can be incubated with an elution buffer to elute the sample bound to the beads and transport it to further processing. In that case, the beads would be transported to waste reservoir after eluting off the sample. It should also be noted that incubation cycles may be used to enhance the kinetics of chemical reactions even in droplets where beads are not present. As another example, a droplet including cells and reagents for supplying one or more metabolic requirements of the cells may be subjected to one or more incubation cycles to improve supply of the metabolic reagent to the cells. In some cases, the cells may be bound to beads. In another embodiment, the incubation can be between a chemiluminescence or fluorescence producing reagent with an enzyme on an immuno-complex bound to magnetic beads. Effective resuspension of magnetic beads by incubating the enzyme labeled magnetic beads would improve the sensitivity of the assay.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1E","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","118","118","110","118","114","110","110","110","114","110","118","110","122","118","114","114","110","118","110","122","118","114","122","122","118","114","122","118","114","122","118","118","118","122","114","122","122","118","122","114","118","110","122","118","114","118","110","110"]},"In , droplet  including beads  is positioned adjacent to and overlapping droplet operations electrodes M.

In , droplet  is transported to and elongated along several electrodes M using droplet operations mediated at least in part by electrodes M. In this manner, droplet  is caused to conform to an elongated geometry. The transformation of droplet  from a rounded configuration to an elongated configuration produces a flow of liquid within droplet  that redistributes beads  in droplet  allowing interaction of the beads with several parts of the droplet more effectively. In , elongated droplet  is split using droplet operations to form daughter droplets A, B. Two daughter droplets A, B are illustrated here, but any number of daughter droplets may be formed within the scope of the invention. Splitting of droplet  redistributes beads  within the daughter droplets A, B. In , daughter droplets A,B are merged using droplet operations mediated by electrodes M to reform droplet . This merging is accomplished while beads  are being attracted by the magnetic field of magnet .

Also, the droplet can be transported at higher switching speeds allowing very little time for the magnetic beads to get attracted. Higher droplet switching speeds would enable better binding efficiency of the analyte onto the magnetic beads thereby requiring lesser incubation time. In this case the magnet is right underneath the droplet containing magnetic beads, there is a higher chance of aggregation of beads since the magnetic beads are always under the effect of magnetic field gradient at every step of incubation. This effect would be more pronounced in cases of longer incubation times or multiple steps of incubation resulting in clumps of beads. However, incubation of the beads right over the magnet would be useful when the real estate available is very little and the sensitivity requirements are not as stringent, wherein the typical dynamic range of the analyte concentration is 1 ng\/mL to 100 ng\/mL and the incubation times are in the range of 30 seconds to 300 seconds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2E","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 2B-2E"],"b":["100","122","114","114","122","118","122","118","118","114","122","2"]},"In , droplet  with beads  is positioned adjacent to droplet operations electrodes M, such that beads  are attracted by the magnetic field of magnet .

Therefore, in such a case, incubation may be performed only for 5 minutes but still capturing 80% of the antigen. On the other hand, if real estate is not an issue and if a few more electrodes off-magnet could be utilized for incubation, then 100% of the antigen can be captured within 4 minutes. The same effect of off-magnet incubation could also be obtained by mechanically moving the magnet away from the droplet actuator.","FIG.

Immunoassays were performed on a 600 nL droplet that contained 10 pg\/mL of Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TnF-\u03b1). The sequence of droplet operations in the incubation protocol involved shuttling the droplet along a linear path of electrodes with no split-merge operation as shown in . Effect of switching speed on the signal obtained was studied by performing the immunoassay using different switching speeds at the same incubation time. Since the total incubation time was fixed, the droplets had to be oscillated for a larger number of cycles at higher switching speeds in order to maintain the same total incubation time.","8.1.2 Washing Protocols","The invention provides washing protocols for removing unbound molecules from the magnetically responsive beads. The input to a washing protocol is a bead-containing droplet including unbound substances, and the output is typically a bead-containing droplet in which the concentration and\/or quantity of these unbound substances is reduced relative to the concentration and\/or quantity present in the input droplet. Washing is thus a critical step in the implementation of many assay protocols. In some embodiments, washing is performed using a merge-and-split wash protocol. A merge-and-split wash protocol generally involves merging a bead-containing droplet with a wash droplet and then splitting off a supernatant droplet which carries away at least a portion of the unbound substances. In some cases, an initial droplet is subjected to one or more splitting steps prior to the initial wash droplet merge step. Droplet splitting steps are typically performed in the presence of a magnet, so that the split yields one or more bead-containing droplets in which the concentration and\/or quantity of unbound substances is reduced relative to the concentration and\/or quantity present in prior to the split and one or more droplets without a substantial amount of beads wherein the concentration and\/or quantity of unbound substances is increased relative to the concentration and\/or quantity present prior to the split. Bead retention is important, particularly when the process involves multiple wash cycles, each cycle may potentially reduce the number of retained beads. The washing steps may be repeated as needed until the unbound substances are sufficiently depleted from the liquid surrounding the beads. In some cases, the unbound substances are substantially or completely depleted from the liquid surrounding the beads.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-5E","b":["500","516","514","514","522","514","516"]},"Electrode\/magnet arrangement  may include an arrangement (e.g., a path or array) of droplet operations electrodes .

A plot of number of wash cycles versus the chemiluminescent signal was obtained for both the washing protocols, as illustrated in . Wash cycles may typically range from about 2 to about 30 seconds. The time for each wash cycle generally depends on the distance a wash droplet has to travel from the wash reservoir to the magnetic beads en route to the waste reservoir, transport speed of the droplets, dispensing and disposal rates of the droplets.","Since washing on droplet actuator involves several dilution steps, the time to result can be seriously affected when several wash cycles are required to achieve the desired wash efficiency.  shows the chemiluminescence signal obtained from an immunoassay after the droplets were subjected to different numbers of wash cycles and different wash protocols. In both the cases presented herein, incubation was performed using the off-magnet incubation protocol for 3 minutes. Each wash cycle takes about 8-10 seconds in the slug-based protocol and 8-14 seconds in the circular droplet protocol. It can be seen from , that when washing was performed using slugs of liquid (or elongated droplets as shown in ) desired wash levels were achieved using fewer wash cycles when compared to washing using circular shaped droplets. In the former, mixing was minimized and the bulk of the unbound material from the supernatant was replaced with fresh wash buffer, whereas in the latter mixing was facilitated by operating the 2\u00d7 droplets using only one electrode each. The shading used in  depict the situation achieved by operating the 2\u00d7 droplet using two electrodes and one electrode respectively. Also, it was observed visually that the dispersion of magnetic beads in the lateral plane was higher in the elongated droplet washing when the fresh wash buffer droplet merged with the magnetic bead droplet. This would enable the breaking up of aggregates and any unbound antibody trapped in the interstices to diffuse into the supernatant and be washed away instantly or in subsequent washes. Hence desired wash levels were achieved in \u02dc10 washes using elongated droplet washing, as compared to >18 washes in the rounded droplet washing. The washing behavior has two distinct regimes, one regime where washing is very pronounced and the second where the washing is more subtle. In the slug based washing case, the washing is pronounced with each wash cycle up to 9 cycles, after which the effect of washing is almost subtle or negligible. In the rounded droplet protocol, the washing effect is pronounced until the 15th wash, although the step wash efficiency is less than that observed for the slug-based protocol. Washing is only marginally effective for the circular droplet protocol between the 15th and 18cycles.

Immunoassays were performed on TnI (100 ng\/mL) using an on-magnet incubation protocol and a circular shaped droplet washing protocol. As shown in , about 90% of the end point signal was obtained in about 120 to about 130 seconds. For a lower concentration of the analyte, maximum signal was achieved in about <120 seconds. Based on this data, for the type of substrate used, 2 minutes may be selected as an optimum incubation time to generate maximum signal for the chemiluminescence reaction. However, if the chemiluminescence reaction is observed to behave as a flash signal instead of a glow reaction, the 2 minute incubation may be reduced to about a few seconds. The peak intensity of flash signal obtained is again a function of the mixing efficiency between the magnetic beads and the trigger solution. Efficient mixing can be obtained by oscillating the magnetic beads with the substrate solution at high switching speeds.","Immunoassay kits were obtained from Beckman Coulter for Troponin I (TnI) containing capture antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads, reporter antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and standards (0 ng\/mL-100 ng\/mL).

Various techniques described herein for manipulating beads in droplets may also be employed with electrode\/magnet arrangement . As illustrated, droplet  is a 3\u00d7 droplet, meaning that its footprint is approximately 3 times the area of one droplet operations electrode . Droplet  may be formed by merging a magnetic bead-containing droplet with a sample droplet, e.g., by merging a 1\u00d7 magnetic bead containing droplet with a 2\u00d7 sample droplet. Magnetically responsive beads  are coated with a primary antibody that has an affinity for a specific target antigen. An example of a process of cytokine detection on a droplet actuator may include one or more of the following steps:","Step A of  shows a droplet  that has magnetically responsive beads  therein and is positioned at a certain droplet operations electrode . Droplet  is formed by merging a 1\u00d7 magnetic bead containing droplet with a 2\u00d7 sample droplet.","Steps B and C of  show an incubation process, in which droplet  is repeatedly transported back and forth via droplet operations to adjacent electrodes . Repeated transporting of droplet  is used during incubation of beads  and sample in order to provide sufficient resuspension and mixing of magnetically responsive beads  for optimal antibody and antigen binding. Typically, two or three droplet operations electrodes  may be used to transport a 3\u00d7 droplet , which takes on an elongated or slug shaped geometry. In one nonlimiting example, droplet  may be incubated for 6 minutes using 2 droplet operations electrodes  and transporting droplet  over a span of 8 electrodes at a switching speed of 5 Hertz (Hz). The incubation cycle may include any combination of droplet operations that provides for sufficient mixing of beads  with the contents of droplet . It will be appreciated that timing and steps of the incubation protocol may vary depending on the sample content, the degree and\/or specificity of affinity of the beads for the target substance, and the purpose of the assay being performed. Droplet  is illustrated in the figure as a 2\u00d7 droplet; however, in other embodiments, the droplet may have a size which ranges from about 1\u00d7 to about 6\u00d7, or even larger. In some cases, the droplet may have a size which is approximately 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 3\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 5\u00d7, 6\u00d7, or larger.","Step D of  shows droplet  that has magnetically responsive beads  therein transported to droplet operations electrode M. A supernatant droplet  is split off using droplet operations. Because magnetically responsive beads  are attracted to magnet , they are retained in droplet  during the splitting operation. Supernatant droplet  is substantially free of beads. In one example, supernatant droplet  is a 1\u00d7 droplet and droplet  is now a 2\u00d7 droplet. Supernatant droplet  may be discarded or transported downstream for use in another process (e.g., merged with another set of beads having affinity for a different target). Droplet  may also be subjected to a wash protocol, such as a merge-and-split wash protocol, to remove additional unbound materials from the beads.","Step E of  shows a reagent droplet  that includes secondary antibody being transported using droplet operations to droplet operations electrode M. Reagent droplet  is merged with droplet  (i.e., a 2\u00d7 droplet) using droplet operations to form, for example, a 3\u00d7 reaction droplet. In one example, reagent droplet  is a 1\u00d7 droplet that includes biotinylated secondary antibody that has an affinity to the target antigen. Merged droplet  is subjected to one or more on-magnet or off-magnet incubation cycles. In one embodiment, merged droplet  is incubated for about 4 minutes the incubation cycle described in steps B and C. Following the incubation period, droplet  is transported using droplet operations to droplet operations electrode M, and a 1\u00d7 supernatant droplet is split off using droplet operations, as described in step D, in order to yield a 2\u00d7 droplet . The supernatant droplet (not shown) that includes unbound secondary antibody may be discarded. In an alternative embodiment, droplet  is parked on the electrode path at a position which is outside the attractive influence of the magnet, and droplet  is transported away from the magnet and merged with droplet . The combined droplet may, for example, be positioned in a manner which is similar to the position of droplet  in Step A.","Step F of  shows a bead washing step, in which a wash droplet  is transported from wash reservoir  along droplet operations electrodes . Wash droplet  merges with droplet . Beads  may be restrained during a droplet splitting operation in which one or more bead-free supernatant droplets are removed from droplet . The process may be repeated, and in some cases beads may be resuspended during the washing step, e.g., using the resuspension techniques discussed herein. This is done to remove any unbound material trapped in between the interstices of the magnetic beads. Here, as in other steps and other processes described herein, supernatant droplets may be discarded or transported elsewhere for use as input to another process.","Step G of  shows one or more reagent droplets  (e.g., , ) transported to droplet operations electrode M. In one example, reagent droplet that includes a blocking agent (e.g., Elisa Synblock) and reagent droplet that includes a streptavidin-enzyme conjugate (e.g., streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase) are transported to droplet operations electrode M and merged using droplet operations with droplet . Merged droplet  is incubated for 4 minutes using droplet operations, as described in steps B and C of . Following the incubation period, droplet  is transported to droplet operations electrode M and a supernatant droplet (i.e., a 1\u00d7 droplet) is split off using droplet operations, as described in step D of , in order to yield a 2\u00d7 droplet . The supernatant droplet (not shown) that includes unbound streptavidin-enzyme conjugate may be discarded. Droplet  is subsequently washed, for example 15 times, as described in step F of . Following bead washing, a 1\u00d7 supernatant droplet is split off droplet , as described in step D of , in order to yield a 1\u00d7 droplet . The supernatant droplet (not shown) is discarded. Droplet  that includes antibody-antigen sandwich is now ready for detection. In an alternative embodiment, droplet  is parked on the electrode path at a position which is outside the attractive influence of the magnet, and droplet  is transported away from the magnet and merged with droplet . The combined droplet may, for example, be positioned in a manner which is similar to the position of droplet  in Step A. Following this step, the merged droplet may be subjected to an incubation protocol, followed by immobilization of the beads at the magnet and splitting of the droplet to yield a supernatant droplet.","Step H of  shows droplet  (1\u00d7 droplet) that includes a detection substrate  transported to droplet operations electrode M and merged using droplet operations with droplet . The detection substrate  is converted by the enzyme conjugate into a fluorescent signal (product formation time about 15-20 seconds). The chemiluminescent signal is measured by a detector (not shown) in order to determine the quantity of antigen that is present. In some embodiments, wash buffer droplets may be transported across the detection window following each chemiluminescent droplet to clean up the detection window and the detection loop prior to the next detection.","In a related embodiment, the invention may make use of an enzyme or a series of enzymes to generate a signal amplification cascade. The cascade improves the sensitivity of the detection system. As an example, the signal cascade may terminate with firefly luciferase converting luciferin to light in a \u201cflash\u201d chemiluminescence reaction. In one example, \u03b2-galactosidase may be coupled to an antibody or streptavidin. Luciferin-\u03b2-galactoside, which is not a substrate for luciferase, may be delivered to the immuno-complex, incubated and hydrolyzed to free luciferin and galactose by the \u03b2-galactosidase. The luciferin is then delivered to the PMT where it is mixed with excess ATP and firefly luciferase. All of the luciferin is rapidly converted to light in a flash reaction. Beta-galactosidase can form 700 pmole luciferin per ng enzyme per minute which is equivalent to 7photons per second. In this method the background is very low, and unlike the currently used glow substrates, all of the assay signal may be captured in the short time of the flash reaction. This method also reduces or eliminates the currently observed contamination of long-lived glow chemiluminescent products on-actuator because of the short life time of the luciferin product. It just decays away spontaneously so washing to remove glowing products is eliminated. This system is not a signal regeneration loop like the one used in pyrosequencing.","The steps in the flash assay may be achieved using droplet operations. For example, a droplet protocol may include providing a first droplet comprising \u03b2-galactosidase-antibody or \u03b2-galactosidase-streptavidin. A second droplet including luciferin-\u03b2-galactoside, which is not a substrate for luciferase, may be combined with the first droplet to yield a third droplet. The third droplet may be incubated and hydrolyzed to free luciferin and galactose by the beta-galactosidase. The third droplet including freed luciferin may be transported using droplet operations into the presence of a sensor, such as a PMT, where it is combined using droplet operations with a droplet comprising excess ATP and luciferase (e.g., firefly luciferase). The luciferin is rapidly converted to light in a flash reaction.","The flash assay of the invention may be performed on a droplet actuator, in oil. In some embodiments, a common detection window is used for multiple assays. Where glow assays are used, microdroplets from previous reactions may create background signal that interferes with detection of subsequent droplets. The flash assay of the invention provides a means whereby multiple droplets may be processed for detection in a common detection window on a droplet actuator in a filler fluid with little or no background signal remaining between droplets. For example, little or no background signal from a previous droplet may remain in oil or in microdroplets in oil in proximity to the detection window. In some cases, background signal interference from previous droplets is substantially eliminated by using the flash procedure.","In flash assays, it may be useful to use wash droplets that include the trigger solution to clean droplet transport lanes. Electrode paths that have been used to transport the substrate may be washed by transporting one or more wash droplets across some portion or all of the same area. The wash droplets may include the flash enzyme. For example, the wash droplet(s) may include luciferase or luciferase and ATP.","As another example, acridinium ester (AE) may be used as a chemiluminescent label in a flash assay of the invention. The AE signal quickly rises to a high value, typically in less than about 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 seconds upon addition of the trigger solution. The signal decays to very low values, typically in less than about 60, 30, 20, or 10 seconds. This decay may eliminate contamination on the detection loop and the detection spot. However, contamination may still be present on the wash lanes and the incubation region by free secondary antibody bound with AE which can potentially affect the subsequent assays performed on the same lane. Transporting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more droplets of the AE trigger solution over the electrodes that are contaminated with antibody bound with AE would produce chemiluminescence which would decay quickly, substantially eliminating AE contamination.","8.1.9 IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 Example","A 1\u00d7 droplet including beads with capture Ab was combined using droplet operations with a 2\u00d7 droplet sample to yield a 3\u00d7 reaction droplet. The 3\u00d7 reaction droplet was subjected to an off-magnet incubation protocol for 6 minutes (shuttled the 3\u00d7 droplet using 2 electrodes over a span of 8 electrodes with no split at a switching speed of 5 Hz). The reaction droplet was transported to the magnet, and a 1\u00d7 supernatant droplet was split from the reaction droplet to yield a 2\u00d7 bead-containing droplet. A 1\u00d7 droplet including biotinylated secondary Ab was added to the 2\u00d7 droplet to yield a 3\u00d7 droplet, which was incubated for 4 minutes using the same protocol at a switching speed of 5 Hz. The reaction droplet was again transported to the magnet, and a 1\u00d7 supernatant droplet was split from the reaction droplet to yield a 2\u00d7 bead-containing droplet. Beads were washed using a merge-and-split wash protocol. Wash buffer droplets were 2\u00d7 slugs of IA wash buffer. This process was repeated 5 times to remove most of the unbound secondary antibody and sample from the supernatant. After washing, a 1\u00d7 supernatant droplet was split off of the bead droplet using droplet operations to yield a 1\u00d7 reaction droplet. A 1\u00d7 droplet including phosphate free Synblock and a 1\u00d7 droplet including Streptavidin-ALP were added to the 1\u00d7 bead droplet to yield a 3\u00d7 reaction droplet. Synblock acts as the blocking agent preventing any non-specific adsorption of reagents onto the beads while the streptavidin-ALP binds to the biotinylated secondary antibody. The 3\u00d7 reaction droplet was incubated using the same incubation protocol at 5 Hz for 4 minutes. The droplet was transported to the magnet, and a 1\u00d7 supernatant droplet was split off from the 3\u00d7 reaction droplet to yield a 2\u00d7 reaction droplet. The 2\u00d7 reaction droplet was then subjected to merge-and-split droplet washing protocol. The process was repeated 15 times to ensure no unbound streptavidin-ALP floating in the supernatant which would result in false positives. After washing is complete, the 2\u00d7 droplet was split at the magnet to yield a final 1\u00d7 bead-containing droplet. The 1\u00d7 droplet with the magnetic beads containing the immuno-complex was merged with a 1\u00d7 chemiluminescent substrate droplet and incubated for 120 seconds.

Although magnetic beads are shown in the figure for solid support, the surface of the droplet actuator modified with capture elements, such as nucleic acids, antibodies or antigens, can be used as a fixed solid support instead of magnetic beads. In one example, the binding and the number of immobilized quantum dots may be correlated to the level of an analyte, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), by fluorescent imaging of quantum dots on, for example, a carbon substrate. Furthermore, a spatially multiplexed cytokine approach using a protein microarray with a single type of quantum dot may be used to detect certain cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-13 and IL-1) in a single solution down to a parts-per-million concentration level.

Alternatively, an optical system for separating spectral information may include dichroic beamsplitters in combination with narrowband filters. For example, a filter-based design that may measure 12 spots and 4 spectral channels may include 36 separate dichroic beamsplitters (e.g., 3 per detection spot), 48 narrowband filters, and 48 detectors.

Microfluidics assay multiplexing platform  provides sandwich immunoassay capability with the ability to reach detection limits that are clinically prognostic. While  describe a combined multiplex approach of a 4-plex spectral multiplex capability with a 12-plex spatial multiplex capability, this is exemplary only. Microfluidics assay multiplexing platform  of the invention may be used to combine n-plex spectral multiplex capability with a m-plex spatial multiplex capability, where n and m denote two numbers for the order of multiplexing and in a limiting case can be the same order. Microfluidics assay multiplexing platform  of the invention may be, for example, a 96-plex protein assay system that provides spectral multiplexing to an 8-plex spectral capability combined with 12-plex spatial capability, thereby proving 96-plex capability using only about 30 microliter (\u03bcL) total sample. In existing multiplexing technology, achieving multiplexability beyond 10-plex in a single solution without assay cross-reactivity is an extremely difficult exercise. However, by combining spatial and spectral multiplexing in the microfluidics assay multiplexing platform  of the invention, this antibody-crosstalk barrier can be mitigated and reduced to order of spectral multiplexing. For example, instead of a 10-plex (where 10 antibody pairs resulting in 100 combinations need to be tested for cross reactivity), with spectral multiplexing, two 5-plex assays can be setup which broadens the potential combinations of antibody pairs (where 5 antibody pairs result only in 25 combinations).","8.3 Dielectrophoresis","The invention provides a droplet actuator having unique electrode structures for manipulating particles within a droplet on the droplet actuator, as well as methods of performing such manipulations. The invention makes use of dielectrophoresis (DEP). Polarizable particles are concentrated at locations of highest or lowest electrical field strength. The droplet actuator of the invention includes electrodes configured to produce non-uniform electrical fields, i.e., fields in which electrical field intensities are spatially variable. In this manner, particles may be concentrated, regionalized, isolated, or trapped within or guided to a region of a droplet on a droplet actuator. The DEP electrodes of the invention may be configured in association with the top substrate (when present) and\/or on the bottom substrate of the droplet actuator. Typically, the DEP electrodes will be on a surface of the top and\/or bottom substrate and will be covered with a dielectric coating.
