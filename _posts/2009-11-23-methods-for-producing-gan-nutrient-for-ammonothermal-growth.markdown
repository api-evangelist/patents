title: Methods for producing GaN nutrient for ammonothermal growth
abstract: The present invention discloses methods to produce large quantities of polycrystalline GaN for use in the ammonothermal growth of group III-nitride material. High production rates of GaN can be produced in a hydride vapor phase growth system. One drawback to enhanced polycrystalline growth is the increased incorporation of impurities, such as oxygen. A new reactor design using non-oxide material that reduces impurity concentrations is disclosed. Purification of remaining source material after an ammonothermal growth is also disclosed. The methods described produce sufficient quantities of polycrystalline GaN source material for the ammonothermal growth of group III-nitride material.

Field of the Invention","The invention is related to a production method of polycrystalline GaN for use as a nutrient or source material in the ammonothermal method. Design of the reactor material to control impurities while producing high yields is discussed.","2. Description of the Existing Technology","Gallium nitride (GaN) and its related group III alloys are the key material for various opto-electronic and electronic devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes (LDs), microwave power transistors, and solar-blind photo detectors. Currently LEDs are widely used in cell phones, indicators, displays, and LDs are used in data storage disc drives. The majority of these devices are grown epitaxially on heterogeneous substrates, such as sapphire and silicon carbide. The heteroepitaxial growth of group III-nitride causes highly defected or even cracked films, which hinders the realization of high-end optical and electronic devices, such as high-brightness LEDs for general lighting or high-power microwave transistors.","Most of the problems inherent in heteroepitaxial growth could be avoided by instead using homoepitaxial growth. Single crystalline group III-nitride wafers can be sliced from bulk group III-nitride crystal ingots and then utilized for high-end homoepitaxial growth of optical and electronic devices. For the majority of devices, single crystalline GaN wafers are favorable because it is relatively easy to control the conductivity of the wafer and GaN wafers will provide the smallest lattice\/thermal mismatch with device layers. However, the GaN wafers needed for homogenous growth are currently expensive compared to heteroepitaxial substrates. It has been difficult to grow group III-nitride crystal ingots due to their high melting point and high nitrogen vapor pressure at high temperature. Growth methods using molten Ga, such as high-pressure high-temperature synthesis (S. Porowski, , Res. 4S1, (1999), G1.3; and T. Inoue, et al., . (), 223, (2001), 15) and sodium flux (M. Aoki et al., 242, (2002) 70; and T. Iwahashi, et al., 253, (2003), 1), have been proposed to grow GaN crystals. Nevertheless the crystal shape grown using molten Ga is a thin platelet because molten Ga has low solubility of nitrogen and a low diffusion coefficient of nitrogen.","The ammonothermal method is a promising alternative growth method that has been used to achieve successful growth of real bulk GaN ingots (T. Hashimoto, et al., 46, (2007), L889). Ammonothermal growth has the potential for growing large GaN crystal ingots because its solvent, high-pressure ammonia, has advantages as a fluid medium including high transport speed and solubility of the source materials, such as GaN polycrystals or metallic Ga.","State-of-the-art ammonothermal method (U.S. Pat. No. 6,656,615; International Application Publication Nos. WO 2007\/008198; and WO 2007\/117689; and U.S. Application Publication No. 2007\/0234946) requires a sufficient supply of source material. While pure Ga metal can be used as a source material, it provides an uneven growth rate as the surface of the Ga nitridizes. To provide a more stable growth rate, polycrystalline GaN is desirable. One method to produce GaN polycrystals is direct nitridization of Ga with ammonia (H. Wu, et al., . (), 2 No. 7, (2005), 2074). Nevertheless, this method can only yield powder form of GaN (i.e. microcrystalline or nanocrystalline). On the other hand, GaN polycrystals obtained as a parasitic deposition during hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) show large grains with partially faceted surfaces. The parasitic GaN polycrystals in HVPE are in the suitable shape for ammonothermal nutrients; however, since HVPE are designed to minimize polycrystalline deposits and to improve epitaxial growth, the production yield of the GaN polycrystals is very low. Thus, using parasitic GaN polycrystals in HVPE as ammonothermal nutrient is not practical for mass production of bulk GaN. A method to produce large quantities of polycrystalline source material would improve the feasibility to scale the ammonothermal growth and facilitate large-scale production of high-end GaN ingots.","All references cited herein are incorporated in their entirety by this reference.","The present disclosure describes methods and reactor designs for growing polycrystalline group III nitride, such as polycrystalline gallium nitride (GaN). The polycrystalline group III nitride material is suitable for use in the formation of single-crystal group III nitride ingots.","According to a first embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method of producing polycrystalline group III nitride. The method comprises contacting a gaseous hydrogen halide with a group III element source material in a first heated region to produce a group III halide gas, contacting the group III halide gas with ammonia gas in a growth region, and producing a crystalline group III nitride, wherein greater than 80% of the total produced group III nitride is polycrystalline group III nitride. In specific embodiments, the group III element may be gallium.","According to another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for recycling polycrystalline GaN source material used in a previous ammonothermal growth process. The method comprises heating and maintaining the polycrystalline GaN source material at a temperature greater than 700\u00b0 C., back etching a surface of the polycrystalline GaN source material to provide a back etched polycrystalline GaN, and depositing additional polycrystalline GaN on the surface of the back etched polycrystalline GaN by a hydride vapor phase growth process.","Still other embodiments of the present disclosure provide a reactor for growing polycrystalline GaN. The reactor comprises a first heated region comprising a first gas inlet configured to introduce a nitrogen-containing gas, a second heated region comprising a second gas inlet configured to introduce a halide-containing gas, wherein the first heated region and the second heated region are configured to maintain separation of the gases in each region, and a growth region in gaseous contact with the first heated region and the second heated region and configured to allow growth of polycrystalline GaN.","Another embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for forming single-crystal GaN. The method comprises forming a polycrystalline GaN by a hydride vapor phase growth process, utilizing the polycrystalline GaN as the gallium source material in an ammonothermal crystal growth process, and forming single-crystal GaN by the ammonothermal crystal growth process.","The present disclosure provides methods for growing polycrystalline group III nitride material suitable for use as a group III nitride source material in formation of single-crystal group III nitride compositions, for example by an ammonothermal growth process. The methods of the present disclosure also allow for recycling of polycrystalline group III nitride materials remaining after an ammonothermal growth process. Reactors designed for growing polycrystalline group III nitride material are also disclosed.","Other than the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, processing conditions and the like used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term \u201cabout\u201d. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.","Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values, however, may contain certain errors, such as, for example, equipment and\/or operator error, necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.","Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of \u201c1 to 10\u201d is intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of less than or equal to 10.","Any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in part, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to the extent that the incorporated material does not conflict with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth in this disclosure. As such, and to the extent necessary, the disclosure as explicitly set forth herein supersedes any conflicting material incorporated herein by reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein, but which conflicts with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth herein will only be incorporated to the extent that no conflict arises between that incorporated material and the existing disclosure material.","The present disclosure describes several different features and aspects of the invention with reference to various exemplary non-limiting embodiments. It is understood, however, that the invention embraces numerous alternative embodiments, which may be accomplished by combining any of the different features, aspects, and embodiments described herein in any combination that one of ordinary skill in the art would find useful.","The present invention provides a method of producing polycrystalline GaN suitable for use as a nutrient or source material for the ammonothermal growth of group III-nitride wafers, primarily group III-nitride single crystalline wafers that include at least the element Ga with the possible addition of another group III elements B, Al, and In, such as AlGaN or InGaN (0\u2266x<1), or AlInGaN (0<x<1, 0<y<1). The group III-nitride wafers or ingots are grown by the ammonothermal method which utilizes high-pressure NHas a fluid medium, nutrient containing group III elements, and seed crystals that are group III-nitride single crystals. The high-pressure NHprovides high solubility of the nutrient and high transport speed of dissolved precursors. The ammonothermal growth requires the steady supply of a nutrient, such as Ga metal or GaN. A GaN source has the benefit of providing improved growth rate stability compared to Ga metal. One particularly useful GaN source material is polycrystalline GaN.","The Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE) method has widely been used to produce high quality single crystal GaN with low impurity concentrations. However, the traditional HVPE method is not a practical method to produce large quantities of polycrystalline GaN that may itself be used to grow single-crystal GaN, for example, by an ammonothermal growth process. HVPE traditionally minimizes polycrystalline deposits that can hamper the desired single crystal growth, i.e. HVPE reactor is not designed to grow polycrystalline GaN at fast growth rate. Also, using single crystalline GaN grown by HVPE as the ammonothermal nutrient is not practical since the growth rate of single crystalline GaN is significantly slower than that of polycrystalline GaN. The present disclosure provides a modification of the HVPE setup and a method in which the traditionally desired epitaxy is removed and the reactor design is instead optimized to produce a high yield of polycrystalline GaN. The polycrystalline GaN may be then used as a source material for single-crystal growth, for example, by an ammonothermal growth process. This new and non-obvious method will be denoted herein as Hydride Vapor Phase Growth (HVPG). The reactor and method may also be suitable for the formation of other polycrystalline group III nitrides, such as aluminum nitride (AlN), indium nitride (InN) and mixed group III nitrides, such as AlGaN or InGaN (0\u2266x<1), or AlInGaN (0<x<1, 0<y<1). According to the present methods and reactors, the Ga to GaN conversion efficiency increased to over 80%, as shown in the examples provided herein.","According to one embodiment, one method of applying HVPG for the formation of a group III nitride, such as gallium nitride; a group III halide gas, for example, a gallium halide gas such as gallium chloride gas enters a first region of the HVPG reactor. A second nitrogen-containing gas, such as ammonia enters the reactor in a second region of the reactor. The first region and the second region of the reactor are physically separated from one another by a wall or by a sufficient distance to allow the gases to migrate to the growth region without mixing to an appreciable extent or at all.","According to another embodiment, the group III halide gas may be formed by reacting a group III elemental material with a hydrogen halide gas. For example, in one embodiment gallium halide gas (GaX, where X is halide (i.e., F, Cl, Br, I) and z is an integer from 1-3) may be formed by reacting a gallium source material and a hydrogen halide gas, such as HF, HCl, HBr, or HI, in a first region of the reactor. Any suitable group III elemental material may be used as the source material. For example, for gallium, suitable Ga source material may include, but is not limited to, elemental Ga in metallic, liquid, powder, pellet, granule, wire, or rod form may be used. The hydrogen halide gas may be introduced into the first region of the reactor through an inlet, such as a nozzle. In this instance, the Ga source material, HCl, and the resultant GaCl may all be physically separated from the nitrogen-containing gas (i.e., the NHgas) until the GaCl enters a growth region of the reactor.","Thus, one embodiment of the methods of the present disclosure provides a method for producing polycrystalline group III nitride. The method may comprise contacting a gaseous hydrogen halide with a group III element source material in a first heated region to produce group III halide gas, contacting the group III halide gas with a nitrogen containing gas, such as ammonia gas, in a growth region, and producing a crystalline group III nitride, wherein greater than 80% of the total produced group III nitride is polycrystalline group III nitride.","According to one specific embodiment, the group III element may be gallium. In this embodiment, the group III halide gas is therefore, GaX, where X is a halide (F, Cl, Br, or I) and z is an integer from 1 to 3 and the group III nitride is GaN. In other embodiments, other group III elements such as aluminum or indium or mixtures of gallium with aluminum and\/or indium may be used as the group III element source material. For those embodiments where the group III element source material may comprise gallium, suitable Ga source material may include various forms of metallic Ga, such as, for example, liquid Ga, Ga powder, Ga pellets, Ga granules, Ga wire, Ga rods or ingots, or mixtures of any thereof. In those embodiments where the group III source material may comprise aluminum and\/or indium, equivalent forms of metallic aluminum or indium may be utilized.","According to one specific embodiment of the method, a gallium source material may be contacted with gaseous hydrogen chloride gas in a first heated region of the reactor. In these embodiments, the temperature of the first heated region may be at least 700\u00b0 C., for example, at a temperature ranging from 700\u00b0 C. to 1200\u00b0 C. For example, the gallium source material may be held within the first heated region of the reactor and the HCl gas may be introduced into the first heated region through a gas inlet such as a nozzle. The gallium source material may then react with the HCl gas to produce a gallium chloride gas, such as GaClwhere z is an integer from 1-3. The gallium chloride gas may then migrate or move from the first heated region to a growth region. The growth region may be at a temperature of at least 700\u00b0 C., for example at a temperature ranging from 700\u00b0 C. to 1300\u00b0 C. In the growth region, the gallium chloride gas may be contacted with ammonia gas to produce gallium nitride (GaN) vapor. The gallium nitride vapor may then deposit or crystallize in the growth region to form crystalline GaN, wherein greater than 80% of the total produced GaN nay be polycrystalline GaN. In specific embodiments, greater than 90% of the total produced GaN may be polycrystalline GaN.","In another embodiment, the method may comprise introducing a gallium halide gas, such as a gallium chloride gas into a first heated region and allowing the gallium halide gas to migrate to a growth region. The first heated region may have a temperature of at least 700\u00b0 C., for example at a temperature ranging from 700\u00b0 C. to 1200\u00b0 C. The gallium halide gas may then migrate to the growth region where it is contacted with ammonia gas to produce GaN vapor. The GaN vapor may then deposit or crystallize in the growth region as polycrystalline GaN, such as described before.","In certain embodiments, the growth region may not have any material deposited in it prior to polycrystalline GaN growth. Alternatively, the growth region may contain polycrystalline GaN prior to introducing gallium halide and nitrogen-containing gases. The pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may nucleate additional growth of polycrystalline GaN and\/or act as a template for additional growth. In some instances, the use of pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may increase yield of GaN in the reactor. The pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may have had its surface etched prior to introducing it into the growth region, or the pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may be etched once placed in the growth region.","In the present HVPG method, incorporation of impurities into the product polycrystalline group III nitride may increase due to increased growth rate. For example, in traditional HVPE growth of single crystalline GaN, oxygen concentration in single crystalline GaN is at the order of 10atoms\/cmeven though the reactor may be formed from an oxide containing material, such as quartz. On the other hand, polycrystalline GaN grown in a conventional HVPE setup showed oxygen concentration as high as 10atoms\/cm. Without intending to be limited by any theory, it is believed that this may be because polycrystalline group III nitride has more defects and grain boundaries which may act as incorporation sites of oxygen. Therefore, unlike HVPE growth of single crystalline group III nitride, it is preferable to avoid oxygen incorporation during HVPG growth of polycrystalline group III nitride. To remove any possible oxygen source to polycrystalline group III nitride, the HVPG reactors in the present disclosure utilizes non-oxide containing or forming materials, such as e.g. pyrolytic BN components or components formed of other suitable materials not formed of oxides, from which oxygen might be extracted when in direct contact with the hydrogen halide gas, the group III halide gas, and the ammonia NHin a heated region or growth region.","For example, impurities may be a larger concern for growth of polycrystalline GaN than for growth of single crystal GaN, since impurity incorporation is significantly greater for growth of polycrystalline material compared to single crystal epitaxial films grown by the traditional HVPE. For example, incorporation of oxygen in the polycrystalline GaN may result in impure polycrystalline GaN material that is less suited for use in other processes, such as ammonothermal growth processes. According to embodiments of the present methods and reactor designs, the impurity and oxide concentration in GaN polycrystals from the HVPG process may be reduced by utilizing oxide-free materials in the growth environment for deposition of polycrystalline GaN. Thus, according to the various methods described herein all interior surfaces in the reactor, such as the first heated region, the second heated region and the growth region, that are in direct contact with the gases may be formed of or coated with a non-oxide material. Alternatively, at least the surfaces of the growth region of the HVPG reactor may be formed of or coated with a material which lacks an oxide from which oxygen may be extracted by the GaN vapor or other gas under the GaN growth conditions and therefore the amount of oxygen incorporated into the growing polycrystalline GaN is greatly reduced or eliminated. According to certain embodiments, the non-oxide material may be, e.g., boron nitride or pyrolytic boron nitride. In specific embodiments, the non-oxide material may be pyrolytic boron nitride. The entire reactor need not be formed of a material that lacks an oxide. For instance, the growth region and optionally the first and\/or second heated regions may be formed of a material that lacks an oxide, and the remainder of the HVPG reactor may be formed of conventional materials that may be one or more oxides (such as quartz). Alternatively, surfaces in direct contact with the gases during the HVPG process, such as surfaces in the first heated region and the growth region, may be coated with the non-oxide material.","Embodiments of the present methods provide for the production of polycrystalline group III nitride having an oxygen content quite low, such as less than about 1\u00d710atoms\/cmor less than 9\u00d710atoms\/cm. In certain embodiments, the oxygen concentration in polycrystalline GaN may be about 8\u00d710atoms\/cmor lower, or in specific embodiments, at or beneath a detectable limit such as 3.0\u00d710atoms\/cm. According to one embodiment, the oxygen content of polycrystalline GaN may be less than 1\u00d710atoms\/cm. This polycrystalline GaN will have little or no single-crystal GaN associated with it. The polycrystalline GaN also may not incorporate any other of the growth region materials into it and may be about or at or below the limit of detection that exists today for one or more elements that make up the growth region material. For instance, polycrystalline GaN may be grown in a reactor formed from pyrolytic BN. The polycrystalline GaN may have about or at or less than a detectable limit of boron. A detection limit for B is 6.7\u00d710atoms\/cm, and the amount of boron in the polycrystalline GaN may be about this value, at this value, or below this value.","The methods and reactors of the present disclosure provide for the efficient production of polycrystalline group III nitride. According to certain embodiments, the methods described herein may produce the polycrystalline group III nitride, such as polycrystalline GaN, at growth rates of greater than 5 grams per hour (g\/hr). In addition, the methods and reactors described herein result in a production efficiency (conversion) where greater than 70% of the group III element source material is converted to polycrystalline group III nitride. For example, in specific embodiments greater than 70% of gallium source material may be converted into polycrystalline GaN and in certain embodiments greater than 80% of the gallium source material may be converted into polycrystalline GaN.","In further embodiments of the methods of the present disclosure, producing the crystalline group III nitride may comprise crystallizing the crystalline group III nitride on a back etched surface of a polycrystalline group III base material. As described herein, in specific embodiments, the polycrystalline group III nitride base material may be recycled polycrystalline group III nitride material from an ammonothermal process. In other embodiments, the polycrystalline group III nitride base material may be pyrolytic boron nitride (BN). In still further embodiments, the polycrystalline group III nitride base material may comprise pyrolytic boron nitride and recycled polycrystalline group III nitride (such as polycrystalline GaN) from an ammonothermal process.","In addition, previously formed polycrystalline GaN may be used as a template or nucleation material to grow polycrystalline GaN as discussed above. For instance, polycrystalline GaN source material formed using HVPG growth as disclosed herein may be heated and maintained at a temperature above 700\u00b0 C. and back-etched using a hydrogen-containing gas such as NHor HCl.","According to certain embodiments, polycrystalline GaN having low oxygen content may be formed by placing previously-formed polycrystalline GaN into the growth region and forming new polycrystalline GaN on the pre-existing polycrystalline GaN. This is especially the case if the pre-existing polycrystalline GaN is etched prior to depositing new polycrystalline GaN in the growth region. Without intending to be limited by any theory, it is theorized that etching may help remove oxygen that may have been incorporated into the previously-grown GaN. The pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may be etched using hydrogen gas or hydrogen containing gas or a combination of the two. In certain embodiments, the pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may be etched using an etching gas, such as, for example, HCl or NH. The pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may or may not have been formed by a method of this invention and may also include recycled polycrystalline GaN from an ammonothermal growth process.","According to specific embodiments, the pre-existing polycrystalline GaN may be polycrystalline GaN remaining from a single crystal GaN growth process, such as an ammonothermal growth process. Polycrystalline GaN may serve as a source material for an ammonothermal growth process. Typically, in certain ammonothermal growth processes, there may be remaining polycrystalline GaN after the growth process is halted. To increase the overall and economic efficiency of the process for producing single crystal GaN, the remaining polycrystalline GaN may be recycled in the various methods described herein. For example, the recycled or \u201cold\u201d polycrystalline GaN may be introduced into the HVPE process in the growth region to serve as a base material for new polycrystalline GaN growth.","In certain embodiments, the method of the present disclosure may further comprise submitting the polycrystalline group III nitride to an ammonothermal process to produce single-crystal group III nitride. Examples of ammonothermal methods of growing single-crystal GaN may be found in the references incorporated by reference above. Ammonothermal growth processes include solvothermal methods using high-pressure ammonia as a solvent for the growth of high purity and high quality single-crystal group III nitride ingots, suitable for use in various opto-electronic and electronic devices. In the ammonothermal reactor for GaN, a gallium source material, such as polycrystalline GaN is dissolved in supercritical ammonia a source dissolution region. The GaN then flows to a crystal growth region, for example through a series of baffles, and crystallizes to form single crystal GaN. In specific embodiments, due to the retrograde solubility of GaN in supercritical ammonia, the source dissolution region may be at a lower temperature than the crystal growth region.","Further embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for recycling polycrystalline GaN source material used in a previous ammonothermal growth process. According to these embodiments, the method comprises heating and maintaining the polycrystalline GaN source material at a temperature greater than 700\u00b0 C., back etching a surface of the polycrystalline GaN source material to provide a back etched polycrystalline GaN, and depositing additional polycrystalline GaN on the surface of the back etched polycrystalline GaN by a hydride vapor phase growth (HVPG) process, such as any of the HVPG processes described herein. The polycrystalline GaN source material from the previous ammonothermal growth process may be back etched according to the process described herein (i.e., contacting the surface with a hydrogen containing gas, such as HCl or NH). The polycrystalline GaN material that results from the recycling process has a low oxygen content and is suitable for use in a subsequent ammonothermal growth process to produce single crystal GaN ingots. For example, the resulting polycrystalline GaN may have oxygen contents such as those described for the HVPG processed herein, after the recycling process. As previously described, the low oxygen content may result from the back etching of the recycled polycrystalline source material to remove oxide material on the surface of the polycrystalline GaN source material.","Still other embodiments of the present disclosure describe HVPG reactors for growing polycrystalline group III nitride materials, such as, but not limited to, polycrystalline GaN. According to these embodiments, the reactor may comprise a first heated region comprising a first gas inlet configured to introduce a nitrogen containing gas (such as ammonia gas), a second heated region comprising a second gas inlet configured to introduce a halide containing gas, and a growth region in gaseous contact with the first heated region and the second heated region and configured to allow growth of polycrystalline group III nitride (such as GaN). According to these embodiments, the first heated region and the second heated region are configured to maintain separation of the gases in each region. That is, the first and second heated regions are configured so that the nitrogen containing gas and the halide containing gas have no substantial contact with each other until the gases enter the growth region. In specific embodiments, the first heated region, the second heated region and the crystal growth region are each configured to be heated at temperatures ranging from 700\u00b0 C. to 1200\u00b0 C. for the first and second heated region and 700\u00b0 C. to 1300\u00b0 C. growth region.","Various embodiments of the reactors may be designed so that the growth region, and in certain embodiments both the first heated region and the second heated region, have a surface configured to contact the gases, where the surface is formed from a material other than an oxide (i.e., a non-oxide material). For example, in specific embodiments the reactor surfaces that may contact the gases (i.e., the surfaces of the growth region, the first heated region and\/or the second heated region) may be formed from or coated with boron nitride or pyrolytic boron nitride. Surfaces formed from other non-oxide materials are also envisioned. As described herein, use of such non-oxide materials in the reactor design may result in reduced impurity incorporation, such as oxygen incorporation, in the resulting polycrystalline group III nitride.","In one specific embodiment, the second heated region may comprise a second gas inlet configured to introduce GaCl(where z is as described herein) as the halide-containing gas. In other embodiments, the second heated region may comprise a second gas inlet configured to introduce a hydrogen halide, such as HCl) as the halide-containing gas may be further configured to contain a gallium source material in contact with the hydrogen halide gas. For example, the second region may be configured to contain a tray made of a non-oxide material that contains a gallium source material and the second gas inlet configured to contact the hydrogen halide gas with the gallium source material in the tray.","In other embodiments of the reactor design, the growth region may be configured to allow back etching of a pre-existing polycrystalline group III nitride material, such as BN and\/or GaN. Thus, in certain embodiments, the growth region may be configured to contain a tray made of a non-oxide material containing a pre-existing or recycled polycrystalline group III nitride material. In such embodiments, the growth region may be configured to allow introduction of a hydrogen containing back etching gas (as describe herein, such as HCl or NH) and allow contact and back etching of a surface of the re-existing or recycled polycrystalline group III nitride material.","One exemplary embodiment of an HVPG reactor according to the present disclosure is presented in . Tube reactor  includes a heating mechanism  surrounded by an insulating material . The first heated region  includes first gas inlet . The second heated region  is formed from D-tube  inserted into the tube reactor and includes the second gas inlet  and a non-oxide tray  for containing the group III source material. D-tube  prevents gaseous contact between the gas in the first heated region  and the gas in the second heated region . The gases may then travel to growth region  having a liner  made from pyrolytic boron nitride (PBN). One skilled in the art will recognize that variations of the reactor design presented in  are possible and are within the scope and intent of the reactors as described herein. One exemplary embodiment of the growth region of a reactor is illustrated in . Pyrolytic boron nitride liners  provide a deposition surface for GaN growth. Tray  contains recycled polycrystalline GaN material  and newly deposited GaN growth .","Still other embodiments of the present disclosure include a polycrystalline group III nitride formed by a HVPG process such as described herein. One specific embodiment provides a polycrystalline GaN formed by any of the HVPG methods described herein. The polycrystalline GaN may be suitable for use in an ammonothermal growth process to form single crystal GaN ingots of high purity and high quality and suitable for use in various opto-electronic and electronic applications.","Further embodiments describe methods of forming single-crystal GaN. The methods may comprise forming polycrystalline GaN by a hydride vapor phase growth process such as any of the methods disclosed herein; utilizing the polycrystalline GaN as a nutrient or gallium source material in an ammonothermal growth process to grow single-crystal GaN; and forming single crystal GaN by the ammonothermal growth process. Examples of ammonothermal methods of growing single-crystal GaN may be found in the references incorporated by reference above, and thus any method of forming single-crystal GaN as disclosed in those references may utilize polycrystalline GaN grown by any method disclosed herein. Also disclosed is single-crystal GaN made by this method.","In another embodiment the method of forming single crystal GaN may further comprise the step of recycling polycrystalline GaN source material remaining after completion of the ammonothermal growth process in a subsequent hydride vapor phase growth process. As recited herein, by recycling unused or remaining polycrystalline GaN source material that is not consumed during the ammonothermal growth process, the overall economic efficiency of the ammonothermal process for producing group III nitrides may be improved.","The methods and reactors disclosed herein may be used to form polycrystalline AlGaN, InGaN, and AlInGaN (0<x<1, 0<y<1). Further, the polycrystalline material formed by methods disclosed herein may be used to make single-crystal AlGaN, InGaN, and AlInGaN by any of the methods of forming these single-crystal materials, including those methods incorporated by reference herein.","In the following Examples of various exemplary embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The following text describes non-limiting examples of the current invention.","In this example, a tube furnace with an inner diameter of 2\u2033 was used for the HVPG growth.  is a schematic drawing of the HVPG reactor. 110.0 g of Ga source material was loaded into a pyrolytic BN tray or boat (, feature ) which in turn was loaded into a D-tube (, feature ) which allowed gas streams to be separated in the growth reactor. Several pyrolytic BN parts or liners (, feature ) were loaded in the growth region (, feature ) of the reactor to act as the deposition surface. The reactor was then sealed and connected to a gas\/vacuum system, which could pump down the vessel as well as can supply NH, HCl, and N\/Hto the reactor. The reactor was evacuated and refilled 3 times to remove any oxygen. The reactor was heated to 1100\u00b0 C. as measured by thermocouples at the growth region while it was purged with a N\/Hmixture. Once the growth temperature was reached, NHand HCl gas flows were added to the reactor (, features  and , respectively). The HCl gas flowed through the lower nozzle  and into in the D-tube  where the gas could react with Ga in the Ga tray or boat  to form GaCl which was then transported to the growth environment or region , and NHgas flowed through the upper gas nozzle  such that the GaCl and NHgases contacted one another in growth region . After 7 hours the growth was stopped and the reactor opened upon cooling. Polycrystalline GaN growth and Ga metal consumption were measured as 108.2 g and 107.3 g, respectively. The molar weight of Ga and GaN is 69.72 g\/mol and 83.73 g\/mol, respectively. If all consumed Ga is turned into GaN, the theoretical GaN weight is estimated to be 128.9 g. Therefore, Ga to GaN conversion efficiency was approximately 84% in this example.","Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy confirmed the bulk concentrations of impurities as listed in Table 1.
