See Ouellette. J., 2003, August\/September, 14-17; Scherer, A., et al., 2000, 290, 1536-1539. Photolithography and etching techniques, however, are costly and labor intensive, require clean-room conditions, and pose several disadvantages from a materials standpoint. For these reasons, soft materials have emerged as alternative materials for microfluidic device fabrication. The use of soft materials has made possible the manufacture and actuation of devices containing valves, pumps, and mixers. See, e.g., Ouellette. J., 2003, August\/September, 14-17; Scherer, A., et al., 2000, 290, 1536-1539; Unger, M. A., et al., 2000, 288, 113-116; McDonald, J. C., et al., 2002, 35, 491-499; and Thorsen, T., et al., 2002, 298, 580-584. For example, one such microfluidic device allows for control over flow direction without the use of mechanical valves. See Zhao. B., et al., 2001, 291, 1023-1026.","The increasing complexity of microfluidic devices has created a demand to use such devices in a rapidly growing number of applications. To this end, the use of soft materials has allowed microfluidics to develop into a useful technology that has found application in genome mapping, rapid separations, sensors, nanoscale reactions, ink-jet printing, drug delivery, Lab-on-a-Chip, in vitro diagnostics, injection nozzles, biological studies, and drug screening. See, e.g., Ouellette. J., 2003, August\/September, 14-17; Scherer, A., et al., 2000, 290, 1536-1539; Unger, M. A., et al., 2000, 288, 113-116; McDonald. J. C., et al., 2002, 35, 491-499; Thorsen, T., et al., 2002, 298, 580-584; and Liu, J., et al., 2003, 75, 4718-4723.","Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is the soft material of choice for many microfluidic device applications. See Scherer, A., et al., 2000, 290, 1536-1539; Unger, M. A., et al., 2000, 288, 113-116; McDonald, J. C., et al., 2002, 35, 491-499; Thorsen, T., et al., 2002, 298, 580-584; and Liu, J., et al., 2003, 75, 4718-4723. A PDMS material offers numerous attractive properties in microfluidic applications. Upon cross-linking, PDMS becomes an elastomeric material with a low Young's modulus, e.g., approximately 750 kPa. See Unger, M. A., et al., 2000, 288, 113-116. This property allows PDMS to conform to surfaces and to form reversible seals. Further, PDMS has a low surface energy, e.g., approximately 20 erg\/cm, which can facilitate its release from molds after patterning. See Scherer, A., et al., 2000, 290, 1536-1539; McDonald. J. C., et al., 2002, 35, 491-499.","Another important feature of PDMS is its outstanding gas permeability. This property allows gas bubbles within the channels of a microfluidic device to permeate out of the device. This property also is useful in sustaining cells and microorganisms inside the features of the microfluidic device. The nontoxic nature of silicones, such as PDMS, also is beneficial in this respect and allows for opportunities in the realm of medical implants. McDonald. J. C., et al., 2002, 35, 491-499.","Many current PDMS microfluidic devices are based on Sylgard\u00ae 184 (Dow Corning, Midland, Mich., United States of America). Sylgard\u00ae 184 is cured thermally through a platinum-catalyzed hydrosilation reaction. Complete curing of Sylgard\u00ae 184 can take as long as five hours. The synthesis of a photocurable PDMS material, however, with mechanical properties similar to that of Sylgard\u00ae 184 for use in soft lithography recently has been reported. See Choi, K. M., et al., 2003, 125, 4060-4061.","Despite the aforementioned advantages, PDMS suffers from a drawback in microfluidic applications in that it swells in most organic solvents. Thus, PDMS-based microfluidic devices have a limited compatibility with various organic solvents. See Lee. J. N., et al., 2003, 75, 6544-6554. Among those organic solvents that swell PDMS are hexanes, ethyl ether, toluene, dichloromethane, acetone, and acetonitrile. See Lee. J. N., et al., 2003, 75, 6544-6554. The swelling of a PDMS microfluidic device by organic solvents can disrupt its micron-scale features, e.g., a channel or plurality of channels, and can restrict or completely shut off the flow of organic solvents through the channels. Thus, microfluidic applications with a PDMS-based device are limited to the use of fluids, such as water, that do not swell PDMS. As a result, those applications that require the use of organic solvents likely will need to use microfluidic systems fabricated from hard materials, such as glass and silicon. See Lee, J. N., et al., 2003, 75, 6544-6554. This approach, however, is limited by the disadvantages of fabricating microfluidic devices from hard materials.","Moreover, PDMS-based devices and materials are notorious for not being adequately inert enough to allow them to be used even in aqueous-based chemistries. For example, PDMS is susceptible to reaction with weak and strong acids and bases. PDMS-based devices also are notorious for containing extractables, in particular extractable oligomers and cyclic siloxanes, especially after exposure to acids and bases. Because PDMS is easily swollen by organics, hydrophobic materials, even those hydrophobic. materials that are slightly soluble in water, can partition into PDMS-based materials used to construct PDMS-based microfluidic devices.","Thus, an elastomeric material that exhibits the attractive mechanical properties of PDMS combined with a resistance to swelling in common organic solvents would extend the use of microfluidic devices to a variety of new chemical applications that are inaccessible by current PDMS-based devices. Accordingly, the, approach demonstrated by the presently disclosed subject matter uses an elastomeric material, more particularly a photocurable perfluoropolyether (PFPE) material, which is resistant to swelling in common organic solvents to fabricate a microfluidic device.","Photocurable PFPE materials represent a unique class of fluoropolymers that are liquids at room temperature, exhibit low surface energy, low modulus, high gas permeability, and low toxicity with the added feature of being extremely chemically resistant. See Scheirs. J., ; John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.: New York, 1997; pp 435-485. Further, PFPE materials exhibit hydrophobic and lyophobic properties. For this reason, PFPE materials are often used as lubricants on high-performance machinery operating in harsh conditions. The synthesis and solubility of PFPE materials in supercritical carbon dioxide has been reported. See Bunyard. W. et al., 1999, 32, 8224-8226.","The presently disclosed subject matter describes the use of a photocurable perfluoropolyether as a material for fabricating a solvent-resistant microfluidic device. The use of a photocurable perfluoropolyether as a material for fabricating a microfluidic device addresses the problems associated with swelling in organic solvents exhibited by microfluidic devices made from other polymeric materials, such as PDMS. Accordingly, PFPE-based microfluidic devices can be used to control the flow of a small volume of a fluid, such as an organic solvent, and to perform microscale chemical reactions that are not amenable to other polymeric microfluidic devices.","The presently disclosed subject matter describes the use of a photocurable PFPE material for fabricating a solvent-resistant microfluidic device. More particularly, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of forming a patterned layer of a photocured PFPE material. In some embodiments, the method comprises coating a substrate, such as an etched silicon wafer, with a perfluoropolyether precursor and photocuring the perfluoropolyether precursor to form a patterned layer of a photocured perfluoropolyether.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of forming a multilayer patterned photocured perfluoropolyether material. In some embodiments, the method comprises overlaying a first patterned layer of the photocured perfluoropolyether on a second patterned layer of the photocured perfluoropolyether, wherein the patterns of the first and second layers of the photocured perfluoropolyether are aligned in a predetermined alignment, and then exposing the first and the second layers of the photocured perfluoropolyether to ultraviolet radiation for a period of time. This curing step causes the two layers to adhere to another, thereby creating a seal between the two patterned layers of the photocured perfluoropolyether.","In some embodiments, the multilayer patterned perfluoropolyether structure comprises a plurality of microscale channels, which can further comprise an integrated network of microscale channels. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of flowing a material through an integrated network of microscale channels. In some embodiments, the method of flowing a material comprises actuating a valve structure within the microscale channels. In some embodiments, the method of flowing a material comprises a side-actuated valve structure. In some embodiments, the method of flowing a material comprises flow channels of different shapes and dimensions. In some embodiments, the method of flowing a material comprises actuating multiple valve structures simultaneously to control the flow through a multiplexed network of microscale channels.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of performing a chemical reaction in a microfluidic device, wherein the method comprises contacting a first reagent and a second reagent in the microfluidic device to form a reaction product. In some embodiments, the first reagent and the second reagent are independently selected from one of a nucleotide and a polynucleotide, wherein the reaction product comprises a polynucleotide. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is DNA. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of incorporating a microfluidic device into an integrated reaction or flow system.","Further, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of screening a sample for a characteristic. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of dispensing a material. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of separating a material.","Certain objects of the presently disclosed subject matter having been stated hereinabove, which are addressed in whole or in part by the presently disclosed subject matter, other aspects and objects will become evident as the description proceeds when taken in connection with the accompanying Drawings and Examples as best described herein below.","The presently disclosed subject matter will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Drawings and Examples, in which representative embodiments are shown.

In some examples, the channels include at least one cross-sectional dimension that is in a range of from about 0.1 \u03bcm to about 500 \u03bcm. The use of dimensions on this order allows the incorporation of a greater number of channels in a smaller area, and utilizes smaller volumes of fluids.","A microfluidic device can exist alone or can be a part of a microfluidic system which, for example and without limitation, can include: pumps for introducing fluids, e.g., samples, reagents, buffers and the like, into the system and\/or through the system; detection equipment or systems; data storage systems; and control systems for controlling fluid transport and\/or direction within the device, monitoring and controlling environmental. conditions to which fluids in the device are subjected, e.g., temperature, current, and the like.","As used herein, the terms \u201cchannel,\u201d \u201cmicroscale channel,\u201d and \u201cmicrofluidic channel\u201d are used interchangeably and can mean a recess or cavity formed in a material by imparting a pattern from a patterned substrate into a material or by any suitable material removing technique, or can mean a recess or cavity in combination with any suitable fluid-conducting structure mounted in the recess or cavity, such as a tube, capillary, or the like.","As used herein, the terms \u201cflow channel\u201d and \u201ccontrol channel\u201d are used interchangeably and can mean a channel in a microfluidic device in which a material, such as a fluid, e.g., a gas or a liquid, can flow through.

Method of Forming a Patterned Layer of a Photocurable Perfluoropolyether Material","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of forming a patterned layer of a photocurable PFPE material. Referring now to , a schematic representation of an embodiment of the presently disclosed subject matter is shown. A substrate S having a patterned surface PS comprising a raised protrusion P is depicted.

Commercial PFPE materials are made by polymerization of perfluorinated monomers. The first member of this class was made by the cesium fluoride catalyzed polymerization of hexafluoropropene oxide (HFPO) yielding a series of branched polymers designated as Krytox\u00ae (DuPont, Wilmington, Del., United States of America). A similar polymer is produced by the UV catalyzed photo-oxidation of hexafluoropropene (Fomblin\u00ae Y) (Solvay Solexis, Brussels, Belgium). Further, a linear polymer (Fomblin\u00ae Z) (Solvay) is prepared by a similar process, but utilizing tetrafluoroethylene. Finally, a fourth polymer (Demnum\u00ae) (Daikin Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) is produced by polymerization of tetrafluorooxetane followed by direct fluorination. Structures for these fluids are presented in Table I. Table II contains property data for some members of the PFPE class of lubricants. In addition to these commercially available PFPE fluids, a new series of structures are being prepared by direct fluorination technology. Representative structures of these new PFPE materials appear in Table Ill. Of the abovementioned PFPE fluids, only Krytox\u00ae and Fomblin\u00ae Z have been extensively used in applications. See Jones, W. R. Jr., The Properties of Perfluoropolyethers Used for Space Applications, NASA Technical Memorandum 106275 (July 1993), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Patterned layers PL and PL are provided, each of which comprise a perfluoropolyether material. In this example, each of the patterned layers PL and PL comprise channels CH. In this embodiment of the presently disclosed subject matter, channels CH are microscale channels. In patterned layer PL, the channels are represented by a dashed line, i.e., in shadow, in .

Accordingly, in some embodiments, the first patterned layer of the photocured PFPE material is about 50 \u03bcm to several centimeters thick. In some embodiments, the first patterned layer of the photocured PFPE material is between 50 \u03bcm and about 10 millimeters thick.

In some embodiments, the method of directing the flow of a material through a PFPE-based microfluidic device comprises actuating a valve structure or a plurality of valve structures within the microfluidic device. In some embodiments, the valve structure comprises a portion of the microfluidic channel itself. In some embodiments, the valve structure further comprises a side-actuated valve.","III.A. Method of Actuating a Valve Structure Within a PFPE-Based Microfluidic Device","In some embodiments, the method of actuating a valve structure within a PFPE-based microfluidic device comprises closing a first flow channel by applying pressure to an abutting second flow channel (or \u201ccontrol channel\u201d), thereby deflecting a thin membrane of PFPE material separating the two channels into the first flow channel.  together show the closing of a first flow channel by pressurizing a second flow channel. Referring now to , a front sectional view of a monolithic PFPE-based microfluidic device  comprising a multilayer patterned PFPE material  adhered to planar nonpatterned PFPE layer  is shown. A first flow channel  and a second flow channel  are separated by membrane , which forms the top of first flow channel  and the bottom of second flow channel . As depicted in , flow channel  is open.","Referring now to , pressurization of flow channel  (either by a gas or a fluid introduced therein) causes membrane  to deflect downward, thereby restricting flow F, as shown in , passing through flow channel . Accordingly, by varying the pressure in channel , an actuable valving system is provided such that flow channel  can be substantially opened or substantially closed or in an intermediate open or closed position by deflecting membrane  as desired. For illustration purposes only, channel  in  is shown in a \u201csubstantially closed\u201d position, rather than a \u201cfully closed\u201d position.","In some embodiments, the membrane  of PFPE material separating overlapping channels  and  has a thickness between about 0.01 \u03bcm and 1000 \u03bcm, about 0.05 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm, 0.2 \u03bcm to 250 \u03bcm, 1 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm, 2 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm, and 5 \u03bcm to 40 \u03bcm. Exemplary membrane thicknesses include, but are not limited to, 0.01 \u03bcm, 0.02 \u03bcm, 0.03 \u03bcm, 0.05 \u03bcm, 0.1 \u03bcm, 0.2 \u03bcm, 0.3 \u03bcm, 0.5 \u03bcm, 1 \u03bcm, 2 \u03bcm, 3 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm, 7.5 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm, 12.5 \u03bcm, 15 \u03bcm, 17.5 \u03bcm, 20 \u03bcm, 22.5 \u03bcm, 25 \u03bcm, 30 \u03bcm, 40 \u03bcm, 50 \u03bcm, 75 \u03bcm, 100 \u03bcm, 150 \u03bcm, 200 \u03bcm, 250 \u03bcm, 300 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, 500 \u03bcm, 750 \u03bcm, and 1000 \u03bcm.","Because such valves are actuated by moving a portion of the channels themselves (i.e., deflecting membrane ) and do not require additional components, valves and pumps produced by this technique have a zero dead volume, and switching valves made by this technique have a dead volume approximately equal to the active volume of the valve, for example about 100 \u03bcm\u00d7100 \u03bcm\u00d710 \u03bcm=100 pL. Such dead volumes and areas consumed by the moving membrane are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than known conventional microvalves. Smaller and larger valves are provided in the presently disclosed subject matter, including, but not limited to, valves comprising a dead volume ranging from 1 aL to 1 \u03bcL; 100 aL to 100 nL; 1 fL to 1 nL; 100 fL to 1 nL; and 1 pL to 100 pL.","The small volume of materials, such as a fluid, capable of being delivered by pumps and valves in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter represent a substantial advantage over pumps and valves known in the art. For example, the smallest known volume of a fluid capable of being manually metered is about 0.1 \u03bcL. Further, the smallest known volume of a fluid capable of being metered by automated systems is about 1 \u03bcL. Using pumps and valves in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, a volume of a fluid comprising 10 nL or smaller can be metered and dispensed. The accurate metering of extremely small volumes of fluid enabled by the presently disclosed subject matter can be extremely valuable in a large number of biological applications, including microscale synthesis of biological materials, such as DNA, and diagnostic tests and assays.","As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,408,878 to Unger et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, the deflection of an elastomeric membrane in response to a pressure is a function of: the length, width, and thickness of the membrane, the flexibility of the membrane, e.g., as provided by its Young's modulus, and the applied actuation force. Because each of these parameters will vary depending on the dimensions and physical composition of a particular elastomeric device, e.g., a PFPE device in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, a wide range of membrane thicknesses, channel widths, and actuation forces are provided.","Pressure can be applied to actuate the membrane of the device by passing a fluid or a gas, such as air, through, for example, a first piece of tubing connected to a second, narrower piece of tubing, such as a hypodermic tubing, e.g., a metal hypodermic needle, wherein the metal hypodermic needle is placed into contact with the flow channel by insertion into the PFPE block in a direction normal to the flow channel.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the method of actuating a PFPE-based microfluidic device further comprises forming a plurality of holes in at least one patterned layer of the photocured perfluoropolyether material. In some embodiments, as shown in , at least one of the plurality of holes comprises an inlet aperture IA. In some embodiments, as also shown in , at least one of the plurality of holes comprises an outlet aperture OA.","Further, such an embodiment addresses a number of problems posed by connecting a conventional microfluidic device to an external fluid source. One such problem is the fragility of the connection between the microfluidic device and the external fluid source. Conventional microfluidic devices comprise hard, inflexible materials, such as silicon, to which tubing providing a connection to an external element must be joined. The rigidity of conventional materials creates a physical stress at the points of contact with the external tubing, rendering conventional microfluidic devices prone to fracture and leakage at these contact points.","By contrast, the PFPE material of the presently described subject matter is flexible and can be penetrated for external connection by a rigid tube, such as a metal hypodermic needle, comprising a hard material. For example, in a PFPE structure fabricated using the method shown in , a hole extending from the exterior surface of the structure into the flow channel, as shown in , can be made by penetrating the external surface of the patterned layer of PFPE material with the metal hypodermic needle after the upper layer of PFPE material has been removed from the mold (as shown in ) and before this layer has been bonded to the second patterned layer of PFPE material (as shown in ).","Between these steps, a portion of the flow channel is exposed to the user's view and is accessible to insertion of the hypodermic needle and proper positioning of the hole. Following completion of fabrication of the device, the metal hypodermic needle is inserted into the hole to complete the fluid connection to the external fluid source. Moreover, the PFPE material of the presently disclosed subject matter will flex in response to physical strain at the point of contact with an external connection, rendering the external physical connection more robust. This flexibility substantially reduces the chance of leakage or fracture of the presently described microfluidic device.","Another disadvantage of conventional microfluidic devices is the difficulty in establishing an effective seal between the device and its connections to an external fluid flow. Because of the narrow diameter of the channels that is typical of these microfluidic devices, achieving even moderate rates of fluid flow can require input high pressures. Accordingly, unwanted leakage at the point of contact between the device and an external connection can result. The flexibility of the PFPE material from which the presently described microfluidic device is fabricated aids in preventing leakage related to high input pressures. More particularly, the flexible PFPE material conforms to the shape of inserted tubing to form a substantially pressure resistant seal.","While control of the flow of material through the device has so far been described using an applied gas pressure, other fluids can be used. A gas is compressible, and thus experiences some finite delay between the time of application of pressure by, for example, an external solenoid valve and the time that this pressure is experienced by the membrane separating the flow channels of the microfluidic device. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, pressure is applied from an external source to a noncompressible fluid, such as water or a hydraulic oil, resulting in a near-instantaneous transfer of applied pressure to the membrane. If the displaced volume of the membrane is large or the flow channel is narrow, higher viscosity of the control fluid can contribute to delay in actuation. Therefore, the optimal medium for transferring pressure will depend on the particular application and device configuration. Accordingly, the use of both gaseous and liquid media to actuate the deflectable membrane is provided by the presently disclosed subject matter.","In some embodiments, the external pressure is applied by a pump and tank system through a pressure regulator and external valve. As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, other methods of applying external pressure are provided by the presently disclosed subject matter, including gas tanks, compressors, piston systems, and columns of liquid. Also provided for use in the presently disclosed subject matter are naturally occurring pressure sources, such as those found inside living organisms, including blood pressure, gastric pressure, the pressure present in the cerebro-spinal fluid, pressure present in the intra-ocular space, and the pressure exerted by muscles during normal flexure. Other methods of regulating external pressure also are provided by the presently disclosed subject matter, including miniature valves, pumps, macroscopic peristaltic pumps, pinch valves, and other types of fluid regulating equipment such as is known in the art.","In some embodiments, the response of the microfluidic valves in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter is nearly linear over a substantial portion of its range of travel, with minimal hysteresis. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,408,878 to Unger et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, the valves in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter are ideally suited for microfluidic metering and fluid control.","While the valves and pumps of the presently disclosed subject matter do not require linear actuation to open and close, a linear response facilitates the use of the valves as metering devices. In some embodiments, the opening of the valve is used to control a flow rate by being partially actuated to a known degree of closure. Linear valve actuation also facilitates the determination of the amount of actuation force required to close the valve to a desired degree of closure. Another benefit of linear actuation is that the force required for valve actuation can be determined from the pressure in the flow channel. Accordingly, if actuation is linear, an increased pressure in the flow channel can be countered by adding the same pressure (force per unit area) to the actuated portion of the valve. Thus, high pressures in the flow channel (i.e., back pressure) can be countered by increasing the actuation pressure.","Linearity of the response of a valve depends on the structure, composition, and method of actuation of the valve structure. Further, whether linearity is a desirable characteristic in a valve depends on the application. Therefore, both linearly and non-linearly actuatable valves are provided in the presently disclosed subject matter, and the pressure ranges over which a valve is linearly actuatable will vary with the specific embodiment.","In addition to the pressure-based actuation systems described hereinabove, electrostatic and magnetic actuation systems also are provided by the presently disclosed subject matter. For example, electrostatic actuation can be accomplished by forming oppositely charged electrodes (which will tend to attract one another when a voltage differential is applied to them) directly into the monolithic PFPE structure. Referring again to , a first electrode A (shown in phantom) can be positioned on (or in) membrane  and a second electrode B (also shown in phantom) can be positioned on (or in) planar nonpatterned PFPE layer . When electrodes A and B are charged with opposite polarities, an attractive force between the two electrodes will cause membrane  to deflect downwardly, thereby closing flow channel .","For the membrane electrode to be sufficiently conductive to support electrostatic actuation, but not so mechanically stiff so as to impede the membrane's motion, a sufficiently flexible electrode must be provided in or over membrane . Such a sufficiently flexible electrode can be provided by depositing a thin metallization layer on membrane , doping the polymer with conductive material, or making the surface layer out of a conductive material.","In some embodiments, the electrode present at the deflecting membrane is provided by a thin metallization layer, which can be provided, for example, by sputtering a thin layer of metal, such as 20 nm of gold. In addition to the formation of a metallized membrane by sputtering, other metallization approaches, such as chemical epitaxy, evaporation, electroplating, and electroless plating, also are available. Physical transfer of a metal layer to the surface of the elastomer also is available, for example by evaporating a metal onto a flat substrate to which it adheres poorly, and then placing the elastomer onto the metal and peeling the metal off of the substrate.","The conductive electrode A also can be formed by depositing carbon black (e.g., Vulcan\u00ae XC72R Cabot Corporation, Boston, Mass., United States of America) on the elastomer surface. Alternatively, the electrode A can be formed by constructing the entire structure  out of elastomer doped with conductive material (i.e., carbon black or finely divided metal particles). The electrode also can be formed by electrostatic deposition, or by a chemical reaction that produces carbon.","The lower electrode B, which is not required to move, can be either a compliant electrode as described above, or a conventional electrode, such as evaporated gold, a metal plate, or a doped semiconductor electrode.","In some embodiments, magnetic actuation of the flow channels can be achieved by fabricating the membrane separating the flow channels with a magnetically polarizable material, such as iron, or a permanently magnetized material, such as polarized NdFeB.","In embodiments wherein the membrane is fabricated with a magnetically polarizable material, the membrane can be actuated by attraction in response to an applied magnetic field. In embodiments wherein the membrane is fabricated with a material capable of maintaining permanent magnetization, the material can first be magnetized by exposure to a sufficiently high magnetic field, and then actuated either by attraction or repulsion in response to the polarity of an applied inhomogeneous magnetic field.","The magnetic field causing actuation of the membrane can be generated in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, the magnetic field is generated by a small inductive coil formed in or proximate to the elastomer membrane. The actuation effect of such a magnetic coil is localized, thereby allowing actuation of an individual pump and\/or valve structure. In some embodiments, the magnetic field is generated by a larger, more powerful source, in which case actuation is not localized and can actuate multiple pump and\/or valve structures simultaneously.","It is further possible to combine pressure actuation with electrostatic or magnetic actuation. More particularly, a bellows structure in fluid communication with a recess and\/or channel could be electrostatically or magnetically actuated to change the pressure in the recess and\/or channel and thereby actuate a membrane structure adjacent to the recess and\/or channel.","In addition to electrical or magnetic actuation as described above, electrolytic and electrokinetic actuation systems also are provided by the presently disclosed subject matter. For example, in some embodiments, actuation pressure on the membrane arises from an electrolytic reaction in a recess and\/or channel overlying the membrane. In such an embodiment, electrodes present in the recess and\/or channel apply a voltage across an electrolyte in the recess and\/or channel. This potential difference causes electrochemical reaction at the electrodes and results in the generation of gas species, giving rise to a pressure differential in the recess and\/or channel.","In some embodiments, actuation pressure on the membrane arises from an electrokinetic fluid flow in the control channel. In such an embodiment, electrodes present at opposite ends of the control channel apply a potential difference across an electrolyte present in the control channel. Migration of charged species in the electrolyte to the respective electrodes gives rise to a pressure differential.","In some embodiments, it is possible to actuate the device by causing a fluid flow in the control channel based upon the application of thermal energy, either by thermal expansion or by production of a gas from a liquid. Similarly, chemical reactions generating gaseous products can produce an increase in pressure sufficient for membrane actuation.","III.B. Method of Actuating a Valve Structure Within a PFPE-Based Microfluidic Device Comprising Flow Channels of Different Cross Sectional Sizes and Shapes","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes flow channels comprising different cross sectional sizes and shapes, offering different advantages depending on their desired application, in particular, advantages with regard to sealing a flow channel. For example, the cross sectional shape of the lower flow channel can have a curved upper surface, either along its entire length or in the region disposed under an upper cross channel.","Referring now to , a cross sectional view similar to that of  of flow channels  and  is shown. In this embodiment, flow channel  is rectangular in cross sectional shape. In some embodiments, as shown in , the cross-section of flow channel  has a curved upper surface as depicted by A.","Referring again to , when flow channel  is pressurized, the membrane portion  separating flow channels  and  will move downwardly to the successive positions shown by the dotted lines A, B, C, D, and E. In some cases, incomplete sealing can occur at the edges of rectangular flow channel  and adjacent planar nonpatterned PFPE layer .","Referring again to , flow channel A has a curved upper surface A. When flow channel  is pressurized, membrane portion  will move downwardly to the successive positions shown by dotted lines A, A, A and A, with edge portions of the membrane moving first into the flow channel, followed by top membrane portions. An advantage of having such a curved upper surface at membrane  is that a more complete seal will be provided when flow channel  is pressurized. More particularly, the upper surface of flow channel A will provide a continuous contacting edge against nonpatterned PFPE layer , thereby avoiding the incomplete contact seen between membrane  and the bottom of flow channel  in .","Another advantage of having a curved upper flow channel surface at membrane  is that the membrane can more readily conform to the shape and volume of the flow channel in response to actuation. More particularly, when a rectangular flow channel is employed, the entire perimeter (2\u00d7flow channel height, plus the flow channel width) must be forced into the flow channel. When a curved flow channel is used, a smaller perimeter of material (only the semi-circular arched portion) must be forced into the channel. In this manner, the membrane requires less change in perimeter for actuation and is therefore more responsive to an applied actuation force to close the flow channel.","In some embodiments, (not illustrated), the bottom of flow channel  is rounded such that its curved surface mates with the curved upper surface A as seen in  described above.","In summary, the actual conformational change experienced by the membrane upon actuation will depend on the configuration of the particular PFPE structure. More particularly, the conformational change will depend on the length, width, and thickness profile of the membrane, its attachment to the remainder of the structure, and the height, width, and shape of the flow and control channels and the material properties of the PFPE material used. The conformational change also can depend on the method of actuation, as actuation of the membrane in response to an applied pressure will vary somewhat from actuation in response to a magnetic or electrostatic force.","Moreover, the desired conformational change in the membrane will also vary depending on the particular application for the PFPE structure. In the embodiments described above, the valve can either be open or closed, with metering to control the degree of closure of the valve.","Many membrane thickness profiles and flow channel cross-sections are provided by the presently disclosed subject matter, including rectangular, trapezoidal, circular, ellipsoidal, parabolic, hyperbolic, and polygonal, as well as sections of the aforementioned shapes. More complex cross-sectional shapes, such as the embodiment with protrusions discussed immediately above or an embodiment comprising concavities in the flow channel, also are provided by the presently disclosed subject matter.","III.C. Method of Actuating a Side-Actuated Valve Structure","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter comprises a side-actuated valve structure. Referring now to ,  shows a side-actuated valve structure  in an unactuated position. Flow channel  is formed in PFPE layer . Control channel  abutting flow channel  also is formed in PFPE layer . In some embodiments, control channel  comprises a \u201chole\u201d formed by, for example, puncturing the PFPE layer with a hypodermic needle as described hereinabove. Control channel  is separated from flow channel  by PFPE membrane portion . A second PFPE layer (not shown) is bonded over bottom PFPE layer , for example by photocuring, to enclose flow channel  and control channel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["500","512","504","510","510","512","504","512","510"]},"While a side-actuated valve structure actuated in response to pressure is shown in , a side-actuated valve in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter is not limited to this configuration. In some embodiments, the PFPE membrane portion located between the abutting flow and control channels is manipulated by electric or magnetic fields, as described hereinabove.","III.D. Method of Actuating an Integrated Network of Microscale Channels Comprising a PFPE-Based Microfluidic Device","In some embodiments, the predetermined alignment of the first and second layers of the photocured perfluoropolyether material forms a plurality of microscale channels. In some embodiments, the plurality of microscale channels comprises an integrated network of microscale channels. In some embodiments, the microscale channels of the integrated network intersect at predetermined intersecting points.","Referring now to , a schematic view of a plurality of flow channels which are controllable by a single control channel is shown. This system is comprised of a plurality of single addressable on\/off valves multiplexed together. More particularly, a plurality of parallel flow channels A, B, and C are provided. Flow channel  (i.e., a \u201ccontrol line\u201d) passes over flow channels A, B, and C. Pressurization of control line  simultaneously shuts off flows F, F, and F by depressing membranes A, B, and C located at the intersections of control line  and flow channels A, B, and C.","Referring now to , a schematic illustration of a multiplexing system adapted to permit fluid flow through selected channels, comprised of a plurality of the single on\/off valves, joined or networked together is shown. A plurality of parallel flow channels A, B, C, D, E, and F are positioned under a plurality of parallel control lines A, B, C, and D. Control channels A, B, C, and D are actuated to shut off fluid flows F, F, F, F, F, and F passing through parallel flow channels A, B, C, D, E, and F using any of the valving systems described above, with the following modification.","The downward deflection of membranes separating the respective flow channels from a control line passing thereabove (for example, membranes A, B, and C in ) depends on the membrane dimensions. Accordingly, by varying the widths of flow channel control line  in , it is possible to have a control line pass over multiple flow channels, yet only actuate (i.e., close) desired flow channels. Each of control lines A, B, C, and D have both wide and narrow portions. For example, control line A is wide in locations disposed over flow channels A, C, and E. Similarly, control line B is wide in locations disposed over flow channels B, D and F, and control line C is wide in locations disposed over flow channels A, B, E, and F.","At the locations where the respective control line is wide, its pressurization causes the membrane  separating the flow channel and the control line (as shown in ) to depress significantly into the flow channel, thereby blocking the flow passage therethrough. Conversely, in the locations where the respective control line is narrow, membrane  also is narrow. Accordingly, the same degree of pressurization will not result in membrane  becoming depressed into the flow channel . Therefore, fluid passage thereunder will not be blocked.","For example, when control line A is pressurized, it blocks flows F, F, and F in flow channels A, C, and E, respectively. Similarly, when control line C is pressurized, it blocks flows F, F, F, and F in flow channels A, B, E, and F, respectively. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the present disclosure, more than one control line can be actuated at the same time. For example, control lines A and C can be pressurized simultaneously to block all fluid flow except F (with control line A blocking F, F, and F; and control line C blocking F, F, F, and F).","By selectively pressurizing different control lines A-D both together and in various sequences, a degree of fluid flow control can be achieved. Moreover, by extending the present system to more than six parallel flow channels A-F and more than four parallel control lines A-D, and by varying the positioning of the wide and narrow regions of the control lines, complex fluid flow control systems can be fabricated.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method of flowing a material and\/or performing a chemical reaction in a PFPE-based microfluidic device.

In some embodiments, the active material is a chromatographic material.

Extending from chamber  substantially opposite from microscale channel  is microscale channel . Microscale channel  forms a T-junction with microscale channel  which extends away from and is in fluid communication with aperture C. Thus, the junction of microscale channels  and  form intersecting point B. Microscale channel  extends from intersecting point B in a direction substantially opposite microscale channel  and to fluid reservoir 850C. Fluid reservoir C is dimensioned to be wider than microscale channel  for a predetermined length. As noted above, however, a given section of a microscale channel can act as a fluid reservoir without the need to necessarily change a dimension of the section of microscale channel. Moreover, microscale channel  could act as a reaction chamber in that a reagent flowing from microscale channel  to intersection point B could react with a reagent moving from microscale channel  to intersection point B and into microscale channel .","Continuing with reference to , microscale channel  extends from fluid reservoir C substantially opposite microfluidic channel  and travels through a bend into microscale channel .

Subsequent photocuring of the material is accomplished through blending with 1 wt % of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone and exposure to UV radiation (\u03bb=365 nm).","Poly(tetrafluoroethylene oxide-co-difluoromethylene oxide)a,w diol (ZDOL, Average Mca. 3,800 g\/mol, 95% Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis., United States of America), 2-Isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (EIM, 99% Aldrich), 2,2-Dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone (DMPA, 99% Aldrich), Dibutyltin diacetate (DBTDA, 99% Aldrich), and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (Freon 113, 99% Aldrich) were used as received.","In a typical synthesis, ZDOL (5.7227 g, 1.5 mmol) was added to a dry 50 mL round bottom flask and purged with argon for 15 minutes. EIM (0.43 mL, 3.0 mmol) was then added via syringe along with Freon 113 (2 mL), and DBTDA (50 \u03bcL). The solution was immersed in an oil bath and allowed to stir at 50\u00b0 C. for 24 h. The solution was then passed through a chromatographic column (alumina, Freon 113, 2 cm=5 cm). Evaporation of the solvent yielded a clear, colorless, viscous oil, which was further purified by passage through a 0.22-\u03bcm polyethersulfone filter. 1H-NMR (ppm): 2.1, s (3H); 3.7, q (2H); 4.4, t (2H); 4.7, t (2H); 5.3, m (1H); 5.8, s (1H); 6.3, s (1H).","In a typical cure, 1 wt % of DMPA (0.05 g, 2.0 mmol) was added to PFPE DMA (5 g, 1.2 mmol) along with 2 mL Freon 113 until a clear solution was formed. After removal of the solvent, the cloudy viscous oil was passed through a 0.22-\u03bcm polyethersulfone filter to remove any DMPA that did not disperse into the PFPE DMA. The filtered PFPE DMA was then irradiated with a UV source (Electro-lite UV curing chamber model no. 81432-ELC-500, Danbury, Conn., United States of America, \u03bb=365 nm) while under a nitrogen purge for 10 min, yielding a clear, slightly yellow, rubbery material.","In a typical fabrication, PFPE DMA containing photoinitiator (as described in Example 4) was spin coated to a thickness of 20 \u03bcm (800 rpm) onto a Si wafer containing the desired photoresist pattern. This wafer was then placed into the UV curing chamber and irradiated for 6 s. Separately, a thick layer (\u02dc5 mm) of the material was produced by pouring the PFPE DMA containing photoinitiator into a mold surrounding the Si wafer containing the desired photoresist pattern. This wafer was irradiated with UV light for 1 min. Following this step, the thick layer was removed and inlet holes were carefully punched in specific areas of the device. The thick layer was then carefully placed on top of the thin layer such that the patterns in the two layers were precisely aligned, and then the entire device was irradiated for 10 min. Once complete, the entire device was peeled from the wafer with both layers adhered together. These curing times were determined to be the optimal exposure times to achieve a good balance between structure failure and proper adhesion of the two layers.","Swelling experiments were performed by soaking fully cured PFPE DMA and fully cured Sylgard\u00ae 184 (Dow Corning, Midland, Mich., United States of America) in dichloromethane. The % Swelling was determined using the following equation:\n\n% Swelling=100% * ()\/\n\nwhere Wt is the weight of the material immediately after soaking in dichloromethane for time t and being patted dry with a paper tissue, and Wis the original weight of the material.\n","Viscosities of the two elastomer precursors (PFPE DMA and Sylgard\u00ae 184) were measured on a TA Instruments AR2000 Rheometer (New Castle, Del., United States of America). Measurements were taken on approximately 3-5 mL of material. Measurements on the Sylgard\u00ae 184 precursors were taken immediately after mixing the two components. The shear rate for Sylgard\u00ae 184 was varied from 0.03 sto 0.70 sand resulted in a constant viscosity at each shear rate. The shear rate for PFPE DMA was varied from 0.28 sto 34.74 sand also resulted in a constant viscosity regardless of the shear rate. Viscosities were obtained by taking an average of the viscosity values over all measured shear rates on a logarithmic plot. The raw data for these experiments are shown in .","Modulus measurements were taken on a PerkinElmer DMA 7e Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (Boston, Mass., United States of America). Samples were cut into 4-mm\u00d78-mm\u00d70.5-mm (width\u00d7length\u00d7thickness) rectangles. The initial static force on each of the two samples was 5 mN and the load was increased at rate of 500 mN\/min until the sample ruptured or it reached 6400 mN. The tensile moduli were obtained from the initial slope (up to approximately 20% strain) of the stress\/strain curves.","Thermal transitions of the two elastomers were obtained on a Seiko DMS 210 Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analyzer (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Chiba, Japan). Samples were cut into 4-mm\u00d720-mm\u00d70.5-mm (width\u00d7length\u00d7thickness) rectangles. The following settings were used: Lamp=10, Min Tension\/Compression force=10.000 g, Tension\/Compression correction=1.2; Force amplitude=100. The temperature sweep ranged from \u2212140\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. Tg's were obtained from the corresponding temperature at the maxima in a plot of E\u2033 (loss modulus) vs. temperature.","Static contact angles were measured using a KSV Instruments CAM 200 Optical Contact Angle Meter (KSV Instruments, Ltd., Helsinki, Finland). Droplets were placed on each of the fully cured elastomers using a 250-\u03bcL screw-top syringe.","To measure solvent resistance, tests using classical swelling measurements were performed on both the cross-linked PFPE DMA and Sylgard\u00ae 184, a PDMS. Rubinstein, M., et al., ; Oxford University Press: New York, 2003; p 398. Sample weight was compared before and after immersion in dichloromethane for several hours. The data show that after 94 h the PDMS network had swelled to 109% by weight, while the PFPE network showed negligible swelling (<3%).","The PDMS and PFPE precursor materials and the fully cured networks have similar processing and mechanical properties. Rheology experiments showed the viscosity of the uncured PFPE DMA at 25\u00b0 C. to be 0.36 Pa\u00b7s, which is significantly lower than that of 3.74 Pa\u00b7s for the uncured Sylgard\u00ae 184. Because both materials are viscous oils at room temperature, however, standard PDMS device fabrication methods also could be used with the PFPE materials.","Said another way, the PFPE materials of the presently disclosed subject matter exhibit low viscosities and are pourable. These properties distinguish PFPE materials from other fluoroelastomers, such as Kalrez\u00ae (DuPont Dow Elastomers, L.L.C., Wilmington, Del., United States of America) and Viton\u00ae (DuPont Dow Elastomers, L.L.C., Wilmington, Del., United States of America), which have high viscosities. For example, the viscosity of Viton\u00ae is 7800 Pa\u00b7s at 160\u00b0 C. Further, Kalrez\u00ae and Viton\u00ae are each cured thermally only.","Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was performed on the fully cured materials. Both the PFPE and PDMS networks exhibited low temperature transitions (\u2212112\u00b0 C. and \u2212128\u00b0 C., respectively) as evidenced by maxima in the loss modulus E\u2033 (see ). This transition accounts for the similar elastic behavior of the two crosslinked materials at room temperature. Stress strain analysis shows that the tensile modulus of the fully cured PFPE-based elastomer is 3.9 MPa, which similar to that measured for fully cured Sylgard\u00ae 184 (2.4 MPa). Static contact angle measurements were made on both the elastomers.","As provided in Table IV, the PFPE DMA elastomer showed a higher contact angle than Sylgard\u00ae 184 for water and methanol. Toluene and dichloromethane instantly swelled Sylgard\u00ae 184 on contact, which prevented measurements to be taken. Contact angle values for these solvents were obtained for the PFPE DMA material, however, as no swelling occurred.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0194","num":"0216"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE IV"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Static Contact Angles (deg)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Elastomer","Water","Methanol","Toluene","Dichloromethane"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["PFPE DMA","107","35","40","43"]},{"entry":["Sylgard\u2009\u00ae 184","101","22","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"a"}}]}}]}}},"In some embodiments, device fabrication was accomplished according to the procedure illustrated in . This procedure uses partial curing techniques to adhere the two layers without compromising feature sizes. Unger, M. A., et al., 2000, 288, 113-116. The PFPE DMA material was spin-coated and molded using procedures designed for Sylgard\u00ae 184.","To compare the solvent compatibility of devices made from the two materials, a dyed solution containing dichloromethane, acetonitrile, and methanol was introduced into a PFPE channel and a PDMS channel by capillary action (see ). The PFPE channels showed no evidence of swelling as the solution traveled easily through the channel. A pronounced reverse meniscus was observed, indicating good wetting behavior. In contrast, no solution entered the PDMS device because the channel was plugged shut when it made contact with the droplet. As a control, a dyed methanol solution was easily introduced in the PDMS channel in the same manner. Actuation of the valves was accomplished by introducing pressurized air (\u02dc25 psi) to small holes that were punched through the thick layer at the beginning of the channels. When the solution was present in the channel, valve actuation was observed (see ).","It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter can be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.
