These components may be physically and\/or electrically attached with each other and may have a communication interface with a remotely located monitoring apparatus. Such a communication interface is typically required to be configured for proper and accurate operation of the monitoring apparatus. The typical procedure for configuring such a communications interface can be time consuming and vulnerable to inaccuracy.","In a typical system, a user walks to within viewing proximity of the equipment (e.g., a turbine) and then identifies characteristics and external markings that are visible on each monitoring component, such as the type, manufacture and model of each component, and then records such information, such as for example, via a writing on a notepad, and then walks over to the monitoring apparatus, which might be located 200 yards away from the equipment. The user then interacts with a user interface provided by the monitoring apparatus and communicates information to the monitoring apparatus typically via a keyboard and\/or a mouse, that represents the characteristics of each component, such as for example, the type, manufacture and model of each component. Any information that may be required to be entered into the user interface of the monitoring apparatus may have been recorded inaccurately or not at all by the user. As a result, the configuration information that directs the operation of the monitoring apparatus for communicating with the equipment monitoring components may be inaccurate and\/or incomplete. The user may or may not recognize that the entered configuration information is inaccurate or incomplete.","If such a configuration problem is recognized by the user, the user will likely travel (e.g., walk) back to the equipment and attempt to again record any information understood to be relevant to configuring the installed set of equipment monitoring components and then travel back to the monitoring apparatus to re-enter such information via the user interface program. If such a configuration problem is not recognized by the user, the user will cease attempting to properly configure the monitoring apparatus and as a result, the monitoring apparatus will be permitted to operate while being directed by incomplete and\/or inaccurate configuration information, potentially causing incorrect processing of signals received from the equipment monitoring components.","The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A system and method for configuring a communications interface between a monitoring apparatus and one or more equipment monitoring components is disclosed. The equipment monitoring components are designed to physically and\/or electrically interface with each other while in proximity to equipment being monitored. Each of these components has a proximately disposed unique associated machine readable code. A set of configuration information is also associated with the machine readable code. The codes are scanned and mapped to the configuration information in order to automate configuration of communication between the monitoring apparatus and equipment monitoring components.","An advantage that may be realized in the practice of some disclosed embodiments is reduced expenditure of time and improved accuracy when configuring a communications interface between a monitoring apparatus and one or more equipment monitoring components.","In one exemplary embodiment, a system is disclosed for configuring a communications interface between a monitoring apparatus and one or more components that are designed to physically and\/or electrically interface with each other, one or more of the components each having a unique associated machine readable code and each component having associated configuration information, the system including a code scanning device that is configured to input and map a visual representation of a machine readable code associated with each of one or more selected components, to at least one numerical value, a code mapping facilitator that is configured to map the at least one numerical value to an associated set of configuration information, and a monitoring configuration facilitator that is configured to communicate the set of configuration information to a monitoring apparatus that is designed to communicate with the at least one component of the one or more selected components.","In another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method for configuring a communications interface with one or more equipment monitoring components that are designed to physically and\/or electrically interface with each other, one or more of the components each having a unique associated machine readable code and each having associated configuration information associated with the machine readable code. The method includes the steps of scanning a representation of a machine readable code that is associated with at least one of the components, obtaining at least a portion of a set of configuration information that is associated with the machine readable code, and communicating the set of configuration information to a monitoring apparatus that is designed to communicate with the at least one component.","In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides for a method of configuring a communications interface with one or more equipment monitoring components that are designed to physically and\/or electrically interface with each other, each of the components having a unique associated machine readable code and each having associated configuration information associated with the machine readable code, the method including the steps of scanning a representation of a machine readable code that is associated with at least one of the components via a code scanning device, the components collectively function as a sensor for monitoring selected equipment, obtaining a set of configuration information that is associated with the machine readable code via communication with a repository of configuration information, and communicating the set of configuration information to a monitoring apparatus that is designed to communicate with the at least one of the components while monitoring the selected equipment.","This brief description of the invention is intended only to provide a brief overview of subject matter disclosed herein according to one or more illustrative embodiments, and does not serve as a guide to interpreting the claims or to define or limit the scope of the invention, which is defined only by the appended claims.

Machine readable codes display a pattern that is designed to encode information that can be decoded by a code scanning device . There are numerous types of machine readable codes, which are also referred to as bar codes, QR codes, optical product marking etc. A machine readable code can also be designed to be human readable, such for example, a product code including letters or numbers, and is not necessarily not suitable to be read via the human eye. The monitoring apparatus  includes computer hardware and software and is designed to receive and process electronic signals that are transmitted from the equipment monitoring components -.","The attributes of each of these equipment monitoring components -, such as the type, manufacturer, model and operating characteristics of each of these components  can vary. As a result, the correct processing by the monitoring apparatus  of signals received from the equipment monitoring components -, requires that certain configuration parameters that define the attributes, such as operating characteristics of the equipment monitoring components - and\/or mechanical configuration of the equipment, be included within configuration information that is stored and processed within the monitoring apparatus . Furthermore, configuration parameters that define the attributes and operating characteristics of the monitoring apparatus itself, may also be included within the configuration information.","The monitoring apparatus  includes monitoring communication hardware  and monitoring software .

The scanning device  is designed for initiating bi-directional wireless communication to the monitoring apparatus  and\/or the computer  in accordance with IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, or other wireless communication standards.","While using the code scanning device , the user can obtain other types of configuration information, such as including orientation and location of an equipment monitoring component -, that cannot be obtained from scanning any code that is disposed in association with the equipment monitoring component -.","In some embodiments, the code scanning device  includes hardware, such as for example an accelerometer and\/or a gyroscope, that are designed to measure a direction of gravity relative to and the orientation of, the code scanning device . In combination with other capabilities of the code scanning device , including such as the execution of embedded digital logic and image capture and viewing capabilities of the code scanning device , the orientation of the code scanning device  relative to the direction of gravity can be determined via the code scanning device . This is particularly useful when configuring the orientation of a probe that is functioning as an equipment monitoring component -. In some circumstances, the probe may need to be oriented at a particular angle relative to the direction of gravity.","While viewing an equipment monitoring component - via the code scanning device , the orientation of an equipment monitoring component - that is disposed in proximity to the code scanning device  can be determined. The orientation of an equipment monitoring component - can be measured relative to the direction of gravity and\/or relative to the orientation of the code scanning device  while the equipment monitoring component - is being viewed through the code scanning device .","In some embodiments, the code scanning device  is placed into a mode that provides an orientation angle measurement template, having a general appearance of a circular clock that instead indicates angle of orientation numerals along its perimeter, and that is superimposed over the image of an equipment monitoring component - while the equipment monitoring component - is being viewed through a user interface display screen of the code scanning device . This feature enables a user of the code scanning device  to view and measure angle of orientation of the equipment monitoring component , while the code scanning device  is oriented in alignment with the direction of gravity. As a result, the orientation of an equipment monitoring component - can be measured and adjusted with respect to the direction of gravity while viewing the equipment monitoring component - via the image viewing and angle of orientation measurement features of the code scanning device .","In some embodiments, the code scanning device  includes hardware, such as for example a geographic positioning system (GPS) component, that is designed to measure and report the location of the code scanning device . The location of equipment monitoring components - can be determined when the code scanning device  is located proximate or adjacent to the location of an equipment monitoring component -. As a result, the location and\/or orientation of equipment monitoring components - can be included within a set of configuration information associated with the equipment monitoring components -.","Obtaining equipment monitoring component - configuration information apart from that obtained from scanning a code associated with the particular equipment monitoring component -, is referred to herein as direct (non-scanning) identification of configuration information via the code scanning device . Via direct identification, configuration parameters that are not encoded within a machine readable code, are obtained via human eye observation or via other functions of the code scanning device , such as configuration parameters that are measured via image recognition and\/or other code reading device  sensors, such as for example, equipment measurement component - orientation as seen through a viewing image provided by the code scanning device .","Other non-scanning configuration associated with the particular equipment monitoring component - may simply be observed and entered by the user into the code scanning device . This type of configuration information, such as for example, the scale factor, orientation, type of output and full scale range of an equipment monitoring component - is communicated within a set of communication information for the particular equipment monitoring component - to other destinations for processing and\/or storage.","In some exemplary embodiments, the set of equipment monitoring components  is designed to monitor vibration of equipment, such as a turbine . For example, in some exemplary embodiments, the monitoring components can be implemented as 3300 XL sensor apparatus, also referred to herein as the 3300 XL vibration apparatus, that is supplied by the General Electric Company of Bently, Nev. The 3300 XL apparatus includes a transmitter , an extension cable , and a proximity probe . The extension cable  can be designed at different lengths (e.g., as a 5 meter model or a 9 meter model version).","In some exemplary embodiments, the monitoring apparatus  is implemented as a 3500 Series condition monitoring and protection system, also referred to as an asset condition monitor, that is also supplied by the General Electric Company. Within this monitoring apparatus  there are card slots to receive various types of monitoring modules that are each implemented as electronic cards.

The monitoring hardware  is accessible from the CPU  and the monitoring software  via the system bus  and is available for the monitoring software  to interface with the monitoring communication hardware  while in communication with the equipment monitoring components -.","User interface hardware  is also accessible from the CPU  and the monitoring software  via the system bus  and device communication hardware  and is available for the monitoring software  to direct interaction with a user. The device communication hardware  interfaces with hardware of a data repository  and of the user interface hardware .","Optionally, the monitoring apparatus  can also interface with one or more computer networks  via the communication input\/output hardware . The computer networks  can be implemented as a set of local and\/or a wide area networks, such as including the Internet. The networks can support wireless communication with various other devices, including hand held devices and\/or the equipment monitoring components -. With such a network communication embodiment, a direct cable connection, such as cable , may be redundant or un-necessary in addition to wireless communication. Such networks may enable the equipment monitoring components to be located far away from the location of the network monitoring apparatus.","Referring back to , in a typical system , equipment monitoring components - physically and electrically attach to each other and are disposed proximate to the turbine . The equipment monitoring components - are attached to a first end of an electrical signal carrying cable  and the monitoring apparatus  is connected to an opposite and second end of the cable .","In the above described system , the equipment monitoring components - are installed prior to being fully configured to communicate with the monitoring apparatus . In a typical system, a user walks to within proximity of the equipment (e.g., a turbine ) and employs a code scanning device  to automate configuration of the installed equipment monitoring components -. In one embodiment, the code scanning device  is also an image capture device.","The code scanning device  is used to capture visual information associated with each equipment monitoring component -. Such visual information is processed by the code scanning device  to identify and decode unique codes that are associated with each component and to obtain configuration information regarding the equipment monitoring component - that is associated with each code. The visual information can also include for example, other information regarding component orientation and\/or location which may not be obtained in association with scanning each respective code. Such configuration information can be obtained directly by the code scanning device  or by the user via the code scanning device  or by the user via observation and automatically communicated into the monitoring apparatus  without the user having to travel to the monitoring apparatus .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["140","120","124","130","140","140","140","140","140"],"i":["a ","b"]},"The internals of the code scanning device  are similar to that of , in that the code scanning device  will include a processor (central processing unit), virtual  and\/or physical memory , at least one system bus and application software. The application software is designed to direct code scanning device hardware to scan and decode a machine readable code - and to communicate with a repository  via repository software  and communicate with the monitoring communication hardware  via the monitoring software . The application software interfaces with operating software also residing within memory , like that shown with respect to the interface between the monitoring software  and the operating system software  of . The application and operating system software include procedures that facilitate code mapping and monitoring configuration and any communication required for code mapping and monitoring configuration.","In some embodiments, code mapping is performed via a repository located within the code mapping device  itself. In some embodiments, the code mapping device  is wire line, such as via a docking station, and in communication with other devices for communication with a repository and\/or a monitoring system.","The monitoring apparatus  is shown as a set of racks - that each include (8) card slots for storage of various card types. A card  of rack  is designed to process signals transmitted from equipment monitoring component - via cable . The card  includes (4) channels arranged in a vertical line. The cable  is attached to channel number  which is the third top most channel.","Referring back to , in the typical system , equipment monitoring components - are physically and\/or electrically attached with each other and disposed onto the outer surface of the turbine . The equipment monitoring components - are connected to a first end of an electrical signal carrying cable , and that has a second end that is connected to the monitoring apparatus . In the above described system , the components are installed prior to being fully configured to communicate with the monitoring apparatus .","Further, a user can walk to within viewing proximity of the turbine  and then capture or analyze an image of each of one or more installed component(s) via a code scanning device . The code scanning device  is designed to process each captured image and to locate and identify a code within the captured image. Upon identification of each code, the code scanning device  determines a numerical value represented by the code. The code scanning device  initiates a mapping operation upon the numerical value of the code to a set of configuration information associated with the code representing the component.","In one exemplary embodiment, the code scanning device  performs the mapping operation by transmitting a wireless communication that includes the numerical value of the code to repository software , which accesses a repository  of code and configuration information. The repository  stores information encoding an association between a code representing an equipment monitoring component -, and configuration information that is associated with the code representing the equipment monitoring component -. In response, the repository software  transmits a communication to the code scanning device  including the configuration information that is associated with the code representing the component. The above described mechanism, which employs the repository software , the repository  and a communication capability for interfacing with the code scanning device , can be referred to as a code mapping facilitator.","The configuration information is designed to encode a set of one or more configuration parameters that are each named and set to equal a default parameter value. Some of the configuration parameters may be set to default values that are fixed, while other configuration parameters may be set to default values that are not-fixed and are appropriate to be reset by the user.","In such a use, the software within the code scanning device  lists configuration parameters by name and value and prompts the user to optionally set or reset a non-fixed value of one or more named configuration parameter(s) associated with each scanned component, via user interface display screen . The user may or may not elect to modify the value of some or all of the non-fixed configuration parameter(s) listed by the code scanning device . In this described circumstance, the listed configuration parameters are associated with the one scanned equipment monitoring component -.","For example, an equipment monitoring component - may include external and hand settable switches. The user has the option to set a switch position and to set a corresponding non-fixed parameter in association with that equipment monitoring component -. In some exemplary embodiments, the user can also modify and essentially override a fixed configuration parameter value associated with the equipment monitoring component -.","After viewing the listed parameter names and values and approving the fixed or non-fixed values of the configuration parameters, the user enters a command to the code scanning device  to transmit the configuration information to the monitoring apparatus  for processing of configuration information in association with an identified rack and card slot and channel of the monitoring apparatus  for which the equipment monitoring component is to communicate. In response, the monitoring apparatus  processes the received configuration information to generate a configuration file that is loaded into and processed by the monitoring apparatus  to direct operation of the identified rack, card slot and channel of the monitoring apparatus , when communicating with equipment monitoring components - via cable . The above described mechanism, which processes configuration information in association with an identified rack and card slot and channel of the monitoring apparatus  for which the equipment monitoring component is to communicate, can be referred to as a monitoring configuration facilitator.","In the circumstance where there are multiple equipment monitoring components -, such as that shown in , each of the multiple machine readable codes for each respective equipment monitoring component -, are scanned, mapped and a resulting set of per component configuration information for each scanned code is consolidated or aggregated into one combined set of configuration information. The combined set of configuration information is transmitted to the monitoring apparatus  for configuration processing in association with a rack and card slot and channel identifier. In response, the monitoring apparatus  processes the configuration information to generate a configuration file that is loaded into and processed by the monitoring apparatus  to direct operation of the identified rack\/slot and channel of the monitoring apparatus  when communicating with the multiple equipment monitoring components -.","In some exemplary embodiments, the code scanning device  is designed so that the user enters a command to execute a cross checking procedure for the combined set of configuration information. This cross checking command determines compatibility between pairs of per component configuration information that are each associated with selected pairs of components. Pairs of components that are determined to be incompatible with each other, in any configuration, or incompatible with each other as currently configured, are identified by the code scanning device  to the user.","If no incompatibility between configured components is identified by the cross checking procedure, such a result is indicated to the user. The user enters a command to the code scanning device  to transmit the cross-checked configuration information to the monitoring apparatus  for configuration processing in association with a rack and card slot and channel identifier. In response, the monitoring apparatus  processes the configuration information to generate a configuration file that is loaded and processed to direct operation of the identified rack\/slot and channel of the monitoring apparatus  when it is communicating with the multiple equipment monitoring components -.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["140","402","120","124","404","140","406"]},"Next, the user reads the listed configuration parameters for the scanned component and determines if a configuration parameter value of a scanned component should be modified. In some exemplary embodiments, the software is designed to highlight configuration parameter values of the configuration information associated with the scanned code, that do not have an associated fixed value based upon the type of particular equipment monitoring component - scanned. For example, an equipment monitoring component - may have one or more user selectable switches each having a position that can be manipulated by the user. The user has an option to modify a configuration value parameter in accordance with the position of such a switch (step ). Next, whether a configuration parameter has been modified or not, the per component configuration information is saved (step ) by entering a command into the code scanning device .","Next, the procedure returns to step  to ask whether there is any remaining equipment monitoring components - to be scanned. If yes, performance of steps - are repeated for another equipment monitoring component -. If no remaining equipment monitoring components - are available to be scanned, then go to step  to ask if at least one component was scanned? If yes, then go to step  to combine and communicate component configuration information to the monitoring apparatus  for compatibility cross-checking between selected pairs of individually scanned and configured equipment monitoring components -. The monitoring apparatus  then communicates a reply back to the code scanning device  acknowledging receiving and processing the prior communication from the code scanning device  and reporting results of processing the prior communication from the code scanning device . Next, the user verifies that the combined configuration information has passed compatibility cross-checking checks and lacks compatibility errors and successfully completes processing to use by the monitoring apparatus  (step ).","In some exemplary embodiments, the user optionally employs the code scanning device  to scan a machine readable code disposed on a selected monitoring card residing within a particular rack and card slot within the monitoring apparatus  that is to communicate with the equipment monitoring components -. The scanned code is mapped to a set per component configuration information, where in this instance, the scanned component is the selected monitoring card. In this exemplary embodiment, compatibility between the selected monitoring card and one or more other equipment monitoring components - can be determined via the cross checking procedure.","Furthermore, in some exemplary embodiments, per component configuration information obtained for the selected monitoring card, is employed by the mapping procedure to revise per component configuration information associated with other equipment monitoring component(s) that are expected and being configured to communicate with the selected monitoring card.","For example, the selected monitoring card may be designed to support programmable alarm set points with respect to the operation of a particular equipment monitoring component -. In this circumstance, such an alarm set point can be set or reset by the user as a non-fixed configuration parameter value associated with a selected equipment monitoring component - for which the alarm set point is to be applied.","In another circumstance, the selected monitoring card may not be designed to support programmable alarm set points with respect to the operation of a particular equipment monitoring component -. In this circumstance, such an alarm set point is unavailable to be set by the user as a configuration parameter associated with a selected equipment monitoring component -, when that component is configured to communicate with the selected monitoring card lacking such a design. As a result, scanning the machine readable code disposed on a selected monitoring card which lacks such an alarm set point feature, would not cause an alarm set point configuration parameter to be added to the per component configuration data associated with the selected equipment monitoring component -.","After the combined set of configuration information is transmitted to and processed by the monitoring apparatus , the monitoring apparatus  is configured to monitor the operation of the one or more configured equipment monitoring components -.","In some exemplary embodiments, referred to as loop checking, during a period of monitoring of the operation of the equipment monitoring components -, the code scanning device  upon entry of a command, remotely communicates with and obtains information from the monitoring apparatus  regarding the operating status of the equipment monitoring components -. For example, if the components are communicating with channel number  of monitoring card residing within slot  of the monitoring apparatus  (See ), the user can obtain an information transmitted from equipment monitoring component  that is communicating with that channel, card within that slot . Also, system performance can be monitored and verified via entry of a command after completion of loop checks and final installation setup.","For example, if the equipment monitoring components - comprise an eddy current type of sensor, the information transmitted could indicate the value of a gap voltage that is measured by the equipment monitoring component -. If the gap voltage is suspiciously low or high, the user can move to the location of the equipment monitoring components - to take further action, such as to adjust an eddy probe gap to measure a corresponding change in the bias voltage, in order to verify that the equipment monitoring components - are operating properly, or to verify that the equipment monitoring components - are in fact correctly wired to the channel  of slot . If not, then the cable  may be incorrectly wired to another channel and\/or slot than was intended by the user.","In some embodiments, software that directs hardware within a code scanning device performs scanning a representation of a machine readable code that is associated with at least one equipment monitoring component via a code scanning device, and performs obtaining a set of configuration information that is associated with the machine readable code via communication with a repository of configuration information, and performs communicating the set of configuration information to a monitoring apparatus that is designed to communicate with the at least one of the components while monitoring the selected equipment, to yield a technical effect of configuring a communications interface between a monitoring apparatus and one or more components that are designed to physically and\/or electrically interface with each other.
