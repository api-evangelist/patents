{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to teleconferences and, more particularly, to methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to detect echo during teleconferences.","An echo in a communication service is a potentially attenuated, potentially distorted and\/or potentially altered version of what is transmitted by a device that is also received at the device. An echo may be caused by any number and\/or type(s) of conditions such as, but not limited to, an impedance mismatch, an acoustic echo due to use of a speakerphone, etc. When an echo occurs with sufficient amplitude, and\/or with sufficient delay and\/or time offset relative to what was transmitted, the echo can be noticeable and\/or annoying to a person utilizing the communication service and\/or be disruptive to the ongoing communication service.","Example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to detect echo during teleconferences are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes collecting first signal data for a first teleconference leg of a teleconference, collecting second signal data for a second teleconference leg of the teleconference, computing an echo detection metric from the first and second signal data, and comparing the echo detection metric to a threshold to determine whether an echo is likely present on the first teleconference leg of the teleconference.","A disclosed example apparatus includes a teleconference bridge interface to collect first signal data for a first teleconference leg of a teleconference, and to collect second signal data for a second teleconference leg of the teleconference, a detector to compute an echo detection metric from the first and second signal data, and an echo identifier to compare the echo detection metric to a threshold to determine whether an echo is likely present on the first teleconference leg of the teleconference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","105","108","100","110","105","108","105","108","110","115","118","105","108","115","118","115","118"]},"The example teleconference bridge  of  communicatively couples two or more of the example endpoints - together to implement and\/or form a teleconference that allows, permits and\/or enables users of those endpoints - to communicate simultaneously with each other via the teleconference bridge . Using any number and\/or type(s) of circuit(s), device(s), and\/or method(s), the example teleconference bridge  implements a particular teleconference by combining signal data received from each of the endpoints - participating in that teleconference and providing the combined signal data to each of those participating endpoints -.","During a teleconference, echo present on one leg of the teleconference is often readily heard and\/or perceived by users associated with other legs of the teleconference, and\/or may interfere with what others hear and\/or speak. Teleconference echoes may result in decreased customer satisfaction and\/or lost revenue. As more telecommunication networks evolve to utilize VoIP technologies, increasing numbers of teleconference legs include communication paths having bulk and\/or flat delays in excess of 128 milliseconds (ms), thereby increasing the likelihood of perceivable teleconference echoes.","To cancel echo(s) that are detected, identified and\/or present on one or more legs of a teleconference, the example teleconferencing system  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of echo cancellers, one of which is designated at reference numeral . The example echo canceller  of  includes an adaptive filter  to convolve the transmitted signal associated with a teleconference leg with filter coefficients to form an estimate of the echo, and a subtractor  to subtract the estimate of the echo from the signal received via the teleconference leg. The example echo canceller  also includes an adapter  to adapt the filter coefficients to minimize the residual echo remaining in the received signal after the subtractor  subtracts the estimate of the echo. In some examples, the echo canceller  includes a non-linear processor (NLP) and\/or echo suppressor (not shown) to eliminate any remaining residual echo. An example NLP attenuates the received signal with an attenuation factor adaptively and\/or dynamically selected based on the signal strength of the remaining residual echo. For large remaining residual echoes, which may represent actual speech rather than echo, the attenuation factor is selected to be small. For small remaining residual echoes, the attenuation factor is selected to be larger, with the attenuation factor increasing as the signal strength of the remaining residual echo decreases. Example manners of implementing the example echo canceller  of  are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/562,366, entitled \u201cMethods, Apparatus and Articles of Manufacture to Cancel Echo for Communication Paths Having Long Bulk Delays,\u201d and filed Sep. 18, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","To monitor teleconferences for echo, the example teleconferencing system  of  includes a bridge monitor . The example bridge monitor  of  collects, receives and\/or otherwise obtains from the example teleconference bridge  signal data for the legs of a currently considered teleconference, and processes the collected signal data to detect, identify and\/or otherwise determine whether echo is present on any leg(s) of that teleconference. The example bridge monitor  computes one or more echo detection metrics from and\/or based on the collected signal data. Example echo detection metrics that may be computed include, but are not limited to, a single-talk activity metric (STM), a double-talk activity metric (DTM), a muting metric (MM), a signal level during single-talk metric (SSM), a signal level during double-talk metric (DSM), and a signal correlation metric (SCM). The example STM represents a percentage of time that a presently considered teleconference leg is the only teleconference leg with an active signal. The example DTM represents a percentage of time that a presently considered teleconference leg and one or more other teleconference legs are simultaneously active. The example MM represents a percentage of time that a presently considered teleconference leg is muted at the teleconference bridge . The example SSM represents an average signal level in, for example, decibels (dB) referenced to one milliwatt (dBm), when a presently considered teleconference bridge has an active signal. The example DSM represents an average signal level in, for example, dBm, when a presently considered teleconference leg and one or more other teleconference legs are simultaneously active. The SCM represents a peak, largest and\/or maximum correlation between the active signal on a presently considered teleconference leg and the active signal on another teleconference leg. In some examples, the SCM is zero when the two active signals are completely uncorrelated, and one when the two active signals are completely correlated. The computed SCM is associated with the teleconference leg having the weaker active signal, and is held and\/or tracked over the duration of the teleconference. That is, the SCM represents the peak amount of correlation between two active teleconference legs during the teleconference.","The example bridge monitor  compares one or more of the echo detection metrics computed for a presently considered teleconference leg to respective thresholds to determine whether it is likely that echo is present on that teleconference leg. For example, it is likely that echo is present when the DTM is greater than a threshold when the teleconference is not muted, which can be expressed mathematically as\n\n(DTM\u2212MM)\/(100\u2212MM)>,\u2003\u2003EQN (1)\n\nwhere an example value of Tis 0.5 (i.e., 50%). It is also likely that echo is present when the STM is much smaller than the DTM when the leg is not muted, which can be expressed mathematically as\n\n(DTM\u2212MM)\/(100\u2212MM)\u2212(STM\u2212MM)\/(100\u2212MM)>,\u2003\u2003EQN (2)\n\nwhere an example value of Tis 0.5 (i.e., 50%). Echo is also likely present when SSM is significantly larger than the DSM, which can be expressed mathematically as\n\nSSM\u2212DSM>,\u2003\u2003EQN (3)\n\nwhere an example value of Tis 20 dB. When the SCM is large, which can be expressed mathematically as\n\nSCM>,\u2003\u2003EQN (4)\n\nwhere an example value of Tis 0.5 (i.e., 50%), it is likely that echo is present. The example echo detection methods of EQNS 1-3 can be used to identify teleconference legs that are likely sources of echo. The example method of EQN 4 can detect echo with a higher level of certainty and\/or reliability. In some examples, the bridge monitor  continually and\/or proactively monitors the teleconference legs of each teleconference for echo so that any detected echo(s) can be cancelled prior to a teleconference participant complaint.\n","When one or more of the example comparisons of EQNS 1-4 indicate that it is likely that echo is present on a leg of a teleconference, the example bridge monitor  of  configures the echo canceller  to remove, reduce, mitigate, cancel and\/or substantially eliminate the detected echo. The example bridge monitor  can query the echo canceller  to obtain one or more parameters representative of the current echo cancelling performance of the echo canceller . Example parameters include, but are not limited, an amount of echo removed, a filter coefficient value, a magnitude of a peak filter coefficient, etc. Such parameters may be used to, for example, verify the presence of the echo detected using the computed echo detection metrics described above. For example, if the filter coefficients have substantially random values it is unlikely that the echo is actually present. However, if the amount of echo removed is large then it is likely that the echo is present, etc.","To assist users during a teleconference and\/or to troubleshoot problems, such as echo, a technician  may interact with the example teleconference bridge  and\/or the example bridge monitor  of . When a teleconference participant mutes their teleconference leg - at their endpoint -, which could prevent echo from being transmitted to the teleconference bridge , the example comparisons of EQNS 1-4 may not be able to identify that the muted teleconference leg - is a source of echo. When participants in a teleconference complain of an echo problem, the technician  can query the bridge monitor  to determine whether an echo was detected. If an echo was not detected, the technician  can instruct all teleconference participants to un-mute their user devices - and reset the echo detection metrics computed by the bridge monitor . The example bridge monitor  may then reattempt to detect and cancel the reported echo. Because the offending teleconference leg(s) is no longer muted, the example methods and apparatus described herein will be able to detect and cancel the teleconference echo.","While an example teleconferencing system  has been illustrated in , the elements illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, eliminated and\/or implemented in any way. For example, the teleconferencing system  may include more than one teleconference bridge  and\/or more than one bridge monitor , and\/or the bridge monitor  and\/or the echo canceller  may be implemented by and\/or within the teleconference bridge . Further, the example teleconference bridge , the example echo canceller , the example bridge monitor  and\/or, more generally, the example teleconferencing system  of  may be implemented by hardware, software, firmware and\/or any combination of hardware, software and\/or firmware.

The example echo identifier  compares the one or more of the echo detection metrics computed by the example detectors - to respective thresholds to determine whether it is likely that echo is present on that teleconference leg. Example comparisons that may be used to determine whether echo is present are described above in connection with EQNS 1-4. The example echo identifier  obtains the example MM and\/or data from which the MM can be computed either from the teleconference bridge  via the bridge interface  and\/or via any of the example detectors -.","When the example echo identifier  of  determines that echo is or is likely present on a leg of a teleconference, the example echo identifier , via an echo canceller interface , configures the echo canceller  to remove, reduce, cancel and\/or substantially eliminate the detected echo.
