Other immune mediated diseases that are contemplated for treatment by the polypeptide mixture of the invention include delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) which is associated with contact antigens such as poison ivy and poison oak and various chemicals, as well as tuberculosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, deep fungal infections, etc. GA has been disclosed for use in the treatment of these diseases in, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,938 B1, issued Feb. 4, 2003 to Gad, et al.; and PCT International Publication No. WO 01\/60392, published Aug. 23, 2001 (Gilbert, et al.); PCT International Publication No. WO 00\/27417, published May 19, 2000 (Aharoni, et al.).","Polypeptide mixtures of the invention are also contemplated as a treatment for diseases associated with demyelination of central nervous system axons such as multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, demyelinating genetic diseases, spinal cord injury, virus-induced demyelination, Progressive Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy, Human Lymphotrophic T-cell Virus I (HTLVI)-associated myelopathy, and nutritional metabolic disorders such as vitamin B12 deficiency and central pontinemyelinolysis. GA has been disclosed for use in the treatment of these diseases in, e.g. PCT International Publication No. WO 01\/97846, published Dec. 27, 2001 (Moses, et al.).","Methods of Administration","Methods of administration include all standard methods, e.g. by parenteral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, mucosal, oral, intranasal, buccal, vaginal, rectal, intraocular, intrathecal, topical, transdermal and intradermal routes. Administration can be systemic or local.","For oral administration excipients such as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like may be used.","Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the polypeptide mixture include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient(s), the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.","For intraocular administration the polypeptide mixture may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as water or saline and may be formulated into eye drops.","For oral administration, the pharmaceutical preparation may be in liquid form, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or may be presented as a drug product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well-known in the art.","Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the polypeptide mixture. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and\/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen free water, before use.","The polypeptide mixture may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.","For administration by inhalation, the polypeptide mixture according to the present invention is conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.","Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the mixture of polypeptides of the invention may optionally be administered with an adjuvant in the usual manner for immunization. Non-limiting examples of such adjuvants include alum and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Other manners of improving the immunogenicity of the administered peptide or polypeptide include administration in the form of an aggregation or a complex with albumin or with other carriers, all as are well known to those of ordinary skill in the vaccine art. Metabolizable lipid emulsions, such as Intralipid or Lipofundin may also be used as vehicles for the Cop 1 therapy in the manner disclosed in PCT International Publication No. WO 97\/02016, published Jan. 23, 1997 (Cohen et al), the entire contents of which being hereby incorporated herein by reference.","When the mixture of polypeptides of the invention is administered orally, it may be mixed with other food forms and consumed in solid, semi-solid, suspension, or emulsion form; and it may be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including water, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, flavor enhancers, and the like. In one embodiment, the oral composition is enterically-coated. Use of enteric coatings is well known in the art. For example, Lehman teaches enteric coatings such as Eudragit S and Eudragit L. (Lehman, K., \u201cAcrylic Coatings in Controlled Realse Tablet Manufacturer\u201d, Manufacturing Chemist and Aerosol News, p. 39 (1973)) The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2.sup.nd Ed., also teaches Eudragit S and Eudragit L applications. One Eudragit which may be used in the present invention is L30D55.","The mixture of polypeptides of the invention may also be administered nasally in certain of the above-mentioned forms by inhalation or nose drops. Furthermore, oral inhalation may be employed to deliver the mixture of polypeptides of the invention to the mucosal linings of the trachea and bronchial passages.","The mixture of polypeptides can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamallar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholines, or lipids, such as cholesterol and stearylamine. The compounds may be administered as components of tissue-targeted emulsions.","Examples of liposomes which can be used in this invention include the following: (1) CellFectin, 1:1.5 (M\/M) liposome formulation of the cationic lipid N,NI,NII,NIII-tetramethyl-N,NI,NII,NIII-tetrapalmity-spermine and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (GIBCO BRL); (2) Cytofectin GSV, 2:1 (M\/M) liposome formulation of a cationic lipid and DOPE (Glen Research); (3) DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammoniummethylsulfate) (Boehringer Manheim); and (4) Lipofectamine, 3:1 (M\/M) liposome formulation of the polycationic lipid DOSPA and the neutral lipid DOPE (GIBCO BRL).","The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.","The mixture of polypeptides disclosed in this application, having a net positive charge, can be attached electrostatically to charged nanoparticles or nanoparticle by mixing an aqueous solution of the polypeptide mixture of the invention with a suspension of the nanoparticles or microparticles. The suspension thus formed of the polypeptide mixture attached to the nanoparticles or nanoparticle can be lyophilized to a powder for long-term storage. The lyophilized powder can be reconstituted in buffer to re-obtain the suspension of drug. Suspensions of attached drug thus obtained are particularly suited for oral delivery. If made with particles having an average diameter below 200 nm the suspension is suitable for sublingual delivery since nanoparticles can transverse the sublingual membrane. For oral delivery to the gastrointestinal tract larger nanoparticles can be used since they are the size most readily recognized by the Peyer's patches and M-cells. For such oral delivery a nano-suspension, as a lyophilized powder or as a reconstituted suspension, may be delivered to the small intestine by using an enteric coated capsule. The enhanced stability of the peptide or protein when attached in a nano-suspension formulation allows for more time for the peptide drug to be absorbed in the intestine before it is degraded by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. Production of nanoparticles can be achieved by methods well known in the art.

The results of the Edman degradation indicate the specific relative occurrence (expressed in molar fraction) of the four amino acid residues comprising the polypeptides of the polypeptide mixture of the invention.","Because the mixture of polypeptides of the invention contains polypeptides of different sizes and compositions, only limited information on the amino acid residues sequence is available by a standard method of sequencing, such as Edman degradation. The average molar fraction of the amino acids between batches, as measured, is: 0.427 alanine, 0.337 lysine, 0.141 glutamate, and 0.093 tyrosine. However, the test results indicate that L-tyrosine is more prevalent at or near the N-terminus and L-lysine is more prevalent at or near the C-terminus of the polypeptides of the mixture of the invention. Furthermore, although the average molar content of alanine in GA and in the polypeptide mixture of the invention is the same, in the polypeptide mixture of the invention, the first cycle of Edman degradation show that there are fewer polypeptide molecules with alanine at the N-terminus (0.393 molecules) than in GA. Specifically, realative to the average molear content of alanine in the mixture, there are a greater percentage of polypeptide molecules with alanine at the N-terminus in GA, but a lower percentage of polypeptide molecules with alanine at the N-terminus in the polypeptide mixture of the invention.","Molecular Size","A graphical comparison between the molecular sizes of GA and the polypeptide mixture of the invention appears in . The difference in molecular size between a polypeptide mixture of the invention (RS) and glatiramer acetate (RS) is illustrated by their two overlaid GP-HPLC (Superose 6) chromatograms.","Diethylamide Content Analysis","The polymerization process is initiated by the reaction between diethylamine (DEA) and N-carboxamide amino acid precursors in the reaction mixture. Following the acidolytic cleavage reaction, some of the polypeptide chains retain their C-terminal diethylamides, although most of the polypeptides of the invention are cleavage products with C-terminal carboxylates. Furthermore, the ultrafiltration process removes short peptides which may have either C-terminal carboxylates or diethylamides, while the larger fragments remain in the polypeptide mixture.","In the polypeptide mixture of the invention, 13-38% of the polypeptides chains have diethylamides at the end thereof where a carboxyl is usually present (preferably 18-28%). Thus, the measured free diethylamine content, calculated on a water and AcOH free basis, may vary from 700 ppm to 1500 ppm (70-150 milligrams of diethylamine per 100 grams of polypeptide mixture).","Since neither GA nor the mixture of polypeptides of the invention contain free diethylamine, the percentage of diethylamide substituted derivatives in the polypeptide mixture is actually determined by complete hydrolysis of a sample of polypeptide mixture under strongly alkaline conditions followed by quantitation of liberated diethylamine by headspace chromatography and correction to the water and AcOH free basis.","The percentage of polypeptide chains with C-terminal diethylamides (DTP) may be calculated as follows (for convenience, the calculation is shown for 100 grams of polypeptide mixture):\n\nDTP=(DEA\/PP)\u00d7100\n","DEA=moles of diethylamine in 100 grams of polypeptide mixture calculated on the dry basis","PP=moles of polypeptide in 100 grams of polypeptide mixture","For example, the average molecular weight of a representative batch of a mixture of polypeptides was determined to be 16,192 Da. A 100 gram sample was found to contain 112.4 mg of diethylamine after hydrolysis (calculated on the dry basis), thus the DTP is 24.9.","3.5.5 Circular Dichroism (CD) Studies (See )","The polypeptide mixture of the invention was dissolved in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 containing potassium chloride. The initial spectra was determined in this buffer (line with triangles). Minima at about 208 and 220 nm which is characteristic of the presence of alpha-helical conformation.","Trifluoroethanol (TFE), an inducer of alpha-helical conformation was added, and the spectra were recorded. The addition of TFE caused no significant effect on the polypeptide mixture of the invention.","The minimal signal ratio is from 0.91 (solution in buffer) to 0.93 (solution in buffer+TFE). These results represent the polypeptide mixture of the invention with 97.0% of initial \u03b1-helical conformation.","On the basis of these test results, it can be concluded that the degree of alpha-helical conformation in the polypeptide mixture of the invention is apparently almost at its maximum and is not affected by the addition of TFE. Contrary to the polypeptide mixture of the invention, glatiramer acetate molecules, which have a smaller degree of alpha-helical conformation, are induced to increase this characteristic by the addition of TFE.","The average molecular weight of the polypeptides in the mixture of the invention was initially determined to be approximately 15,000\u00b12,000 daltons (by multi-angle laser scattering (MALLS). The molecular weight is now being determined by SEC-chromatography. As determined by SEC-chromatography, the same mixture of polypeptides was shown to have an average molecular weight of 16,000\u00b12,500 daltons.","Determination of molecular weights (MW) distribution in the polypeptide mixture of the invention by SEC-chromatography requires a suitable set of MW markers. As the polypeptide mixture of the invention differs from native protein, no commercial protein MW markers could be used for this purpose and markers related to the mixture of polypeptides of the invention (\u201cpolypeptide markers\u201d) had to be produced. In order to obtain marker set for MW calibration curve, five markers were designed with MW range from about 16,000 Da to 27,000 Da (table 6). The polypeptide markers were produced by recombinant methods. The markers cDNA were sub-cloned into pET-21a vector (Merck cat# 69740) and cloned into HMS174(DE3) strain (Merck cat# 69453). After expression, two precipitations and two chromatography steps gave the markers in at least 80% purity.","Molecular weight determination of the markers was made using a Q-TOF Ultima Global (Micromass) mass spectrometer.

DNA encoding each of the polypeptide markers of the invention was subcloned into the NdeI and SalT sites of the Pet21-a vector and transformed into strain HMS174 (DE3).","A 10-30 liter culture was grown and expression of the polypeptides was induced with IPTG. After 25-50 hours of fermentation, the cells were harvested and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 2.5 and 6M urea and lysed in a Microfluidics homogenizer with cooling coil inline. The homogenate was then centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 12. The resulting suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant pH was adjusted to 8.0 with HCl. 1 mM MgCl and DNAse were added and the suspension was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.","Chromatographic Step 1: The ammonium sulfate concentration of the suspention was adjusted to 50% and the markers were loaded on a phenyl sepharose column (Amersham). The markers were eluted from the column using a gradient of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 and the peak fractions were collected.","Chromatographic Step 2: The main peak from the phenyl sepharose column was diluted with 50 mM buffer phosphate pH 8.5 and loaded on a SP-650C column (Tosoh). The markers were eluted from the column using a gradient of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.5\/2M NaCl and then collected, desalted and lyophilized.","Comparison of Different Molecular Weight Markers","To compare the chromatographic characters of different MW markers we tested four sets of markers: the polypeptide markers 1-5 as disclosed, Glatiramer acetate markers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,287 and commercially available protein markers from two vendors (sigma cat# MW-GF-70 and Amersham cat# 17-0442-01). All markers were prepared in the same fashion according to the method that was developed during this study including sample preparation with 4.5M guanidine hydrochloride.","The experiments show () that these polypeptide markers are almost in line with GA markers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,287 B2 and apparently have identical running characters. The two largest GA markers, 9200 Da and 11700 Da, form together with the polypeptide markers 1-5 an excellent linear correlation (R=0.996). The smaller GA markers seem to deviate slightly from the straight line; however the differences are most likely due to column range that wasn't designed to include samples with MW as small as the polypeptide markers. Unexpectedly, the two set of protein markers present two unrelated trend lines. The two calibration curves formed by the protein markers set are not comparable with each other and undoubtedly not with the GA markers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,287 B2 and polypeptide markers 1-5.","The test shows that calibrations with commercial MW markers are not comparable with the polypeptide markers 1-5. Even though the commercial markers' trend lines show slope values close to that of the other two sets, their RRT values are significantly larger compared to their MW as if they maintained some level of globular form (they appear smaller then their labeled MW compared to the polypeptide markers 1-5). In addition, under the conditions developed for running the mixture of polypeptides of the invention: one commercial marker was aggregated during preparation (Ovalbumin, Amersham 43000 Da marker), and the others show poor linear correlation.","Molecular Weight Distribution Determination of the Polypeptide Mixture of the Invention","After establishing core chromatographic conditions at which linear correlation between the molecular weight markers was obtained, a preliminary experiment to determine the MW of the polypeptide mixture of the invention was performed. The experiment was carried out with the conditions using phosphate buffer pH 3 with 4.5M GuaHCl as mobile phase and 0.4 ml\/min flow rate. The MW distribution results of a batch of a mixture of polypeptides of the invention were determined by \u201cMillennium\u201d MW calculation program based on theoretical MW values for the markers.","As shown in the overlay chromatogram of the polypeptide mixture of the invention and the polypeptide markers (), the markers covered the higher molecular weight region of the polypeptide mixture of the invention. The RT of polypeptide marker 1 (the lower MW marker) and the polypeptide mixture of the invention at its max were about the same. Extension of the MW range covered by markers toward the lower MW region of the polypeptide mixture of the invention can be achieved with 11700 Da and 9200 Da markers, respectively, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,287 B2 for Alexander Gad et al.","Finally, the markers themselves having the four amino acid constituents of the polypeptide of the invention are contemplated as being useful for the same uses and methods as the polypeptide mixture of the invention.","Description of the Process","Stage 1: Mixtures of Protected Polypeptides","The copolymerization of N-carboxyanhydride derivatives of the four amino acids (L-Ala, L-Glu, L-Tyr and L-Lys) in 1,4 dioxane, stirred at 25\u00b0 C.\u00b12\u00b0 C. in the presence of an initiator (diethylamine) 24 hours\u00b1\u00bc hours to yield a mixture of protected polypeptides. The four derivatives of the amino acids used are L-Tyrosine-N-carboxyanhydride, L-Alanine-N-carboxyanhydride, 5-benzyl-L-glutamate-N-carboxyanhydride and 6N-Trifluoroacetyl-L-Lysine-N-carboxyanhydride.","Following copolymerization, process water is added and the protected polypeptides are subjected to precipitation, chopping, and dispersion for 1.25 hours. The protected polypeptides are then subjected to filtration and washing. The filter-cake is dried in a vacuum at 60\u00b0 C.\u00b15\u00b0 C. at a pressure of less than 20 mmHg for 12 hours, and then subjected to milling. This yields a mixture of protected polypetides, wherein the side chain functional groups of two amino acids (glutamic acid and lysine) are protected to avoid cross-linking.","The mixture of protected polypeptides is the first intermediate in the production of the mixtures of polypeptides of the invention.","At this stage, the sequence of amino acid residues in the polypeptides is fixed.","Stage 2: Trifluoroacetylpolypeptides","Treatment of the mixtures of protected polypeptides with a solution of 33% hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid at 20\u00b0 C. for a time determined by a test reaction involves two chemical reactions: cleavage of the benzyl protecting group from the 5-carboxylate side chain of the glutamate residues (deprotection); and acidolytic peptide bond cleavage, reducing the average molecular size of the peptide mixture. The process water is then added, follwed by washing with stirring, decantation, filtration, and drying at 40\u00b0 C.\u00b12\u00b0 C. at less than 40 mmHg, thus forming the second intermediate mixtures of trifluoroacetyl polypeptides of reduced average molecular size and weight.","The necessary reaction time is determined by a test reaction prior to the actual execution of production stage 2, directing the reaction to a target value of an average molecular weight of 16,000 daltons. The reaction time is normally 7 to 18 hours at 17-21\u00b0 C. Thus, the reaction time is 7-15 hours at 18-20\u00b0 C. and is \u02dc15 hours at \u02dc20\u00b0 C.","Stage 3: Solution of a Mixture of Polypeptides of the Invention","Treatment of mixtures of trifluoroacetyl polypeptides with aqueous piperidine at 20\u00b0 C.-26\u00b0 C. removes the trifluoroacetyl protecting groups from the lysine residues forming a mixture of polypeptides of the invention (base). The resulting product is then subjected to filtration (less than 1.2 \u03bcm+0.2 \u03bcm) at a temperature less than 15\u00b0 C. During the ultrafiltration\/dilution steps, of which there may be two, low weight polypeptides formed during the first two production stages, salts and piperidine are removed by alternating the ultrafiltration\/dilution cycles. After acidification with glacial acetic acid (pH 4.0-4.5) the ultrafiltration\/dilution cycles are resumed, reaching pH greater than 5.5, e.g. 5.5-6, and reducing the impurity concentration to the required level. This produces the third intermediate mixture, an acidified mixture of the polypeptides of the invention in solution.","Stage 4: Drug Substance","The third imtermediate mixture is subjected to further filtration (0.2 \u03bcm), and then lypopilized. After inicital freezing (\u221250\u00b0 C.), the freeze-drying process on the filtered solution of acidified mixture of polypeptides of the invention contained in individual trays in the lyophilizer, is continued step-wise maintaining a controlled pressure of <0.3 mbar.","Following the lyophilization, a white to slightly yellowish material is obtained, characterized by its formula as the acetate salt of the polypeptide mixture of the invention having an average molecular weight range at HPLC peak maximum 16,000\u00b12,500 daltons, as characterized by GC-HPLC calibrated by the polypeptide markers.","The HBr Reagent","In the manufacturing process for the mixtures of polypeptides of the invention, 10%-36% hydrobromic acid in acetic acid can be used to deprotect the protected polypeptides. During the development of the production process it was found that some of the tyrosine residues in trifluoroacetyl polypeptides were brominated. This impurity was isolated and identified. The tyrosine residue was found to react with bromine to form a mono-bromotyrosine moiety comprising either 2-bromotyrosine or 3-bromotyrosine.","After much investigation the inventors discovered that the brominated tyrosine impurity was introduced into the polypeptides through free bromine in HBr\/acetic acid. The free bromine was present in 33% HBr\/acetic acid bought from a supplier and used in the production process. Thus, the hydrogen bromide and acetic acid solution is contemplated to have less than 500 ppm, in an embodiment less than 100 ppm, or less than 10 ppm of metal ion impurities. In an embodiment, the hydrogen bromide and acetic acid solution is free of metal ion impurities. Furthermore, in the hydrogen bromide and acetic acid solution should have less than 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01%, or 0.001% of (or to be free of) free bromine and, as noted should have less than 1000 ppm of metal ion impurities.","Thus, measures were taken in order to decrease the level of free bromine in the solution. For example, pre-treatment of 33% HBr\/acetic acid with a bromine scavenger was effective in removing some of the free bromine from the HBr\/acetic acid solution. Furthermore, the hydrogen bromide and acetic acid solution was handled in a non-metallic reactor, such as a glass-lined or Teflon\u00ae lined reactor.","One of the bromine scavengers used in the HBr purification process was phenol. In addition to phenol, other reducing agents, such as sodium bisulfite, may be used. Phenol was chosen as a bromine scavenger because it and its reaction product with bromine (bromophenols) are both substantially non-reactive with protected polypeptides, the mixture of polypeptides of the invention, and the mixture of TFA polypeptides of the invention, and they are easy to remove from the solution during the purification process. Similarly, any bromine scavenging agent may be used provided that it and its reaction product with bromine, are not reactive with protected polypeptides, the mixture of polypeptides of the invention, and the mixture of TFA polypeptides of the invention, and it is easily removable during the final purification process.","Pharmaceutical Form and Strength","A number of different strengths of the polypeptide mixture of the invention have been developed. Immunorecognition tests in vitro by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using anti-GA (glatiramer acetate) specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies which show high cross reactivity with the polypeptide mixture of the invention, serve the specific identification of the polypeptide mixture of the invention. The biological activity of the material is demonstrated by the ex vivo Potency Test and the in vivo EAE Blocking Test, both carried out on mice.","One out of three regular production batches of the polypeptide mixture of the invention displaying acceptable effect in the glutamate toxicity, intra-occular pressure, and TNBS models described herein was chosen to serve as the Reference. Material.","The material was not subjected to an additional purification process for its use as Reference Standard.","Sandwich ELISA Specific Biorecognition","The biological properties of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention were evaluated by immunorecognition tests using antibodies specific to GA. The immunorecognition of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific to GA was examined by ELISA. Several lab scale preparations of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention were screened and the % binding of antibodies to relevant epitopes was calculated relative to GA RS (100%). Immunorecognition above 100% binding was found, up to 122% and up to 113% bidnign for poly- and mono-clonal antibodies respectively.","The test batches of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention were identified by GA specific antibodies, indicating that GA and the mixture of polypeptides of the invention share similar B cell epitopes and that there is cross reaction between GA and the mixture of polypeptides of the invention. However, these identification ELISA tests were not quantitative and incapable of evaluating the relative amount of epitopes, hence batches of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention do not show significantly higher binding as compared to GA RS. Consequently, a more sensitive sandwich ELISA method has been developed, enabling a more quantitative evaluation. Results of batches of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention tested by sandwich ELISA are presented in .","The results showed that the amount of antibodies binding to the mixture of polypeptides of the invention were higher than that to GA, indicating higher-immunorecognition, corresponding to its higher immunogenicity, as shown in the EAE models and the ex-vivo potency tests.","A microtiter plate is coated with mouse anti-Glatiramer acetate (anti-GA) monoclonal antibody (MAb) (#4B5\/44 or #10F6\/32). After washing the excess unbound MAbs and blocking the exposed well surface, the polypeptide mixture of the invention reference standard (RS) or the tested polypeptide mixture of the invention drug substance (DS) batches are allowed to bind the bound anti-GA MAbs. Since the polypeptide mixture of the invention contains the same amino acid residues as GA, similar antigenic determinants are presented in both polypeptides. Therefore, the peptides of the polypeptide mixture of the invention are recognized by anti-GA antibodies in a specific manner. The binding of the polypeptide mixture of the invention to the antibodies is subsequently detected by biotin-conjugated goat anti-GA polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The results are expressed as the average of % binding deviation of the tested the polypeptide mixture of the invention DS and GA DS batches to the antibodies, relative to the binding of the polypeptide mixture of the invention RS batch. The extent of binding correlates with the amount of \u201cbio-recognizable\u201d material in the tested batch relative to the RS batch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0324","num":"0352"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00036","num":"00036"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"The Polypeptide Mixture Of The Invention:"},{"entry":"Sandwich ELISA, specific biorecognition test results."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Results*"]},{"entry":[{},"Data of GP-HPLC","% Binding deviation"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Drug Substance (DS)","MW at HPLC","MAbs","MAbs"]},{"entry":["Batch No.","peak max","10F6\/32","4B5\/44"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Polypeptide","1","(16,000 \u00b1 2,500","\u20024% (Pass)","\u20029% (Pass)"]},{"entry":["Mixture of","2","daltons) average for","\u20022% (Pass)","\u20024% (Pass)"]},{"entry":["the","3","all three batches","\u20023% (Pass)","\u20023% (Pass)"]},{"entry":"Invention"},{"entry":["GA","4","8050 daltons","37% (Fail)**","47% (Fail)"]},{"entry":[{},"5","8000 daltons","35% (Fail)**","45% (Fail)"]},{"entry":[{},"6","7100 daltons","41% (Fail)**","46% (Fail)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"The average of the % binding deviation values should not be more than 25%"},{"entry":"*% binding deviation relative to the polypeptide mixture of the invention RS"},{"entry":"**significantly poorer than the polypeptide mixture of the invention"}]}}]}}},"The polypeptide mixture of the invention is identified by the immunorecognition test and, as shown in Table 7, this method showed high selectivity to distinguish between the polypeptide mixture of the invention and GA batches.

On the day of glutamate injection (Day 0) male C57BL\/6J mice aged 1.5-2 months were anesthetized and each animal's right eye was punctured with a 27-gauge needle in the upper portion of the sclera. Next, a Hamilton syringe with a 30-gauge needle was inserted as far as the vitreal body and a total volume of 1 \u03bcl (200 nmol) of L-glutamate dissolved in saline was injected. Four days after the glutamate injection, the mice were anesthetized and a retrograde neurotracer dye (FluoroGold) was injected stereotactically into the superior colliculus of each hemisphere. From the superior colliculus the dye is retrogradely transported into RGCs. Three days later the animals were sacrificed, their eyes enucleated, and the retinas detached, fixed in paraformaldehyde and whole mounted on filters. Labelled cells from four selected fields of identical size were counted. The selected fields were located at approximately the same distance from the optic disk to overcome the variation in RGC density as a function of distance from the optic disc. RGCs were counted under a fluorescent microscope and the average number of RGCs per field in each retina was calculated.

In most cases, the mixture of polypeptides of the invention was found to be more immunogenic than GA.","Immunological Response to Weekly vs. Daily Injections in Mice (3 Week Study)","Based on the fact that the mixture of polypeptides of the invention was found to be more immunogenic than GA in-vivo, the effect of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention in administration schedule less frequent than that for GA was evaluated. An investigation was conducted to assess the immunological profile of a weekly administration of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention in mice vs. a daily administration of GA.

Mice were injected once a week (total of 3 injections) with the mixture of polypeptides of the invention (75 \u03bcg\/mouse) or daily with GA (75 \u03bcg\/mouse). During the study period which followed each of the injections, subsets of animals in each treatment group were sacrificed on days 4 and 7 of each week, spleens were excised and primary cell cultures were prepared. The effect of the treatment was tested by in vitro activation of splenocytes, and specific T-cell response was monitored by detection of cytokines secreted from activated cells. The results of IL-2 measurements are shown in .","Daily injections of GA or once-weekly injections of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention provided a similar immune response of GA-specific T cells, as evident by IL-2 secretion. Once-weekly injections of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention induced a strong IL-2 secretion after the first injection. This secretion decreased (\u201ctolerance\u201d) with repeated injections, in parallel with 7-10 daily injections of GA. No significant difference was observed between GA and the mixture of polypeptides of the invention administered once daily or once-weekly, respectively. The levels of additional cytokines, i.e. IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and IL-4, were examined throughout the tested three weeks. All cytokines determined in the spleen cultures showed similar pattern of initial peak, and a subsequent decline to steady low levels. An additional experiment testing the effect of nine consecutive weekly injections of the polypeptide mixture of the invention showed similar immunological response: a decrease in secretion of all cytokines after the third injection.","Neuroprotective Response in Glutamate Toxicity Model to Weekly Injections in Mice (9 Week Study)","Having shown the immunological response to weekly administration of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention, the effect of weekly repeated injections of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention on protection of RGCs from glutamate toxicity was tested. The mice were immunized by a sc injection of 75 \u03bcg\/mouse of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention, or 75 \u03bcg\/mouse GA, or PBS control administered once a week, nine consecutive injections from day \u221263 to day \u22127 prior to the induction of glutamate toxicity.  shows that 9 repeated injections, administered once a week, of 75 \u03bcg\/mouse of either GA RS or the reference standard of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention, provide a significant neuroprotective effect on RGC survival in the glutamate toxicity model. Repeated weekly injections of 75 \u03bcg of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention (\u02dc16,000 Daltons) showed a high and significant neuroprotective effect (p<0.01). Similarly, weekly administration of GA at the same dose level resulted in a good neuroprotective effect (p=0.05), though it was smaller as compared to the effect of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention. There was a very small placebo effect.","These data demonstrate that not only is the mixture of polypeptides of the invention effective when administered once weekly, in this administration schedule the mixture of polypeptides of the invention was more effective than GA, therefore supporting a weekly administration schedule for the mixture of polypeptides of the invention.","Discussion of Results","GA fractionation studies showed that peptides characterized by increased molecular size and hydrophobicity exhibit progressively higher effect in both in vivo and ex vivo tests, i.e. the higher the average molecular weight, the higher is the biological activity and immunogenicity. These studies established the basic rationale for the development of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention as an improved product for MS.","Indeed, the mixture of polypeptides of the invention showed increased relative potency ex vivo, antibodies specific to GA recognize the mixture of polypeptides of the invention and the interaction of the antibodies with the mixture of polypeptides of the invention yields a stronger signal in ELISA compared to that of GA, in correlation with an increase in MW of its peptides: the higher the average molecular weight the higher the immunogenicity and potency.","These results were in agreement with the effect of an increase in average molecular weight on activity in vivo in both acute and chronic EAE models. All batches of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention exhibited higher activity in the EAE blocking test, as compared to GA. At a dose as low as 100 \u03bcg\/mouse, batches of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention reduced the incidence of sick mice (increased % activity) and reduced the severity of the disease to a level similar to that conferred by GA RS at 250 \u03bcg\/mouse.","The mixture of polypeptides of the invention showed increased immunogenicity in vivo. A single injection of both GA and the mixture of polypeptides of the invention evoked immunological response, where the mixture of polypeptides of the invention was found to be more immunogenic than GA. The presence of an enhanced immunological response following administration of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention lent support to the hypothesis that the mixture of polypeptides of the invention evokes a beneficial T-cell response that mediates neuronal protection.","In agreement with enhanced immunogenicity in vivo of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention, in immunological studies in mice no significant difference was observed between GA and the mixture of polypeptides of the invention administered once daily or once-weekly, respectively. Daily injections of GA or once-weekly injections of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention provided a similar immune response of GA-specific T cells.","The studies of the neuroprotective effect of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention showed that active immunization with the mixture of polypeptides of the invention provides effective neuroprotection from glutamate toxicity, suggesting that the mixture of polypeptides of the invention is a neuroprotective agent that would have clinical benefits in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in which glutamate is a prominent participant such as MS, ALS, Huntington's Disease and glaucoma.","Taken together, these findings suggested that the mixture of polypeptides of the invention was efficacious when administered once weekly, was more efficacious than GA, and therefore can potentially confer a therapeutic effect in MS when administered at a lower frequency than GA, supporting weekly administration schedule for the mixture of polypeptides of the invention, and weekly, monthly or bimonthly administration in other neurological disorders.","In order to investigate whether a monthly treatment regimen (immunization) with the mixture of polypeptides of the invention would protect RGCs from glutamate-induced toxicity, mice were assigned to the following pre-insult treatment groups:\n\n","The mixture of polypeptides of the invention was dissolved in PBS and injected subcutaneously in the flank.","Results","The results of the study are displayed in  which shows the protective effects of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention on RGC survival in the immunized treatment groups.

The observed effect was higher in the group treated with monthly repeated administrations of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention at a dose of 75 \u03bcg\/mouse (35% protection) (p<0.01). The results of the above study show that immunization with the mixture of polypeptides of the invention provides effective neuroprotection from glutamate toxicity, suggesting that the mixture of polypeptides of the invention may have clinical benefits in the treatment of degenerative disorders in which glutamate is a prominent participant, e.g. glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Splenocytes were cultured and cytokine levels measured at several timepoints.","Results","Glutamate Toxicity results are shown in . The protection of the positive control group (GA at day \u22127) is relatively low (the expected result rendering an experiment valid for batch release is above 20-25%), which may be attributed to the \u201cold\u201d age of the mice. All the data collected in this model up-to-date is in 8-12 week old mice. However, relative to the positive control group of the experiment, all the treatment groups showed similar or higher % protection. Furthermore, the effect of bi-monthly administration of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention showed close to statistical significance (p=0.058).","It is important to note that both monthly (total of 6 injections) and bi-monthly (total of 3 injections) schedules of administration provide equal or greater protection than single injection at day \u22127, i.e. repeated injections in these frequencies are neuroprotective.","Immunology results are shown in , , and . IL-2 levels were measured following each injection. The results in  show a rapid rise and decline in the first cycle, as seen in previous experiments, followed by lower peaks in each of the five successive cycles. The current results confirm ability of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention to elicit a stronger T-cell response than GA. The results also confirm the ability of monthly treatment to boost the immune response, albeit at a level about half of the initial response. This response seems to be sufficient to maintain a neuroprotective effect. Bi-monthly injections of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention show the ability to boost the immune response following each injection, though at progressively lower levels ().  shows the TH1-TH-2 shift after several injections, showing a decrease in IFN-\u03b3 response and a stable if not rising IL-10 response.","The results also show that the immune response is maintained after each new injection, as indicated by the presence of a peak after each boost.","The effect of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention on RGC survival was tested in a rat model of chronically elevated IOP, a major risk factor in glaucoma.","Materials and Methods","A unilateral increase in IOP was induced in anesthetized male Lewis rats (aged 8 weeks) by laser photocoagulation of the limbal and episcleral veins. Rats received two laser cauterization treatments, one week apart. IOP was measured one week following the second laser treatment. The second laser treatment was followed two weeks later by application of a fluorescent retrograde neurotracer distally to the optic nerve head.

Additionally, glaucoma is characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, axon loss and an excavated appearance of the optic nerve head (Alward, \u201cMedical Management of Glaucoma\u201d, N Eng J Med, 1998; 339:1298-1307). Glaucoma can be diagnosed before vision loss occurs by visual field testing and by ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic nerve to detect \u201ccupping.\u201d The management of glaucoma is based on lowering the IOP to prevent further optic nerve damage. The mean IOP in normal adults is 15 to 16 mm Hg; the normal range is 10 to 21 mm Hg. The first step in the management of glaucoma is based on lowering the IOP using topically applied medications (Coleman, \u201cGlaucoma\u201d, Lancet, 1999; 354:1803-1810). Currently there are five major classes of medications that are used to lower the IOP: \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists, adrenergic agonists, parasympathomimetics, prostaglandin-like analogues and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (Medeiros, et al., \u201cMedical Backgrounders: Glaucoma\u201d, Drugs of Today 2002; 38:563-570). Although most medications are applied topically to the eye, they can cause severe systemic side effects and adversely affect the quality of the patient's life. If additional lowering of IOP is indicated or if medication fails to sufficiently lower the IOP, laser trabeculoplasty is usually the next step. If IOP is still not adequately controlled, incisional glaucoma surgery is indicated (Id). The lowering of IOP, although significantly reducing the extent of neuronal loss, does not ensure cessation of the disease process, because the loss of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) may continue. Recent studies of the association between IOP regulation and visual field loss after medical or surgical intervention showed that ongoing neuronal loss reflected in visual field tests can be diminished if the IOP is low. However, neuronal loss may continue to occur after reduction of IOP (Bakalash, et al., \u201cResistance of Retinal Ganglion Cells to an Increase in Intraocular Pressure is Immune-dependent\u201d, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2002; 43:2648-2653).","Glaucomatous optic neuropathy appears to result from specific pathophysiological changes and subsequent death of RGCs and their axons. The process of RGC death is thought to be biphasic: a primary injury responsible for initiation of damage followed by a slower, secondary degeneration attributable to the hostile environment surrounding the degenerating cells (Kipnis, et al., \u201cT Cell Immunity To Copolymer 1 Confers Neuroprotection On The Damaged Optic Nerve: Possible Therapy For Optic Neuropathies\u201d, Proc Natl Acad Sci 2000; 97:7446-7451).","RGC death mechanisms in experimental animal models of glaucoma and human glaucoma have been shown to involve apoptosis. Although the molecular mechanism triggering the apoptosis has not been identified, deprivation of neurotrophic factors, ischemia, chronic elevation of glutamate and disorganized nitric oxide metabolism are suspected to be possible mechanisms (Farkas, et al., \u201cApoptosis, Neuroprotection and Retinal Ganglion Cell Death: An Overview\u201d, Int Ophthalmol Clin 2001; 41:111-130). In addition, it would not be surprising if the mechanisms leading to RGC death shared common features with other types of neuronal injury, such as signaling by reactive oxygen species, depolarization of mitochondria, or induction of transcriptionally regulated cell death (Weinreb, et al., \u201cIs Neuroprotection a Viable Therapy for Glaucoma?\u201d Arch Ophthalmol 1999; 117:1540-1544).","It has been hypothesized that an excessive release of the excitatory amino acid glutamate in the retina may contribute to cell death. Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter in the retina, but when released in excess it can be toxic to RGCs. It is therefore essential that glutamate levels be tightly regulated within the retina. Glutamate toxicity seems to be mediated, at least in part, through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors that can allow entry of excessive amounts of calcium. The increase in intracellular calcium appears to activate the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, which generates reactive oxygen species. These free radicals ultimately destroy the cell. Neuronal ischemia has been proposed as the mechanism underlying the glutamate elevation observed in glaucoma (Sucher, et al., \u201cMolecular Basis of Glutamate Toxicity in Retinal Ganglion Cells\u201d, Vision Res 1997; 37:3483-3493; Osborne, et al., \u201cNeuroprotection in Relation to Retinal Ischemia and Relevance to Glaucoma\u201d, Survey of Ophthalmology 1999; 43(Supp 1):S102-S128).","In the brain, glutamate abnormalities have been implicated in a number of neurologic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy (Sucher, et al., \u201cMolecular Basis of Glutamate Toxicity in Retinal Ganglion Cells\u201d, Vision Res 1997; 37:3483-3493). Elevated glutamate concentrations have been found in the vitreous of patients with glaucoma and also in monkeys with experimental glaucoma (Dreyer, et al., \u201cElevated Glutamate Levels in the Vitreous of Humans and Monkeys with Glaucoma\u201d, Arch Ophthalmol 1996; 114:299-305). However, whether abnormalities of glutamate metabolism play a causative role in either primary glaucomatous RGC death or in secondary RGC degeneration remains uncertain.","In recent years there has been increasing interest in preventing progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy using approaches based on the premise that glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease (Fisher, et al., \u201cVaccination for Neuroprotection in the Mouse Optic Nerve: Implications for Optic Neuropathies\u201d, J Neurosci 2001; 21:136-142). Neuroprotection of the glaucomatous optic nerve would therefore be an adjunctive therapeutic paradigm for use with conventional IOP-lowering treatments (Schwartz, et al., \u201cPotential Treatment Modalities for Glaucomatous Neuropathy: Neuroprotection and Neurodegeneration\u201d, J. Glaucoma 1996; 5:427-432). Research led to the development of the concept of \u201cprotective autoimmunity\u201d, i.e. a physiological response in which auto-reactive T cells confer protection against neurodegeneration (Schwartz, et al., \u201cProtective Autoimmunity Against the Enemy Within: Fighting Glutamate Toxicity\u201d, Trends in Neurosciences, 2003; 26:297-302; Moalem, et al., \u201cAutoimmune T Cells Protect Neurons form Secondary Degeneration after Central Nervous System Axotomy\u201d, Nat Med 1999; 5:49-55).","Neuroprotection is a novel therapeutic paradigm for slowing or preventing degeneration and death of neurons to maintain their physiological function. An important advantage of the neuroprotective strategy is that it allows treatment of disease for which the specific etiology is either unknown or differs among patients. This is particularly relevant to the treatment of glaucoma where neuroprotection should be effective independently of whether a particular patient's glaucoma is due to primary or secondary disease mechanisms (Weinreb, et al., \u201cIs Neuroprotection a Viable Therapy for Glaucoma?\u201d, Arch Ophthalmol 1999; 117:1540-1544). Though significantly decreasing neuronal loss, the current IOP-lowering medications do not halt the progressive nature of glaucoma, and the loss of RGCs may continue even after the IOP has been reduced. Thus, the greatest unmet medical need in glaucoma is a therapeutic agent capable of protecting ocular tissue from continued degeneration.","Several approaches to neuroprotection in glaucoma have been proposed. A neuroprotective approach has been suggested which relies on delivering neurotrophins to the retina to compensate for the deprivation of target-derived neurotrophins resulting from blockade of retrograde axoplasmic transport (Weinreb, et al., \u201cIs Neuroprotection a Viable Therapy for Glaucoma?\u201d, Arch Ophthalmol 1999; 117:1540-1544). Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, reduced ganglion cell loss in a rat model of IOP-induced retinal ischemia (Lagreze, et al. \u201cMemantine is Neuroprotective in a Rat Model of Pressure-induced Retinal Ischemia\u201d, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 1998; 39:1063-1066) and is presently being tested in clinical trails with glaucoma patients (Vision Newsletter, Fall 2002, ucsfeye.net\/visionsfal02p2.shtml). In a rat model of high IOP, vaccination with Cop-1 significantly reduces the pressure-induced death of RGCs (Schwartz, \u201cNeurodegeneration and Neuroprotection in Glaucoma: Development of a Therapeutic Neuroprotective Vaccine: the Friedenwald Lecture\u201d, Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2003; 44:1407-1411; Bakalash, et al., \u201cAntigenic Specificity of Immunoprotective Therapeutic Vaccination for Glaucoma. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2003; 44:3374-3381; Schwartz M., \u201cNeuroprotection as a Treatment for Glaucoma: Pharmacological and Immunological Approaches\u201d, Eur J Ophthalmol 2003; 13:S27-31).","Recent investigations showed that neuroprotection of crush-injured rat optic nerves can be obtained by active immunization with GA on the day of injury and by adoptive transfer of GA-reactive T cells (Kipnis, et al., \u201cT Cell Immunity To Copolymer 1 Confers Neuroprotection on the Damaged Optic Nerve: Possible Therapy For Optic Neuropathies\u201d, Proc Natl Acad Sci 2000; 97:7446-7451). GA demonstrated neuroprotective properties in a glutamate-induced toxicity model in mice and in a rat model of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) by protecting the animals from RGC loss inflicted by intravitreal injection of glutamate (Schori et al., \u201cVaccination for Protection of Retinal Ganglion Cells Against Death From Glutamate Cytotoxicity and Ocular Hypertension: Implications for. Glaucoma\u201d, Proc Natl Acad Sci 2001; 98:3398-3403). Furthermore, in the rat ocular hypertension model, which simulates glaucoma, immunization with GA significantly reduced the RGC loss from 27.8% to 4.3%, without affecting the IOP (Id). Vaccination with GA resulted in significant neuroprotection in rat models of optic nerve crush and chronic glaucoma (Schwartz, \u201cVaccination for Glaucoma: Dream or Reality?\u201d, Brain Res Bull. 2004; 62(6):481-4).","GA-specific activated T cells are used to promote nerve regeneration or to prevent or inhibit the secondary degenerative effects which may follow primary nervous system injury or the effects of neurodegenerative processes caused by a disease or condition including glaucoma (U.S. Patent Application Publication 2002-0037848 A1, published Mar. 28, 2002 (Eisenbach-Schwartz et al.); U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003-0004099 A1, published Jan. 2, 2003 (Eisenbach-Schwartz et al.)).","Multiple Sclerosis","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of myelin (demyelination) in the central nervous system. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR MS) is the most common form of the disease at time of initial diagnosis (Noseworthy, et al., \u201cMultiple Sclerosis\u201d, N Engl J Med 2000; 343:938-952). Although RR MS patients typically have mild manifestations between relapses initially, nearly 60% experience a secondary progressive course 15 years after diagnosis. This proportion increases to 90% at 25 years after disease onset, which leaves the majority of patients disabled at a relatively young age (Bjartmar, et al., \u201cPathological Mechanisms and Disease Progression of Multiple Sclerosis: Therapeutic Implications\u201d, Drugs of Today 2002; 38:17-29).","The prevalence of MS varies considerably around the world. (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, available at nationalmssociety.org) The prevalence is highest in northern Europe, southern Australia and the middle part of North America. Worldwide, MS may affect 2.5 million individuals. The reasons for the variation in the prevalence and incidence of MS worldwide are not understood. Environmental and genetic explanations have been offered, and both factors probably have a role. Typically, patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50. MS is found in two to three times as many women as men. The basis for this difference is unknown (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, nationalmssociety.org).","The management of MS has been substantially advanced by the availability of four injectable disease-modifying agents: interferon beta-1b (Betaseron\u00ae), interferon beta-1a intramuscular (Avonex\u00ae) and interferon beta-1a subcutaneous (Rebif\u00ae) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone\u00ae). After several years of experience with these immunomodulatory drugs, it is the consensus that these agents reduce future disability and improve the quality of life for many individuals with R-R MS. It is thus recommended that immunomodulatory therapy should begin shortly after R-R MS diagnosis and continue for many years. (Freedman M S, Blumhardt L D, Brochet B, Comi G, Noseworthy J H, Sandberg-Wollheim M, Soelberg S\u00f8rensen P and the Paris Workshop Group. International consensus statement on the use of disease-modifying agents in multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis 2002; 8:19-23.)","The choice of the specific agent remains highly dependent on the physician's opinion of its relative potency and the patient's anticipated tolerance to treatment-related side effects. Copaxone\u00ae is generally well tolerated and may be most effective for mildly disabled patients with a recent diagnosis of MS who wish to start treatment early in the course of the illness (Noseworthy, et al., \u201cMultiple Sclerosis\u201d, N Engl J Med 2000; 343:938-952).","Recent experimental evidence implicates glutamate, the major neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, as an important contributing factor in MS pathogenesis. Glutamate levels had been found to be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients, and its concentration is associated with the severity and course of the disease. This excitotoxicity, secondary to autoimmunity, could indeed underlie a substantial part of the lesions observed in MS (Matute, et al., \u201cThe Link Between Excitotoxic oligodendroglial Death and Demyelinating Diseases\u201d, Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24:224-30; Gilgun-Sherki, et al., \u201cRiluzole Suppresses Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis: Implications for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis\u201d, Brain Res. 2003; 989:196-204).","Based on the foregoing, two clinical trials are being undertaken.","Glaucoma Clinical Trial","A multi-center, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, three-arm study to assess the tolerability, safety and the efficacy of subcutaneous injections of the mixture of polypeptides of the invention in patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy at high risk to progress.
