{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Wireless networking technologies offer users the convenience of mobility and ease of connection to a network. Users not only employ mobile devices to connect people in real-time for personal use, e.g., family, friends, but also for business applications as well. Thus, mobile devices are routinely utilized to enable communications among employees who may be scattered across the globe; e.g., doctors to their patients, students to their teachers, etc. With the advances in broadband technologies, service providers have offered a number of sophisticated services, including video conferencing. Unfortunately, traditional video communication schemes communicate in real-time from single user perspective, e.g., a perspective captured by a camera. That is, users may need to be mindful to record images that provide an effective view of the user, e.g., configure camera zoom to show facial features. Further, users are unable to interact with virtual collaboration information, e.g., slide show, virtual whiteboard, and the like using customary body gestures, e.g., pointing at features, covering features. Consequently, inefficiencies in conducting video communications result, along with an increasingly burdensome user experience.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach that conveniently and efficiently connects people in real-time.","An apparatus, method and software for providing virtual conferencing are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Although the various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to mobile devices including cellular phones, it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to other types of computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, web appliances, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","101"]},"The virtual conferencing services may, for instance, be initiated using one or more user devices (e.g., mobile devices  (or mobile devices -)) over one or more networks (e.g., data network , telephony network , wireless network , service provider network , etc.). According to one embodiment, services including virtual conferencing may be part of managed services supplied by a service provider (e.g., a wireless communication company) as a hosted or subscription-based service made available to users of the mobile devices  through a service provider network . For instance, conference platform  can process a request from mobile device to initiate virtual conferencing. The request for virtual conference may include the use of a graphical user interface (GUI) configured to create a virtual conference, invite other users (or subscribers) to join, and collect preference information such as a desired virtual environment and avatar. Alternatively, the request for a virtual conference may cause the virtual conference platform  to initiate a request to join a virtual conference along with a request for preference information. It is contemplated that preference information may also be stored on the virtual conference platform .","As shown, the virtual conference platform  may be a part of or connected to the service provider network . According to another embodiment, the virtual conference platform  may be included within or connected to the mobile devices , a computing device , etc. While specific reference will be made thereto, it is contemplated that the system  may embody many forms and include multiple and\/or alternative components and facilities. Conference platform  can provide virtual conferencing to facilitate, for example, a business meeting, an anniversary dinner, a virtual classroom, a virtual hospital, and the like.","In certain embodiments, the virtual conference platform  may include or have access to virtual environments, whereby the data and parameters for creating such environment is stored in a virtual environment database . Each virtual environment integrates images of users for particular uses (e.g., round table discussion, slide show presentation, etc.) Additionally, groups (e.g., corporations, schools, family) may customize virtual environments to include names, slogans, familiar items and the like. For example, the virtual conference platform  may access the virtual environment database  to acquire data specifying, e.g., a company logo to be utilized in virtual conferences for company employees.","In certain embodiments, the virtual conference platform  accesses an avatar database  to populate users in a virtual environment. An avatar is used in creating a graphical representation of a human user to enable users to communicate using body language, and to interact with collaboration information. An avatar may correspond to movements of part of the user (e.g., face, head, etc.) or the entire user. For example, the virtual conference platform  may generate a skeletal map of each user to map movements onto the avatar. Additionally, the avatar may display images of the user (e.g., mapping user's face onto avatar) or use images associated with the avatar (e.g., profile picture, name, symbol, etc.). Further, the avatar may display information unique to the user, for example, personal slogans, titles, awards, geolocation, status and the like.","As mentioned, typical video conferencing systems rely on a single user perspective. That is, users are viewable only from a perspective captured by the camera. Additionally, such systems do not easily facilitate a group meeting, and result in inefficiencies as well as a burdensome experience. For example, images of multiple users in a group meeting are frequency tiled together making it difficult to show collaboration information (e.g., slide, whiteboard), particularly on smaller screens (which is typical of mobile devices\u2014e.g., smart phones). Additionally, this tiling of images is particularly inefficient and burdensome when the group discussion is focused on a single speaker because much of the display can be focused away from the single speaker. Also, the tiling of user images limits the ability for users to communicate using body language to interact (e.g., point at other users, collaboration images, etc.).","To address this issue, the system  of  introduces the capability to integrate a representation of a user onto an avatar located within a virtual environment using a virtual conference platform. The avatar can be configured to normalize the representation of users by managing scale, contrast, lighting, topographic relief and the like to enable multiple user perspectives. The virtual environment can be configured to support multiple uses (e.g., round table discussion, slide show presentation) and customizable by users (e.g., names, slogans, familiar items). Additionally, the virtual environment can include collaboration information that is accessible to users (and avatars) to enable such users to interface (e.g., view, modify, remove, etc.) the collaboration information.","By way of example, mobile device  users can benefit from the services of virtual conference platform , whereby images representing a user (e.g., video recording of facial features) can be placed on an avatar located in a virtual environment viewable by other users of a group. For instance, user of mobile device  can be provided with an avatar and virtual environment stored in a virtual conference platform ; in addition, multiple avatars representing multiple users can be used in this virtual environment. In certain embodiments, the virtual conference platform  includes a variety of virtual environments to support various types of meetings, such as single speaker, round-table discussions, presentation of slides, panel discussions and the like to efficiently combine multiple users in different contexts. Further, the virtual conference platform  can be configured to integrate body language of users onto the avatars to enable interaction between users and to support the use of collaboration information by incorporating the collaboration information in the virtual environment. The users may then cause avatars to point at or conceal portions of the collaboration information.","By way of example, mobile devices  may be any type of mobile terminal including a mobile handset, mobile station, mobile unit, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, communicator, netbook, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), smartphone, media receiver, etc. It is also contemplated that the mobile devices  may support any type of interface for supporting the presentment or exchange of data. For example, the mobile device  may facilitate various output means, including image\/pico projectors (e.g., projecting images on a desk or screen), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, plasma display and the like. In addition, mobile devices  may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information, including a camera, touch screen capability, keyboard and keypad data entry, voice-based input mechanisms, accelerometer (e.g., shaking the mobile device ), and the like. Any known and future implementations of mobile devices  are applicable. Also, connectivity may be provided via a wireless local area network (LAN). By way of example, a group of mobile devices  may be configured to a common LAN so that each device can be uniquely identified via any suitable network addressing scheme. For example, the LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign \u201cprivate\u201d DHCP internet protocol (IP) addresses to each mobile device , i.e., IP addresses that are accessible to devices connected to the service provider network  as facilitated via a router.","In some embodiments, the virtual conference platform , the mobile devices , and other elements of the system  may be configured to communicate via the service provider network . According to certain embodiments, one or more networks, such as the data network , the telephony network , and\/or the wireless network , may interact with the service provider network . The networks - may be any suitable wireline and\/or wireless network, and be managed by one or more service providers. For example, the data network  may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, such as a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. For example, computing device  may be any suitable computing device, such as a VoIP phone, skinny client control protocol (SCCP) phone, session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, IP phone, personal computer, softphone, workstation, terminal, server, etc. The telephony network  may include a circuit-switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a private branch exchange (PBX), or other like network. For instance, voice station  may be any suitable plain old telephone service (POTS) device, facsimile machine, etc. Meanwhile, the wireless network  may employ various technologies including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), long term evolution (LTE), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), mobile ad hoc network (MANET), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","Although depicted as separate entities, the networks - may be completely or partially contained within one another, or may embody one or more of the aforementioned infrastructures. For instance, the service provider network  may embody circuit-switched and\/or packet-switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communications. It is further contemplated that the networks - may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of the system . In this manner, the networks - may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 7 and 8"],"b":["101","101","100","101","201","203","205","207","209","211"]},"The provisioning module  may deliver mobile content to the mobile device  to enable virtual conferencing. The provisioning module  may also update, for example, the version, language settings, or type of installation for the virtual conference platform .","The user account module  may work with the mobile device  to provide secure access to a user's data. Secure access may be provided by the use of an authentication procedure such as an inputting of credentials, biometric authentication, and the like. User data can include preference information, contact information (e.g., group associations, friends, family and the like), and conferencing information (e.g., collaboration information, playback, etc.) and the like. It is contemplated that a user account module  may be configured to accept user availability information, schedule virtual conferences, send reminders\/updates, and the like in order to facilitate the scheduling of a virtual conference.","Preference information may include information regarding default parameters (e.g., preferred avatar, preferred virtual environment, preferred perspective etc.), a default representation of a user (e.g., profile picture), and whether to include or exclude the representation of the user in the user's own perspective. The default representation of a user may be displayed in the contact information associated with the user, and also displayed on an avatar. As noted, the virtual conference platform  may allow a user to select whether to include or exclude the representation of the user in the user's own perspective. For example, an active participant (e.g., user presenting slides, leading a discussion, etc.) may select to include the representation of the user in order to interact with the virtual environment. On the other hand, inactive participants (e.g., viewer, audience, etc.) may select to exclude the representation of the user to reserve more room in the virtual environment to view the active participants.","Contact information may include associations with individual users, groups of users (e.g., corporations, organizations, families, friends, etc.). Such associations may provide access to avatars and\/or virtual environments that are customized for a particular group (e.g., corporate logo). For example, a corporation may grant a user access to a customized virtual environment that includes a corporate logo or slogan. Additionally, a group may provide a user access to customized avatars. For example, a corporation may grant a user access to customized avatars that indicate corporate titles (e.g., associate, manager, etc.), awards (e.g., sale leader, employee of the month, etc.), and geolocation.","Conferencing information may include collaboration information, playback information, and the like. As used herein, collaboration information refers to text documents (e.g., MICROSOFT WORD, EMACS, OPEN OFFICE), presentation programs (e.g., MICROSOFT POWERPOINT, GOOGLE DOCS, OPEN OFFICE, APPLE KEYNOTE), image files (e.g., raster, vector, stereo), video files (e.g., H.263, MPEG), computer aided drafting (e.g., AUTOCAD, SOLID EDGE). It is contemplated that the collaboration information may be stored on one or more networks (e.g., data network , telephony network , wireless network , service provider network , etc.) accessible by the virtual conference platform . The virtual conference platform  may be configured to receive collaboration information (e.g., receive data, or receive information indicating a location data may be retrieved), incorporate modifications from users, and provide users access to the collaboration information. By way of example, a user inputs into a mobile device a location that a presentation file may be retrieved, the virtual conference platform  then retrieves and displays the presentation file into a virtual environment. The presentation file may then be modified by users, and made available after the conference session has ended. It is contemplated that the virtual conference platform may only allow collaboration information to be modified by some of the users, for example, attendees, premium subscribers, presenters, and the like. Additionally, the virtual conference platform  may be configured to record a virtual conference to enable playback of the virtual conference. In this manner, users (attendees or premium subscribers) may access the virtual conference platform to playback a previous virtual conference.","According to one embodiment, conference platform  may include a virtual environment module  to provide virtual environments associated with a particular use (e.g., business meeting, anniversary dinner, virtual teaching, virtual doctor, etc.) of virtual conferencing between multiple users of the mobile devices . In addition, virtual environments may also provide users the ability to select configurations of objects within the virtual environment to facilitate discussion. For example, the virtual environment may include a conference table and integrate images representing users around the table to facilitate a group discussion. In another embodiment, the virtual environment includes a group of designated users (e.g., panel speakers) to facilitate a panel presentation. Virtual environments may include an area associated with collaboration information (e.g., slide show, white board) to allow users to share, and modify information in real-time. It is contemplated that users may customize a virtual environment to include personal slogans, corporate logos, representations of familiar items and the like.","Virtual environments may be generated and provided as part of managed services supplied by a service provider (e.g., a wireless communication company) as a hosted or subscription-based service made available to users of the mobile devices  through a service provider network . Additionally, Virtual environments may be generated and\/or modified by others, including users of the mobile devices , and users of the computing device . Likewise, virtual environments may be public and accessible to users of the virtual conference platform , or may be accessible to limited group of users of the virtual conference platform . For example, some virtual environments may be accessible to premium subscribers, or members of a group associated with the virtual environment (e.g., employees, students, family, etc.)","According to one embodiment, conference platform  may include an avatar module  configured represent users in the virtual environment. In one embodiment, the virtual conference platform  integrates an image representing a user's face on the head of an avatar. In another embodiment, the virtual conference platform  maps a user's face on the head of an avatar and updates the avatar's body to represent the user's movement. The avatars may be static (e.g., a single image), or dynamic (e.g., real-time images representing the user). Additionally, avatars may be animated. It is contemplated that a static avatar may be selected by users lacking access to a recording device (e.g., camera). Avatars may be scaled based on a selected environment, and participants. By way of example, a selected avatar may be scaled larger when fewer participants, and\/or when fewer objects (e.g., collaboration information, tables, etc.) are displayed in a perspective. Similarly, images representing users that are mapped onto avatars may be normalized. By way of example, an image representing a first user may be larger than an image representing a second user due to a difference in recording resolution, zoom, distance from the recording device and the like. Avatars representing users modifying or adding collaboration information may be also emphasized (e.g., increase contrast, increase brightness, topographical relief) or may be modified to include additional objects (e.g., writing utensil).","Similar to virtual environments, avatars may be generated and provided as part of managed services supplied by a service provider (e.g., a wireless communication company) as a hosted or subscription-based service made available to users of the mobile devices  through a service provider network . Additionally, avatars may be generated and\/or modified by others, including users of the mobile devices , and users of the computing device . Avatars may be made available publicly, and thus, accessible to users of the virtual conference platform , or may be accessible to limited group of users of the virtual conference platform  (e.g., premium subscribers, authorized users). Additionally, avatars may be customized to indicate corporate titles (e.g., associate, manager, etc.), awards (e.g., sale leader, employee of the month, etc.) and geolocation.","According to one embodiment, conference platform  may include an integration module  for generating output information for each user in a virtual video conference. The integration module  may incorporate collaboration information, images representing users, a virtual environment, avatars and the like to generate, in real-time, a point of view for each user's perspective. For example, the integration module  may receive images from representing a user, and map those images on an avatar included in outputs to other users. That is, each user in the virtual conference shares a virtual environment, and collaboration information, but has a unique perspective (e.g., excludes image representing self). In another embodiment, non-participating users (e.g., audience, viewers, etc.) share a single perspective, and the participating users (e.g., lecturers, panel group, etc.) share a single perspective. For example, users identified as an audience of a slide show may have a perspective that includes a speaker and the slide show, while the speaker may have a perspective that includes the audience and the slide show. In this manner, the perspective in the virtual conference may be configured to be similar to a perspective in a real conference. Additionally, integration module  may be configured to record one or more of the perspectives to enable playback of the virtual conference.","Integration module  may also allow users (or attendees) without mobile devices to participate in the virtual conference. In one embodiment, the virtual conference platform  is configured to allow users to join (or create) a virtual conference using a computing device  configured with a webcam and microphone. In another embodiment, the virtual conference platform  is configured to allow users to join (or create) a virtual conference using voice station  (e.g., suitable plain old telephone service (POTS) device, facsimile machine). As noted, it is contemplated that users lacking a video recording device may be represented in a virtual environment by an avatar containing a static image of representing the user.","Integration module  may also allow users to select or manage their perspective by sending a request to the virtual conference platform . By way of example, a user may use a graphical user interface (GUI) to input a request to remove or add avatars, collaboration material, objects, and the like from their perspective. Additionally, or alternatively, a user may use a graphical user interface to input a request to manage zoom, angle\/field of view, and the like.","The virtual conference platform  may further include a communication interface  to communicate with other components of the virtual conference platform , the mobile devices , and other components of system . The communication interface  may include multiple means of communication. For example, the communication interface  may be able to communicate, over short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), internet protocol, instant messaging, voice sessions (e.g., via a phone network), email, or other types of communication. Additionally, communication interface  may include a web portal accessible by, for example, mobile device , computing device  and the like.","It is contemplated that to prevent the unauthorized access, conference platform  may include an authentication identifier when transmitting signals to mobile devices . For instance, control messages may be encrypted, either symmetrically or asymmetrically, such that a hash value, for instance, can be utilized to authenticate received images, as well as ensure that those signals have not been impermissibly detected in transit. As such, communications between the mobile devices  and conference platform  may include various identifiers, keys, random numbers, random handshakes, digital signatures, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","301","101","103","103","101","303","103","305","101","101","101"],"i":["a","n","a"]},"Once the virtual environment is selected, the virtual conference platform  may, as in step , receive, in real-time, images representing users of the respective mobile devices. For example, a camera located on a mobile device may record images of a respective user and send the images to the virtual conference platform . It is contemplated that a forward facing camera may be used to allow users to simultaneously record images and view information on a display located on the mobile device. Additionally, or alternatively, a forward facing camera may be used to allow users to simultaneously record images and view information projected by a pico projector located on the mobile device.","Once the images representing users are received, the virtual conference platform  may, as in step , modify the images based on the selected virtual environment. By way of example, the virtual conference platform  may detect a representation of a user in the received images, remove the background, and render the representation of the user on a background associated with the selected virtual environment. Additionally, the virtual conference platform  may also normalize the size of images representing users due to a difference in recording resolution, zoom, distance from the recording device and the like. As noted, the virtual conference platform  may also render a static image to represent users, for example, users using a plain old telephone service, or mobile device lacking a camera.","Next, the virtual conference platform  may, as in step , select one or more avatars based on the selected virtual environment. That is, the virtual conference platform  selects one or more avatars associated with a virtual environment. By way of example, the virtual conference platform  may select a single avatar representing a designated user (e.g., a speaker\/presenter) for a virtual environment with a single presenter (other users are not represented by an avatar). In another example, the virtual conference platform  may select an avatar for each user for a virtual environment configured for a conference table discussion. It is contemplated that the selection of an avatar may also be based on an input detected on one or more mobile devices. In one embodiment, the virtual conference platform  selects a group of avatars available, and each user selects an avatar. In another embodiment, the virtual conference platform  selects a group of avatars available, each user selects a preferred avatar, and the virtual conference platform  selects the avatar with the most votes for each user. It is contemplated that each groups or type of users (e.g., non-participating, and participating) may vote for an avatar to be used for that group or type of users.","Once the avatars have been selected, the virtual conference platform  may, as in step , map a portion of one or more of the images onto the one or more avatars. That is, the images representing a user (and modified) are placed onto one or more avatars. In one embodiment, the images representing a user are mapped to a single avatar. In another embodiment, an avatar contains images representing multiple users. In yet another embodiment, the images representing a single user is mapped onto multiple avatars. After mapping a portion of one or more of the images onto one the one or more avatars, the virtual conference platform  may, as in step , integrate the images into the selected virtual environment. That is, the images mapped onto an avatar may be placed (or made viewable) into the virtual environment. By way of example, the avatars with the images are placed in a round table near collaboration information to enable the users to interact with each other and the collaboration information. Next, the virtual conference platform  may, as in step , send, in real-time, images relating to the video conferencing session. As previously noted, conference platform  may be configured to send each user a different perspective of the virtual conference based on an automated perspective (e.g., update the leaving or entering of other users), and\/or a managed perspective (e.g., add or remove avatars or objects, change scale, angle of view, etc.) Additionally, or alternatively, users may receive a perspective based on their participation in the discussion (e.g., presenter views the audience, and the audience views the presenter).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","401","101","101","101","101"]},"The virtual conference platform  then selects, as in step , an image representing a designated user based on the detected input. For example, the virtual conference platform  may select the images received (and modified) from the designated user. Once the virtual conference platform  selects an image, it renders, as in step , the image representing the designated user with an emphasis added. By way of example, the emphasis may include effects using lighting, contrast, topographical relief and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","500","501","101","101","101","503","101","101","505","101","101","507"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6D","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6D"],"b":["103","103","103","103"]},"As illustrated in , an exemplary graphical user interface  is implemented using a mobile device  (e.g., mobile device ), wherein the mobile device  displays on a touch sensitive display  a banner , virtual environments , , , and selectable options , , .

Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to computer-readable storage medium ((or non-transitory)\u2014i.e., non-volatile media and volatile media), and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","800","800","800","800"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real-time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. For example, a graphics processing unit (GPU) may be included to facilitate the rendering of images.
