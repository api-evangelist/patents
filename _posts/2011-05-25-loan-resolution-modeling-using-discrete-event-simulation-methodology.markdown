title: Loan resolution modeling using discrete event simulation methodology
abstract: Systems, methods, and computer program products are provided for customer loan lifecycle modeling using discrete event simulation methodology. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) allows for modeling to occur at the customer and/or account level, such that the process captures customer-specific or loan-specific attributes/exposure factors, such as, but not limited to, credit score(s), House Price Index (HPI), loan product type, unemployment rates, interest rates and the like. Such modeling takes into the account that loan events occur at random paces and are typically dependent on ancillary factors, such as, availability of financial resources, market demand, customer attributes and the like, which all tend to be stochastic by nature.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["In general, embodiments herein disclosed relate to financial institution loan management and, more specifically loan resolution modeling using discrete event simulation methodologies.","Currently financial institution customer loan resolution modeling is conducted at the aggregate level. Aggregate level modeling assumes that a certain segment of the overall loan population behaves a certain way and based on those behaviors predicts how that segment will behave for the area of interest. For loan resolution modeling, aggregate level processing, determines how a specific segment of the overall financial customer population is likely to resolve the loan within a predefined period of time.","In loan resolution, many events may occur within the life of the loan, for example, events related to the current\/late state of the loan, such as staying current on loan payment, becoming late on loan payment and events related to servicing of the loan, such as modification\/short sale of the loan, a bankruptcy by the customer, foreclosure\/Real Estate Owned (REO), becoming the potential workout population and the like. Each of these events tend to occur at random times throughout the life of the loan and may depend on other factors, such as availability of financial resources, market demand, and customer attributes, which are also stochastic by nature.","Therefore, a need exists to develop systems, methods, computer program products and the like which model loan resolution at the individual customer and\/or account level as opposed to at the aggregate level. Such loan resolution modeling needs to be able to capture the stochastic nature of the events that occur within the loan lifecycle. The desired solution should take into account not only the randomness of the events but also the complexity, interdependency and importance of timing.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments.

The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more embodiments. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various embodiments may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such embodiments and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more embodiments. It may be evident; however, that such embodiment(s) may be practiced without these specific details. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Various embodiments or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, and the like and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules and the like discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","The steps and\/or actions of a method or algorithm described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium may be coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. Further, in some embodiments, the processor and the storage medium may reside in an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a computing device. Additionally, in some embodiments, the events and\/or actions of a method or algorithm may reside as one or any combination or set of codes and\/or instructions on a machine-readable medium and\/or computer-readable medium, which may be incorporated into a computer program product.","In one or more embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored or transmitted as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage medium may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures, and that can be accessed by a computer.

For example, if software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. \u201cDisk\u201d and \u201cdisc\u201d, as used herein, include compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs usually reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Thus, methods apparatus systems and computer program products are described herein that provide for loan lifecycle modeling using Discrete Event Simulation Methodology. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a dynamic simulation process in which the operation of a system (in this instance, resolution of a loan) is represented by a sequence of event. Each event occurs at an instant in time, thus the discrete aspect of the simulation and marks a change of state in the resolution of the loan. In specific embodiments of the invention, the events that result in a change in state are financial institution-related events, such as changes in loan lateness status or changes in loan servicing status. The result of the loan resolution processing of the present invention is a prediction, based on a predetermined probability that an event will occur, of the future state of the loan during the ensuing predetermined time interval (e.g., the next month). The future state of the loan may be the same state as the current state of the loan or the loan may move in terms of lateness status and\/or servicing status. As such, the loan resolution modeling of the present invention, allows for modeling to occur at the customer and\/or account level, such that the process captures customer-specific or loan-specific attributes\/exposure factors, such as, but not limited to, credit score(s), House Price Index (HPI), loan product type, unemployment rates, interest rates and the like. Further, such loan modeling takes into account that loan events occur at random paces and are typically dependent on ancillary factors, such as, availability of financial resources, market demand, customer attributes and the like, which all tend to be stochastic by nature. Such modeling and understanding of the customer relationship lifecycle and specifically in terms of loan resolution lifecycle, provides financial institutions tremendous opportunities for making informed management decisions that impact customer service.","Referring to , a block diagram is presented of an apparatus  configured to provide loan resolution predictions using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) processing, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The apparatus includes a computing platform  having a processor  and a memory  in communication with the processor . The memory  of apparatus  stores loan resolution application  which is executable by processor  and configured to identify the current loan state for one or more financial institution loans and predict, using DES processing, the future state of a loan for a predetermined time interval, such as a month in the future or the like, based on the current loan state.","In specific embodiments of the invention, loan resolution modeling is conducted by a financial institution or other loan providing entity on a regular schedule, such as monthly or the like, such that the financial institution or other loan providing entity can predict where the loan will reside in the future, for example, where the loan will reside a month from now, in terms of lateness and\/or servicing status. In such embodiments, the financial institution or other loan providing entity typically conducts loan resolution modeling on the entire loan population, or a significant portion of the loan population, such as all consumer loans or the like. In other embodiments of the invention, it may be possible and advantageous to conduct loan resolution modeling on a small subset of loans or one specific loan to predict the future state of the subset of loans or single loan. The subset of loans being identified based on any loan criteria as defined by the user.","In those embodiments in which the entire loan population or a significant portion of the loan population is modeled for loan resolution in accordance with the methodology herein disclosed, the result of the process is a specific predicted future loan state for each specific loan in the overall population. It should be noted that in those embodiments of the invention in which the predictions are based solely on historical aggregated loan data (i.e., not based on customer\/account-specific data), the resulting specific predicted future loan state for each specific loan is used by the financial institution or loan providing entity for the overall management\/forecasting of the loan portfolio and not for the purpose of taking specific action at the account or customer level. This is because that while the result of the process is a predicted state at the loan-level, i.e., a prediction for each loan account in the overall portfolio, the assignment of a specific predicted future loan state is random.","As previously mentioned, in specific embodiments of the invention future loan state predictions are based, solely or in part, on historical aggregated loan data. The historical aggregated loan data may include both dynamic predictive variables and static predictive variable. Example of dynamic predictive variables include, but are not limited to, interest rates, unemployment rates, Market-to-Market Combined Loan-to-Value (MCLTV), Home Price Index (HPI), home price momentum, loan age, payment shock and the like. Examples of static predictive variables include, but are not limited to, credit scores, such as Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores and the like, origination Loan-to-Value (LTV), origination CLTV, loan age, loan product type, household income, occupancy status, loan purpose, loan size, amortization term, property type, number of borrowers associated with the loan and the like. In other alternate embodiments of the invention, future loan state predictions may additionally be based on account-specific or customer-specific loan data, such as specific loan account performance data, specific customer profile data or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","102"]},"The apparatus  includes computing platform  that may be configured to transmit data across a network, and that can receive and execute routines and applications, such as loan resolution application . Computing platform  includes memory , which may comprise volatile and nonvolatile memory such as read-only and\/or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computing platforms. Further, memory  may include one or more flash memory cells, or may be any secondary or tertiary storage device, such as magnetic media, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","Further, computing platform  also includes processor , which may be an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), or other chipset, processor, logic circuit, or other data processing device.

For example, processing subsystems allow for initiating and maintaining communications, and exchanging data, with other networked devices. For the disclosed embodiments, processing subsystems of processor  may include any subsystem used in conjunction with loan resolution application .","In accordance with specific embodiments, the loan resolution application  includes data initialization module , loan mitigation module , loan weave module  and loan resolution module . In such embodiments of the invention multiple modules may be necessary to segment out primary probability drivers. For example, in the loan mitigation module , the lateness status is the primary probability driver and only one servicing status (i.e., bankruptcy) is tracked. In the loan weave module  both the loan's lateness status and the servicing status are tracked, while in the loan resolution module  only the loan's servicing status is tracked via the month leading into that particular servicing status.","Data initialization module  is configured to receive or assess current loan account data and, in some embodiments, planned new loan account data to identify the current loan state for one or more financial institution loans. Planned new loan account data includes data related to loans that have been processed but which will be opened during the ensuing prediction period (e.g., the ensuing month or the like). In specific embodiments in which loan resolution predictions are determined on a predetermined schedule, such as monthly or the like, the data initialization module  is configured to receive\/assess the current and planned loan account data on a likewise predetermined schedule, such as month-end or the like, to identify the current loan state for each loan account in the financial institution or loan providing entity's loan portfolio.","Loan mitigation module  is configured to predict future loan states for loan accounts identified as having a current loan state of less than 90 days late. For example, loan mitigation module  may be configured to predict future loan states for new\/proposed loan accounts, current loan accounts, 30 day late loan accounts, 60 day late loan accounts and the like. , discussed infra. provides details related to exemplary future loan states, otherwise referred to as migration segmentations, resulting from executing the loan migration module .","Loan weave module  is configured to predict future loan states for loans accounts identified as having a current loan state between ninety (90) days and one-hundred and seventy-nine (179) days late. For example, loan weave module  may be configured to predict future loan states for ninety (90) day late loan accounts, one-hundred and twenty (120) day late loan accounts and one-hundred and fifty (150) day late loan accounts. In such embodiments of the invention, the loan weave module may be further configured to consider both lateness status and servicing status simultaneously. Lateness status refers to the number of days that the loan is account is late, while servicing status refers to whether an action has been taken on the loan account, such as foreclosure, bankruptcy, modification, workout, short sale or the like. , discussed infra. provides details related to exemplary future loan states, otherwise referred to as weave segmentations, resulting from executing the loan weave module .","Loan resolution module  is configured to predict future loan states for loan accounts identified as having a current loan state of greater than or equal to one-hundred and eighty (180) days late. , discussed infra. provides details related to exemplary future loan states, otherwise referred to as resolution segmentations, resulting from executing the loan resolution module .","Turning the reader's attention to , a block diagram of a data initialization module  included within the loan resolution application  is depicted. The initialization module  includes inventory data initialization  configured to read-in\/assess actual current loan account inventory data to identify the current loan state of one or more, typically all, of the currently inventoried loan accounts. Additionally, data initialization module  includes new production schedule  configured to readin\/assess scheduled new loan account data for scheduled new loan accounts which may be scheduled to open during the ensuing prediction time period, for example, scheduled to open in the ensuing month or the like.
