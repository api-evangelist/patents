title: Systems and methods for determining an objective security assessment for a network of assets
abstract: A security assessment tool can determine computer assets in a network and provide an overall security score for the network. The overall security score can represent an objective measure of the security of the network that considers potential security threats to the computer assets, counter measures deployed in the network to address the potential security threats, and the effectiveness of the counter measures. Based on the overall security assessment, the security assessment tool can provide recommendations for improving the security of the network.

No. 13\/899,117 filed May 21, 2013, entitled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ASSESSING SECURITY FOR A NETWORK OF ASSETS AND PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS\u201d by Chad Loder, Dana Elizabeth Wolf, and Matthew Robert Hathaway, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","In today's distributed computing environments, security is of the utmost importance. Due to the rise of wide-area public networks, users have unlimited access to content, e.g. data, files, applications, programs, etc., from a variety of sources. Additionally, the users' connection to the public networks provides a window for malicious entities to attack the users' computing systems. Malicious entities utilize this ease of accessibility and anonymity to attack the users. For example, the malicious entities can plant viruses, Trojans, or other malicious agents in publicly available content in order to attack the users' computing systems and steal sensitive information from the users and can attack the users' system remotely across the public networks.","To identify security risks in computing systems and networks, users and administrators employ vulnerability assessment and security assessment tools. These tools can identify vulnerabilities in computing systems and networks but only provide discrete information about the vulnerabilities (i.e. that a vulnerability exists). Accordingly, the tools do not provide any assessment of the vulnerabilities within the context of the overall network security.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to examples of various implementations thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, all types of information and systems, and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific examples of various implementations. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes can be made to the examples of the various implementations without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","According to implementations, systems and methods are directed to providing an overall security assessment of a network of computer assets. In implementations, a security assessment tool can determine computer assets in a network and provide an overall security score for the network. The overall security score can represent an objective measure of the security of the network that considers potential security threats to the computer assets, counter measures deployed in the network to address the potential security threats, and the effectiveness of the counter measures. Based on the overall security assessment, the security assessment tool can provide recommendations for improving the security of the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A"],"b":["100","100","1"]},"As illustrated in , the network environment  can represent the computer systems and network hardware of public or private entities, such as governmental agencies, individuals, businesses, partnerships, companies, corporations, etc., utilized to support the entities. The network environment  can include a number of computer assets . The computer assets  can be connected by one or more local area networks  and one or more wide area network . In implementations, a security assessment tool  can be configured to assess the security of the network environment  and provide an overall security score for the network environment .","The computer assets  can include any type of conventional computer systems that are operating with the network environment  or supporting the network environment . For example, the network environment  can include various types of servers, such as file servers, web servers, application servers, database servers, email servers and the like, that provide services within the network environment . Likewise, for example, the computer assets  can include laptop computers, desktop computers, tablet computers, mobile phones, and the like used by the personnel of the entities.","Additionally, for example, the computer assets  can include other hardware and computer systems that support the network environment . For example, the computer assets  can include gateways, routers, wireless access points, firewalls, and the like that support any type of communications networks, such as the local area network  and the wide area networks , to allow the computing systems in the network environment  to communicate. In any of the examples, the computer systems in the network environment  can include hardware resources, such as processors, memory, network hardware, storage devices, and the like, and software resources, such as operating systems (OS), application programs, and the like.","In addition to physical computer systems, the computer assets  can include virtualized computer systems, such as virtual machines (VM). A VM can be a virtualized computer system, or a software implementation of a computer system layered on top of any of physical computer system. The VM's access to the underlying computer system can be controlled through a hypervisor or virtual machine monitor. The VMs can provide for multiple and\/or different operating system environments to run concurrently on a single computer system.","While several examples of the computer assets  have been described above, the computer assets  can include any system, whether physical or virtual, that performs computing processes in the network environment . Additionally, the computer assets  in the network environment  can be located at any location, whether located at single geographic location or remotely located from each other. For example, the network environment  can represent the computer assets  of a company that is located in multiple geographic locations. As such, one or more of the computer assets  can be located at one location (e.g. one office of the company) and one or more of the computer assets  can be located at one or more different locations (e.g. satellite offices of the company).","In implementations, the security assessment tool  can be configured to assess the overall security of the network environment . The security assessment tool  can be configured to identify the computer assets  of the network environment . Once identified, the security assessment tool  can be configured to determine the security information of the network environment  and the computer assets . Based on the security information, the security assessment tool  can be configured to determine potential security threats to the network environment  and the computer assets . Likewise, based on the security information, the security assessment tool  can be configured to determine counter measures that are deployed in the network environment  and deployed on the computer assets  to address the potential security threats. Based on the effectiveness of the deployed counter measures, the security assessment tool  can be configured to provide an overall assessment of the security of the network environment . Based on the overall security assessment, the security assessment tool  can be configured to provide recommendations for improving the security of the network environment .","As described herein, a security threat can be any process, method, technique, algorithm, condition, software program, policy, and the like that can be utilized to compromise the security of the network environment . For example, a security threat can include known threat vectors for computer assets  and the network environment , such as known malware, known exploits, known viruses, and the like. A counter measure can include processes, techniques, methods, algorithms, conditions, policies, software programs and the like that can be implemented in the network environment  to address potential security threats.","Security information can include any information about the structure of the network environment  and any information about the computer assets . For example, the security information can include security details of the network environment , such as security polices of the network environment , details of computer assets  (e.g. firewalls) providing security in the network environment , and the like. Likewise, for example, the security information can include security details of the computer assets , such as the configuration of the computer assets , system setting of the computer assets , software programs including security software programs installed on the computer assets , security settings of the computer assets , configuration policies of the computer assets , security policies of the computer assets , access information for the computer assets , and details of software programs installed on the computer assets.","In implementation, the security assessment tool  can be configured as a software program that is capable of being stored on and executed by a computer system, whether part of the network environment  or external to the network environment . The security assessment tool  can be written in a variety of programming languages, such as JAVA, C++, Python code, Visual Basic, hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), and the like to accommodate a variety of operating systems, computing system architectures, etc.  illustrates a more detailed view of the security assessment tool . As illustrated, the security assessment tool  can be configured as a stand-alone software program and can include a scanner , a threat model , a score module , and one or more interfaces . While  illustrates the components as being part of the security assessment tool , the components can be separate software programs that communicate with the security assessment tool . Likewise, the security assessment tool , itself, can be a component of another software program.","The scanner  can include one or more software modules or tools that can scan the network environment  and the computer assets . The scanner  can be configured to determine the structure of the network environment  and identify the computer assets . Likewise, the scanner  can be configured to determine the security information for the network environment . Accordingly, the scanner  can be configured to include the necessary logic, commands, algorithms, and code to scan the network environment  and to communicate computer assets . For example, the scanner  can include various types of network scanners and vulnerability scanners, such as NeXpose\u2122 or Metasploit\u2122 from Rapid7, LLC.","The threat model  can be a listing of known security threats to network environments. The threat model  can include the identification of the known security threats and details of the security threats. The details can include the types of the computer assets  that are vulnerable to the known security threats, the affect of the known security threats, one or more counter measures that address the known security threats, and the like.","The score model  can include the necessary logic, commands, algorithms, and code utilized by the security assessment tool  to determine the overall security assessments and provide recommendations as described herein. The score model  can include a listing of the counter measures to security threats and a weighting value associated with each of the counter measures. The weighting value can represent the effectiveness of a particular counter measure.","The security assessment tool  can also include an interface . The interface  can be configured to allow one or more users to interact with the security assessment tool . The interface  can be configured to provide one or more graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and\/or command-line interfaces to allow a user to interact with the security assessment tool . Likewise, the interface  can be configured to provide one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) to allow other software programs to interact with the security assessment tool . As described herein, the security assessment tool  will be described with reference to a user interacting with the security assessment tool . In implementations, a user can include a one or more persons and\/or one or more software programs that can interact with the security assessment tool .","In implementations, a user can utilize the interface  to interact with the security assessment tool  to perform the overall security assessment. The user can utilize the interface  to initiate a security assessment of the network environment . The user can utilize the interface  to enter information about the network environment  and the computer assets . For example, the user can enter information about the structure of the network environment  such as network addresses of the network environment . Likewise, for example, the user can enter information about the computer assets , such as identification of the computer assets , access information for the computer assets , and the like. The security assessment tool , for example, the scanner , can utilize the information provided by the user when identifying the computer assets  and when determining the security information for the network environment .","The security assessment tool  can utilize the interface  to output the results of the overall security assessment. The results can include the security score relative to the potential security threats and the overall security score determined by the security assessment tool . The results can also include one or more recommendations for improving the security score relative to the potential security threats and the overall security score. For example, the one or more recommendations can include deploying a new counter measure, changing a security setting of the computer assets , changing a system setting of the computer assets , changing a security policy of the computer systems , updating software of the computer assets , installing security software on the computer assets , and improving access information for the computer assets .","As illustrated, the security assessment tool  can be configured to access one or more security resources . The security resources  can be a source, whether internal or external to the network environment , that provides information about security threats and counter measures. For example, the security resources  can include security experts, security forums, security literature, empirical security testing platforms, and the like. Likewise, for example, the security resource  can include the user of the security assessment tool . The security assessment tool  can utilize the security resources  to generate and update the threat model . The security assessment tool  can also utilize the security resources  to generate and update the score model . For example, the security assessment tool  can utilize the security resources  to determine effectiveness metrics for the counter measures. The effectiveness metrics can be utilized to determine and update the weighting values for the counter measures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","100","200"]},"As illustrated, at , the process can begin.

Based on the security information, the security assessment tool  can examine the threat model  to identify the potential security threats to the network environment . Additionally, from the threat model , the security assessment tool  can identify counter measure that can address the potential security threats to the network environment .","For example, based on the type and configurations of computer assets , the security assessment tool  can determine potential security threats. For instance, if one or more of the computer assets  are running a particular OS or a particular software program, the security assessment tool  can determine any potential security threats and any counter measures that are applicable to the particular OS or software program.

The effectiveness metrics can include quantitative and qualitative data on the effectiveness of the counter measures.","For example, if a security resource  is a security expert, security forum, or security literature, the effectiveness metrics can include one or more lists that rank one or more counter measures for a potential security threat. The ranking in the list can be based on the experience and observations of security experts and professional as to the effectiveness of a counter measures. If, for example, a particular counter measure is ranked 1 out of 10 on a list of counter measures, the effectiveness metrics can be 1.0 or 100% effective. Likewise, for example, if a particular counter measure is ranked 3 out of 10 on a list of counter measures, the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70% effective.","Likewise, if a security resource  is an empirical security testing platform, the effectiveness metrics can include a score or ranking describing how well a counter measure performed in various security tests. For instance, a security testing platform can operate a testing environment in which a counter measure is tested against attacks and exploits. If, for example, a particular counter measure was effective against 70 out of 100 attacks and exploits, the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70% effective.","At , the security assessment tool  can determine a weighting factor for each of the counter measure. The weighting factor can be based on the effectiveness metrics. For example, the weighting factor can be based on the effectiveness metrics from one of the security resources . For instance, if the security assessment tool  utilizes the list of ranked counter measures from a security resource , the weighting factor can be based on the ranking in the list. If a particular counter measure is ranked 3 out of 10 on a list of counter measures, the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70% effective, and the security assessment tool  can determine that the weighting factor is 0.7.","Additionally, for example, the security assessment tool  can utilize the effectiveness metrics from multiple security resources . If, for example, a particular counter measure is ranked 1 out of 10 on a list of counter measures, the effectiveness metrics can be 1.0 or 100% effective. Additionally, for example, if the particular counter measure is tested by a security testing platform and determined to be effective against 70 out of 100 attacks and exploits, the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70% effective. The security assessment tool  can combine the effective metrics to determine the weighting factor.","One skilled in the art will understand that any type of procedure, method, or algorithm can be utilized to combine the effectiveness metrics. For example, the security assessment tool  can average the effectiveness metrics to determine the weighting factor. For instance, in the above example, the security assessment tool  can determine that weighting factor is 0.85 (1.0+0.7\/2). Additionally, for example, when determining the average, the security assessment tool  can weight one of the effectiveness metrics from one or more of the security resources  higher when combining the effectiveness metrics. For example, if a particular security resource  is deemed for accurate, reliable, or trustworthy, the effectiveness metrics from the particular security resource  can be weighted higher than effectiveness metrics from other security resources .","At , the security assessment tool  can generate a security score model. The security score model can be based on the potential security threats, the potential counter measures, and the weighing factors. The security assessment tool  can generate the necessary logic, algorithms, commands, instructions, and code to perform the processes described above.","At , the security assessment tool  can determine, over time, if new security threats exist. As new security threats are identified, the security assessment tool  can update the threat model and the scoring model using the processes described above.","At , the security assessment tool  can determine, over time, changes in the counter measures. As counter measures change over time, the security assessment tool  can update the threat model and the scoring model using the processes described above.","At , the process can end, repeat, or return to any point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","108","500"]},"As illustrated in , the computing device  can include one or more processors  of varying core configurations and clock frequencies.
