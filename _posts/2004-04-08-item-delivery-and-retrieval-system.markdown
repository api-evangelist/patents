{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Division of non-provisional application Ser. No. 09\/817,375, filed on Mar. 27, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,748,295, including the subject matter and claiming the priority dates of Provisional Application No. Ser. No. 60\/220,842, filed on Jul. 26, 2000, and Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/265,875 filed on Feb. 5, 2001, the contents of which are meant to be incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates generally to item storage and retrieval systems and more particularly to a web-enabled item storage and retrieval system including a secure enclosure which is controlled by computer apparatus employing browser technology type software.","The overnight delivery business is a highly competitive business, requiring delivery companies to develop innovative approaches to reduce delivery cost and increase customer satisfaction. With today's lifestyles, persons, i.e., customers, are frequently not at home to accept deliveries and\/or it is inconvenient to return items. Thus there is a need for eliminating the requirement of couriers, meaning persons employed by a delivery company to make a delivery to a customer, to make multiple visits to the same residence or small business in order to complete delivery transaction(s).","Accordingly, there is a need for a secure item and delivery and return system which permits a customer to retrieve undelivered items or return items at any hour of the day, seven days a week. Typically, a customer receives some type of notification that an undeliverable item is stored at a remote location where there is located an item delivery and retrieval system. When it is convenient, the customer subsequently travels to the location of the system and retrieves the items. The benefits of such a system include labor savings, increased customer satisfaction, improved traceability, and improved process control and item security.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for storing items of various types, sizes and shapes for subsequent retrieval or return when an initial delivery was unsuccessful.","It is a further object of the invention to provide an item delivery and retrieval system which is operable in multiple utilization scenarios.","It is yet another object of the invention to provide an item delivery and retrieval system which is accessible on demand by either delivery and\/or storage clerks (employees), and clients (customers) wishing to store or retrieve undelivered items.","It is a further object of the invention to provide an item delivery and retrieval system which provides a requisite amount of security for items stored therein while providing relatively easy and user friendly access.","And it is still a further object of the invention to provide an item delivery and retrieval system which is controlled by application configurable digital computer apparatus supporting browser and web page software.","The foregoing and other objects are achieved by a storage subsystem and a computer subsystem. The storage subsystem provides a secure items storage and delivery environment including a secure enclosure having an item storage carousel including controller apparatus as well as a set of sensors. The computer subsystem is embodied in web page based customized application software for implementing an application interface of selectively configurable application interface controls, such as ActiveX controls, for providing user access to one or more storage bins located behind a set of normally closed doors which are selectively opened and then closed for item storage and retrieval, provides access control to the bins, and manages the location of the items in the storage sub-system. The doors are opened when proper identification is provided by a user so as to permit access only to specifically designated bin(s).","Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific example, while disclosing the preferred embodiment of the invention, is given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description.","Item delivery companies incur a high cost to make multiple deliveries at one location if a customer is not at home. The high cost results from: redeliveries that increase the delivery expense through additional man-hours and use of valuable space on a delivery truck; deliveries left at the delivery point without any signature are subject to theft, damage and lack delivery verification; and there is no method to handle returns. The customer also has concerns about the deliveries, namely: redeliveries are inconvenient; deliveries are difficult to schedule and wait for re-delivery; there are concerns about theft and weather damage to packages; and returning is a time-consuming and often irritable task.","Furthermore, delivery companies are belabored with item process control, typically: significant labor hours to hand-write left notices, e.g., first delivery attempt, second notice attempt, or final notice prior to returning to sender; the lack of visibility of the item while in the on-delivery, re-delivery, or return to sender life-cycle; manual process generates significant hard copy content to manage, store, protect and archive; and, hard copies are cumbersome to obtain quick visibility.","In accordance with the problems briefly referred to above, this invention is directed to an item delivery and retrieval system (IDRS) which stores a variety of products and items from post cards to large packages. The system may be installed in three scenarios: (1) behind the customer service counter for operation by employees; (2) free standing in a public access location for access by both the employees or customers; or (3) wall mounted in a public location as a customer operated system. If wall mounted, the front of the IDRS is accessible by customers in a common area or lobby, while the rear of the IDRS is accessible by employees\/clerks for behind the scenes loading of items.","The IDRS in accordance with this invention is comprised of a single sided or a double sided storage subsystem and a computer subsystem. The storage subsystem provides secure item storage and delivery. The computer subsystem includes separate customer and employee interfaces, provides access control, and manages the location of items in the storage subsystem.","When necessary, multiple IDRS(s) may be co-located at a single facility, allowing the delivery company to configure the system based on site requirements. Multiple IDRS systems can be integrated, when desirable, with multiple storage and computer subsystems for efficiently serving a higher volume of items and customers.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like components throughout,  is broadly illustrative of the architecture for an IDRS system  including, among other things, a storage subsystem  and a computer subsystem embodied in a front office client module  and a back office module , both of which includes state of the art computer apparatus with application configurable software, such as a browser, which is internet web page based. These elements are interconnected by means of a local area network (LAN)  and a router\/firewall .","As shown in , a master server  supports and stores set(s) of web pages. They are connected via a direct network connection  from a company wide area network  and connection  to user access terminals  and  supporting web browsers  and  located in the front office client module  and back office module .","Additionally, the master server  supports and stores set(s) of web pages that are connected via the internet  to a web server . The web server  is a pass through connection via the internet  to user access terminals  and  supporting web browsers  and  located in the front office client  and back office module . A modem  connects the user access terminals  and  to the web server . A modem  connects the master server  to the web server .","As illustrated, the front office browser software  and the back office browser software  reside in separate user access terminals  and . This would be the case for double sided load and retrieve system as shown in ; however, in a single sided system as shown in , the front office browser software  and the back office browser software  would reside in a common terminal, i.e., the front office client terminal  which is in the form of a kiosk , shown in , and which is associated with the front office client module .","The web server  can also be internet connected to other software such as browsers ,  and  located, for example, in another customer access terminal , a customer delivery terminal , or a personnel support terminal . The customer may view information about the items stored in the IDRS, for example, from terminal . This information may include date stored and type of item. The customer may also view any personalized information such as their e mail address and date of IDRS membership.","Delivery company personnel may view machine usage information such as is the IDRS full at certain locations and hardware failure information from a support terminal such as terminal  which is accessible by modem . The master server  is also shown connected to the delivery company-wide area network  which is coupled to the Internet  via a firewall  and connection .","The preferred embodiment of the storage subsystem  includes a vertical carousel , a single sided embodiment of which is shown in . The carousel  is constructed of individual carriers or shelves that travel on a chain and track as shown in . Vertical and horizontal mechanical inserts are mounted on the carriers with the insert determining the number of compartments associated with that carrier. The construction of the carriers and inserts preclude unauthorized access to adjacent compartments. The number and size of the compartments is furthermore configurable based on the delivery company requirements. The size of the compartment determines the size of the item which can be stored varying from postcard to large item. Each compartment is assigned a unique identifier identification number such as a sticker with a unique barcode for tracking items located therein. The computer subsystem keeps a database linking the storage compartment unique identifier with a unique mail piece identifier. A partially cutaway view of the single sided carousel structure is shown in  wherein a plurality of item holding trays  are moved up and down from front to back via a motor driven sprocket and chain assembly . This equipment is well known and comprises, for example, a vertical carousel manufactured and sold by Remstar International, Inc. of Westbrook, Me. Another known manufacturer is Hanel Storage Systems of Oakdale, Pa.","The carousel  also includes a set of sensors and a control system  (). The sensors allow the safe use of the storage subsystem by the general public. An optional safety light curtain is included across the customer access doors , as shown in , to provide a means to stop the carousel or doors when obstructed by fingers, hands, arms or items. Internal sensors, not shown, detect items that obstruct the carousel's rotational flow. In the event of an obstruction, the motions of all access doors and the carousel cease. Optional emergency stops, also not shown, are located on the periphery of the machine to allow an immediate stop of the machine. Setting of an emergency stop by delivery company personnel (employees) results in ceasing the motion of all access doors and the carousel. Additional sensors may be included in the vertical carousel to detect carousel movement and interface to external pushbuttons.","The carousel control system interfaces with the sensors and controls the movement of the carousel . The carousel control system responds to requests from the computer subsystem in either the back office module  or front office module  via a software carousel driver shown in  and which will be considered subsequently. The carousel control system includes a diagnostic capability so as to provide diagnostic information regarding the safety light curtain, photoeyes, motor starters and external pushbuttons.","As shown in , B, and , the carousel  is housed within a secure enclosure . The enclosure  is vandal resistant and graffiti resistant. The front doors  of the carousel  are segmented to allow the opening of a door in front of the desired compartment only. The height, width, depth of the enclosure is based on customer requirements and mechanical constraints.","The front office client module  provides a user friendly customer interface implemented in customized application software for the retrieval of an item. The term \u201capplication\u201d is well known in the art and refers to a computer program for carrying out a certain function or producing a certain result. As shown in , the front office module  includes in addition to application configurable browser software  which resides in the user access terminal , a screen  which may optionally be a touch screen and other optional devices such as a barcode reader , credit\/debit card reader , pin pad , receipt printer , signature pad , and two security cameras  and . While the front office client module  is preferably accessed from the front, it may be accessed from the front and\/or rear depending on the customer requirements.","The front office user access terminal  is further shown in  consisting of a kiosk  having a touch activated screen  and a housing  wherein there is located the customized application software  for controlling the carousel .","The back office module  provides an interface also implemented in customized application software for employees to load the IDRS from front and\/or rear access doors of the carousel . Two front access doors  and  are shown in the single sided carousel  shown in . If the system does not require the carousel  to be rear loaded, the back office functions can be implemented on the customer interface side or front of the carousel  via the kiosk  as shown in , but still may be accessed only by authorized delivery company personnel. In such a configuration, both software interfaces, i.e., a front office application program interface (FO API) and a back office application program interface (BO API) reside in the kiosk .","If the back office module  is located separate from the kiosk  such as where the carousel  is designed so as to be rear loaded from a back room, it would, for example, include a separate employee access terminal  equipped with its own application configuration browser software  as shown in . The terminal  would also include a screen  and other peripheral devices such as, but not limited to, a bar code reader , a modem  for connecting to a bank clearing switch  and apparatus  for connection to an external telephone . Additionally, such a back office module  would include a printer  which is coupled to the local area network .","Also shown in  is a handheld wireless device\/scanner  which can access the storage subsystem , the front office module  and the back office module  including a screen  via a wireless local area network (LAN) shown by reference numerals  and  which are coupled to the local area network  and allows for mobility of the handheld device\/scanner  The handheld wireless device\/scanner  may also execute an application to store items in the carousel  of the IDRS system .","It should be noted that a single back office module  can control multiple front office modules  and storage subsystems  at high demand sites. This feature allows the delivery company to vary the quantity of front office kiosks  and carousels  based on site-to-site variations on demand.","The master server  shown in  includes state of the art digital computer apparatus supporting master server application software and is used to network the subject system  as well as multiple other systems together over the delivery company wide area network . The Master Server  allows delivery company supervisors and operations managers to browse any website(s) to determine usage rates across sites and system availability information. The master server  contains the centralized data for the IDRS system such as certain data indicating IDRS locations, user e-mail addresses, user account\/loyalty card information, item status, and any other information needed to operate the system. Other master servers, not shown, may be linked to geographic regions for large or regional deployments. Customers may access the specific website to get item delivery traceability information. The firewall  prevents the public from corrupting the Master Server data and ensures data integrity.","Referring now briefly to , shown thereat is an electrical block diagram of the electrical power supplied to the equipment shown in , B,  and . 120 VAC electrical power is fed from an outside power line to a junction box\/receptacle  where it then is fed to an AC power supply  and an overhead light . The power supply  feeds AC power on separate busses to the carousel , the kiosk  and a 120V AC converter  in a conventional manner. The output of the converter  is fed to a router  which provides an internet cable connection to the kiosk . An RS  communication cable  is shown connected between the carousel  and the kiosk .","Before considering the details of the application software of this invention, reference is first made to  which is intended as a simple tutorial to illustrate how web browser technology is utilized to display a web page. As is well known, a web browser is a software application used to locate and display a web page, i.e., a document on the World Wide Web. As shown, reference numeral  denotes a machine running web browser software connected to a web server . Reference numeral  denotes a mouse, i.e., a well known hand activated device to move a cursor on a computer screen or activate a command, connected to the machine . Thus when a web page is desired, the browser software in the machine  connects to the server software in the web server  and requests a page. The web server  in turn retrieves the requested page from a digital storage located, for example, in a master server  shown in , where it is then sent back to the machine  running the web browser where it is then displayed on a screen .","Referring now to , shown thereat is a simplified block diagram of the subject invention and illustrative of the software architecture in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention where the front office application program interface (FO API)  and the back office application program interface (BO API) , referred to above, are located in the CUPSS software environment  of the kiosk  () using ActiveX control technology. As shown, the FO API  and BO API  support ActiveX controls  and . A security interface is also shown using ActiveX and control .","ActiveX control is a well known concept in current state of the art of digital computer technology. It is a programming language including a set of rules for how applications should share information and can be automatically downloaded and executed, for example, by a web browser. ActiveX controls have full access to a windows operating system using web pages. ActiveX control is particularly adapted to implement custom controls, which in the subject invention comprises the FO API , the BO API  and a carousel driver  which is connected to the carousel controller  ().","The FO API , the BO API , and the carousel driver  combine together to form a customized application and carousel independent interface which is configured on demand to meet a desired configuration of utilization. Accordingly, the carousel driver  can be instantaneously used to control any manufacturer's carousel simply by enabling the particular manufacture software switch and recompiling the driver associated therewith.","The configuration of the carousel , e.g. bin locations and size, is controlled by a carousel database  also residing in the CUPSS software environment . The carousel driver  supports both double sided and single sided configurations such as shown in . The carousel driver  coordinates access to the carousel  such that only one employee or customer operates the carousel at one time. For employee access, the carousel driver  opens front and\/or rear doors, e.g. doors  and  shown in , exposing multiple compartments authorized to be accessed by the employee. For customer access, the carousel driver  opens the front doors , exposing a single compartment authorized to be accessed by the customer.","The carousel driver  also interacts with an operating system  and a simple network management protocol (SNMP) agent  as shown in  to ensure a safe environment is maintained during storage personnel\/employee or customer\/client operation. Status information from light curtains, door movement, carousel movement, and power fluctuations is constantly maintained. The carousel driver  uses the information to control the load and retrieval process so that the integrity of the carousel  is maintained, such as closing the doors during a power failure, and the safety of the user is maintained just closing the door while the user is reaching into a bin.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["50","126","120","121","120","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE I"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Front Office","Back Office"]},{"entry":[{},"Control Functions","Control Functions"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Connect","Connect"]},{"entry":[{},"Cue Bin Location","Open All Doors"]},{"entry":[{},"Open Bin Location","Open Bin Location"]},{"entry":[{},"Close Bin","Rotate Carousel"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Identify Bin"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Close Bin"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Close All Doors"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The Connect function initializes connections of the ActiveX controls  and  to the carousel driver . The ActiveX control may also be required to pass an identification code to the carousel driver  for access control security. The Cue Bin Location function is used by the FO API  to rotate the carousel  such that the requested bin is positioned behind the doors  without any of the doors being opened. This function is used to reduce the service time required for the overall transactional session, if the operational rules of the application also include authentication of the user. The Cue Bin Location function will position the carousel  while the transactional process of authenticating the user takes place. This will reduce the overall transaction time. The Open Bin Location function is used by the BO API  and FO API  to position the carousel  and to open the doors to a specified bin. This may require an access code. The Open Doors function is a back office function that is used to gain full access to the carousel . This function may restrict access based on identification code. The Rotate Carousel function is used by the BO API  to position hidden carriers to the access point and may restrict access based on identification code. The Identify Bin function is used by the BO API  to identify a particular bin when all doors are open. This function may be used by applications to verify if bins are empty or indicate which items need attention. The Close Bin function is used by the FO API  and\/or BO API  to close the doors. Once the door has been opened, the Close Bin function may also be used to clear bin access codes. The Close All Doors function is used by the BO API  to close all doors and secure the carousel .","The present invention also contemplates an enhanced item controlled architecture shown in  which provides an interface to applications via ActiveX controls  and  for providing, among other things, inventory control of items that are placed into or out of the carousel . This enhanced architecture provides advanced functionality and allows multiple delivery companies to use a single IDRS carousel . This interface is more transactional based and permits an application to load items, find empty locations, remove items and a host of transactional type of information queries. Again, the carousel driver  is a persistent service of the operating system and the ActiveX controls are active only for the processing time of the applications or web pages that contain them. The enhanced architecture additionally includes a local item inventory database , but uses the same interfaces  and  to the carousel driver  for carousel control, but provides a higher level of service to the application through its APIs  and . Access codes that are required by the carousel driver  and are not provided by the application are generated by the ActiveX controls  and .","Application access for the enhanced item controlled architecture to the functions to be described can be classified in two types of control classes: (a) session access and, (b) bin access. Session access describes the protocol required to any given application to connect to the carousel driver . Bin access describes the protocol for a qualified application to reserve or lock any given bin.","Session access is controlled by means of an access control list (ACL) which is maintained in the data of the carousel driver . As is well known, a \u201clist\u201d is an ordered set of data which is normally accessed in a digital computer sequentially. The ACLs of the FO API  and BO API  will contain the ACL member ID of all authorized applications of the carousel . When an application initializes its embedded ActiveX controls  or , it in turn establishes the requisite transmission control protocol (TCP) connections to the carousel driver . The ACL member ID that is passed with the connection request will be checked against the carousel's ACL. A successful match will permit the connections to be made, assuming no other connection is established. An unsuccessful match will reject the connection and not permit that application to have access to the carousel . If there are no members in either ACLs, then it should be assumed that any application can access the carousel and no access security will be required to operate the carousel.","With respect to bin access, the carousel driver  will grant access to any given bin based on the access type declared for that bin at installation time. Each bin will be set up based on one of two access types Static or Dynamic.","The Static access type relates a given bin to a given application on the ACL. This type of bin access petitions the carousel  to either a single application or multiple applications with fixed storage capabilities. The Dynamic bin access type allows for more efficient use of the carousel  in the multiuse configuration by allowing applications to gain access to the bins based on a common pool of dynamically allocated bins. Once a bin has been accessed, the application may place or remove a lock on that bin with an application supplied access code. Subsequent access to that bin or removal of the lock will then require the access code for that bin. The carousel driver  will journal log all access activity via a simple network management protocol (SNMP). This information will provide the basis for \u201cuse accountability\u201d for owners\/administrators of the equipment.","It should be noted that if more than one member exists in the ACL of the BO API , back office operations will limit exposure of the bins, i.e., rotation operations, to only those bins which have any given application is authorized to use. This may be accomplished by closing all doors before a rotation and only granting open doors at authorized carrier level as will be described subsequently with respect to .","The Static bin access type is the simpler of the two access services. The configuration of the carousel  is segmented into a predetermined configuration which specifies who has the right to access any given bin. If no ACL member is specified, it would be assumed that any application has access to the bin. At configuration time, it should be noted that the segmentation definition will take into account for the dual sided and\/or single sided system as shown, for example, in  such that unauthorized bins will not be exposed during back office operations.","The Dynamic bin access has two modes of operation, with or without back office operations. Dynamic bin access without back office operations will permit any application to access any unlocked bin. Once the bin has been locked with an access code, both the ACL member ID and access code will be needed to re-access the bin or remove the lock. Dynamic bin access with back office operations, however, will operate as above, but with a further restriction such as to limit access to those bins where no other bin on that carrier, for single sided configurations and adjacent carrier for dual sided configurations, is locked by another ACL member ID.","The major function of these ActiveX controls for the enhanced architecture shown in  are summarized in the following Table II.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE II"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Front Office","Back Office"]},{"entry":[{},"Item Functions","Item Functions"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Connect","Connect"]},{"entry":[{},"Cue Item\/Authenticate User","Register Item"]},{"entry":[{},"Load Item","Purge Item"]},{"entry":[{},"Remove Item","Load Item"]},{"entry":[{},"Close Bin","Remove Item"]},{"entry":[{},"Return Item","Open All Doors"]},{"entry":[{},"Query Item","Open Bin Location"]},{"entry":[{},"Print Receipt","Identify Bin"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Rotate Carousel"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Close Bin"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Close All Doors"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Database Maintenance\/Reports"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"With respect to the functions listed in Table II, the Connect function, for example, initializes connections of the ActiveX control of FO API  and BO API  to the carousel driver . The ActiveX controls may also be required to pass an identification code to the carousel driver  for access control security. This function is the same as in the basic control outlined in Table I. The Cue Item function is similar to the Cue Bin Location function of Table I and is used by the FO API  to rotate the carousel  such that the requested item is positioned behind the doors  without any of the doors being opened. This function is also used to reduce the service time required for the overall transactional session. If the operational rules of the application include authentication of the user, the Cue Item function will position the carousel  while the transactional process of authenticating the user can take place, and thus will also reduce overall transaction time. The Register Item function is used by the BO API  to register an item and the item characteristics in the inventory data base  (). This function may be used to set the bin access code and may use an external scanner or similar data entry device. The Load Item function is similar to the Open Bin Location function (Table I) and is the function used by both the BO API  and the FO API  to position the carousel  and open the doors, for example,  and\/or  of  for a specified item at a specific location. The item is then registered in the local database . This function may also be used to set the bin access code and may use an external scanner or similar data entry device.","The Purge Item function is used by the BO API  to remove an item in the local data base  and clear the bin access code. This function may require a bin access code and also may use an external scanner or similar data entry device. The Close Bin function is used by FO API  and\/or BO API  to close the doors , , . The Remove Item function is similar to the Open Bin Location function of Table I and is the function used by both the BO API  and the FO API  to position the carousel  and open the doors  to a specified item. The item is then marked as removed from the local database  and the bin access code is cleared if a bin access code is present.","The Return Item function is used by the FO API  to close the bin doors  and flag\/mark the item in the database  for return. This function may also be used to flag an item that has not been removed from the carousel  but has been purged from the database . This function may be used to set the bin access code and is similar to the Remove Item and the Load Item function, noted above, with an item that is already in the system. The Query Item function is used by the FO API  to find and load time and status information into the database  regarding item removal or return. The Print Receipt function is used by the FO API  to print a transaction receipt of item removal or return from the carousel .","The Open All Doors function is a function of the BO API  that is used to gain full access to the carousel . The Open All Doors function may restrict access based on an identification code and is the same as in the basic control outlined in Table I. The Open Bin Location function is used by the BO API  to position the carousel  and to open the doors  or  to a specified bin and may require an access code. Again, this function is the same as in the basic control outlined above with respect to Table I. The Identify Bin function is used by the BO API  to identify a particular bin when all doors are opened. This function may be used by applications to verify if bins are empty or indicate which items need attention. This function is also the same as in the basic control outlined above.","The Rotate Carousel function is used by the BO API  to position hidden carriers to a specific access point and may restrict access based on an identification code. This function is also the same as in the basic control. The Close All Doors function is used by the BO API  to close all doors and secure the machine and is the same as in the basic control described with respect to . Finally, the Database Maintenance\/Reports function is used by the BO API  to update the database .","Other queries and maintenance functions of the local item inventory base will depend on the design of the database itself.","With respect to the three major interfaces considered above with respect to ,  and , namely: the employee or BO API ; the customer or FO API , and the carousel driver interface , the employee or BO API  has access to the carousel driver  as shown, for example, in  through an immediate response port termed a \u201ccommand respond port\u201d  or a process generate event port termed a \u201ccommand process port\u201d . The command respond port  will return with the function result. The command process port  will return the success of sending the message upon receiving the completion or error of a command. This port will generate an event with the status of the last command. The attached Appendix A is illustrative of the set of functions implemented by the employee interface or BO API .","The customer or FO API interface  has access to the carousel driver  through an immediate response port termed a \u201ccommand respond port\u201d shown by reference numeral  or a process and generate event port termed a \u201ccommand process port\u201d  shown in . The command respond port  will return with the function result. The command process port  will return the success of sending the message and upon receiving the completion or error of a command, this port will generate an event with the status of the last command. The attached Appendix B is illustrative of the set of functions implemented by the customer interface or FO API .","As noted above, the carousel driver interface  is an executable program that communicates directly with the carousel , with both the customer FO API  and employee BO API . ActiveX controls  and  communicate with the carousel through this driver. The attached Appendix C is illustrative of the set of functions implemented by the carousel driver interface .","It should be noted that ActiveX controls can be used, without modification, by any development environment such as the Web. The application programming interface (API) remains constant, irrespective of whether a web page of a windows application is operating the carousel . This significantly reduces the software effort because the same API is used in both the Web and programming development environments. In addition, by hiding the peripheral details, this common use interface provides higher level interfaces to the developers, resulting in shorter time-to-market efforts.","For example,  is illustrative of a multiple user scenario. In , carriers refer to delivery companies. Accordingly, when a user approaches the IDRS system , he\/she enters which item(s) they wish to retrieve, for example, using the kiosk . If delivery company  shown by reference numeral  delivered the item(s) to be retrieved, then delivery company 's application  is plugged into the browser peripheral control portion  of the FO API  and executed by the Front Office ActiveX control  shown, for example, in . At this time, delivery company  has control of the carousel  and can only access the designated items. The carousel driver  prevents any access to any other delivery companies, items or information. After the user has completed the transaction, all information with respect to the user, the delivery company and transaction is flushed from the carousel database . Thus a virtual architecture is generated which allows each delivery company, for example, delivery companies  and  designated by reference numerals  and  to function with confidence so that no other delivery company can view or gather any of its private information. As shown in , the delivery companies  and  can insert their respective applications  and  to respective browser peripheral control portions  and , which would then be executed in turn.","Considering now , shown thereat are four step sequences outlining four possible modes of operation. Typically, a user, e.g., an employee of a delivery service company operates the IDRS in accordance with the subject invention from behind a customer service counter. A second user, e.g., a customer of the delivery service company interfaces with the IDRS system  using the front office client module  and retrieves the items from the storage subsystem module . Four scenarios are provided for customers to retrieve undelivered items, namely: (1) barcoded notification form; (2) internet e-mail notification; (3) customer loyalty card (similar to supermarket savings cards and library cards with a magnetic strip on the back); and (4) front counter clerk.","The notification form approach (1) requires the delivery company courier to leave a written notice at the residence or business of attempted delivery. The written notice has a barcode on the form matching a self-stick barcode label placed on the item. When the delivery of an item cannot be completed, the courier will fill out a notification form, peel off a self-stick barcode label, and apply it to the item. The form is left at the address and the item is brought back to the IDRS . Once back at the delivery facility, the employee uses the back office subsystem module to initiate loading the storage unit  including the carousel . The screen on the terminal  in the back office subsystem module  displays the available compartments in the carousel . The employee then selects an empty compartment to match the item size. The application software in the back office subsystem module  automatically requests the carousel  to move the compartment to the loading position and the doors of the carousel are opened. The employee scans the self-stick barcode label and an IDRS storage location barcode label is scanned and fed into a database.","Thereafter, a customer retrieves the items via the notification form. As shown in , at step , the customer scans the barcode on the notification form into the system at the kiosk  using the barbode reader  (). The IDRS ActiveX software described above uses the scanned barcode to reference the proper storage location linked to the form's barcode. Thereafter, an approved card provided by the delivery company for delivery authentication is scanned at step . If the delivery company requires, the customer uses a credit card, debit or customer loyalty card to authenticate the identity of the customer. Payment may be accepted for the transaction if the delivery company requests payment. A PIN number associated with the card is entered per step . This information is remotely verified and authenticates the user so that the card holder information tracks the person who picked up the item. The customer will then be prompted to supply a signature in accordance with step  via the signature pad  or on a touch screen  of the kiosk . This signature also tracks the person who signed for the item. Thereafter, the doors  of the carousel  automatically opens to the storage location of the customer's item. The customer then is prompted to deposit the notification form per step  into a slot and the previously undelivered item is retrieved per step . During this process, photos of the person retrieving the item may also be required using the cameras  shown in .","The second scenario involves internet e-mail notification (2). This approach requires notifying the customer via a supplied e-mail address, contained in a database of the master server  whenever an item is stored in the IDRS. In such an operational mode, the customer is first registered for service via the Internet by accessing a website and requesting internet e-mail notification service. At a minimum, a delivery address is provided to re-direct to the IDRS system. An e-mail address is provided to receive the notification. After registering, the customer must activate the service by calling the IDRS from a phone at the address given during registration. A customer selects a delivery profile, e.g., automatic placement of the item in the IDRS system . The customer indicates a preference to automatically put deliveries into the carousel  and thereafter eliminate any further attempts to deliver to the customer's address.","When an item is then stored in the carousel , an e-mail is sent to the e-mail address on file. The e-mail contains instructions on how to retrieve the item, including a six-digit PIN along with the location of the IDRS system, i.e., the address at which the IDRS  is located and, when desirable, with an optional map showing street locations, etc.","Items for the customer will be directed immediately to the IDRS  if the customer selected this delivery profile for this account. Not delivering the item reduces courier delivery time, delivery vehicle wear, and delivery vehicle gas and maintenance. The item may contain other delivery company barcodes such as expedite shipment confirmation of delivery, insured item, and indication of any other special handling. Any of these additional barcodes will also be scanned into the IDRS when the item is stored in the carousel. An e-mail is thereafter sent to the e-mail address on file associated with the item's delivery address.","As shown in , a customer would then go to the IDRS  and enter the 6-digit e-mail PIN on the PIN pad  as indicated by step . Next, a photo of the customer is taken via the cameras  shown in , whereupon the IDRS system  uses the e-mail PIN to reference the storage location(s) linked to the PIN. Next, the customer uses a card approved by the delivery company for delivery authentication. If the delivery company requires, the customer uses a credit card, debit or customer loyalty card to authenticate the identity of the user. Payment may be accepted for the transaction, if the delivery company requires payment. Next, the card is scanned via the card reader  in accordance with step  and the customer enters the PIN associated with the card. This is indicated by step . The information on the card is remotely verified and authenticates the user. If the delivery company requires, the IDRS  system will prompt the customer to supply a signature per step  via the electronic signature pad  or on the touch screen  (). Thereafter, the IDRS opens automatically to the store location of the stored item. The item is then removed from the storage location per step  and if the delivery company requires, a second photo of the item removal process is made.","The third scenario (3) is shown in  and one where a front counter clerk provides the necessary access information when a customer has lost or forgotten, for example, the notification form, e-mail\/PIN or customer loyalty card\/PIN or simply needs assistance at the IDRS  following storage of an item in the carousel  and where the customer had previously been alerted either by notification form or e-mail.","In such an instance, where the customer needs assistance as indicated by step , he\/she would proceed to the front counter and see the clerk\/employee per step  who would obtain the necessary information such as the delivery address and name and the necessary customer identification. The clerk then enters the address into the IDRS in the back office module  in accordance with step , whereupon the IDRS  uses the address to reference the storage location(s) linked to the address. The clerk\/employee then retrieves the item(s) and upon receiving a customer signature per step , the item is supplied in accordance with step .","The fourth scenario (4) permits the customer to use a delivery company issued customer loyalty card to retrieve items stored in the IDRS. In this mode of operation, the customer would again register for service via the web by accessing a website and requesting customer loyalty service. This would again involve providing a delivery address to re-direct to the IDRS and an e-mail address to receive the notification. After registration, the delivery company mails a customer loyalty card to the customer.","Thereafter, the customer must activate the service by calling the IDRS from a phone at the address given during registration. The customer would then select a delivery profile, whereupon an e-mail notification is sent by the IDRS to the e-mail address on file. Contained in the e-mail are instructions on how to retrieve the item; however, there is no 6-digit PIN. Contained on the customer loyalty card is an encoded loyalty PIN number. The customer must then supply an associated PIN for authentication when using the customer loyalty card to access the IDRS.","Items will be directed immediately to the IDRS if a customer selected such a delivery profile for their account. The item may contain other delivery company barcodes such as expedited shipment confirmation of delivery, insured item indication of any other special handling required. Any of these additional barcodes will be scanned into the IDRS when the item stored upon non-delivery. An e-mail is sent to the e-mail address on file associated with the item delivery address.","When the customer arrives at the IDRS, he\/she enters the customer loyalty card and PIN via the card reader in the PIN pad as shown by steps  and  in . The cameras  would also take a photo of the customer. The IDRS system uses the customer loyalty account number to reference the storage location(s) of all items linked to the account. Authentication when necessary via signature is provided by the supply of a signature which would be prompted by the system per step . The doors  of the carousel  open automatically to the storage location of the item which is retrieved per step . Again, if the delivery company requires, a second photo of the item removal process is taken via the cameras  shown in .","It should be noted that the flexibility of the IDRS system  in accordance with the subject invention allows the delivery company to deploy the appropriate configuration depending upon available floor space, item mix and capacity.","Having thus shown and described what is at present considered to be the preferred embodiment of the invention, it should be noted that the foregoing detailed description merely illustrates principles of the invention.
