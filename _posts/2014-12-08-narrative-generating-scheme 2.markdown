Further, the actions may be a user defined action implemented by computing device .","As an example of identifying at least one action, the registered narrative application may display the predefined list of actions in a drop-down menu of a pop-up window corresponding to the registered application. Then, the narrative application may receive one or more user inputs to select at least one action from the predefined list of actions in the drop-down menu, e.g. by clicking selections of the one or more actions.","As non-limiting example of the actions list, if the narrative application registers \u201cAmazon\u00ae Kindle Store\u201d, the narrative application may display in, e.g., a pop-up window or drop-down menu, a predefined list of actions, including as non-limiting examples \u201cread,\u201d \u201chold,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d \u201cdislike,\u201d \u201cpurchase\u201d, \u201cread again\u201d, \u201chighlight,\u201d \u201cannotate,\u201d \u201cpreview,\u201d etc., using a UI on computing device  or the narrative application server.","As another example, if the narrative application registers \u201cYahoo!\u00ae Music\u201d as a mobile music store application, the narrative application may display in, e.g., a pop-up window or drop-down menu, actions that include, as non-limiting examples, \u201clisten,\u201d \u201chold,\u201d \u201cpurchase,\u201d \u201cdownload\u201d, \u201clike,\u201d \u201cdislike,\u201d \u201crate,\u201d \u201cadd to favorites,\u201d \u201cremove from favorites,\u201d \u201cread a review,\u201d \u201ccomment,\u201d etc.","As another example of identifying at least one action, the narrative application may identify a category of the registered application and display a predefined list of actions stored in computing device  corresponding to the category of the application. Then, the narrative application may receive one or more user inputs to select at least one action from the list of actions.","For example, if the narrative application registers \u201cAmazon\u00ae Kindle Store\u201d and \u201cGoogle\u00ae eBook\u201d, the narrative application may determine based on metadata of the two applications that \u201cAmazon\u00ae Kindle Store\u201d and \u201cGoogle\u00ae eBook\u201d are both \u201cE-book\u201d store applications. Then, the narrative application may display the same predefined list of actions corresponding to all registered \u201cE-book\u201d store application.","As still another example of identifying at least one action, the narrative application may receive user-defined actions corresponding to the registered application. After the narrative application displays a list of actions predefined and stored in computing device  corresponding to the registered application, the narrative application may receive one or more user inputs to enter new actions associated with the registered third party application.","After the narrative application identifies at least one action, the narrative application may be configured to receive recorded usage history of the at least one action corresponding to the registered third party application transmitted from external server  and computing device .","The recorded usage history of the at least one action corresponding to the registered application may include an executed function, an execution time, an execution location of the at least one application, along with a title, a starting time, and a location transmitted from external server . Further, the recorded usage history of the at least one action corresponding to the application may include an image, a rating, an author, an actor\/actress and a review associated with the application.","The information regarding the executed function, the execution time, and the execution location may be stored in computing device , and the narrative application may receive such information transmitted from computing device  by calling application programming interfaces (APIs), because the usage record of applications installed on computing device  may be stored in computing device .","On the contrary, the information regarding the title, the starting time, and the location may be stored in external server  linked to the registered application, and the narrative application may receive such information transmitted from external server  by calling application programming interfaces (APIs). The information regarding a subject matter of the registered application, e.g. e-Book of Amazon\u00ae Kindle Store or a movie ticket of AMC\u00ae grand, may be stored in external server  linked to the registered application.","For example, if a narrative application registers the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application and the narrative application receives at least one user input to select \u201cwatch a movie\u201d from a list of actions, the narrative application may receive one or more UI fields or windows to facilitate a \u201cbook a ticket\u201d function; an indication of \u201c14:00\u201d or \u201c2:00 p.m.\u201d as a starting time for execution of the function; \u201c00:05\u201d as a duration of execution of the function; \u201chome\u201d as a location of execution of the function, etc. Such information regarding execution of the function may be stored in computing device  and be transmitted to the narrative application that may utilize such information to write a story when a user utilizes the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application) for booking a movie ticket.","In addition, in order to include more specific story of the user's life, the narrative application may receive, from external server ; \u201cDark Knight\u201d as a movie title; \u201c16:00\u201d or \u201c4:00 p.m.\u201d as a starting time for the movie; \u201cBeverly Center\u201d as the location of a desired movie theater, etc. Further, the narrative application requests background information regarding the \u201cDark Knight\u201d from external server  associated with the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application to generate a more specific and\/or interesting story for the user. Thus, the narrative application may retrieve and\/or receive, from external server , promotional images and\/or videos for the Dark Knight, information regarding the director, reviews of the Dark Knight, information regarding actors in the Dark Knight, etc., which may be stored in external server  associated with the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application.","After the narrative application receives a history of the action. The history may include information such as an executed function, an execution time, an execution location, etc., the narrative application may generate a narrative to be viewed on a user interface of the computing device  based on the received usage history of the action corresponding to the registered application. For example, after a user has booked a ticket for Dark Knight using the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application, which has been registered by the narrative application, and the user further selects the action \u201cwatch movie\u201d using the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application, the narrative application may generate a narrative to record such actions in one or more of various narrative formats.","As depicted in , the narrative application may display a narrative, \u201cIn Beverly Hills, I dropped by the Dunkin Donuts\u00ae at 3:00 p.m. After that, I watched Dark Knight at 4:00 p.m. at the AMC\u00ae Grand Theater. It was so exciting, as people said\u201d based on the predefined expression stored in computing device  such as \u201cIt was so exciting, as people said.\u201d","Further, when the narrative application requests background information regarding the Dark Knight to external server  associated with the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application to generate a more interesting and\/or specific story for the user, the narrative application may retrieve and\/or receive, from external server , promotional images and\/or videos for the \u201cDark Knight,\u201d information regarding the director, reviews of the \u201cDark Knight,\u201d information regarding actors in the \u201cDark Knight,\u201d etc., which may be stored in external server  associated with the \u201cAMC\u00ae grand\u201d application.","After the narrative application generates the narrative, the narrative application may be configured to display at least part of the generated narrative and highlight at least one of the actions in the displayed narrative. The highlighting may include underlining and\/or coloring. Then, the narrative application may receive an input to revise the highlighted action or to add new information to the highlighted action, e.g. one or more user inputs to selection another action in the pop-up menu or drop-down menu on which a list of actions may be displayed, or user input to type other action in an appropriate UI field or window.","For example, based on the generated narrative, \u201cI watched the Dark Knight at 4:00 p.m. at the AMC\u00ae Grand Theater. It was so exciting, as said the reviews stated.\u201d If the narrative application receives one or more user inputs to select \u201cwatched\u201d and also to select \u201cgive a present\u201d in a pop-up menu or a drop-down menu, the narrative application may display, alternatively or additionally, a revised narrative that indicates, as a non-limiting example, \u201cI gave my friend a ticket to watch the Dark Knight. He should like it, since the reviews have been good.\u201d","Further, after the narrative application generates the narrative, the narrative application may be configured to insert, to the narrative, at least one picture taken when receiving the recorded usage history of the actions corresponding to the application. In addition, the narrative application may transmit the generated narrative to external server  to be shared through the Internet.","Thus,  shows example system  in which one or more embodiments of a narrative generating scheme may be implemented, in accordance with various embodiments described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["130","210","220"]},"Processing unit  may include a registering component  configured to register an application from among a plurality of applications installed on a mobile device, an identifier  configured to identify at least one action corresponding to the application, a receiver  configured to receive recorded usage history of the at least one action corresponding to the application, a narrative generator  configured to generate a narrative, based on the received usage history of the at least one action corresponding to the application, and an analyzer  configured to collect and analyze external data transmitted from an external server.","Processing unit  may further include a display  configured to display at least part of the generated narrative, a highlighter  configured to highlight the at least one action in the displayed narrative, an input receiver  configured to receive an input to revise the at least one action or to add new information to the at least one action, an attachment component  configured to attach, to the narrative, at least one file (e.g. picture, video file, audio file), and a transmitter  configured to transmit the narrative to an external server.","In some embodiments, if a narrative application generates a plurality of narratives, then memory  may be configured to store the plurality of narratives.
