Strobilurins and other complex III inhibitors. In: Kramer, W.; Schirmer, U. (Ed.)\u2014Modern Crop Protection Compounds. Volume 2. Wiley-VCH Verlag 457-495), are conventionally used to control a number of fungal pathogens in crops. Qo inhibitors typically work by inhibiting respiration by binding to a ubihydroquinone oxidation center of a cytochrome bccomplex (electron transport complex III) in mitochondria. Said oxidation center is located on the outer side of the inner mitochrondrial membrane. A prime example of the use of Qo inhibitors includes the use of, for example, strobilurins on wheat for the control of (also known as ), which is the cause of wheat leaf blotch. Unfortunately, widespread use of such Qo inhibitors has resulted in the selection of mutant pathogens which are resistant to such Qo inhibitors (Gisi et al., Pest Manag Sci 56, 833-841, (2000). Resistance to Qo inhibitors has been detected in several phytopathogenic fungi such as or . Although several resistance mechanisms have been detected meanwhile (e.g. Jabs et al. Phytomedizin 31, 15-16 (2001); Olaya et al., Pestic Sci 54, 230-236 (1998), the major part of resistance to Qo inhibitors in agricultural uses has been attributed to pathogens containing a single amino acid residue substitution G143A in the cytochrome b gene for their cytochrome bccomplex, the target protein of Qo inhibitors. See, for example, Lucas, Pestic Outlook 14 (6), 268-70 (2003); and Fraaije et al., Phytopathol 95 (8), 933-41 (2005), (which both are expressly incorporated by reference herein). Thus, new methods and compositions are desirable for controlling pathogen induced diseases in crops comprising plants subjected to pathogens that are resistant to Qo inhibitors. Furthermore, in many cases, in particular at low application rates, the fungicidal activity of the known fungicidal strobilurin analogue compounds is unsatisfactory, especially in case that a high proportion of the fungal pathogens contain a mutation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene conferring resistance to Qo inhibitors. Based on this, it was also an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved activity and\/or a broader activity spectrum against phytopathogenic harmful fungi.","\u201cQo inhibitor,\u201d as used herein, includes any substance that is capable of diminishing and\/or inhibiting respiration by binding to a ubihydroquinone oxidation center of a cytochrome bccomplex in mitochondria.

The active substances are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably from 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).","Solutions for seed treatment (LS), Suspoemulsions (SE), flowable concentrates (FS), powders for dry treatment (DS), water-dispersible powders for slurry treatment (WS), water-soluble powders (SS), emulsions (ES), emulsifiable concentrates (EC) and gels (GF) are usually employed for the purposes of treatment of plant propagation materials, particularly seeds. The compositions in question give, after two-to-tenfold dilution, active substance concentrations of from 0.01 to 60% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 40%, in the ready-to-use preparations. Application can be carried out before or during sowing. Methods for applying compound I and compositions thereof, respectively, on to plant propagation material, especially seeds include dressing, coating, pelleting, dusting, soaking and in-furrow application methods of the propagation material. Preferably, compound I or the compositions thereof, respectively, are applied on to the plant propagation material by a method such that germination is not induced, e.g. by seed dressing, pelleting, coating and dusting.","When employed in plant protection, the amounts of active substances applied are, depending on the kind of effect desired, from 0.001 to 2 kg per ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg per ha, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.9 kg per ha, and in particular from 0.1 to 0.75 kg per ha.","In treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds, e.g. by dusting, coating or drenching seed, amounts of active substance of from 0.1 to 1000 g, preferably from 1 to 1000 g, more preferably from 1 to 100 g and most preferably from 5 to 100 g, per 100 kilogram of plant propagation material (preferably seeds) are generally required.","When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active substance applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect. Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active substance per cubic meter of treated material.","Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, fertilizer, or micronutrients, and further pesticides (e.g. herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, growth regulators, safeners) may be added to the active substances or the compositions comprising them as premix or, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:100 to 100:1, preferably 1:10 to 10:1.","The user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage device, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank, a spray plane, or an irrigation system. Usually, the agrochemical composition is made up with water, buffer, and\/or further auxiliaries to the desired application concentration and the ready-to-use spray liquor or the agrochemical composition according to the invention is thus obtained. Usually, 20 to 2000 liters, preferably 50 to 400 liters, of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare of agricultural useful area.","According to one embodiment, individual components of the composition according to the invention such as parts of a kit or parts of a binary or ternary mixture may be mixed by the user himself in a spray tank and further auxiliaries may be added, if appropriate.","Mixing the compounds I or the compositions comprising them in the use form as fungicides with other fungicides results in many cases in an expansion of the fungicidal spectrum of activity being obtained or in a prevention of fungicide resistance development. Furthermore, in many cases, synergistic effects are obtained.","The following list of active substances, in conjunction with which the compounds I can be used, is intended to illustrate the possible combinations but does not limit them:","A) Respiration inhibitors",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021","list-style":"none"},"li":["Inhibitors of complex III at Qsite (e.g. strobilurins): azoxystrobin, coumethoxystrobin, coumoxystrobin, dimoxystrobin, enestroburin, fenaminstrobin, fenoxystrobin\/flufenoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin, kresoxim-methyl, metominostrobin, orysastrobin, picoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, pyrametostrobin, pyraoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, 2-[2-(2,5-dimethyl-phenoxymethyl)-phenyl]-3-methoxy-acrylic acid methyl ester and 2-(2-(3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1-methyl-allylideneaminooxymethyl)phenyl)-2-methoxyimino-N-methyl-acetamide, pyribencarb, triclopyricarb\/chlorodincarb, famoxadone, fenamidone;","inhibitors of complex III at Qsite: cyazofamid, amisulbrom, [(3S,6S,7R,8R)-8-benzyl-3-[(3-acetoxy-4-methoxy-pyridine-2-carbonyl)amino]-6-methyl-4,9-dioxo-1,5-dioxonan-7-yl] 2-methylpropanoate, [(3S,6S,7R,8R)-8-benzyl-3-[[3-(acetoxymethoxy)-4-methoxy-pyridine-2-carbonyl]amino]-6-methyl-4,9-dioxo-1,5-dioxonan-7-yl] 2-methylpropanoate, [(3S,6S,7R,8R)-8-benzyl-3-[(3-isobutoxycarbonyloxy-4-methoxy-pyridine-2-carbonyl)amino]-6-methyl-4,9-dioxo-1,5-dioxonan-7-yl] 2-methylpropanoate, [(3S,6S,7R,8R)-8-benzyl-3-[[3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethoxy)-4-methoxy-pyridine-2-carbonyl]amino]-6-methyl-4,9-dioxo-1,5-dioxonan-7-yl] 2-methylpropanoate;
