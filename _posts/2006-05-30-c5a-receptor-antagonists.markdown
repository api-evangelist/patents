This system is called complement system and consists of more than 30 soluble and membrane bound proteins. The complement system can be activated without or together with the adaptive immune system to eliminate, e.g., pathogenic bacteria. An uncontrolled activation or inadequate regulation of the complement system is related to a number of inflammatory diseases like septic shock, reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, transplant rejection, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), and glomerulonephritis. Numerous overviews over the relation between the complement system and diseases are published (e.g. Kirschfink 1997 Immunopharmacology 38: 51-62; Markides 1998 Pharmacological Reviews 50: 59-87, Walport 2001 The New England Journal of Medicine 344: 1140-1144, Walport 2001 The New England Journal of Medicine 344: 1058-66).","Activation of the complement system takes place via three different pathways. They are called classical, alternative, and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) way. All pathways proceed via the sequential processing and thus activation of pro-forms of proteases. As each activated protease can cleave and therefore activate the next pro-form, an amplification of the initial reaction is obtained. This is similar to the clotting cascade. An overview over the complement system is given by Sim and Laich (2000 Biochemical Society Transactions 28: 545-550).","Some of the most important proteins that are generated upon complement activation are C3a, C3b, C5a, and C5b. These proteins will be discussed in detail.","C3b is an essential part of a central protease of the complement cascade, the C5 convertase. C3b is part of the C5 convertase from both, the classical and alternative pathway of complement activation. The MLB pathway is proceeding via the convertases of the classical pathway, too.","The C5 convertase is responsible for the progress of the complement cascade and catalyses the cleavage of C5. Additionally, C3b is covalently attached to the surface of, e.g., bacteria which are thus more prone to phagocytosis by macrophages. Similar processes are described for immune complex clearance.","C3a is the smaller fragment that is produced in addition to C3b upon cleavage of C3. C3a is a comparatively weak chemokine and belongs to the anaphylatoxins.","C5b is formed upon cleavage of C5. This cleavage product is the starting point for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC forms a pore which perforates both plasma membranes of bacteria and endogenous cells. Due to the pore formation the perforated cells can be lysed.","C5a is the 74 amino acid N-terminal cleavage product of the \u03b1-chain of plasma protein C5 and is released by the activity of the C5 convertase. C5a is bound by its receptor which is referred to as C5a receptor C5aR1 or CD88, with high affinity and triggers a number of pro-inflammatory effects. It is one of the most potent chemokines and belongs as C3a to the anaphylatoxins. The C5aR can be found on many cells. This receptor is particularly found on neutrophils, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells.","C5a release is thought to be directly or indirectly responsible for many acute and chronic diseases as well as symptoms thereof. Examples for acute diseases and symptoms are septic shock, SIRS (systemic\/severe inflammatory response syndrome), MOF (multi organ failure) oder ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). An example for a chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Several systemic diseases cause local manifestations which can be treated with a C5a receptor antagonist.","Finally, C5a and its receptor are interesting targets also for infections and diseases associated therewith, i.e. inflammatory diseases as for instance mycarditis.","Due to the involvement of C5a and its receptor in several diseases and symptoms thereof, in the prior art several strategies were developed for the treatment of these.","C5a receptor antagonists, as reported in detail below, can be used for an intracorporal therapy as well as for an extracorporal treatment of blood and organs. For instance, for the treatment of dialysis patients or other patients observing thereby unwanted side effects, one should evaluate the possibility that e.g. the complement system might be activated at the artificial surfaces. Furthermore, such a treatment can be used to treat reperfusion injuries that can occur in patients undergoing revascularization or other treatments to increase or renew blood circulation, such as e.g. PTCA or thrombolysis, as well as in patients undergoing surgery during which the blood circulation is entirely or partially interrupted as e.g. during aneurysm surgery. An option is the extracorporal treatment of organs before being transplanted.","The C5a receptor (C5aR) is a particularly interesting target for the development of a drug for the treatment of C5a induced diseases and symptoms. This is especially the case due to the finding that mice lacking the receptor do not show an unusual phenotype (Hopken et al. 1996 Nature 383: 86-89). Thus it appears that blocking the C5a receptor probably does not have any negative effect. Merely, a higher sensitivity versus pseudomonad infection was observed in mice lacking the receptor. This means that the complement cascade with its useful functions for defense against pathogens (MAC formation) and immune complex clearance can still proceed in an unhindered manner even when the receptor is totally inactivated. Nevertheless, these animals are protected against ischemia reperfusion injury. For this reason, the inhibition of the C5a receptor appears more favorable than e.g. an inhibition of the complement system at the level of the cleavage of C5 or above.","Up to now several methods for the development of C5a receptor antagonists were used. Among them recombinant proteins, peptides and also few small molecules are known in the literature.","Examples for C5aR inhibitors based on the use of recombinant proteins are CGS 32359 (Ciba-Geigy, Pellas et al. 1998 Journal of Immunology 160: 5616-5621), \u0394pIII-A8 (Heller et al. 1999 Journal of Immunology 163: 985-994) and antibodies, which can be of recombinant or non-recombinant origin (Huber-Lang et al. 2001 Faseb Journal 15: 568-570). These C5aR antagonists are proteins and therefore expensive in production. They have comparatively high affinities and specificities but have the drawback of pronounced immunogenicity. In addition proteins can be effectively administered only by costly procedures such as, e.g., i.v. or s.c. injection.","Peptidic antagonists were developed following different strategies. For example the C-terminal sequence information of C5a was used for the development of peptidic C5aR antagonists. Peptides as therapeutically useable antagonists of the C5aR are advantageous over protein therapeutics because of lower production costs and reduced immunogenicity. Many peptidic antagonists are described in the literature. Examples for these peptidic C5aR antagonists or partial agonists are found in the following patents and patent applications: U.S. Pat. No. 4,692,511, U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,148, WO 9009162, WO 9211858, WO 9212168, WO 9221361, WO 9407518, WO 9407815, WO 9525957, WO 9606629, WO 9900406 and WO 9913899, WO 03033528, EP01498422 and WO05010030. However, disadvantages of peptides are often poor oral bioavailability or higher synthetic effort which is very disadvantageous especially for very long peptides composed of more than ten amino acids. Furthermore, peptidic bonds in peptides composed of proteinogenic amino acids can be cleaved e.g. via proteases in biological fluids.","For the therapy of chronic diseases the use of orally bioavailable so called small molecules is particularly advisable. This term usually refers to compounds with a molecular weight up to 1000 g\/mol, preferably up to 500 g\/mol, which have only few peptidic structural features, as e.g. peptide bonds. Examples of small molecule developments are amongst others L-156602 (Merck; Tsuji et al. 1992 Bioscience Biotechnologie and Biochemistry 56: 2034-2036), TAN-2474 (Takeda; JP10182648), RPR120033 (Rhone-Poulenc, Wong et al. 1999 IDrugs 2: 686), W-54011 (Mitsubishi Pharma, Sumichika et al. 2002 Journal of Biological Chemistry 277: 49403) and NGD 2000-1 (Neurogen, Shaw and Hutchison, 220th ACS National Meeting, Washington, D.C., August 2000). The development of these inhibitors is described in numerous patents and patent applications, as for instance in the following: WO0214265, WO0222556, WO0249993, WO03082829, WO03082828, WO03082826, WO03084524, WO04018460, US2004\/0048913, U.S. Pat.

No. 6,069,172, WO179189, WO02068377, WO03029187, WO02068377 and WO04043925.","Small molecules known up to now, which interact with the C5a receptor either as antagonist or agonist, are described in detail in the following section.","The first small molecule C5a receptor antagonist was developed by Merck Sharp and Dohme in the early 1990s. Successively, positively charged molecules as e.g. compounds 1 and 2 were identified (Merck, Lanza et al. 1992 J. Med. Chem. 35: 252). These compounds showed moderate binding activities of 3.3 and 12 \u03bcg\/ml (=8.9 and 35.5 \u03bcM, respectively). However, also undesired side effects were observed (compound 7 inhibited the fMLF-induced neutrophil activation) and no further development or data were described. Instead, Merck identified another series of C5a binding molecules (Merck, Laszlo et al. 1997 Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 7: 213) through screening of an in-house library. The molecules with the highest affinity for the C5a receptor were compounds 3 and 4. However, both compounds are agonists and the attempt to eliminate the agonistic activity, via modifications of the structure, failed. Other lead series as, e.g., benzodiazepine (L-747 981, Flanagan et al. 210th ACS National Meeting, Chicago, Ill., Aug. 20-24, 1995) or tetrahydroimidazopyridine (L-164 712, Kim et al. 210th ACS National Meeting, Chicago, Ill., Aug. 20-24, 1995) were also not successful in this respect. During the last years no development was announced by the company Merck in the area of C5a receptor antagonists.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0022"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"198.80mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08071810-20111206-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"76.28mm","wi":"53.68mm","file":"US08071810-20111206-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"The company Rh\u00f6ne-Poulenc-Rorer identified and optimized C5a receptor antagonists as well, but no further development was reported (Astles et al. 1997 Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 7: 907). A reason for that could be that even the most active compound 5 (RPR121154 and RPR120033) shows only a moderate activity of 0.8 \u03bcM. The compound contains a guanidino moiety, which often has a negative influence on oral bioavailability (Reiner et al. 1992 Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 12: 120).

The biological properties were specified only for a few compounds. To these belong 9 and 10, whose activity, in an assay concerning the inhibition of C5a induced calcium mobilization, was described to be 24 and 465 nM, respectively. However, further analysis of the compounds in a functional assay of C5a induced enzyme release by stablye transfected rat-basophil cells expressing the human C5a receptor (Example 28), shows that 9 and 10 have only a minor activity of 7152 nM or >4760 nM.

The compound 11 not only has got a poor activity (Example 28) but also the disadvantage of a poor shelf life (Example 25). For W-54011 a very high biologic activity was described: an ICvalue of 3.1, 2.7 and 1.6 nM for the rhC5a-induced calcium mobilization, chemotaxis and ROS release was respectively measured (Sumichika et al. 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277: 49403). Sumichika described the compound as being more active in a binding assay than the peptide mimetic PMX53 (a hexamer, cyclic peptide with the formula Ac-F[OPchaWR]) and even more active than an anti C5a receptor monoclonal antibody (Sumichika 2004 Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs 5: 505). In an enzyme release assay according to Example 28W-54011 shows an IC50 value of 90 nM which is notedly bigger than the ICvalue given in the previously described assay. Despite this still satisfactory activity, the compound has other disadvantages: the solubility in PBS-buffered aqueous solution is only 0.4 \u03bcM and the chemical synthesis requires an enantioselective step or an enantiomer separation, if there is the need to administer only one enantiomer.

Clinical studies were carried out solely with one of the small molecule C5a-inhibitors (NGD 2000-1 of the company Neurogen; Shaw and Hutchison, 220th ACS National Meeting, Washington, D.C., August 2000). Therein, the efficacy of the C5a inhibitor was proven for the indication rheumatoid arthritis (ACR improvement), however the properties of the substance (e.g. cytochrome inhibition) were not adequate for a higher dosage in human in a way to reach a clinically relevant therapeutic efficacy (press release of the company Neurogen, www.neurogen.com, 16.06.2004). It is therefore desirable that new improved C5a receptor antagonists are developed, which are suitable for oral administration.","The problem underlying the present application is the provision of C5aR antagonists. Another problem underlying the present invention is the provision of drugs that can be used for the treatment of diseases in which the C5a receptor and\/or C5a are involved in a causal, indirect or

accordance with the present disclosure using the compounds according to the invention or as defined in connection with any aspect of the present invention.","In connection with the present invention, the following terms and expressions are preferably used in an interchangeable manner, namely medicament, formulation, medication and pharmaceutical composition; invention-based compounds, compound based on the present invention, compounds of this invention, compounds of the present invention, and compounds in accordance with this\/the present invention. It will also be acknowledged by the ones skilled in the art that what is disclosed herein in connection with the one of these terms to be used and understood, respectively, in an interchangeable manner, is also disclosed for such other terms or any terms obviously used in an interchangeable manner.","The present invention is based on the surprising finding that the bi- and\/or tri-substituted urea compounds disclosed in the present invention which exhibit at least one aromatic substituent at each of either N-atoms of the urea compounds, are potent antagonists of the C5a receptor.","Furthermore, it was also surprisingly found that the advantageous properties arise in particular from the presence of the NR21R22 group at one of the two aromatic substituents of the urea derivatives disclosed in the present invention. This NR21R22 group in addition distinguishes the present compounds from the compounds claimed in the international patent applications WO0214265 and WO0222556 of the company Mitsubishi Pharma. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the NR21R22 group refers to an amino group.","Besides the high potency as C5a receptor antagonists, the described compounds possess a set of other favorable properties, e.g. higher specificity compared to the prior art, lower agonistic activity, higher affinity, higher solubility in water, longer shelf life, lower chemical reactivity, higher microsomal stability, or lower inhibition of P450 enzymes. In particular, this is also true for the compounds claimed in the international patent applications WO0214265 and WO0222556.","Without wishing to be bound by any theory in the following the present inventors assume that the NR21R22 group at the aromatic substituent is responsible for or involved in the improvement of a set of properties featured by the compounds in accordance with the present invention. This group can improve the solubility of the compounds in water, since it can favourably interact with water molecules. Due to the ability to form H-bonds, this group can also favour the binding to biological receptors, which could for instance explain the higher antagonistic activity. Due to a higher hydrophilic content, this group can improve the receptor specificity or decrease the cytochrome inhibition, since hydrophobic substances often tend to undergo unspecific binding and lead to high interaction with cytochromes.","Another aspect of the present invention is that some preferred compounds carry a stereo or chiral centre. Preferably, the stereo centre is in alpha position to one aromatic ring and more preferably the stereo centre possesses the (s)-configuration.","The (S)-configuration is accomplished for instance when the residue",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0382"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00052","num":"00052"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00052","he":"25.06mm","wi":"28.45mm","file":"US08071810-20111206-C00052.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0383"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00053","num":"00053"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00053","he":"25.06mm","wi":"28.45mm","file":"US08071810-20111206-C00053.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Choosing the ideal stereo centre for instance can positively influence the antagonistic activity of a compound.","Despite the positive properties of several compounds carrying a stereo centre, also compounds without a stereo centre show very favorable properties.

Furthermore, this is preferably to be administered to a patient who is in need for such treatment or prevention.","Diseases that are preferably associated in conjunction with the various aspects of the present invention are preferably those involved directly, i.e. causal, indirectly, or symptomatically with the C5a or C5a receptor. Preferred are also inflammatory diseases associated with an activation of the complete system.","Without wishing to be bound to specific details in the following, the presenting inventors are currently focusing on two fundamental pathogenic mechanisms of C5a. The first mechanism involves processes that are triggered directly by the effect of C5a on cells that express the C5a receptor. Cell types that express the receptor include the following: astrocytes, microglia, neurons, granulocytes (neutrophiles, basophiles, eosinophiles), mast cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, macrophages, T cells, dentritic cells, hepatic cells, cells of the kidney (e.g. glomeruli and the tubolointerstitium), the lungs and the smooth muscles. The direct action of C5a is very diverse and depends on the observed cell type. Examples of direct action are chemotaxis and degranulation of granulocytes. Degranulation, in turn, subsequently leads to the indirect effect of damaging surrounding tissues (e.g. by matrix metalloproteases, oxygen radicals, elastase, etc.). A further direct effect is the delay of apoptosis in neutrophiles by C5a (Perianayagam et al. 2004 European Journal of Clinical Investigations 34: 50) or the production of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 in mast cells and basophiles (Wojita 2002 Blood 100: 517). The second fundamental pathogenic mechanism include processes that are induced indirectly via C5a. This includes influencing the adaptive immune defence by C5a and changes in the cytokine pattern, which can be observed by the effect of C5a on cytokine secreting cells (Jauneau et al. 2003 FEBS Letters 537: 17). These effects are also induced by cells that do not belong to the inherited immune system: the C5a receptor is also found on T cells (Nataf et al. 1999 Journal of Immunology 162: 4018), B cells or antigen presenting cells (APCs). The altered cytokine pattern can lead to different differentiation of T cells into Th1 or Th2 cells primarily through a dosage-dependent change in release of IL-12 (Hawlisch et al. 2004 Molecular Immunology 41: 123). Further important cytokines that influence T cell differentiation are, for example, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-23 and IL-27. Similar results are also known from genetically modified mouse strains lacking the C5 gene. These animals produce significantly less IL-12 than the corresponding control strains.","The cytokine pattern altered by C5a can also result in the immune system being less effective in combating intracellular parasites (e.g. viruses, leishmania, rickettsia, chlamydia, coxiella, plasmodia, brucella, mycobacteria, listeria, toxoplasma, trypanosomes). Hawlisch et al. (2005 Immunity 22: 415) showed that mice that do not express the C5a receptor are significantly more resistant to leishmania infection than the corresponding control animals expressing the functional receptor. This means it is possible that diseases caused by intracellular parasites or viruses can be treated or treatment can be supported by using a C5a receptor antagonist according to this invention for therapy or supportive therapy.","The impact of influencing the cytokine pattern is not limited to changing the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells. However, for many diseases it has been shown that changes in this balance are decisive for their pathogenesis (Bamias et al. 2001 Current Opinion Investigational Drugs 11: 1279; Lucey et al. 1996 Clinical Microbiology Reviews 9: 532).","Finally, numerous processes are indirectly influenced by C5a. Here, of course, organs and cells that express very little or no C5a receptors can also be affected.","It is often not possible to separate the two pathogenic mechanisms such that any disease can clearly be ascribed to one of the two processes. One can however assume that the first pathogenic mechanism is more important in acute inflammatory reactions, while the second pathogenic mechanism plays a role in chronic and immune or autoimmune diseases. But the dividing line is diffuse, as shown, for example, by acute sepsis, where in animal models a C5a blockade (knock-out animals, antibodies or antagonists) can relieve disturbances in chemotaxis and the oxidative burst of neutrophiles, as well as positively influence the cytokine pattern (cytokine storm) (Huber-Lang et al. 2002 FASEB Journal 16: 1567; Ward 2004 Nature Review Immunology 4: 133; Riedenmann et al. 2003 Immunity 19: 193, Riedenmann et al. 2003 Nature Medicine 9: 517; Czermak et al. 1999 Nature Medicine 5: 788, Huber-Lang et al. 2001 FASEB Journal 15: 568, Huber-Lang et al. 2001 Journal of Immunology 166: 1193).","The source of C5a is of secondary importance. It is possible that C5a is released through activation of the complement system (e.g. the classical, alternative or MBL pathways) or directly from certain cells (e.g. phagocytotic cells) (Huber-Lang 2002 American Journal of Pathology 161: 1849).","Examples for acute indications, or indications that can proceed with acute phases, associated with C5a, and therefore that could be treated with a compound of this invention or medication of this invention are asthma (K\u00f6hl 2001 Molecular Immunology 38: 51), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, Colitis ulcerosa) (Woodruff et al. 2003 Journal of Immunology 171: 5514), sepsis or septic shock (Huber-Lang et al. 2001 Faseb Journal 15: 568), severe burn injuries (Piccolo et al. 1999 Experimental and Molecular Pathology 66: 220) and the acute consequences of severe burn injuries (organ failure, shock, sepsis, SIRS), multiple sclerosis (Mullerladner et al. 1996 Journal of Neurological Science 144: 135) and reperfusion damage to different organs such as the heart (heart attack), spleen, bladder, pancreas, stomach, lungs, liver, kidneys, extremities, brain, (stroke), muscles or intestines (Riley et al. 2000 Journal of Thoriacic and Cardiovascular Surgery 120: 350).","Based on the two pathogenic mechanisms described also all inflammatory or immuno-inflammatory diseases could be treated or undergo preventative treatment using the compounds of the present invention. K\u00f6hl (2001 Molecular Immunology 38: 51) provides an overview of the inflammatory diseases associated with C5a.","Immune complex associated diseases (Heller et al. 1999 Journal of Immunology 163: 985) are similarly diseases that could be treated with the C5a receptor antagonists of the present invention. An example of an immune complex associated or immune complex induced disease is glomerulonephritis.","Accordingly, diseases caused by infections, such as myocarditis, also belong to those diseases that could be treated with one of the compounds or medications of the present invention. Similarly, a therapeutic procedure with a C5a receptor antagonist is possible with several diseases of the eye, such as uveitis, age-related macular degradation, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema, ocular pemphigoid, keratoconjunctivitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Graves' opthalmopathy.","It could be shown in an animal model of age-related macular degradation (AMD) that the pro-inflammatory part of the disease is induced by C5a, among other things (Ambati et al. 2003 Nature Medicine 9: 1390). Therefore, this indication is also a candidate for therapy with one of the compounds of this invention.","In accordance with the novel approach to influence T cell populations and other cell types, respectively, which are affected by an altered cytokine pattern, by a C5a receptor antagonist according to the present invention, it is possible, for example, to also influence primarily T cell induced immune responses. Such an application opens up the possibility of treating a large spectrum of difficult to treat immune or autoimmune diseases with the compounds and medications, respectively, according to the present invention. In particular, the group of autoimmune diseases includes, but is not limited to, the following diseases: Alopecia greata, cold agglutinin immunohemolytic anemia (cold agglutinin disease), warm antibody immunohemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia (Biermer's disease, Addison's anemia), antiphospholipid antibody syndrom (APS), arteriitis temporalis, atherosclerosis, autoimmune adrenalitis (autoimmune adrenal cortex athrophy, Addison's disease), chronic fatigue\/immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic-inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Cogan's syndrome, ulcerative colitis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus type I, dermatitis herpetiformis, dermatomyositis, fibromyalgia, chronic autoimmune gastritis, Goodpasture syndrome (anti-GBM antibody related glomerulonephritis), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS; Polyradiculoneuropathy), Hashimoto thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, immunothrombocytopenice purpura (Werlhof's disease), autoimmune infertility, autoimmune inner ear deafness (AIED), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune cardiomyopathy, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, Lichen sclerosis, Lupus erythematosus (particularly the dicoide form), Lyme arthritis (Lyme's disease), collagenosis, Basedow's disease (Graves' disease), Beh\u00e7et disease, Bechterev's disease (ankylosing spndylitis), Crohn's disease, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, Reiter's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS, encephalomyelitis), myasthenia gravis (myasthenia), sympathic ophtalmia, scaring pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, polyarteriitis nodosa, polychondritis (panchondritis), polyglandular autoimmune (PGA) syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymoysitis, primary biliary cirrhosis (primary autoimmune cholangitis), psoriasis, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis (Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann's disease), Sj\u00f6rgen's syndrome, scleroderma, sprue\/celiac disease, stiff-man syndrome (Moersch-Woltmann syndrome), systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu arteritis (aortic arch syndrome), transient gluten intolerance, urticaria, autoimmune uveitis, vasculitis and vitiligo (white spot disease).","Vasculites have to be considered as a form of immune or autoimmune diseases. In more detail: They are a group of different inflammatory diseases of the vessels. Primary and secundary vasculites are sub-groups of the vasculites. Primary vasculites are triggered by autoantibodies found in patients. One primarily preferred group of vasculites which can be treated with the compounds according to the invention is the group of vasculites which are triggered by cytoplasmatic anti-neutrophile antibodies (ANCA). To this group belongs e.g. Wegener's disease (Wegener's granulomatosis), Churg-Strauss syndrome and microscopic polyangiitis. Secondary vasculites are e.g. drug-induced vasculites and vasculites which are induced through diseases like AIDS, hepatitis B or C, or cytomegaly-virus infection.","In the course of the primary disease forms, leukoplastic vasculitis and\/or tissue infiltration with eosinophils which is also called Churg-Strauss syndrome can occur. The diseases are characterized by e.g. a deposit of immune complexes and an activation of the complement system. Additionally the autoantibodies against the neutrophils activate them, leading to the production and release of reactive oxygen. This leads additionally to a damage of e.g. endothelial cells. Neutrophils and other leukocytes carry the C5a receptor and can be activated by binding of C5a.","Without therapy Wegner's disease can be rapidly fatal. Mostly patients die because of acute lung or renal failure. The current treatment includes unspecific suppression of the excessive immune response with drugs like cyclophosphamide, glucocorticoids, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine or leflunomide. These therapies are associated with numerous side effects like increased infections and decrease in white blood cell counts. Therefore, a more targeted and safer therapy for this indication is needed and can be provided by treatment with compounds according to the present invention.","The term urticaria covers a whole range of different forms of blister rashes. They are divided into spontaneous (acute and chronic urticaria) and physical urticaria (urticaria factitia, urticaria e frigore, urticaria e calore, urticaria mechanica, urticaria solaris) (Zuberbier et al. 2001 Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings 6: 123). In addition, there are particular forms of urticaria such as cholinergic urticaria, adrenergic urticaria, contact urticaria and urticaria caused by water.","Particularly for chronic urticaria it has been shown experimentally that the complement system and particularly C5a participate in the release of histamine in the course of the disease (Kaplan et al. 2004 Current Reviews of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 114: 465). A therapy for urticaria with C5a inhibitors would seem a highly appropriate a novel approach.","A further aspect of the indirect action of C5a is, for example, fibrosis. The chemotaxis of neutrophiles and other leucocytes to the location of an inflammation induced by C5a can in part resulting from this infiltration lead to increased fibrosis there. However, C5a can also act directly on cells from the affected organs resulting in increased fibrotic events. C5a inhibition reduces the degree of fibrosis in a number of organs and diseases. Examples of this are liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, fibrosis in the kidneys, skin and other organs. Fibrotic events also occur with myocardial infarction and can play a decisive role in reduced ejection performance of the heart following healing of the infarction. Similarly, reduced, or loss of function of kidneys and other organs following transplantation can be traced back to fibrosis and other factors. Therefore the C5a receptor antagonists of this invention could be used to prevent or reduce fibrotic events.","Based on the pathogenic mechanisms described, there are further applications for the compounds according to the present invention which are also referred to herein as invention-based compounds: for support and follow-up treatment of patients receiving organ transplants such as kidneys, liver, lung, heart, skin (particularly self donors with burn injuries), cornea, pancreas or intestine. This can act positively on the acute rejection reaction (by reducing reperfusion damage) and the chronic rejection reaction (by modulating the cytokine pattern). C5a plays a direct or indirect role in each of these processes. Therefore, transplantation is a potential application area for C5a receptor antagonists of this invention.","Another option is the use of a substance or compound of this invention, or at least a preparation derived from one of these, for conserving organs to be transplanted. In one embodiment a C5a receptor antagonist should be used to pre-treat the donor, and treat the organ and\/or the recipient. Preferably, the compound of this invention would be used, more preferably the same compound of this invention would be used at all stages of the procedure. A combined treatment of the organ, donor and\/or recipient also seems to be appropriate. Such organs could be, for example, kidneys, liver, lung, heart, skin (particularly self donors with burn injuries), cornea, pancreas or intestine.","In principle every surgical event represents a trauma that according to its severity could well be treated with a C5a receptor antagonist of the present invention. Examples here are CABG, PTCA, PTA, MidCAB, OPCAB, thrombolysis, organ transplantation, aneurysmal operations and vascular occlusion (clamping). One additional aspect is reducing or preventing possible neurocognitive dysfunction or local and\/or systemic reperfusion damage resulting from extra-corporal circulation (e.g. heart-lung machine or dialysis). In particular, this could be used as a prophylactic approach by treating the patient before surgery or reperfusion.","Several systemic diseases result in local manifestations that could be treated with a C5a receptor antagonist. Examples here are the local manifestations of rheumatism, SLE and type I and II diabetes, which can affect the eyes, brain, blood vessels, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, skin, bones, lymphatic system and the blood.","In addition, C5a receptor antagonists could be usefully used to prevent or treat haemorrhagic shock if large amounts of fluid have to be administered to stabilize the circulatory system. The condition of haemorrhagic shock is comparable with systemic ischaemia. If the circulation is restabilized by the infusion of liquid, this results in a situation comparable to reperfusion damage.","A therapy with a medicament or medication of the present invention can be carried out alone or with other therapeutic agents. Here, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapeutic agents are particularly well-suited. Here, the term combination therapy is preferably used to mean the combination of two or more therapeutically active compounds. The combination can be carried out on several levels and includes, but is not limited to, the following examples. The combination can be a pharmaceutical formulation including two or at least two of several therapeutically active compounds. A further embodiment can comprise two or at least two of several therapeutically active compounds that are contained in two or more different pharmaceutical formulations, but the formulations are contained in one package, usually accompanied by instructions, which describe the temporal relationship in applying, administering or taking these formulations. Finally, in terms of a preferred finalized form, a combination can also comprise two or at least two of several therapeutically active compounds in different formulations and in different packaging. Preferably, at least one of the packages should contain instructions describing the temporal relationship in applying, administering or taking these formulations. In the context of combination therapies as preferably described here, it is within the framework of the presented invention that the term for various formulations also includes those embodiments containing different formulations, and the differences in the formulations depend ultimately on the therapeutically active compound contained in the formulation.","There are currently already therapeutic procedures for most of the disease whose pathogenic mechanism can be treated with an C5a receptor antagonist of this invention. In many cases, however, these procedures are unsatisfactory and\/or the side-effects of the administered medications are high. It is therefore desirable to improve the therapeutic effect of an existing therapy or one under development, or to reduce the dosage of therapeutic agents with side-effects, through combinations with an invention-based C5a receptor antagonist. Described below are several existing therapies and the medications or drugs used, which within the framework of the present invention could be used in conjunction with the compounds and\/or medications of this invention.","In connection with the indication transplantation immunosuppressive therapeutic agents are used in particular to prevent chronic transplant rejection. The mechanism of action of current immunosuppressive agents is quite different from the mechanism of action of the compounds of this invention. Therefore one might expect an additive or synergistic effect of the two therapy approaches. A combination comprising current immunosuppressive agents and the compounds of this invention is therefore very appropriate. Examples of current immunosuppressive agents are calcineurin inhibitors or other substances such as cyclosporin A, methotrexate, azathioprine, FK506 (tacrolimus), rapamycin, leflunomide, mycophenolatemofetil, brequinar, mizoribin and deoxyspergualin. These immunosuppressive agents are also used for other indications. A combination comprising the compounds of this invention and immunosuppressive agents is therefore relevant for other indications such as: Alopecia greata, cold agglutinin immunohemolytic anemia (cold agglutinin disease), warm antibody immunohemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia (Biermer's disease, Addison's anemia), antiphospholipid antibody syndrom (APS), arteriitis temporalis, atherosclerosis, autoimmune adrenalitis (autoimmune adrenal cortex athrophy, Addison's disease), chronic fatigue\/immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic-inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Cogan's syndrome, ulcerative colitis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus type I, dermatitis herpetiformis, dermatomyositis, fibromyalgia, chronic autoimmune gastritis, Goodpasture syndrome (anti-GBM antibody related glomerulonephritis), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS; Polyradiculoneuropathy), Hashimoto thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, immunothrombocytopenice purpura (Werlhof's disease), autoimmune infertility, autoimmune inner ear deafness (AIED), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune cardiomyopathy, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, Lichen sclerosis, Lupus erythematosus (particularly the dicoide form), Lyme arthritis (Lyme's disease), collagenosis, Basedow's disease (Graves' disease), Beh\u00e7et disease, Bechterev's disease (ankylosing spndylitis), Crohn's disease, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, Reiter's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS, encephalomyelitis), myasthenia gravis (myasthenia), sympathic ophtalmia, scaring pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, polyarteriitis nodosa, polychondritis (panchondritis), polyglandular autoimmune (PGA) syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymoysitis, primary biliary cirrhosis (primary autoimmune cholangitis), psoriasis, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis (Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann's disease), Sj\u00f6rgen's syndrome, scleroderma, sprue\/celiac disease, stiff-man syndrome (Moersch-Woltmann syndrome), systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu arteritis (aortic arch syndrome), transient gluten intolerance, urticaria, autoimmune uveitis, vasculitis and vitiligo (white spot disease).","Urticaria is primarily treated with anti-histamine agents. It is known, for example, that with chronic urticaria C5a plays a vital role in the activation of mast cells via autoantibodies that bind to the IgE-receptor or the Fc region of IgE. Therefore, a combination of anti-histamine and the therapeutic agents of this invention is relevant and also promises relief from the disease symptoms in patients who respond poorly or not all to anti-histamine agents.","Glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisolon) are used in a large number of different indications. These substances can be used particularly for diseases involving inflammatory or autoimmune responses. Examples of diseases where combination therapy with glucocorticoids and C5a receptor antagonists are relevant are: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, COPD, uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis, asthma, Bechterew's disease, multiple sclerosis, Wegener's disease and many other immune and autoimmune diseases.","Bacterial and other infections can overload the human immune system and\/or a systemic infection can set in motion a massive activation of the defence mechanisms, which can lead to adverse reactions in those affected. The most prominent example is septic shock, which can be triggered by, for example, a systemic bacterial infection or the release of sufficient amounts of LPS, for example, from local infection foci. An important reason for the adverse systemic effects of an infection lies in the release of C5a. Therefore, antimicrobial therapies with antibiotics offer a particular opportunity for combination with C5a receptor antagonists. Examples of antibiotic classes suited to combination therapies are amynoglycosides, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics, gyrase inhibitors, lincosamides, macrolide antibiotics, nitroimidazole derivatives, polypeptide antibiotics, sulfonamides, trimethoprim and tetracycline.","Anti-inflammatory therapeutic antibodies or other anti-inflammatory proteins, nucleic acids and their derivatives, as well as peptides and small molecules that, for example, inhibit the action or effects of pro-inflammatory molecules, or support the action of anti-inflammatory molecules (e.g. IL-10), are preferably well-suited for a combination therapy with the C5a receptor antagonists of this invention. Most of the substances listed here can be grouped in the class of biologicals and are substances that mostly show a very specific mechanism.","Often it is useful to modify several pathways within a biological system in order to achieve a better effect. Therefore, it is particularly advantageous to combine C5a receptor antagonists of this invention with inhibitors of pro-inflammatory molecules.","Examples of pro-inflammatory molecules whose action could be inhibited in combination with invention-based C5a receptor antagonists in order to achieve a better therapeutic effect include: IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, TNF\u03b1, \u03b14\u03b27, \u03b15\u03b21, BlyS, cadherin, CCR2, CD11a, CD11b, CD125, CD130, CD16, CD18, CD2, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD28, CD3, CD30, CD4, CD40, CD40L, CD44, CD45R, CD54, CD62E, CD62L, CD8, CD80, CD95, CEP, gastrin-R, complement C1 or C1-esterase, complement factor 5, complement factor D, complement MBL, complement receptor 1, CRTH2 receptor, CTGF, E- and P-selectin, eotaxin, factor IX, FGF-20, Fg1-2, GM-CSFr, GP IIb\/IIIa receptor, HMG1, IgE, thymocytes, IFN\u03b3, IFNr, IP-10, MCP-1, M-CSF receptor, MIF, MMP9, PDGF-D, P-selectin, TGF\u03b21, tissue factor, TrkA (tyrosine kinase receptor), VAP-1, VCAM-1, VEGF, VLA1 and vWF. Inhibition of the pro-inflammatory molecules from the list can be achieved, for example, by antibodies, soluble receptors or other natural or artificial inactivating binding partners, aptameres, Spiegelmers, RNAi, antisense molecules or small molecules.","Besides drusen formation, neogenesis of blood vessels is an important disease characteristic in AMD. Amongst other factors, the in growth of blood vessels leads to a loss of eyesight in patients. Currently, AMD patients are treated with photodynamic therapy. In addition, antibodies against VEGF and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 are being developed for AMD therapy. A combination of these therapy approaches with an C5a receptor antagonist of this invention is therefore preferred.","Generally anti-inflammatory or pain relieving therapeutic agents such as acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, are also well-suited for use in a combination therapy with C5a receptor antagonists of this invention. Those affected by rheumatic diseases represent an example of a patient collective that would profit from such a kind of combination treatment.","Like the components of the complement cascade, the components of the kinin cascade and the blood clotting system are located in blood plasma. In addition to the complement system, the kinin system is also activated by artificial surfaces or other triggers such as burns or sepis. This suggests a close connection between the complement cascade, the kinin cascade and the blood clotting system. A close connection between the three pathways is also suggested by the fact that the C1-esterase inhibitor (C1Inh, a naturally existing protein) not only inhibits the complement system but also the kinin system and the intrinsic pathway of blood clotting. Therefore, it is primarily preferred to combine antagonists of the end products of the kinin system, such as bradykinin, desArg-bradykinin, kalidin and desArg-kalidin, with C5a inhibitors of this invention. An example of one of such antagonists that seems suitable for combination is icatibant (a BRantagonist). Similarly well-suited is the combination with inhibitors of the kinin cascade or blood clotting system. Examples for indications where a combination of two or three inhibitors from the kinin, clotting and complement cascades would be particularly relevant are, for example, reperfusion damage (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, intestine, brain or skin), severe burns and septic shock. Most preferred is the combination of bradykinin-receptor antagonists with C5a receptor antagonists. The combination of therapeutic agents that inhibit the kinin cascade or inhibitors of the kinin receptors BRand BR, such as icatibant, with the compounds of this invention would be highly preferred. The influence of bradykinin on the inherited immune response has been shown (Aliberti et al. 2003 Journal of Immunology 170: 5349), and it is apparent that particularly BRantagonists are suited for a combination therapy with compounds of this invention in order to specifically act on the inherited immune response through two targets. A new aspect of this invention is thus influencing the inherited immune response with a combination therapy comprising C5a receptor antagonists and BRantagonists. It was shown that bradykinin receptors also play an important role in connection with intracellular parasites (, Scharfstein et al. 2003 FASEB Journal 17: 73). A combination of a C5a inhibitor and a bradykinin antagonist is also relevant for these indications.","Further possible targets for combination therapy with a C5a receptor antagonist are p38 MAP kinase, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4), the NO system (NO synthase) and IL-1\u03b2 converting enzyme (caspase-1).","The combination of a C5a receptor antagonist with an other medicament refers not only to the C5a receptor antagonists of this invention but also to the a C5a receptor antagonists that come under the claims of the application WO2005\/010030, which are included here through disclosure by reference.

Non-limiting examples are the conversion of the carboxyl group to salts, esters, acylhydrazides, hydroxamic acids or amides, and the conversion of the amino group to amides, ureas, thioureas, thioamides, sulfonamides, phosphoric acid amides, boric acid amides or alkyl amines. Parts of compounds, which result from modifications of amino acids at the C and\/or N-terminus, can also be referred to as amino acid units. Furthermore, amino acids derivatives can also represent amino acids derivatized at their side chains. If amino acid derivative represents such an amino acid, whereby the side chain is modified one or several times, it is usually specifically indicated herein. A preferred derivatisation of the side chain may be made in particular at positions, at which the side chain carries a functional group. Preferred functional groups are, for example, an amino group, a carboxyl group, a thiol group or an alcohol group.","Amino acid analogues are compounds, which result from amino acids by replacing the amino and\/or carboxyl group by other groups which can mimic them. Non-limiting examples are the incorporation of thioamides, ureas, thioureas, acylhydrazides, esters, alkyl amines, sulfonamides, phosphoric acid amides, ketones, alcohols, boronic acid amides, benzodiazepines and other aromatic or non-aromatic heterocycles (for a review see M. A. Estiarte, D. H. Rich in Burgers Medicinal Chemistry, 6edition, volume 1, part 4, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2002).","The biological binding characteristics of an amino acid unit as described herein are preferable those binding characteristics shown by the respective amino acid during the interaction with a biological molecule. Biological molecules are especially molecules exerting a biological function. Non-limiting examples of such biological molecules are protein- or peptide-based receptors.","Groups or units, which mimic or imitate the biological binding characteristics of an amino acid, are defined as groups, which can interact in a way identical or similar to the amino acid itself with a receptor or interacting partner, preferably a biological receptor or a biological interaction partner. For the selection of such groups it is preferred to take into consideration those which are the most wide-spread ones in terms of most preferred interactions of the respective amino acids with biological receptors. For example, the oxygen atom of a carbonyl group of an amino acid can function as hydrogen bond acceptor, whereas the NH proton can act as hydrogen bond donor. Additionally, amino acids can interact with receptors via their side chains. Phenylalanine and tryptophane can establish both hydrophobic interactions via the methylene side chain or the aromatic groups and \u03c0-\u03c0-interactions via the aromatic groups. Additionally, the indole group of the tryptophane can serve as a hydrogen bond donor via its NH group. Cyclohexylalanine and norleucine can, in principle, establish hydrophobic interactions with biological receptors via their alkyl and\/or cycloalkyl side chains. Not only the complete side chain of an amino acid, but also parts of the side chain can establish important interactions.","If a group or a unit, which is to mimic or imitate the biological binding characteristics of an amino acid or shall exhibit this characteristic, is capable of establishing at least one of the above-mentioned interactions of the respective amino acid, then this group or unit can mimic its biological binding characteristics.","As used herein, in connection with group definitions, the term \u201cand respective derivatives thereof\u201d refers to the fact that all derivatives of the individual compounds, groups of compounds, parts of molecules, radicals or chemical groups can be present as derivatives.","Most preferable C5a receptor antagonists are the

The reason for the decrease of the neutrophils in the circulation is their binding to the vessel walls due to the C5a stimulus. These processes of neutrophil recruitment are playing an important role in many other diseases like reperfusion injury. This model was also described by Short et al. (1999 British Journal of Pharmacology 125: 551-554).","Male gerbils () are anaesthesized i.p. with ketamine (80 mg\/kg) and xylazine (12 mg\/kg).
