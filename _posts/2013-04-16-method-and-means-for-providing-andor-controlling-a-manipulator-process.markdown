By way of example, a welding current is to be switched on or off, an adhesive or paint nozzle is to be opened or closed, or a clamping fixture is to be opened or closed, at sections, in order to enable the passage of a manipulator-guided tool.","For this, it is known in the field to define switching points, referred to as switching path-points in the following, by means of a switching point routine, which includes a subroutine for executing the action, basically in the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":". . ."},{"entry":"SLIN P"},{"entry":"TRIGGER WHEN PATH=abstand [:distance] DELAY=Zeit"},{"entry":"[:Time]DOUnterroutine[:Subroutine]"},{"entry":"SLIN Q"},{"entry":". . ."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"A switching path-point is defined by this switching point routine TRIGGER, between the path points P and Q at a distance Abstand from the end pointQ of the section of the manipulator path defined as a Cartesian line by SLIN Q. When arriving at the switching path-point defined in this manner, after (or before, respectively, when Zeit<0) the time Zeit, the action defined by the subroutine Unterroutine is executed, e.g. a welding current is switched on, an adhesive or paint nozzle, or a clamping fixture, is opened.","When traveling along a defined manipulator path it may be necessary to retrace a section, e.g. after detecting a disruption in the process.","The disadvantage with retracing the path in this manner is that the switching point routines explained above are not executed. If, for example, a clamping fixture must be opened in order to enable the passage of a manipulator-guided tool, it is not automatically re-opened during the retracing of the path by the switching point routine\u2014which only functions with respect to forward movement between points P and Q.","The object of the present invention is to improve a manipulator process.","This object is achieved by a method having the features of claim . Claim  places a means for executing such a method under protection. The dependent claims relate to advantageous further developments.","One aspect of the present invention relates to a manipulator process for a manipulator assembly having one or more manipulators, in particular industrial robots. The manipulator process has a defined, oriented manipulator path for the manipulator assembly. A manipulator path is understood in the present case to be, in particular, a discreet or continuous sequence of positions, in particular positions and\/or orientations of one or more permanent reference points for the manipulator, in particular a TCP for a manipulator, and\/or poses, in particular joint coordinates, for one or more manipulators. The manipulator path can be defined, in particular, by specifying discreet, in particular learned, path points, and by specifying a path between these path points, such as a straight line or circle segment, in the workspace or configuration space, or also by specifying a mapping or relation, e.g. a spline function in the workspace or configuration space. An oriented manipulator path is understood in the present case, in particular, to be a manipulator path having a defined directional orientation or travel orientation, which can be defined, for example, by a series of points that are to be approached and\/or passed over.","For this manipulator process, or the manipulator path thereof, according to one aspect of the present invention, one or more actions can be defined and\/or executed in this manipulator process or the during the traveling of its manipulator path, respectively. An action as set forth in the present invention can comprise, in particular, be, a logical and\/or mathematical computing and\/or storage operation, in particular the assignment of a variable, and\/or a control of the manipulator assembly, in particular one or more manipulator-guided tools and\/or tools that are permanently installed in the environment, and\/or processing means. An action as set forth in the present invention can, for example, be the assignment of a value to an identifier, the providing of current to a manipulator-guided welding tongs, or the closing of a clamping device permanently installed in the environment.","One or more of these actions can be defined and\/or executed, depending on a reverse movement initiated by an event, running in the opposite direction of the oriented manipulator path, and\/or a return movement of the manipulator assembly running in the same direction as the oriented manipulator path. An event initiated movement is understood in the present case, in particular, to mean a movement of the manipulator assembly that is initiated, or executed, due to an external, in particular, not specified, and\/or not normal, event. In one embodiment, an event initiated reverse movement can be triggered by a manual input from a user, by actuating a reverse button, for example, and\/or by a signal, in particular a malfunction signal, or by the actuation of an emergency stop, a deviation from the manipulator path, an erroneous value for the welding current when the supply of inert gas is interrupted, or suchlike. In one embodiment, an event initiated movement is characterized in that it does not always occur at the same path point during every travel of the defined manipulator path, and\/or depends on other ancillary conditions, not belonging to the manipulator path.","A reverse movement in the opposite direction is understood, in the present case, to mean, in particular, a movement of the manipulator assembly, in particular one or more manipulators, which\u2014at least in sections\u2014occurs in the opposite direction to the oriented manipulator path. The reverse movement can have, in particular, a starting point, which lies on the manipulator path, i.e. starting from the manipulator path, and runs in the opposite direction of the manipulator path, on a local basis, with respect to this starting point. The reverse movement can have a section that is parallel to the manipulator path. A parallel section is understood in the present case, in particular, to mean a congruent section in the workspace or configuration space, e.g. a parallel straight line, a concentric circle segment, or suchlike. In particular, the parallel section can also be identical to a section of the manipulator path that is to be traveled in the opposite direction, i.e. the reverse movement can occur\u2014at least in sections\u2014on the manipulator path. Likewise, the reverse movement can include a section leading away from the manipulator path, to which, in particular, a parallel section can adjoin, such that the manipulator path can be traveled in the opposite direction, with an offset, or a displacement thereto, during the reverse movement.","A return movement in the same direction is understood, in the present case, to mean, in particular, a movement of the manipulator assembly, in particular one or more manipulators, which follows\u2014at least in sections\u2014the oriented manipulator path in its normal direction. The return movement in the same direction can occur in one embodiment, following a reverse movement in the opposite direction, in particular immediately, or after a pause, and\/or include an end point that lies on the manipulator path, and with respect thereto, the return movement can be in the same direction as the manipulator path on a local basis. The end point, or its projection, respectively, can be identical to the starting point of a preceding reverse movement, or its projection, respectively, or\u2014in the travel direction of the manipulator path\u2014lie in front of or behind said point. In one embodiment, travel is continued along the defined manipulator path after an event initiated travel along the reverse movement or the return movement, starting at the end point thereof.","The return movement can likewise include a section that is parallel to the manipulator path, in particular, it can be identical to a section\u2014that is to be traveled again in the normal direction\u2014i.e. the return movement can\u2014at least in sections\u2014occur on the manipulator path. Likewise, the return movement can include a section that returns to the manipulator path, in particular in order to compensate for an offset, or displacement resulting from a preceding reverse movement.","One or more of the actions can be specified or executed, respectively, as a function of the reverse movement. In particular, it may be provided that one or more actions are executed selectively, in particular also, or only, during the reverse movement. Thus, for example, a clamping fixture, which has been closed during the travel along the defined manipulator path after the passage of a manipulator-guided tool, is again opened during a reverse movement.","In addition, or alternatively, one or more actions can be specified or executed as a function of the return movement. In particular, it may be provided that one or more actions are executed selectively, in particular also, or only, during the return movement. Thus, for example, a clamping fixture that is re-opened during a reverse movement is again closed during a return movement after the passage of a manipulator-guided tool.","One or more actions can be specified or executed, in particular, during or after the completion of a reverse movement and\/or a return movement. By way of example, it may be practical to re-execute actions that are executed at the start of the manipulator process, such as a visual or acoustic warning, a rinsing, tempering, or suchlike, upon completion of the reverse movement and\/or the return movement. Likewise, one or more actions can also be executed during the reverse or return movement, in particular as a function of the position of the manipulator assembly in relation to the defined manipulator path.","One or more actions can be specified or executed in a different manner, in one embodiment, as a function of the reverse movement and\/or the return movement. This is understood to mean, in the present case, in particular, that one action\u2014by way of example, the assignment of a value to a variable or the opening of a clamp designating fixture\u2014is specified for a reverse movement, or can be executed during a reverse movement, respectively, and a different action\u2014by way of example, the assignment of another value to the variable, or the closing of a clamp designating fixture\u2014is specified for a return movement, or can be executed during a return movement, respectively. Additionally, or alternatively, the same, or a different, action\u2014by way of example, the assignment of another value to the variables\u2014can be specified for the travel along the defined manipulator path, or can be executed during the travel along the defined manipulator path, respectively. In general, it is provided thereby that the action for the normal travel along the defined manipulator path, the event initiated execution of a reverse movement and\/or a, in particular subsequent thereto, return movement, can be specified in different ways, or can be executed selectively. An action can be also executed in different ways, in particular, in that it can be executed or not executed selectively.","As explained in the above introduction, it is known in the field to provide one or more switching path-points for a manipulator path, in order to trigger a specified action during the normal travel along a manipulator path, as a function of these switching path-points, in particular upon arriving or passing over these points, e.g. the opening of a clamping fixture, supplying current to a manipulator-guided welding tongs, etc.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, such switching path-points are then also used to specify or execute, respectively, an action as a function of the reverse movement and\/or return movement, in particular selectively, or differently, respectively. The action can thus be specified, or executed, in particular differently, as a function of the reverse movement and\/or the return movement, and as a function of a switching path-point.","In a further development, the action can be specified or executed, in particular differently, as a function of a projected distance of the manipulator assembly to a switching path-point during the reverse movement and\/or the return movement. While traveling along the defined manipulator path, a point that identifies the position of the manipulator assembly moves, by way of example, the TCP in the workspace, or a vector of the joint coordinates in the configuration space, on the manipulator path defined in this space. During a reverse or return movement, this point moves accordingly in the workspace or configuration space, when displaced from the manipulator path. This point can be projected onto the manipulator path, in particular parallel to a norm on the manipulator path or the reverse or return movement. Likewise, the switching path-point can, conversely, also be projected onto the reverse or return movement, in particular when this occurs\u2014at least in sections\u2014automatically, in one embodiment of the present invention, and is thus defined, for example, parallel to a section of the manipulator path. The projected point can also be displaced in relation to the perpendicular projection onto the manipulator path or the reverse or return movement path, in, or opposite to, the normal direction of travel thereof, in particular, it can anticipate or lag behind an actual movement. A projected distance of the manipulator assembly is understood in the present case, in particular, to mean the distance of a point identifying the position of the manipulator assembly, projected onto the manipulator path, to the switching path-point, or the distance of a point identifying the position of the manipulator assembly to the switching path-point projected onto the reverse or return movement (path). The action can then be executed, in particular, when the projected distance is less than a threshold value, in particular approaches zero, in particular when a point identifying the position of the manipulator assembly, projected onto the manipulator path, arrives at, or passes, a switching path-point. Visually, the projected point can be conceived of as a point on the manipulator path, which moves in a manner corresponding to a reverse or return movement on the manipulator path. If the reverse or return movement occurs\u2014at least in sections\u2014on the manipulator path, then the projection can be an identifier.","In addition, or alternatively, to an, in particular different, execution of the action upon arriving at or passing a switching path-point allocated to this action by a point identifying the position of the manipulator assembly projected onto the manipulator path, an action can also occur upon completion of a reverse and\/or return movement, as a function thereof, whether the projected distance of the manipulator assembly to this switching path-point is positive or negative. In this manner, actions, in particular those, the switching path-point of which has already be traveled over during travel along a section of the manipulator path, can be selectively executed again, in particular also when they are not traveled over in a projected manner during the reverse or return movement.","As explained above, it is known in the field to define switching path-points by mean of a switching point routine, which includes a subroutine for executing an action, basically in the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"...",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SLIN P",{}]},{"entry":[{},"TRIGGER WHEN PATH=Abstand [:distance] DO Unterroutine",{}]},{"entry":[{},"[:subroutine]",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SLIN Q",{}]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In a preferred embodiment the functionality of the switching point routine is expanded such that this can be specified, or is executed, respectively, in particular differently, as a function of the reverse movement and\/or return movement, for example in the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"...",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SLIN P",{}]},{"entry":[{},"TRIGGER WHEN PATH=Abstand [:distance] DO Unterroutine",{}]},{"entry":[{},"[:subroutine][FIRE_COND=Bewegung [:movement]",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SLIN Q",{}]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The preferably Boolean and\/or multi-value variable Bewegung can, in particular, be a system variable, which indicates which type of movement is currently occurring.

Likewise, it may be advantageous to designate, or execute, respectively, the subroutines differently, in relation to the reverse and return movement, as is explained in an exemplary manner for the example of the switching point routine for the second and third switching points.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","2","2","2","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0069"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0002","num":"0070"},"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0003","num":"0071"},"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0004","num":"0072"},"b":"4"},"S, S, S switching path-points","P, Q taught path points","PA projected spacing","PR projection onto the manipulator path"]}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["Further advantages and features can be derived from the following examples.
