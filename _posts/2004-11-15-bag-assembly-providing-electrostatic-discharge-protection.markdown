title: Bag assembly providing electrostatic discharge protection
abstract: An electrostatic discharge (ESD) protective bag assembly includes a tote bag and an envelope made from ESD protective material positioned at least partially within the tote bag. The envelope may be defined by two sheets of ESD protective material joined along at least two opposing sides thereof to form join regions. At least one layer of a reinforcing material, such as a fibrous web, is coupled to a portion of each of the join regions. The tote bag and envelope may be coupled to one another by stitches that pass through the reinforcing material.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy and may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the Government for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to the transportation of devices sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD), and more particularly to a transportable bag assembly that provides ESD protection for the contents thereof.","Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can inadvertently initiate the detonation train in certain ordnance, as well as damage a wide variety of electronic devices. Vulnerability to ESD increases dramatically when ordnance or electronic devices are being transported because they are typically removed from a safe or grounded environment such as housing or a complete grounded system in which they are a component. Accordingly, a variety of ESD bags or envelopes have been designed to provide for ordnance and\/or electronic device transportation. In general, ESD bags are made from material that is easily torn. Thus, ESD bags are generally good for only a \u201cone time\u201d usage, or must be packed in a specially-designed protective container if rough handling is expected. However, there is no simple, reusable and transportable system for transporting ESD-sensitive ordnance or electronic devices in an ESD protected manner.","An assembly is described that can be used to transport ESD-sensitive ordnance or electronic devices while protecting them from ESD. The assembly may be a reusable bag assembly that affords ESD protection for the contents thereof.","In one general aspect, a bag assembly provides electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection for the contents thereof. A tote bag has a first end that can be opened and closed, and a closed second end that opposes the first end. An envelope made from ESD protective material is positioned partially in the tote bag. More specifically, the envelope has an open end, and is folded at an end thereof that opposes the open end with the end so-folded positioned to abut the closed second end of the tote bag. Further, the envelope is defined by two sheets of ESD protective material joined along at least two opposing sides thereof to form join regions. At least one layer of a reinforcing material, such as, for example, a fibrous web, is coupled to a portion of each of the join regions that resides within the tote bag. The tote bag and envelope are coupled to one another by stitches that pass through the reinforcing material.","Other features will become apparent from the following description, including the drawings, and from the claims.","Referring now to , one implementation of a bag assembly providing ESD protection for the contents thereof is illustrated and referenced generally by numeral . Bag assembly  can be sized and shaped as needed to satisfy size constraints of contents (not shown) to be stored therein.","Bag assembly  includes an outer tote bag  defined by a flexible bag A having one open end B formed thereby. Bag A can be made from a wide variety of rugged materials designed to withstand environmental conditions to which bag A will be subjected. Accordingly, the choice of material for bag A is not a limitation.","To facilitate the carrying of tote bag , a carrying strap C optionally may be coupled to bag A. For example, carrying strap C can be adjustable in length and can be stitched to bag A at one or more stitch locations D. Additional straps, different strap configurations (e.g., shoulder straps), and\/or strap attachment methodologies can be used.","Bag A may be further equipped to provide for the opening\/closing of open end B. For example, as shown, a \u201cduffle bag\u201d closing scheme is used where eyelets E are provided about the periphery of open end B. In order to close bag A, eyelets E are aligned and a clip F is coupled thereto. Clip F can be attached to bag A by, for example, a strap G stitched to bag A at H. Other types of closure systems may be used at open end B. For example, a drawstring closure system, a zipper closure system, a hook and loop closure system, or a button closure system, among others, may be used.","Tote bag  serves as the outer bag to at least partially contain an electrostatic discharge (ESD) liner  in which electronically-sensitive contents (not shown) will be stored for transportation.","Referring to , one implementation of ESD liner  is shown in isolation. In this implementation, the ESD liner  is formed as an envelope made from two sheets A and B of ESD material (e.g., a flexible and electrostatic protective material satisfying the performance standards established by MIL-PRF-81705). For example, sheets A and B can be joined together (e.g., heat sealed) along three sides thereof. Specifically, opposing edges are sealed at regions C and D, and one end of ESD liner  is sealed at end F thereby leaving the envelope open at end E. In another implementation, the envelope may be constructed from a single sheet of ESD material. In yet another implementation, the envelope may be constructed from several sheets of ESD material.","In general, ESD liner  is sewn into bag . However, because ESD material tears easily, such sewing can initiate small tears that can compromise the ESD performance of ESD liner . In one implementation, this problem is overcome by coupling one or more layers of a reinforcing material, such as, for example, a fibrous web, to portions of join regions C and D that will be used to stitch liner  to bag A. For example, in one implementation, the reinforcing material is a tape  incorporating a web of fibers (e.g., bi-directional packing tape or high-temperature tape). The tape  may be adhered to each of sheets A and B along portions of each of join regions C and D, and may be wrapped around the edges of join regions C and D.","Next, in one implementation, sealed end F may be folded onto itself at least one time (e.g., along dashed line G) to thereby form a folded end H () that is positioned to abut the closed end  of bag A. ESD liner  is then coupled to bag A by stitching (represented by dashed lines ) that passes through bag A, tape , and portions of joined regions C and D to which tape  is adhered. The reinforcing material, such as the fibrous tape , retains stitches  so that stitch holes (not shown) formed in joined regions C and D cannot grow into tears that could compromise the ESD protection performance of ESD liner . In another implementation, sealed end F is not folded onto itself.","ESD liner  may sized such that, after assembly to bag A as just described, open end E of ESD liner  extends out from open end B of bag A, as shown in . In this way, when contents are placed in ESD liner  (through open end E), ESD liner  can be rolled or folded onto itself starting at open end E until ESD liner  fits into bag A. Bag A can then be closed to retain the folded form of open end E. As a result, the combination of (i) join regions C\/D, and (ii) fold(s) formed at open ends E and F, a Faraday cage is formed about the contents of ESD liner .","In addition to the use of stitching  to retain ESD liner  in bag A, folded end H (i.e., formed by folding at G) can be positively retained in its abutting relationship with bag A. This has the benefit of assuring that the weight of contents resting against folded end H is transferred to bag A as opposed to being supported by the weaker sealed end F of ESD liner . Such positive retaining of folded end H can be achieved by using hook-and-loop fastening strips with one strip  coupled (e.g., stitched) to the inside of bag A and the complementary strip  coupled to ESD liner  along folded end H. To avoid unnecessary puncturing of ESD liner , strip  can be adhered thereto using, for example, a flexible double-sided tape.","To assure that the opening of bag A simultaneously causes the opening of ESD liner  (at open end E), additional hook-and-loop fastening strips can be coupled to bag A and ESD liner . More specifically, one (or more) strip  can be coupled (e.g., stitched) to the inside of bag A near open end B and the complementary strip(s)  could be coupled to ESD liner  at a corresponding position(s). Strip  can be adhered to ESD liner  using a flexible double-sided tape.","As described, the tote bag assembly is easily opened\/closed and provides ESD protection of the contents stored therein. The assembly minimizes the risk of ESD liner tears while providing a reusable and easily-carried tote bag for field transportation of ESD-sensitive ordnance or electronic devices.","Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. For example, sealed end F of ESD liner  could be realized by a fold if ESD liner  were made from a single piece of ESD material that was folded at the location of end F. If folded in this fashion, the folded region of ESD liner  should be placed in an abutting relationship with the closed end  of bag A. Furthermore, the placement of tape  is not limited to that shown in FIG. \u2014as other non-limiting options are illustrated in .","In , for example, a single strip of tape  incorporating a fibrous web is applied just to sheet A at join region C.  illustrates the use of two individual strips of tape  and  applied to sheets A and B, respectively, at join region C.  illustrates the use of a strip  of a reinforcing material that is a fibrous web material (but not necessarily a tape) that is captured between sheets A and B at join region C during the sealing process.","Yet another option is shown in  where a single strip of reinforcing material, in this case a tape  incorporating a fibrous web, is adhered to the outer edges of each of sheets A and B at join region C, and folded onto itself to create a fibrous stitch region. Thus, regardless of how a reinforcing material, such as, for example, a fibrous web, is incorporated in the join region, the fibrous web will define the stitching region for attachment of ESD liner to the outer tote bag.","In certain implementations, it may be possible to eliminate the use of a reinforcing material such as a fibrous web or tape. For example, as illustrated in , ESD liner  has sheets A and B joined\/sealed at join regions C\/D such that wings AW and BW are formed outside of join regions C and D. The completed bag assembly is formed by stitching ESD liner  to tote bag  using wings AW\/BW as the \u201cstitch-through\u201d regions. Use of hook-and-loop fastening strips (e.g., strips \/ and \/) would be used as described above to respectively seat\/retain the ESD liner in the tote bag, and assure that the ESD liner opens in correspondence with the opening of the tote bag."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
