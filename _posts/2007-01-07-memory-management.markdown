title: Memory management
abstract: At least certain embodiments of the present disclosure include a method for memory management of a view of an application displayed on a display of a device. The method includes constructing a data structure having a hierarchy of layers with at least one layer being associated with the view. The method further includes storing the data structure in memory. The method further includes maintaining a retained count of the number of references to the view from other objects. The method further includes deallocating the view from memory if the retained count is zero. As discussed above, the retained count of the view will be decremented if the layer is removed from the data structure. Removing the layer from the data structure may occur based on the view associated with the layer being removed from the display of the device.

The copyright owner has no objection to facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent & Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Applicant has submitted herewith Computer Program Listings which are included as Appendix A, attached.","An API is a source code interface that a computer system or program library provides in order to support requests for services from a software application. An API is specified in terms of a programming language that can be interpretative or compiled when an application is built, rather than an explicit low level description of how data is laid out in memory. The software that provides the functionality described by an API is said to be an implementation of the API.","Various devices such as electronic devices, computing systems, portable devices, and handheld devices have software applications. The API interfaces between the software applications and user interface software to provide a user of the device with certain features and operations. A user may desire certain operations such as scrolling, selecting, gesturing, and animating operations for a display of the device.","Scrolling is the act of sliding a directional (e.g., horizontal or vertical) presentation of content, such as text, drawings, or images, across a screen or display window. In a typical graphical user interface, scrolling is done with the help of a scrollbar or using keyboard shortcuts, often the arrow keys. Gesturing is a type of user input with two or more input points. Animating operations include changing content within a given time period.","The various types of devices may have a limited display size, user interface, software, API interface and\/or processing capability which limits the ease of use of the devices. User interfaces of devices implement APIs in order to provide requested functionality and features. These user interfaces can have difficulty interpreting the various types of user inputs and providing the intended functionality associated with the user inputs.","At least certain embodiments of the present disclosure include one or more application programming interfaces in an environment with user interface software interacting with a software application. Various function calls or messages are transferred via the application programming interfaces between the user interface software and software applications. Example application programming interfaces transfer function calls to implement scrolling, gesturing, and animating operations for a device.","At least certain embodiments of the present disclosure include a method for memory management of a view of an application displayed on a display of a device. The method includes constructing a data structure having a hierarchy of layers with at least one layer being associated with the view. The method further includes storing the data structure in memory. The method further includes maintaining a retained count of the number of references to the view from other objects. The method further includes deallocating the view from memory if the retained count is zero. As discussed above, the retained count of the view will be decremented if the layer is removed from the data structure. Removing the layer from the data structure may occur based on the view associated with the layer being removed from the display of the device.","At least certain embodiments of the present disclosure include an environment with user interface software interacting with a software application. A method for operating through an application programming interface (API) in this environment includes transferring a rubberband call. Rubberbanding a scrolled region within a display region occurs by a predetermined maximum displacement when the scrolled region exceeds a display edge. The method further includes transferring an edge rubberband call to set displacement values for at least one edge of the display (e.g., top and bottom edges, left and right edges).","At least certain embodiments of the present disclosure include gesture operations for a display of a device. The gesture operations include performing a scaling transform such as a zoom in or zoom out in response to a user input having two or more input points. The gesture operations also include performing a rotation transform to rotate an image or view in response to a user input having two or more input points.","At least certain embodiments of the present disclosure include a method for performing animations for a display of a device. The method includes starting at least one animation. The method further includes determining the progress of each animation. The method further includes completing each animation based on a single timer. The single timer can be based on a redraw interval of the display hardware.","Various devices which perform one or more of the foregoing methods and machine readable media which, when executed by a processing system, cause the processing system to perform these methods, are also described.","Other methods, devices and machine readable media are also described.","Various embodiments and aspects of the disclosure will be described with reference to details discussed below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the disclosure and are not to be construed as limiting the disclosure. Numerous specific details are described to provide a through understanding of various embodiments of the present disclosure. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to provide a concise discussion of embodiments of the present disclosure.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of algorithms which include operations on data stored within a computer memory. An algorithm is generally a self-consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. The operations typically require or involve physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, can refer to the action and processes of a data processing system, or similar electronic device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the system's memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The present disclosure can relate to an apparatus for performing one or more of the operations described herein.

Alternatively, the scroll indicators can be attached to the display edge. In some embodiments, user input in the form of a mouse\/finger down causes the scroll indicators to be displayed on the display edge, content edge, or window edge of the scrolled region. If a mouse\/finger up is then detected, the scroll indicators are faded out from the display region, content edge, or window edge of the scrolled region.","In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, gesture operations include responding to at least one gesture call, if issued, by rotating a view associated with the event object based on receiving a plurality of input points in the form of the user input. Gesture operations may also include scaling a view associated with the event object by zooming in or zooming out based on receiving the user input.","In some embodiments, a device includes a display region having multiple views or windows. Each window may have a multiple views including superviews and subviews. It is necessary to determine which window, view, superview, or subview is contacted by a user input in the form of a mouse up, mouse down, or drag, etc. An API can set various modes for making this determination. In one embodiment, a pass mode sends mouse down, mouse up, and drag inputs to the nearest subview. In another embodiment, an intercept on drag mode sends a drag input to the superview while mouse up and down inputs are sent to the subview. In another embodiment, an intercept mode sends all drag, mouse up and down inputs to the superview. The superview may be scroller software operating as a subclass of a view software.
