title: Synchronizer circuits with failure-condition detection and correction
abstract: An input signal and a reset signal are provided to respective inputs of a resettable flip-flop. The resettable flip-flop generates an output signal. The output signal transitions from a first logic state to a second logic state in response to corresponding transitions of the input signal and transitions from the second logic state to the first logic state in response to assertion of the reset signal. A warning signal is asserted in response to transitions of the input signal from the second logic state to the first logic state. A logic gate forwards the output signal when the warning signal is de-asserted and provides a signal in the first logic state in response to assertion of the warning signal.

The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present embodiments relate generally to synchronizer circuits, and more specifically to mitigation of metastability in synchronizer circuits.","Synchronizer circuits are used to transition data between different clock domains in an electronic device. For example, a Multiple Clock Domain (MCD) device may use synchronizer circuits to transition data between respective clock domains. An example of an MCD device is a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) System on a Chip (SoC), in which different parts of the chip operate at different frequencies, yet communicate with each other. Another example is a processor in which high-clock-rate processor cores communicate with slower cores and\/or even slower memory. Still other examples are possible.","Synchronizer circuits suffer from metastability. When a clock of a receiving clock domain rises while data in a data line between a transmitting clock domain and a synchronizer circuit in the receiving clock domain is transitioning, a metastable state may potentially be generated. The metastable state causes an output value of neither high nor low, effectively corrupting the data and causing any logic after the synchronizer circuit in the receiving clock domain to produce incorrect results.","In some embodiments, a synchronizer circuit includes a resettable flip-flop with a data input to receive an input signal, a reset input to receive a reset signal, and a data output to provide an output signal. The resettable flip-flop produces transitions of the output signal from a first logic state to a second logic state in response to corresponding transitions of the input signal and produces transitions in the output signal from the second logic state to the first logic state in response to assertion of the reset signal. The synchronizer circuit also includes a detector circuit to assert a warning signal in response to transitions of the input signal from the second logic state to the first logic state. The synchronizer circuit further includes a logic gate to forward the output signal when the warning signal is de-asserted and to provide a signal in the first logic state in response to assertion of the warning signal.","In some embodiments, a method of data synchronization includes providing an input signal and a reset signal to respective inputs of a resettable flip-flop. The resettable flip-flop generates an output signal. The output signal transitions from a first logic state to a second logic state in response to corresponding transitions of the input signal and transitions from the second logic state to the first logic state in response to assertion of the reset signal. A warning signal is asserted in response to transitions of the input signal from the second logic state to the first logic state. A logic gate forwards the output signal when the warning signal is de-asserted and provides a signal in the first logic state in response to assertion of the warning signal.","Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the figures and specification.","Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure. However, some embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.","A synchronizer circuit may include one or more resettable flip-flops in accordance with some embodiments. As the term is used herein, a resettable flip-flop includes a data input, clock input, reset input, and data output. Resettable flip-flops thus are distinguishable from D flip-flops, which include data inputs, clock inputs, and data outputs, but do not include reset inputs. Also, a resettable flip-flop as the term is used herein is configured to provide an output signal from its data output that transitions from a first logic state to a second logic state in response to corresponding transitions of an input signal applied to its data input, but does not transition from the second logic state to the first logic state in response to corresponding transitions of the input signal. Instead, the output signal transitions from the second logic state to the first logic state in response to assertion of the reset signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","108","110","110","112","108","112","102","108","112","102","102","108","112","116","118","120","124","102","102","106","102","102","104","108","102"]},"An inverter  provides the value (\u201cX\u201d) stored in the master latch  to the gate of the transistor . The input clock is provided to the gate of the transistor . (The input of the inverter  and the gate of the transistor  compose the clock input of the resettable flip-flop ). The transistors  and  are arranged in series between the left side of the slave latch  and ground. When the value of the master latch  is \u20181\u2019 and the clock is asserted, the transistors  and  both turn on and couple the left side of the slave latch  to ground. Coupling the left side of the slave latch  to ground drives the right side of the slave latch  to \u20181\u2019, due to the cross-coupled arrangement of the inverters . As a result, a \u20181\u2019 is stored in the slave latch . A transition of the value stored in the master latch  from \u20181\u2019 to \u20180\u2019, however, causes the transistor  to turn off and therefore does not change the value stored in the slave latch .","A transistor  is coupled between the right side of the master latch  and ground. A transistor  is coupled between the right side of the slave latch  and ground. The gates of the transistors  and  receive a reset signal and thus compose the reset input of the resettable flip-flop . When the reset signal is asserted, the transistor  couples the right side of the master latch  to ground, causing a \u20180\u2019 to be stored in the master latch  (assuming the transistors  and  are not also on at the same time). Similarly, the transistor  couples the right side of the slave latch  to ground when the reset signal is asserted, causing a \u20180\u2019 to be stored in the slave latch  (assuming the transistors  and  are not also on at the same time). As a result, the output signal provided by the inverter  becomes \u20180\u2019; if it was already \u20180\u2019, it stays \u20180\u2019. In this manner, the reset signal resets the resettable flip-flop .","An inverter  coupled to the left side of the slave latch  provides the value stored in the slave latch  as the output signal (\u201cQ\u201d) of the resettable flip-flop . The output of the inverter  thus is the data output of the resettable flip-flop .","As the above description indicates, the output signal of the resettable flip-flop  transitions from a logic-low state to a logic-high state in response to transitions of the input signal from the logic-low state to the logic-high state, assuming appropriate clocking. The output signal of the resettable flip-flop , however, does not transition from the logic-high state to the logic-low state in response to transitions of the input signal from the logic-high state to the logic-low state. Instead, the output signal of the resettable flip-flop  transitions from the logic-high state to the logic-low state in response to assertion of the reset signal. Therefore, in the example of the resettable flip-flop , the first logic state (as the term is used in the above definition of a resettable flip-flop) is a logic-low state and the second logic state (as the term is used in the above definition of a resettable flip-flop) is a logic-high state. The resettable flip-flop  is merely one example of a resettable flip-flop in which the first logic state is a logic-low state and the second logic state is a logic-high state; other examples are possible.","Also, a resettable flip-flop may be designed such that the first logic state is a logic-high state and the second logic state is a logic-low state. For example, the resettable flip-flop  may be modified by switching the position of the transistors  and  with the position of the transistor  and also switching the position of the transistors  and  with the position of the transistor . Each of the transistors , , , , , and  would still receive the respective signals shown in . The transistors  and  thus would be respectively coupled to the inverters  and . The transistor , when turned on, would pull down the left side of the master latch , and the transistors  and , when both turned on, would pull down the right side of the master latch . Likewise, the transistor , when turned on, would pull down the left side of the slave latch , and the transistors  and , when both turned on, would pull down the right side of the slave latch .","Resettable flip-flops such as the resettable flip-flop  are desirable for use in synchronizer circuits because they have low input capacitance. The data input of the resettable flip-flop  corresponds to the gate of a single transistor , resulting in a low input capacitance. This low input capacitance results in a low minimum steady time for the resettable flip-flop , where the minimum steady time is the sum of the setup time and hold time for the resettable flip-flop . A low minimum steady time reduces the likelihood of metastability and thus reduces the mean time between failures caused by metastability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","218","1","218","1","100","200","200"]},"The synchronizer circuit  receives transmit data (\u201ctdata\u201d)  from the first clock domain as an input signal. A receive clock (\u201crclk\u201d)  is generated in the second clock domain and provided to the synchronizer circuit . The receive clock  is said to be a local clock, since it is generated in the second clock domain, which is the clock domain receiving the transmit data . The transmit data  is provided to a data input (\u201cD\u201d) of the resettable flip-flop -.

(The pulse  actually begins slightly after time , due to a delay associated with the pulse generator .

The pulse  at time  causes the output of the resettable flip-flop - to transition from \u20181\u2019 to \u20180\u2019 as shown. For example, if the resettable flip-flop - is a resettable flip-flop  (), the pulse  at time  turns on the transistor  at a time when the transistor  is off (because the receive clock  is low, as  shows). As a result, a \u20180\u2019 is stored in the slave latch , and the output of the resettable flip-flop - transitions from \u20181\u2019 to \u20180\u2019 at (or slightly after) time .","However, the pulse  at time  occurs while the transmit data  is \u20181\u2019.

As a result, the \u20181\u2019 stored in the master latch  is not reset. Instead, the master latch  continues to store a \u20181\u2019 and provides this \u20181\u2019 to the slave latch , and thus to the output of the resettable flip-flop , upon the rising edge of the receive clock  at time .","The output of the resettable flip-flop - remains \u20181\u2019 until the next pulse  occurs at time , in response to which the output of the resettable flip-flop - transitions back to \u20180\u2019. The D flip-flop  samples this \u20180\u2019 upon the next rising edge of the delayed, inverted receive clock , at time , and the aligned data  transitions from \u20181\u2019 to \u20180\u2019 at time  accordingly.
