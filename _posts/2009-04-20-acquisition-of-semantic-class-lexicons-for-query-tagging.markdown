title: Acquisition of semantic class lexicons for query tagging
abstract: A user's search experience may be enhanced by providing additional content based upon an understanding of the user's intent. Query tagging, the assigning of semantic labels to terms within a query, is one technique that may be utilized to determine the context of a user's search query. Accordingly, as provided herein, a query tagging model may be updated using one or more stratified lexicons. A list data structure (e.g., lists of phrases obtained from web pages) and seed distribution data (e.g., pre-labeled probability data) may be used by a graph learning technique to obtain an expanded set of phrases and their respective probabilities of corresponding with particular lexicons (e.g., semantic class lexicons). The expanded set of phrases may be used to group phrases into stratified lexicons. The stratified lexicons may be used as features for updating and/or executing the query tagging model.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A user's online search experience may be enhanced through better understanding of the user's intent. Query tagging, the assigning of semantic labels to terms within a query (e.g., a user's search query), is one technique that may be utilized to determine the context of the query. The semantic labels assigned to terms within the query may be used to retrieve relevant information about the user's needs. For example, a phrase \u201cdigital camera\u201d within a query may be labeled as a \u201cproduct class\u201d. The semantic label \u201cproduct class\u201d may be used to retrieve additional content (e.g., contextual advertisements relating to products) that may be presented to the user for an enhanced experience.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A technique for updating a query tagging model using one or more stratified lexicons is disclosed herein. A list data structure comprising a set of lists may be created. Respective lists within the set of lists may comprise one or more phrases. For example, a set of HTML lists (e.g., order lists, unordered list, tables, etc.) comprises phrases (e.g., strings of text) may be obtained from web resources (e.g., a webpage) by, for example, crawling the web. The list data structure may be filtered based upon one or more criteria (e.g., maximum length of phrases, number of phrases occurring within a list, etc.). Seed distribution data comprising one or more phrases may be created. Respective phrases may comprise lexicon probability distributions based upon, for example, a set of labeled training data. A lexicon probability distribution of a phrase may comprise one or more probabilities, wherein a probably corresponds to a probability the phrase relates to a particular lexicon. It may be appreciated that semantic class lexicons may be referred to as lexicons and that a lexicon may, for example, refer to the semantic meaning of phrases (e.g., \u201cBrand\u201d, \u201cModel\u201d, \u201cProduct class\u201d, \u201cAttribute\u201d, etc.).","A sub-graph may be created based upon the list data structure and the seed distribution data. One or more lists and one or more phrases from the list data structure may be removed based upon the seed distribution data. A graph learning technique (e.g., a graph learning algorithm) may be executed upon the sub-graph to create an expanded set of phrases, wherein a phrase comprises an updated lexicon probability distribution. For example, lists within the list data structure may be assigned list lexicon probability distributions based upon lexicon probability distributions of phrases comprised within the lists. The expanded set of phrases may be created by assigning updated lexicon probability distribution to phrases based upon the list lexicon probability distribution of the particular lists comprising the phrases. The updated lexicon probability distribution may comprise one or more updated lexicon probabilities, wherein an updated lexicon probability corresponds to a probability that a phrase relates to a particular lexicon.","One or more stratified lexicons may be created based upon the expanded set of phrases. A stratified lexicon may comprise a set of phrases, wherein respective phrases within the set of phrases have updated lexicon probabilities within a predefined range. One or more stratified lexicons may be associated with a particular lexicon. A query tagging model may be updated using one or more stratified lexicons as lexicon features. Query tagging may be performed through updating the query tagging model (e.g., Conditional Random Fields). Updating the query tagging model may provide improved query tagging performance and may mitigate the use of training data.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Query tagging through a query tagging model (e.g., a learned sequential statistical labeling model) may be used to label terms within a user's search query. These semantic class labels may be used to understand the context of the user's search query, such that additional relevant information (e.g., related news feeds, targeted advertisements, additional product information, hyperlinks to related web pages, etc.) may be provided to the user to improve their experience. Updating the query tagging model may require substantial human effort in annotating a training set used to update the query tagging model. Currently, semantic class lexicons may be used to mitigate the need for manual annotations, but again manual effort may be needed to maintain the semantic class lexicons as search topics evolve over time. Prior work on semantic class lexicon acquisition has focused on the precision of acquired semantic class lexicons, which has shown to be inadequate for the task of query tagging.","Among other things, a technique for updating a query tagging model using one or more stratified lexicons is provided herein. In one example, the technique may be implemented as a semi-supervised learning algorithm which leverages structured data to create stratified lexicons used to enhance query tagging performance and mitigate the need for training data. The stratified lexicons may be used to train the query tagging model to identify and understand the context of a user's search query. Understanding the context of a user's search query allows for additional content relevant to the user's intent to be provided to the user. In other example, the acquisition of stratified lexicons may be used to label information within web resources (e.g., entries within an online information database).","One embodiment of updating a query tagging model using one or more stratified lexicons is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a list data structure (e.g., see  and ) comprising a set of lists may be created. A list within the list data structure may comprise one or more phrases (e.g., a table comprising one or more phrases). The list data structure may be filtered based upon particular criteria. In one example, the set of lists may be derived from a set of HTML lists obtained from web resources (e.g., ordered lists and\/or unordered lists within web pages). Because web resources may be noisy and comprise information of little use, the set of HTML lists may be filtered. For example, HTML lists having a number of phrases (e.g., 2 phrases, 900 phrases) outside a predefined range (e.g., remove HTML lists comprising less than 4 phrases and greater than 300 phrases) may be removed from the set of HTML lists. In another example, HTML lists may be filtered based upon the maximum length of phrases (e.g., remove HTML lists comprising phrases with a number of characters greater than 60). It may be appreciated that in one example, HTML lists may be filtered to remove SPAM lists and\/or web lists used to format the layout of a webpage, rather than HTML lists grouping semantically related phrases. The set of lists may be created based upon the filtered set of HTML lists.","At , seed distribution data (e.g., see ) comprising one or more phrases may be created, wherein a phrase within the seed distribution data may comprise a lexicon probability distribution. It may be appreciated that a lexicon probability distribution may comprise one or more probabilities corresponding to probabilities that a phrase relates to a particular lexicon. For a particular phrase within the seed distribution data, a probability may be assigned to one or more lexicons based upon a set of labeled training data. For example, a phrase \u201corange\u201d may occur within the seed distribution data. A first probability of 0.6 may be assigned to a lexicon \u201cfruit\u201d, wherein the probability that the phrase \u201corange\u201d relates to the lexicon \u201cfruit\u201d is 60%. A second probability of 0.4 may be assigned to a lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d, wherein the probability that the phrase \u201corange\u201d relates to the lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d is 40%. These probabilities may be comprised within a lexicon probability distribution for the phrase \u201corange\u201d. The probabilities within the lexicon probability distribution may be derived from a set of labeled training data (e.g., phrases manually labeled by user input to characterize the phrases). For example, probabilities may be determined based upon counting a number of times a particular phrase is labeled as a particular lexicon within the labeled training data.","At , a sub-graph (see ) may be created based upon the list data structure and the seed distribution data. It may be appreciated, that the list data structure, in one example, may represent phrases and\/or lists in a graph format. The sub-graph may be derived from the list data structure because the list data structure may comprise an unworkable amount of data for graph learning techniques (e.g., a graph walking algorithm) to execute upon.","In one example, one or more phrases (e.g., phrases within the list data structure matching phrases within the seed distribution data) within the list data structure may be labeled with a corresponding lexicon probability distribution. For example, if a phrase \u201corange\u201d occurs within the list data structure and the seed distribution data, then \u201corange\u201d within the list data structure may be labeled with the corresponding lexicon probability distribution (e.g., 0.4 \u201ccolor\u201d, 0.6 \u201cfruit\u201d, etc.) from the seed distribution data. Lists having a number of phrases labeled with a lexicon probability distribution below a predetermined threshold may be removed from the list data structure. For example, a list threshold may be set at 3, wherein lists comprising less than 3 phrases that were labeled with lexicon probability distributions from the seed distribution data may be removed.","Once the lists within the list data structure have been removed based upon the predetermined threshold, phrases within the list data structure occurring within the remaining lists at a frequency below a predetermined threshold may be removed. For example, a phrase threshold may be set to 2. Phrases within the list data structure that occur in less than 2 lists within the list data structure may be removed from the lists data structure. Once the appropriate lists and phrases have been removed from the list data structure, the sub-graph may be created from the remaining lists and phrases.","At , a graph learning technique may be executed upon the sub-graph to create an expanded set of phrases (e.g., see ). For example, the sub-graph may already comprise phrases with lexicon probability distributions assigned from the seed distribution data. Based upon the graph learning technique, additional phrases may be assigned lexicon probability distributions, thus creating an expanded set of phrases.","In one example of executing a graph learning technique, list lexicon probability distributions may be assigned to particular lists and updated lexicon probability distributions may be assigned to phrases iteratively. For particular lists within the sub-graph, a list lexicon probability distribution may be assigned to a particular list based upon lexicon probability distributions of phrases comprised within the list (e.g., a list comprising a phrase \u201corange\u201d and a phrase \u201cred\u201d may be assigned a list lexicon probability distribution based upon respective lexicon probability distributions of the phrase \u201corange\u201d and the phrase \u201cred\u201d). It may be appreciated that a list may comprise one or more phrases that do not have lexicon probability distributions that were assigned from the seed distribution data because that phrase did not occur within the seed distribution data.","For particular phrases within the sub-graph, an updated lexicon probability distribution may be assigned to a particular phrase based upon list lexicon probability distributions of lists comprising the phrase. For example, a phrase \u201csalmon\u201d may occur in a first list and a second list having respective list lexicon probability distributions. The phrase \u201csalmon\u201d may be assigned an updated lexicon probability distribution based upon the respective list lexicon probability distributions of the first list and second list. The phrase \u201csalmon\u201d is assigned the updated lexicon probability distribution because it may have a similar probability of relating to particular lexicons as other phrases within the first list and second list which were assigned list lexicon probability distributions based upon the phrases they comprise.","At , one or more stratified lexicons (e.g., see ) may be created based upon the expanded set of phrases. It may be appreciated that a particular lexicon may comprise one or more stratified lexicons. In one example, a set of phrases within the expanded set of phrases maybe be grouped into a stratified lexicon. The grouping, for example, may be performed by grouping phrases with update lexicon probabilities within a predefined range. For example, a lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d may comprise one or more stratified lexicons. A first stratified lexicon of the lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d may comprise a set of phrases (e.g., a phrase \u201cred\u201d, a phrase \u201cgreen\u201d, and a phrase \u201cblue\u201d) having an updated lexicon probability distribution between 0.9 to 1 relating to the lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d. A second stratified lexicon of the lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d may comprise a set of phrases (e.g., \u201csalmon\u201d, \u201cgrape\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d, etc.) having an updated lexicon probability distribution between 0.8 to 0.9 relating to the lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d. One or more stratified lexicons may be associated with a corresponding lexicon (e.g., a lexicon may be associated with stratified lexicons corresponding to predefined ranges 0.9 to 1, 0.8 to 0.9, 0.7 to 0.8, 0.6 to 0.7, 0.5 to 0.6, etc.).","At , a query tagging model (e.g., a conditional random fields tagging model) may be updated using one or more stratified lexicons as lexicon features. Lexicon features may be defined based upon a query, a position of a current term within the query, a current label that is to be assigned to the current term, and a previous label assigned to a previous term within the query. In one example, the query tagging model may be executed upon a query (e.g., \u201cPicture Maker Camera in Orange\u201d) comprising one or more terms (e.g., \u201cPicture Maker\u201d, \u201cCamera\u201d, Orange\u201d, etc.). For respective terms within the query, one or more labels (e.g., semantic class labels derived from stratified lexicons of particular lexicons) may be assigned to a term based upon an occurrence of the one or more terms (e.g., a current term, a pervious term and a respective label of the previous term, etc.) within a stratified lexicon. For example, the term \u201cPicture Maker\u201d may be assigned a label \u201cbrand\u201d based upon its occurrence within a stratified lexicon of a lexicon \u201cbrand\u201d. The term \u201ccamera\u201d may be assigned a label \u201ctype\u201d based upon its occurrence within a stratified lexicon of a lexicon \u201ctype\u201d. The term \u201cOrange\u201d may be assigned a label \u201cattribute\u201d based upon its occurrence within a stratified lexicon of a lexicon \u201cattribute\u201d.","More formally, the query tagging model may be updated with the introduction of lexicons features as a function of f(y,y,x,t)=\u03b4(L[x])\u03b4(y=j), wherein x is a query, t is the position of a current term within the query, yis a current label that is to be assigned to the current term, yis a previous label assigned to a previous term within the query, L[x] is a determination whether an entry within a stratified lexicon L comprises a substring of the query x, and the substring covers the current term x, and j is a label. At , the method ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","210","214","218","222","202","206","206","206"]},"The seed distribution constructor  may be configured to create seed distribution data  comprising one or more phrases. A phrase within the seed distribution data  may comprise a lexicon probability distribution. For example, for particular phrases within the seed distribution data , a probability may be assigned to one or more lexicons based upon a set of labeled training data. That is, a lexicon probability distribution of a phrase may comprise one or more probabilities, wherein a probability may relate to the probability the phrase corresponds to a particular lexicon (e.g., a phrase \u201corange\u201d may have a 0.4 probability of relating to a lexicon \u201ccolor\u201d).","The sub-graph constructor  may be configured to create a sub-graph  based upon the list data structure  and the seed distribution data . For example, one or more phrases within the list data structure  may be labeled with a corresponding lexicon probability distribution based upon the seed distribution data . It may be appreciated that one or more phrases within the list data structure  may not match phrases within the seed distribution data, and thus may not be assigned lexicon probability distributions. Lists having a number of phrases labeled with a lexicon probability distribution below a predetermined threshold may be removed from the list data structure  (e.g., lists comprising less than 3 phrases having lexicon probability distributions may be removed because the lists may not comprise enough useful lexicon probability distribution data to create an expanded set of phrases).","Once respective lists are removed, phrases may be removed from the list data structure . That is, phrases occurring within the remaining lists at a frequency below a predetermined threshold may be removed from the list data structure  because the phrases may not be useful in creating the expanded set of phrases (e.g., phrases occurring in less than 5 lists may be removed, phrases occurring in none of the remaining lists may be removed, etc.). The sub-graph  may be created by the sub-graph constructor  based upon the remaining phrases and lists within the list data structure .","The graph learning component  may be configured to execute a graph learning technique upon the sub-graph  to create an expanded set of phrases , wherein a phrase comprises an updated lexicon probability distribution. In one example, for particular lists within the sub-graph , a list lexicon probability distribution may be assigned to a particular list based upon lexicon probability distributions of phrases comprised within the list. Once list lexicon probability distributions assigned, for particular phrases within the sub-graph , an updated lexicon probability may be assigned to a particular phrase based upon list lexicon probability distributions of lists comprising the phrase. The expanded set of phrases  may be created based upon the list of phrases within the sub-graph  and their respective updated lexicon probability distributions. It may be appreciated that an updated lexicon probability distribution may comprise one or more lexicon probabilities (e.g., probability that a particular phrase is associated with a particular semantic class lexicon).","The stratified lexicon constructor  may be configured to create one or more stratified lexicons  based upon the expanded set of phrases . For example, a set of phrases within the expanded set of phrases may be grouped into a stratified lexicon. The grouping, for example, may be performed by grouping phrases with updated lexicon probabilities within a predefined range.
