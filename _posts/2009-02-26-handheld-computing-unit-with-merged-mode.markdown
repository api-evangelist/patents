U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/026,681, entitled COMPUTING DEVICE WITH HANDHELD AND EXTENDED COMPUTING UNITS, filed Feb. 6, 2008, pending.","NOT APPLICABLE","NOT APPLICABLE","1. Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to computing devices used in such communication systems.","2. Description of Related Art","Communication systems are known to support wireless and wire lined communications between wireless and\/or wire lined communication devices. Such communication systems range from national and\/or international cellular telephone systems to the Internet to point-to-point in-home wireless or wired networks. The wireless and\/or wire lined communication devices may be personal computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDA), cellular telephones, personal digital video players, personal digital audio players, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, video game consoles, entertainment devices, etc.","Many of the communication devices include a similar basic architecture: that being a processing core, memory, and peripheral devices. In general, the memory stores operating instructions that the processing core uses to generate data, which may also be stored in the memory. The peripheral devices allow a user of the communication device to direct the processing core as to which operating instructions to execute, to enter data, etc. and to see the resulting data. For example, a personal computer includes a keyboard, a mouse, and a display, which a user uses to cause the processing core to execute one or more of a plurality of applications.","While the various communication devices have a similar basic architecture, they each have their own processing core, memory, and peripheral devices and provide distinctly different functions. For example, a cellular telephone is designed to provide wireless voice and\/or data communications in accordance with one or more wireless communication standards (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, advanced mobile phone services (AMPS), digital AMPS, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), local multi-point distribution systems (LMDS), multi-channel-multi-point distribution systems (MMDS), radio frequency identification (RFID), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and\/or variations thereof). As another example, a personal digital audio player is designed to decompress a stored digital audio file and render the decompressed digital audio file audible.","Over the past few years, integration of the some of the communication device functions into a single device has occurred. For example, many cellular telephones now offer personal digital audio playback functions, PDA functions, and\/or GPS receiver functions. Typically, to load one or more of these functions, files, or other applications onto a handheld communication device (e.g., a cellular telephone, a personal digital audio and\/or video player, a PDA, a GPS receiver), the handheld communication device needs to be coupled to a personal computer or laptop computer. In this instance, the desired application, function, and\/or file is first loaded on to the computer and then copied to the handheld communication device; resulting in two copies of the application, function, and\/or file.","To facilitate such loading of the application, function, and\/or file in this manner, the handheld communication device and the computer each require hardware and corresponding software to transfer the application, function, and\/or file from the computer to the handheld communication device. As such, two copies of the corresponding software exist as well as having two hardware components (one for the handheld device and the second for the computer). In addition to the redundancy of software, timing issues, different versions of the software, incompatible hardware, and a plethora of other reasons cause the transfer of the application, function, and\/or file to fail.","In addition to integration of some functions into a single handheld device, handheld digital audio players may be docked into a speaker system to provide audible signals via the speakers as opposed to a headphone. Similarly, a laptop computer may be docked to provide connection to a full size keyboard, a separate monitor, a printer, and a mouse. In each of these docking systems, the core architecture is not changed.","Due to the portable nature of the handheld devices and the increasing functionality of them, there may arise situations where it is desirable to connect with another device (e.g., another handheld device, a computer, an appliance, a television, a radio, a GPS receiver, etc.). Currently, a handheld device includes one or more wired or wireless interfaces to communication with other devices. In this regard, the devices have the same issue as describe above with a redundancy of software, timing issues, different versions of the software, incompatible hardware, and a plethora of other reasons cause the transfer of the application, function, and\/or file to fail.","Therefore, a need exists for a computing device that includes a handheld computing unit and an extended computing unit, wherein the handheld computing unit may function in a merged mode.","The present invention is directed to apparatus and methods of operation that are further described in the following Brief Description of the Drawings, the Detailed Description of the Invention, and the claims. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention made with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","16","14"]},"In general, the handheld computing unit  includes the primary processing module (e.g., central processing unit), the primary main memory, and the primary hard disk memory for the computing device . In this manner, the handheld computing unit  functions as the core of a personal computer (PC) or laptop computer when it is docked to the extended computing unit and functions as a cellular telephone, a GPS receiver, a personal digital audio player, a personal digital video player, a personal digital assistant, and\/or other handheld electronic device when it is not docked to the extended computing unit.","In addition, when the handheld computing unit  is docked to the extended computing unit , files and\/or applications can be swapped therebetween. For example, assume that the user of the computing device  has created a presentation using presentation software and both reside in memory of the extended computing unit . The user may elect to transfer the presentation file and the presentation software to memory of the handheld computing unit . If the handheld computing unit  has sufficient memory to store the presentation file and application, then it is copied from the extended computing unit memory to the handheld computing unit memory. If there is not sufficient memory in the handheld computing unit, the user may transfer an application and\/or file from the handheld computing unit memory to the extended computing unit memory to make room for the presentation file and application.","With the handheld computing unit  including the primary components for the computing device , there is only one copy of an application and\/or of a file to support PC functionality, laptop functionality, and a plurality of handheld device functionality (e.g., TV, digital audio\/video player, cell phone, PDA, GPS receiver, etc.). In addition, since only one copy of an application and\/or of a file exists (other than desired backups), special software to transfer the applications and\/or files from a PC to a handheld device is no longer needed. As such, the processing module, main memory, and I\/O interfaces of the handheld computing unit  provide a single core architecture for a PC and\/or a laptop, a cellular telephone, a PDA, a GPS receiver, a personal digital audio player, a personal digital video player, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","14","28","36","38","30","32","34","26","28","14"]},"As is also shown, the extended computing unit  is coupled to a monitor , a keyboard, a mouse , and a printer . The extended computing unit  may also be coupled to other devices (not shown) such as a trackball, touch screen, gaming devices (e.g., joystick, game pad, game controller, etc.), an image scanner, a webcam, a microphone, speakers, and\/or a headset. In addition, the extended computing unit  may have a form factor similar to a personal computer and\/or a laptop computer. For example, for in-home or in-office use, having the extended computing unit with a form factor similar to a PC may be desirable. As another example, for traveling users, it may be more desirable to have a laptop form factor.","In this example, the handheld computing unit  is docked to the extended computer unit  and function together to provide the computing device . The docking of the handheld computing unit  to the extended computing unit  encompasses one or more high speed connections between the units  and . Such a high speed connection may be provided by an electrical connector, by an RF connector, by an electromagnetic connector, and\/or a combination thereof. In this mode, the handheld computing unit  and the extended computing  collectively function similarly to a personal computer and\/or laptop computer with a WLAN card and a cellular telephone card.","In this mode, the handheld computing unit  may transceive cellular RF communications  (e.g., voice and\/or data communications). Outgoing voice signals may originate at the VoIP phone  as part of a VoIP communication  or a microphone coupled to the extended computing unit . The outgoing voice signals are converted into digital signals that are subsequently converted to outbound RF signals. Inbound RF signals are converted into incoming digital audio signals and that may be provided to a sound card within the extended computing unit for presentation on speakers or provided to the VoIP phone via as part of a VoIP communication .","Outgoing data signals may originate at the mouse , keyboard , image scanner, etc. coupled to the extended computing unit . The outgoing data signals are converted into digital signals that are subsequently converted to outbound RF signals. Inbound RF signals are converted into incoming data signals and that may be provided to the monitor , the printer , and\/or other character presentation device.","In addition, the handheld computing unit  may provide a WLAN transceiver for coupling to the WLAN router  to support WLAN RF communications  for the computing device . The WLAN communications  may be for accessing the internet  via modem , for accessing the entertainment server, and\/or accessing the entertainment receiver . For example, the WLAN communications  may be used to support surfing the web, receiving emails, transmitting emails, accessing on-line accounts, accessing on-line games, accessing on-line user files (e.g., databases, backup files, etc.), downloading music files, downloading video files, downloading software, etc. As another example, the computing device  (i.e., the handheld computing unit  and the extended computing unit ) may use the WLAN communications  to retrieve and\/or store music and\/or video files on the entertainment server; and\/or to access one or more of the entertainment components  and\/or the entertainment receiver .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["12","14","28","36","38","30","32","34","26","28","14"]},"As is also shown, the extended computing unit  is coupled to a monitor , a keyboard, a mouse , and a printer . The extended computing unit  may also be coupled to other devices (not shown) such as a trackball, touch screen, gaming devices (e.g., joystick, game pad, game controller, etc.), an image scanner, a webcam, a microphone, speakers, and\/or a headset. In addition, the extended computing unit  may have a form factor similar to a personal computer and\/or a laptop computer.","In this example, the handheld computing unit  is quasi docked  to the extended computer unit , where the handheld computing unit  functions as a stand-alone computer with limited resources (e.g., processing modules, user inputs\/outputs, main memory, etc. of the handheld computing unit) and limited access to the memory of the extended computing unit . The quasi docking  of the handheld computing unit  to the extended computing unit  is provided by an RF communication, where an RF transceiver of the handheld computing unit  is communicating with an RF transceiver of the extended computing unit . Depending on the bit rate of the RF connection, the handheld computing unit can access files and\/or applications stored in memory of the extended computing unit . In addition, the handheld computing unit  may direct the processing module of the extended computing unit  to perform a remote co-processing function, but the processing module of the handheld computing unit and the extended computing unit do not function as a multiprocessing module as they do when in the extended mode.","As an alternative, the quasi extended mode may be achieved by the handheld computing unit  communicating with the extended computing unit via the WLAN communication  and the WLAN router .
