title: Analyzing marketplace listing strategies
abstract: A method and system analyze marketplace listing strategies. In some embodiments, the method accesses data associated with multiple marketplace listings. Each marketplace listing is associated with a product category. A state-action model, associated with the product category, is created based on the data associated with the multiple marketplace listings. The state-action model is then analyzed to identify a marketplace listing strategy associated with the product category.

No. 61\/318,219, entitled \u201cMODELING SELLER LISTING STRATEGIES\u201d, filed Mar. 26, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure generally relates to data processing techniques and, more specifically, to methods and systems for analyzing marketplace listing strategies.","Advancements in computer and networking technology have enabled users and entities to conduct various types of transactions online via computer-based applications and systems. These advancements have caused the growth of electronic commerce, commonly referred to as \u201cecommerce\u201d, and the development of ecommerce marketplaces that allow multiple users and entities to shop and execute various online transactions.","Many ecommerce marketplaces support the buying and selling of large numbers of items and services. In particular ecommerce marketplaces, sellers may use different pricing strategies, shipping options, and other marketplace listing techniques when presenting items and services for sale. Although multiple sellers may offer the same item in the same ecommerce marketplace, the sellers may experience different sales success based on the listing techniques used when presenting the item in the marketplace.","Example methods and systems to analyze marketplace listing strategies are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","The methods and systems described herein identify and analyze marketplace listing information associated with one or more users (e.g., marketplace sellers). The results of the analysis are used to generate one or more recommendations regarding marketplace listings for other users. These recommendations may include adjusting a price of a product in a listing, adjusting shipping costs (e.g., offering free shipping), and adding the listing as a featured selection. The described systems and methods may consider historical data associated with one or more users as well as current data (e.g., current marketplace listings).","The methods and systems further allow other users to learn from successful sellers in a common marketplace. This information is beneficial to other users who are not experiencing success in selling items in the marketplace by allowing them to identify listing strategies of more experienced sellers who are listing the same or similar items.","As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d or an \u201centity\u201d may be a person (e.g., a human), a business (e.g., a company), an organization, a group of people, a persona (e.g., a fictitious character), or any combination thereof. Further, as used herein, a \u201cmarketplace listing strategy\u201d is any technique, procedure, or action used in selling or offering products, services or other items in a marketplace. A marketplace listing strategy may also be referred to as a \u201cproduct listing strategy\u201d or \u201clisting strategy\u201d. Example marketplace listing strategies include lowering the listing price after a time period if the item has not sold, offering free shipping on items in certain price ranges, and so forth. Although particular examples discussed herein refer to \u201cproducts\u201d, the teachings of the present invention are applicable to any type of marketplace listing for any product, service, item, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112"]},"An Application Programming Interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . Application servers  host one or more marketplace applications  and payment applications . Application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases .","Marketplace applications  may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access networked system . Payment applications  may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. Payment applications  may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints\u201d) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are made available via the marketplace applications . While the marketplace and payment applications  and  are shown in  to both form part of networked system , it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, payment applications  may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from networked system .","Further, while the system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, the present invention is of course not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various marketplace and payment applications  and  could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.","Web client  accesses the various marketplace and payment applications  and  via the web interface supported by web server . Similarly, programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace and payment applications  and  via the programmatic interface provided by API server . Programmatic client  may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on networked system  in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between programmatic client  and networked system . Some embodiments of the present invention may be implemented by components of the marketplace application(s) . For example, a listing strategy module  or other system performs the analysis of marketplace listing strategies described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["128","130","102","114","128","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["132","132","118","132"]},"In the embodiment of , listing strategy module  includes a product clustering module , a data summary module , a listing analysis module , listing strategy data , and a recommendation module . Product clustering module  is configured to cluster various products contained in multiple marketplace listings into common groupings. As discussed in greater detail below, this clustering of products is performed in particular embodiments by making reference to one or more product catalogs. Data summary module  is configured to summarize multiple sets of listing information that were grouped together by product clustering module . Listing analysis module  is configured to analyze the summarized listings to identify listing strategies used by one or more sellers in the marketplace. Listing strategy data  represents the listing strategies identified, for example, by listing analysis module . Recommendation module  is configured to make recommendations regarding marketplace listing parameters based on listing strategy data .","In alternate embodiments, listing strategy module  may include fewer or more modules apart from those shown in . For example, in one alternate embodiment, data summary module  is integrated within product clustering module . Product clustering module , data summary module , listing analysis module , and recommendation module  may be in the form of software that is processed by a processor. In another example, as described herein, modules , , , and  may be in the form of firmware that is processed by application specific integrated circuits (ASICs); which may be integrated into a circuit board. Alternatively, modules , , , and  may be in the form of one or more logic blocks included in a programmable logic device (e.g., a field programmable gate array (FPGA)). The described modules , , , and  may be adapted, and\/or additional structures may be used to provide alternative or additional functionalities beyond those specifically discussed with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 9"],"b":["300","300","300","132","300","302"]},"After accessing the listing data, method  accesses a catalog containing multiple products at . The catalog includes, for example, data associated with any number of different types of products. This data may include product descriptions, product features, product specifications, and so forth. In a particular implementation, method  accesses multiple catalogs to obtain data associated with multiple different products. Example catalogs may be obtained from a product manufacturer, product distributor or a third party entity. Alternatively, one or more catalogs may be created by an entity associated with the marketplace.","Multiple users can create product listings for the same product but describe the product in different ways, such as using different words in the listing or describing different characteristics of the product. Thus, it is desirable to group (or cluster) together multiple listings that identify the same product. Method  clusters the products in the multiple marketplace listings based on information accessed from the catalog and data associated with the multiple listings at . Thus, if two different listings for the same product have different descriptions, they will be grouped together for purposes of analysis. Additional details regarding this clustering process are discussed below with respect to .","After the multiple listings are grouped together based on a common product, data associated with the group of listings is stored at . This stored data supports future analysis of the multiple listings, such as analysis of seller listing strategies for a particular product.","New marketplace listings are typically added on a regular basis. Thus, the data associated with current and historical listings continues to grow as new listings are added by users. Further, different users may adjust their product listing strategies at different time frequencies. For example, users may update listing strategies on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. To simplify the processing of the stored listing data associated with a particular product, the multiple listings are summarized based on a specific time interval at . In one embodiment, the multiple listings are summarized based on a calendar week. The summarized listing data is stored at  for future analysis. Additional details regarding this summarization of multiple listings are discussed below with respect to .","After storing the summarized listing data, method  analyzes the summarized listing data at . This analysis identifies marketplace listing strategies at  used by one or more sellers in the marketplace. In a particular implementation, this analysis is focused on sellers with successful selling results in the marketplace, such that the analysis identifies successful marketplace listing strategies in the particular marketplace. These successful marketplace listing strategies may be useful in improving the sales of products by other sellers in the marketplace. For example, if a successful seller in a particular product category regularly uses the listing strategy of offering free shipping, the system may recommend that other sellers in the same product category offer free shipping to improve their sales activity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","306","400","300"]},"Initially, method  removes data, entries associated with bundled items at . \u201cBundled items\u201d refers to the bundling or packaging of multiple products and\/or services into a single marketplace listing (e.g., bundling a cellular phone with a carrying case). Since the bundled items do not contain a single product, their listing strategies may differ from those of individual products. For example, a seller of a carrying case alone may use a different listing strategy than a cellular phone bundled with a carrying case. The bundled items are removed from both the marketplace listing data and the catalog data at . Table 1 below identifies example marketplace listing data after removal of bundled items. Table 1 is limited to three marketplace listings for purposes of discussion.

In this example, two of the listings are associated with seller ABC, and one listing is associated with setter DEF. Although the three listings have different titles, they are all associated with the same product (an \u201cAcme DE-9 Player\u201d). The three listings in Table 1 have different combinations of start dates, end dates, price, and shipping cost.","Method  continues by calculating a matching score between each of the multiple marketplace listings and each product in the catalog at  based on various factors such as brand name, model number, and description. Additionally, the matching score may include the number of matched words between the catalog description and the listing title. For example, the matching score may be calculated using a word similarity algorithm. In one embodiment, a Jaccard similarity coefficient (also referred to as a Jaccard Index) provides a ratio of the number of common words between the catalog description and the listing title to the total distinct words found in the catalog description and the listing title.","The highest matching score between each marketplace listing and a product in the catalog is identified at . Based on this highest matching score, each marketplace listing is associated with the product having the highest matching score at . Thus, multiple marketplace listings that use different product descriptions will be associated with the same product based on the matching with a common catalog. As discussed above with respect to , the resulting association between each marketplace listing and a particular product is stored for later analysis.","In a particular embodiment, each marketplace listing is further associated with a product category at . This product category is determined based on the product associated with the listing. For example, if the product is an Acme DE-9 Player, the product category is \u201cPortable Media Player\u201d. A product category can have any number of associated products from different manufacturers. Associating marketplace listings with a product category simplifies the analysis of seller listing strategies. Instead of analyzing seller listing strategies associated with each model of portable media player, all listings for this product category are analyzed together. Thus, the seller listing strategies are based on (and applicable to) a large number of products in the product category. In this embodiment, all three listings in Table 1 are associated with the same product category (portable media players) although their descriptions and titles are different.","In alternate embodiments, seller listing strategies may be analyzed on a per-product basis. In this embodiment, different listing strategies may be identified for specific products. For example, a particular model of cellular phone may have a different listing strategy than another model of cellular phone. This embodiment typically requires a larger amount of transactional data to develop a relevant amount of data for each product being analyzed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["500","310","500","502","504","500"]},"The method continues by identifying an average price of all listings in the product category during the time period at . In the example of Table 1, the average price of all listings in the product category is 133.33 ((100+150+150)\/3). At , method  identifies an average price of all listings in the product category during the time period and that are initiated by a particular seller. In the example of Table 1, the average price of all listings initiated by seller \u201cABC\u201d is 125.00 ((100+150)\/2). A total number of listings initiated by the seller in the product category during the time period is determined at . Table 1 shows two listings initiated by seller \u201cABC\u201d.","Method  continues by determining at  a number of listings in the product category during the time period in which the seller offered free product shipping. In the example of Table 1, 50% of the listings initiated by seller \u201cABC\u201d offered free product shipping. In alternate embodiments, the method may determine an average shipping cost charged by the seller for all listings instead of the percentage of listings with free shipping. At , the method determines a number of listings in the product category and during the time period in which the seller identified the listing as a featured listing. In the example of Table 1, none of the listings initiated by seller \u201cABC\u201d were featured listings. As discussed below, the information identified and calculated in  is analyzed to identify seller listing strategies associated with one or more product categories.","Table 1 and the descriptions herein identify and calculate particular types of data used in analyzing seller listing strategies. Alternate embodiments may identify and calculate fewer types of data than those discussed herein. Other embodiments may identify and calculate additional types of data, such as the day of the week the listing was initiated, whether the listing was a fixed price listing or an auction style listing, whether the listing offered a \u201cbuy it now\u201d feature, types of payment methods accepted, shipping options (e.g., carriers), whether local pick-up of the item is available, the category (or categories) in which the listing was identified, and, if the listing was an auction, whether the listing had a specified reserve price.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["602","604","602","604"]},"As used herein, a \u201cstate-action model\u201d may also be referred to as a \u201cmarketplace listing model\u201d or a \u201clisting strategy model\u201d.","In one embodiment, a predictive Markov chain models seller listing behaviors using the information identified and calculated from various data sources as discussed above with respect to . A Markov chain model is defined by a set of states and a set of transitions having associated probabilities. The combination of states and transitions between those states generates a sequence (e.g., a chain). The Markov chain model helps determine whether successful sellers use consistent strategies when listing their products in the marketplace. If the successful sellers do use consistent listing strategies, the Markov chain models can assist in predicting their listing decisions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},"Method  begins by identifying state representations at . Example states and their corresponding values are shown in . Each state of the model contains information about the marketplace condition and a seller's new listings created in a time interval. The method further identifies action representations at . An action by a particular seller at a specific time represents a listing change (e.g., price change or shipping cost change) as compared to the listing details prior to the specific time.","Method  continues by creating a state-action model at , such as a Markov chain model. In a traditional implementation, the Markov chain model does not consider past actions when transitioning from a current state to a different state. However, marketplace sellers may review the effectiveness of past actions when considering a change to a current marketplace listing. Thus, a particular embodiment of the state-action model discussed herein extends the model's state representation to include currently available information as well as the seller's last action.","After creating the state-action model, the method generates a transition model from state to action at , also referred to as a \u201cstate-action transition model\u201d. To identify seller listing strategies, the transition model focuses on the action taken from a particular state, rather than focusing on the resulting state. The action taken in response to a particular state is valuable in determining the seller's strategy. The state-action transition model identifies a probability associated with each of the possible actions a seller may take in a particular state. This probability is referred to as \u201cPr(action|state)\u201d. A particular transition from a state to an action identifies the probability of the particular transition as well as the number of times the seller has selected the particular transition from the current state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","802","804","806","802","804","806","808","804","810","806","802"]},"Referring back to , the method continues by determining multiple listing strategy models based on different sets of data at . Each set of data is clustered and summarized as described above with respect to . For each set of data, a corresponding state and action are determined as discussed herein. To evaluate the predictive value of the listing strategy models, the method compares pairs of listing strategy models at . In one embodiment, evaluating the predictive value of the listing strategy model includes computing a log likelihood of the data (D) with the model (M). The computation of the log likelihood (L) is as follows:\n\n()=avg(log((action|state)))\n\nWhere avg is the average value of the log of each probability.\n","Two different listing strategy models (M and M) derived from two different data sets (D and D) can be compared using the following equation:\n\n(12)=(1)\/(2)\n\nWhere a L(M, M) value less than one means that M is a better model at predicting listing strategies than M. If the L(M, M) value is greater than one, then M is a better model at predicting listing strategies than M.\n","Additionally, when comparing listing strategy models M and M, the method can determine how much better at prediction one model (M) is compared to another model (M) by calculating:\n\nPredictor quality=1(12).\n","Method  represents one approach for analyzing the summarized marketplace listings. Alternate embodiments may use different techniques to analyze marketplace listing strategies associated with one or more sellers.","After identifying a listing strategy model that result in desirable sales activity, that model may be applied to other listings and other sellers in the marketplace.
