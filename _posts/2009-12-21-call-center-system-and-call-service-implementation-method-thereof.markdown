of course, the embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned function types listed; it should be illustrated that the above Web browser and the Web access module together accomplish the function of the Web access device ;","a network queuing device, which is a network queuing interface used for providing a connection to the CTI for a seat queuing;","an instant messaging server, which is a network server for providing instant messaging service, can be either an existing public instant messaging system, such as QQ and MSN, or a self-developed instant messaging system;","a CTI, which is a core module of the conventional call center framework;","a soft switch, which is a core device of a telecommunication network, for finishing the control and processing function of the whole call flow and meanwhile controlling the connection and disconnection of a speech path bearer network;","an intelligent network SSP, which is a middle point between the intelligent network and the soft switch, for processing the interaction between the intelligent network and the soft switch; and","the seat is divided into three parts, comprising: an instant messaging module, used for communicating with the instant messaging server; a seat module, used for communicating with the CTI; and a telephone device with an SIP software telephone or a PSTN conventional telephone as a seat, which is a seat device used for performing communication between the seat representative and the user.","Preferably, the call center system according to the embodiment of the present invention is divided into three basic systems, comprising:","an online access queuing system which is connected to the CTI through the network queuing interface between the network queuing device and the CTI; an instant messaging system based on the instant messaging server; and a call center customer service platform system based on the soft switch, the intelligent network SSP, the SIP soft telephone and the seat module.","The above-mentioned three basic systems are independent from each other and can be combined flexibly and organically, for example, an instant messaging system existing in the Internet can be combined with an original call center platform; or a self-developed instant messaging system can be combined with a call center platform.","For clearly describing the specific work process of the call center system according to the embodiment of the present invention, the specific operation flow of the call center system according to the embodiment in practical application will be illustrated in detail by a typical flow of an online chat which is performed through a Web being accessed to the call center system, wherein the flow comprises the following steps:","(1) a user logs on an Instant Messaging system Server (IMServer) using his\/her own instant messaging system account and a Web access module embedded into the Web browser;","(2) the user is connected to the network queuing device through the Web access module, transmits instant messaging queuing information to the CTI to queue through the internet connection and waits queuing result information to be returned by the CTI; wherein the instant messaging queuing information comprises information of the instant messaging system account of the user, information of seat skills required by the user, i.e., what services the seat can provide; the instant messaging queuing information can be transmitted by a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) tunnel technology;","(3) the CTI determines whether the user has obtained an authorization of the service and whether the current system supports the Web access method according to the instant messaging queuing information, if yes, an instant messaging account of a seat customer service representative who is in idle state and supports the service skill will be allocated, the instant messaging account will be displayed to the user as the queuing result information through the network queuing device, the Web access module and the Web browser in turn; and the CTI sends a Web access service beginning message to the seat module in the seat while returning the queuing result information, wherein the message corresponds to the instant messaging account of the user;","(4) the Web access module initiates an instant messaging request to the instant messaging module in the seat according to the instant messaging account in the queuing result information returned by the CTI; the instant messaging module in the seat forwards the request message to the seat module after receiving the request; and the seat module notifies the instant messaging module to accept the instant messaging request after determining that the instant messaging request is legitimate;","wherein the determining criteria of the seat module is: comparing the Web access service beginning message sent by the CTI with the instant messaging request sent by the instant messaging module, and, if it is indicated that the instant messaging request is a legitimate message by comparison, notifying the instant messaging module to accept the instant messaging request;","(5) after accepting the session request, the seat notifies the CTI to set the state of the seat being in service through the seat module; the CTI refreshes the state of the seat, does not accept other access requests of accessing the seat any longer and notifies other modules such as a log server of the call center platform to perform corresponding processing, such as recording a service log, a session start time and the like;","(6) the user and the seat then can begin an online chat directly with their accounts in the instant messaging system as identifiers; and","(7) the user and the seat can further initiate other extended services supported by the instant messaging system, such as video chat, video conference, white board, application program share, remote assistance and the like; the customer service representatives can serve the accessed users by various interaction modes.","The above process is the process that a user initiates the instant messaging request to a seat; the session access process of the system will be described briefly below:","(1) the Web access module initiates a session call access request to the seat based on the session call access operation of a user, and sends the CTI call queuing information of the user including the call number of the user; wherein the Web access module preferably sends the session call access request to the seat through the soft switch and the intelligent network SSP;","(2) the CTI allocates an idle seat to the user according to the received call queuing information;","(3) after the CTI allocates the idle seat, the seat accepts the session call access request sent by the Web access module via the soft switch and the intelligent network SSP, and performs a session; and","(4) after accepting the session call access request, the seat notifies the CTI to set the state of the seat being in service, the CTI refuses other access requests of accessing the seat.","The call center according to the embodiment of the present invention, compared with the existing call center platform with the single manner of voice communication, greatly improves the interaction between the customer service representatives and the user. Meanwhile, for some application fields, such as using a remote assistance function to help a user to solve a computer fault and using a white board to draw a simple map, and guiding the user how to reach a designated place and so on, the communication effect is obviously improved and the experience of the user is greatly improved compared with the single manner of the voice communication.
