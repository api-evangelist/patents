title: Methods and apparatus for managing groups of resources
abstract: An agent in a storage area network communicates with a management entity in the storage area network to discover a group of resources in the storage area network controlled by the management entity. In response to discovering the group of resources, the agent associates member resources (e.g., and their respective names) of the group of resources to a corresponding group identifier to which the member resources belong. The agent reports i) the corresponding group identifier and ii) the member resources of the group of resources controlled by the management entity to a management control center that assigns one of multiple agents in the storage area network to manage the group of resources based on communications with the management entity. After a step of assigning, the management control center can initiate an assigned agent to control the group of resources.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Information services and data processing industries in general have rapidly expanded as a result of the need for computer systems to manage and store large amounts of data. As an example, financial service companies such as banks, mutual fund companies and the like now, more than ever before, require access to many hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of data and files stored in high capacity data storage systems. Other types of service companies have similar needs for data storage.","Data storage system developers have responded to an increased need for storage by integrating high capacity data storage systems, data communications devices (e.g., switches), and computer systems (e.g., host computers or servers) into networks called \u201cstorage networks\u201d or \u201cStorage Area Networks\u201d (SANs). In general, a storage area network is a collection of data storage systems that are networked via a switching fabric to a number of host computer systems operating as servers. The host computers access data stored in the data storage systems on behalf of client computers that request data from the data storage systems. For example, according to conventional applications, upon receiving a storage access request, a respective host computer in the storage area network accesses a large repository of storage through the switching fabric of the storage area network on behalf of the requesting client. Thus, via the host computer (e.g., server), a client has access to the shared storage system through the host computer. In many applications, storage area networks support hi-speed acquisitions of data so that the host servers are able to promptly retrieve and store data from the data storage system.","Conventional storage area network management applications typically include a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables a network manager to graphically manage, control, and configure various types of hardware and software resources associated with a corresponding managed storage area network. For example, one conventional network management storage application generates a graphical user interface utilized by a network manager to graphically select, interface with, and manage local or remote devices and associated software processes associated with the storage area network. Based on use of the graphical user interface in combination with an input device such as a hand operated mouse and corresponding pointer displayed on a viewing screen, a network manager is able to manage hardware and software entities such as file systems, databases, storage devices, peripherals, network data communications devices, etc., associated with the storage area network. Consequently, a network management station and associated management software enables a network administrator or systems manager (a person responsible for managing the storage network) to manage the storage area network and its resources. One purpose of managing storage area network resources is to maintain the storage area network so that the storage area network is properly configured to provide efficient data access to many users.","To manage devices such as switches in a storage area network, a network administrator may arbitrarily assign agents in the storage area network to manage the switches through a common storage area network management device. For example, the network administrator may assign a first agent a duty of managing a first switch based on communications from the first agent to a management device that in turn controls the first switch. Additionally, the network administrator may assign a second agent a duty of managing a second switch device based on communications from the second agent to the same management device that in turn controls the second switch.","Conventional network management applications that support management of network resources via use of multiple agents in a storage area network typically suffer from a number of deficiencies. For example, assigning multiple agents to manage multiple switches in a storage area network typically results in contention when multiple assigned agents attempt to retrieve information or perform operations with respect to different resources controlled by the same management device in the storage area network. This can occur when retrieval of data for a group of resources managed by the management device is not severable. That is, when prompted by either of multiple assigned agents, the management device may only be able to provide information with respect to a whole group of resources in the group of resources that it controls rather than sending only relevant information to the respective agents about the resources that the respective agents manage. Accordingly, the first agent as discussed above in the background of the present application would receive information about resources managed by the second agent and vice versa in response to, e.g., an inquiry from a management control center about the resources managed by a respective agent.","Arbitrary assignment of agents to manage storage area network resources as discussed above may result in poor system performance and potential timeouts. For example, communication links between agents and a management device may not support the bandwidth required so that the management device can efficiently distribute the redundant set of information about a group of resources to multiple agents. Also, the management device may not have appropriate processing power to quickly disseminate the redundant information to multiple agents. Either of these types of bottlenecks may result in communication timeouts between the agents and the management device and poor performance.","Techniques discussed in this application provide advantages over conventional network management applications. In particular, embodiments of the present application include mechanisms and techniques for assigning a group of resources controlled by a storage area network management entity to a single agent rather than assigning each of multiple agents management responsibilities associated with different resources in the group of resources controlled by a respective management entity. More specifically, according to one configuration discussed herein, a management control center communicates with multiple agents in a storage area network. The agents communicate with management entities that in turn control resources such as switches in the storage area network. Based on this chain of communications, the management control center indirectly controls the resources in the storage area network by initiating the agents to communicate with the management entities and control the resources.","Typically, multiple agents in the storage area network are able to communicate with the same management entity. In such an instance, and according to conventional applications as discussed above, multiple agents may be arbitrarily assigned to manage resources controlled by the same management entity. However, techniques herein enable the management control center to learn which groups of resources in the storage area network are controlled by a particular management entity. Based on the learned groupings of resources, the management control center can assign the agents to manage whole groupings of resources rather than split management responsibilities associated with a group of resources to multiple agents. For example, rather than assign a first agent to manage one resource in a group of related resources (e.g., a group of resources controlled by a respective management entity) and a second agent to manage another resource in the group of related resources, the management control center assigns some or all management responsibilities associated with the group of related resources to either the first agent or the second agent. This technique reduces overhead communications because only one agent communicates with the respective management entity to control the resources rather than two agents.","Accordingly, one general embodiment of the present application is directed to techniques for distinguishing groupings of resources in a storage area network. For example, an agent in a storage area network communicates with a management entity in the storage area network to discover a group of resources in the storage area network controlled by the management entity. In response to discovering a group of resources, the agent associates member resources (e.g., and their respective names) of the group of resources to a corresponding group identifier to which the member resources belong. The agent reports i) the corresponding group identifier and ii) the member resources of the group of resources controlled by the management entity to a management control center that assigns one of multiple agents in the storage area network to manage the group of resources based on communications with the management entity.","Another general embodiment of the invention is directed to a technique of assigning management responsibilities associated with resources in a storage area network to multiple agents, the multiple agents being in communication with management entities that in turn control the resources in the storage area network. For example, a management control center generates an inquiry to learn of resources controlled by the management entities of the storage area network. In response to the inquiry, the management control center receives resource identifiers and respective group identifiers for at least a portion of the multiple resources in the storage area network. The resource identifiers identify respective resources of the storage area network. The group identifiers identify corresponding groups of resources to which the identified resources belong. Typically, a group of resources as identified by a common group identifier is controlled by a respective management entity of the storage area network. The management control center assigns a particular agent in the storage area network to execute management responsibilities (based on the assigned agents communicating with the respective management entity) associated with a group of resources having a common associated group identifier.","Techniques of the present application are well suited for use in systems in which a management control center discovers groups of resources managed by management entities in a storage area network and the management control center assigns agents distributed in the storage area network duties of communicating with the management entities that in turn control the groups of resources. However, it should be noted that embodiments of the present application are not limited to use in such applications.","Other embodiments of the present application include a computerized device (e.g., a host computer, workstation, etc.) configured to support the aforementioned method operations disclosed herein as embodiments of the present application to assign management capabilities among multiple agents in a storage area network. In such embodiments, the computerized device such as a management control center includes a memory system, a processor (e.g., a processing device), a display, and an interconnect. The interconnect supports communications among the display, the processor, and the memory system. The memory system is encoded with an application that, when executed on the processor, produces a process that supports offloading execution of management operations to agents that operate on behalf of a management control center.","Yet other embodiments of the present application disclosed herein include software programs to perform the method embodiment and operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below under the heading Detailed Description. More particularly, a computer program product (e.g., a computer-readable medium) including computer program logic encoded thereon may be executed on a computerized device to support discovery of groups of resources and assignment of management responsibilities as explained herein. The computer program logic, when executed on at least one processor with a computing system, causes the processor to perform the operations (e.g., the methods) indicated herein as embodiments of the present application. Such arrangements of the present application are typically provided as software, code and\/or other data structures arranged or encoded on a computer readable medium such as an optical medium (e.g., CD-ROM), floppy or hard disk or other a medium such as firmware or microcode in one or more ROM or RAM or PROM chips or as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or as downloadable software images in one or more modules, shared libraries, etc. The software or firmware or other such configurations can be installed onto a computerized device to cause one or more processors in the computerized device to perform the techniques explained herein as embodiments of the present application.","One more particular embodiment of the present application is directed to a computer program product that includes a computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon for supporting management of network resources. The instructions, when carried out by a processor of a respective computer device, cause the processor to perform the steps of: i) generating an inquiry to learn of resources controlled by management entities of a storage area network; ii) in response to the inquiry, receiving resource identifiers and respective group identifiers for at least a portion of the multiple resources in the storage area network, the resource identifiers identifying respective resources of the storage area network, the group identifiers identifying corresponding groups of resources to which the identified resources belong, the groups of resources as identified by common group identifiers being controlled by respective management entities of the storage area network; and iii) assigning a particular agent in the storage area network to execute management responsibilities associated with a group of resources having a common associated group identifier. Other embodiments of the present application include software programs to perform any of the method embodiment steps and operations summarized above and disclosed in detail below.","It should be understood that the system of the present application can be embodied as a software program or as a software program operating in conjunction with corresponding hardware. Example embodiments of the present application may be implemented in conjunction with EMC's Control Center (ECC) software application that provides graphical management functionality for storage area network resources and in computerized devices that operate the Control Center (ECC) software. Control Center software is manufactured by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass., USA.","According to one implementation of the present application, an agent in a storage area network communicates with a management entity in the storage area network to discover a group of storage area network resources controlled by the management entity. In response to discovering the group of resources, the agent associates member resources (e.g., and their respective names) of the group of resources to a corresponding group identifier to which the member resources belong. For example, the agent generates a list of resources (e.g., managed objects) and a corresponding group identifier that identifies a respective group to which the resources belong. The agent reports i) the corresponding group identifier and ii) the member resources of the group of resources controlled by the management entity to a management control center that assigns one of multiple agents in the storage area network to manage the group of resources based on communications with the management entity. After a step of assigning, the management control center can initiate an assigned agent to communicate with a respective management entity to control the group of resources.","This technique of distinguishing which resources form a particular group and assigning an agent to manage a respective group of storage area network resources (rather than splitting management of the group of resources among multiple agents) alleviates a management control center from having to coordinate direct communications with and control many different types of vendor devices in the storage area network. Instead of relying on direct communications, the management control center indirectly controls a group of resources through a respectively assigned agent. As an example, in response to receiving a control command from a user at the management control center, the management control center transmits user-generated requests or commands to the respectively assigned agents that, in turn, communicate with respective management entities to control resources of the storage area network on behalf of the management control center.","As discussed, one reason for assigning management functions associated with a group of resources associated with a respective management entity to a single agent rather than splitting management functions to multiple agents for a group of resources is to reduce overhead such as network traffic, eliminate contention, and increase system performance, etc. That is, only the single assigned agent managing the group of resources needs to communicate with the respective management entity about the group of resources rather than two otherwise assigned agents communicating with the respective management entity about the same group of resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","304","1","304","2","304","340","350","375","1","375","2","375","110","125"]},"Network  includes switch device -, switch device - which themselves have corresponding switch ports  and . Network  also includes me -, me -, . . . (collectively, management entities ) that control resources in storage area network environment  and more specifically groups of resources in network . For example, me - can be configured to control groups of switches in switch device -, me - can be configured to control groups of switches in switch device -, etc. This will be discussed in greater detail later in this specification.","Host entity - includes adapter - and corresponding port - and port - to communicate over network .

Storage area network  can include any number of agents, each of which may operate on any computerized device in the storage area network environment . For example, agents can reside in respective devices in network , network , etc.","In general, and as will be more particularly discussed, computer system  (e.g., management control system) learns of groupings of resources in storage area network environment  and assigns an agent in storage area network environment  duties of supporting exclusive sets of management functions associated with the group of resources. For example, the agents communicate with me  that in turn control groups of resources (e.g., switches ) in network . Based on the assignments, agents , , and  act on behalf of computer system  to control, e.g., switch devices . Proper configuration and control of switches  ensures that host entities  may efficiently access data from storage system resources  on behalf of clients.","Agents can be distributed throughout storage area network environment  as shown. In one application, agents , ,  run on respective host entities  that are not dedicated to serving data from storage area network environment  to corresponding clients. In other words, agents optionally run on host resources (e.g., host entities ) that are at least partially dedicated to executing agents, but not serving clients. Agents may also run on host entities that do serve data retrieved from storage system resources  to respective clients.","For illustrative purposes, computer system  (e.g., a management control center) is configured, in this example, as a storage area network management station operated by a user  such as a network manager responsible for managing resources in the storage area network . For example, computer system  executes a resource manager application  (e.g., a software graphical user interface application) that generates and displays information in accordance with embodiments of the present application as will be explained herein. The resource manager  may be any type of network management software application that executes, performs, or otherwise operates within computer  such as a computerized management station.","The management station computer system  (e.g., a computer device) includes a corresponding display  (e.g., a monitor or other visual display device) that resource manager  controls to display a graphical user interface . In general, graphical user interface  presented by a software application (e.g., resource manager ) running on computer  enables user  to initiate execution of commands to associated devices such as switches  in storage area network environment . For example, a user  may provide input commands (e.g., selections by clicking on a mouse) to i) control information (e.g., tables, pop-up screens, etc.) displayed on display  and ii) request an agent  (or other agents as is generally the case throughout this document) to perform a management function (e.g., configuration of switches ).","In one application, resource manager  initiates discovery or rediscovery of management capabilities and groupings of resources associated with resources in storage area network environment  without being prompted by a user . For example, resource manager  periodically or occasionally executes a discovery\/rediscovery as a regular course of business to learn of management capabilities associated with devices in the storage area network environment . In response to learning new management capabilities, the computer system  may assign\/reassign the agents , , and  different management functions or duties.","Computer system  and, more particularly, resource manager  stores learned attributes associated with storage area network environment  in repository . Based on management capabilities reported by agents , , and  to computer system , resource manager  notifies (e.g., via a display screen  of selectable options in graphical user interface ) user  of management functions that can be performed on resources (e.g., switch devices) in the storage area network environment .","Note again that storage area network environment  enables host entities  (e.g., servers, etc.) to access data in storage system resources  on behalf of clients coupled to or through the host entities . However, as discussed, certain host entities  are optionally dedicated to running agent applications rather than server applications for serving data to clients.","The following discussion illustrates how certain host entities  in storage area network environment  serve data to clients. For example, host entity - couples to network  via adapter - and corresponding ports . Ports  couple to respective ports  and  on switch devices . In turn, ports  and  of switch devices  couple to ports  and  of corresponding storage system resources . Thus, switch devices  and corresponding ports  and  form at least part of a data path (e.g., a zone) between host entities  and corresponding storage system resources .","Storage system resources - include access controllers  to facilitate access to corresponding storage devices  (e.g., logical storage space). Storage devices  are configured as logical portions of one or more physical storage devices  (e.g., arrays of storage disks). Maps  provide a mapping of storage devices  (e.g., logical volumes) to corresponding physical storage devices  (e.g., storage disks).","Typically, selected host entities  are limited to accessing certain storage devices  in storage system resource - based at least in part on configuration settings of switch devices  of network . For example, in one embodiment, switch ports  and  of switches  are assigned to create a particular zone in network . In general, a zone defines a group of resources in the network providing a logical path i) through a switch resource  and ii) between a host resource  and a storage array resource . Thus, in some respects, a zone defines a logical data flow path in the storage area network environment .","As discussed, computer system  assigns agents , , and  to manage different groupings of resources to more effectively support configuration of and communication within storage area network environment . Based on the assignments, agents , , and  in storage area network environment  enable user  to configure the storage area network environment  so that host entities can more efficiently access data on behalf of corresponding clients.

In another embodiment, the computer system  learns of groupings of resources and assigns the agents to manage the groupings of resources without knowing which respective management entities are associated with the groups of resources. In this latter case, the agents keep track of which management entities are associated with respective groups of resources. Because of such tracking, the agents already know with which management entities to communicate when managing the groups of resources on behalf of the computer system  and therefore need not be notified by the computer system . Agents include respective interfaces (e.g., management application programming interfaces) capable of communicating with management entities  based on, for example, communication protocols such as i) SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), ii) FAL (Fabric Access Layer), iii) SMI (Storage Management Interface), and\/or iv) SWAPI (Switch Application Programming Interface), etc. As mentioned, communications via such protocols enable discovery and management of device attributes (e.g., management capabilities) such as configuration, name of ports, connectivity paths, zone information, vendor type, etc associated with resources in storage area network environment .","In one application, computer  forwards one or more management addresses (e.g., network addresses associated with management entities  in the storage area network environment ) to agents, which operate on behalf of the management control center (i.e., computer ) and utilize the management address (or addresses) to communicate with and query corresponding management entities  about its corresponding management capabilities (e.g., ability to manage respective resources).

Groups FC and group FC identify groups of fabric resources that are potentially controlled by respective management entity - and -. If possible, assignment of managing group FB to a single agent such as agent , , or  solves a problem of assigning all the member resources of the group. Assigning an agent to manage group FA would leave resource RF as an orphan. However, this condition can be avoided by assigning another agent to manage group FC. In such a case, there would be some overlap because two agents could manage resource RF. To avoid producing sets of orphans, when assigning management of a group of resources, it may be desirable for computer system  to assign agents groups of resources encompassing a largest number of resources to reduce how many agents must be assigned to manage the groups of resources.","Functionality supported by agents (e.g., agents , , , and ) in storage area network environment  and management control system  will now be discussed via flowchart  in .
