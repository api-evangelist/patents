{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","The present disclosure relates generally to optics and, more particularly, to pumped semiconductor lasers which emit light at a preselected wavelength.","A laser diode is a laser where the active medium is a semiconductor similar to the semiconductors found in light emitting diodes. One method of exciting the atoms in lasers, called pumping, is achieved by illuminating the semiconductor material with a high-energy light source, such as xenon flash tubes, are lamps, or metal-vapor lamps.","Generally, in optically pumped laser diodes the gain region of the laser is surrounded with an optical cavity, forming a Fabry-Perot resonator. In its simplest form, a waveguide is formed on the crystal surface of the semiconductor, confining the light to a narrow line. Photons emitted in a longitudinal mode of the waveguide may be reflected back and forth several times before being emitted from the laser. As the light is amplified by stimulated emission, the laser begins to \u201clase.\u201d The geometry of the optical cavity is such that when only a narrow beam of light is desired, the vertical (perpendicular to the semiconductor layer) and horizontal (width) directions are sufficiently narrow (on the order of the optical wavelength) such that each supports only a single optical mode. The length of the waveguide is consistent with the longitudinal mode to be supported. In general, the wavelength of the light emitted is dependent upon the band-gap of the semiconductor and the modes of the optical cavity. Generally, the maximum gain will occur for photons slightly above the band-gap energy, and the modes nearest the gain peak will lase with the most intensity. Some instability has arisen in laser diodes that operate at a single wavelength due to fluctuations in current or temperature. In particular, there is a need for lasers that produce light in the green region of the light spectrum in a stable manner.","There have previously been attempts to address the \u201cgreen gap\u201d problem in semiconductor lasers where conventional green DPSS lasers create a need for a more stable system.","In the past, in order to create lasers that lase at a particular wavelength, such as in the green portion of the spectrum, frequency doubling crystals have been utilized. By way of background, crystal materials used in semiconductor lasers can exhibit nonlinearity, which can give rise to the phenomenon of frequency doubling, where an input (pump) wave generates another wave with twice the optical frequency (i.e., half the wavelength) in the medium. This process is also called second-harmonic generation. In most cases, the pump wave is delivered in the form of a laser beam, and the frequency-doubled (second-harmonic) wave is generated in the form of a beam propagating in a similar direction.","The physical mechanism behind frequency doubling can be understood as follows. Due to the nonlinearity, the fundamental (pump) wave generates a nonlinear polarization which oscillates with twice the fundamental frequency. According to Maxwell's equations, this nonlinear polarization radiates an electromagnetic field with this doubled frequency. Due to phase matching issues, the generated second-harmonic field propagates dominantly in the direction of the nonlinear polarization wave. The latter also interacts with the fundamental wave, so that the pump couples power from the pump wave to the second-harmonic wave. For low pump intensities, the second-harmonic conversion efficiency is small and grows linearly with increasing pump intensity, so that the intensity of the second-harmonic (frequency-doubled) wave grows with the square of the pump intensity. Once pump depletion becomes significant, the further rise of second-harmonic power becomes slower.","Frequency doubling is a phase-sensitive process which usually requires phase matching to be efficient. Basically, this means that the second-harmonic field contributions generated at different locations in the nonlinear crystal coherently add up at the crystal's exit face. With proper phase matching and a pump beam with high intensity, high beam quality, and moderate optical bandwidth, achievable power conversion efficiencies may exceed 50%. On the other hand, the conversion efficiencies are typically extremely small when phase matching does not occur. In such cases, the energy transferred by the nonlinearity quickly oscillates back and forth between pump and second-harmonic wave, rather than consistently going in a certain direction.","The lack of phase matching is also the reason why second-harmonic generation is usually not accompanied by other processes such as sum-frequency generation of the pump and second-harmonic wave, or second-harmonic generation of the second-harmonic wave itself: phase matching for second-harmonic generation usually does not imply phase matching for the other mentioned processes.","The present invention addresses the \u201cgreen gap\u201d problem (lack of suitable lasers in the green area of the spectrum) by utilizing II-VI group semiconductor compounds. Examples of II-VI group compounds used in conjunction with semiconductors are disclosed in, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,884 ('884 patent) for \u201cSemiconductor Waveguide Structure of a II-VI Group Compound,\u201d by Hirata, et al., hereby incorporated by reference. The '884 patent discloses a semiconductor waveguide structure utilizing clad and waveguide layers, each formed of a II-VI group compound semiconductor made of a II group element (e.g., Zn, Cd, Mg, Hg, etc.) and a VI group element (e.g., O, S, Se, Te, etc.). In the '884 patent, by a hetero-epitaxy method, thin films of a clad layer, waveguide layers and another clad layer are formed on a ZnSe substrate. As an example, in the waveguide layer formed of ZnCdSSea beam of a wavelength of 530 nm is utilized. The waveguide structure in the '884 patent comprises layers formed by a compounds of the formula ZnCdSSe(where X and Y are each greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1), such as, for example, film layers of ZnCdSSeand ZnCdSSe.","A further example of the disclosure of a II-VI Group semiconductor compound being used in a semiconductor laser is U.S. Pat. No. 5,317,584 ('584 patent) to Mori, et al., hereby incorporated by reference. In the '584 patent, a sulfur\/selenium compound is utilized as a current blocking layer in a semiconductor laser, due to the II-IV group layer's high resistance. The II-VI group compound semiconductor layers, such as those disclosed in the '584 patent, may include, for example, ZnSe, ZnS, ZnSSe, ZnCdS, or CdSSe.","In an article entitled \u201cStanding Waves and Single-Mode Room-Temperature Laser Emission From Electron-Beam Pumped Cadmium Sulfide,\u201d by J. R. Packard, et al., IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-5, No. 1, pp. 44-7, there is disclosed electron beam pumping in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the waveguide of a Cadmium Sulfide Laser which reportedly resulted in single self-sustained axial mode of oscillation at roughly 520 nm, and radiation outputted in a direction parallel to the input. During the experimentation process, the maximum peak power was reported to be 14 watts.","The prior art also discloses \u201cMicrocavity Lasing of Optically Excited Cadmium Sulfide Thin Films at Room Temperature,\u201d in an article by D. M. Bagnall, et al., Optics Letters, Vol. 24, No. 18, Sep. 15, 1999. The Bagnall article reports that poor room-temperature luminescence is characteristic of CdS, and that \u201cgreen emission from CdS is difficult to achieve at room temperature,\u201d but \u201cthat excitonic emissions at cryogenic temperatures have been reported for CdS grown on CaF. . . .\u201d The Bagnall article appears to show that room-temperature green luminescence and lasing can be obtained by optically excited CdS thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. However in the Bagnall article, a CdSeSmicrochip laser system (where 0\u2266x\u22671) has not been fully optimized.","Systems and methods for emitting laser radiation are provided. An embodiment of a method for emitting laser radiation includes: emitting first laser radiation using a first laser, wherein said first laser is a laser diode; receiving the first laser radiation by a second laser comprising \u03a8SeS(e.g., cadmium selenium sulfide, cadmium selenium, or cadmium sulfide), wherein \u03a8 is a Group II element, such as Cadmium, and x is between 0 and 1, inclusively; and responsive to receiving the first laser radiation by the second laser, emitting second laser radiation by the second laser via the \u03a8SeS; wherein the second laser radiation has a wavelength between 487 nm and 690 nm; and wherein the wavelength of the second laser radiation is responsive to the value of x.","An embodiment of a system for emitting laser radiation includes: a first laser configured to emit first laser radiation, wherein said first laser is a laser diode; a second laser comprising CdSeS(cadmium selenium sulfide, cadmium selenium, or cadmium sulfide), wherein x is between 0 and 1, inclusively, the second laser being configured to receive the first laser radiation and to emit second laser radiation responsive to receiving the first laser radiation; wherein the second laser radiation has a wavelength between 487 nm and 690 nm; and wherein the wavelength of the second laser radiation is responsive to the value of x.","Systems and methods for emitting laser radiation are provided. In this regard, an embodiment of such a system provides continuous waves (CW) or pulsed laser radiation having a selectable wavelength between about 487 nm and 690 nm. This may be achieved by using a laser diode to pump a CdSeS(cadmium selenium sulfide, cadmium selenium, or cadmium sulfide) microchip laser that produces the desired wavelength, wherein x has a value between 0 and 1, inclusively. As a result, frequency doubling may be avoided so that power does not oscillate between competing longitudinal modes, thereby achieving a higher efficiency and more stable output.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["110","110","102","101","101","102","101","103","102","102","104","103","103","104","103"],"sub":["(1-x)","x "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["120","120","101","102","101","102","105","101","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1C"],"b":["130","130","101","102","101","102","105","106","106","130","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1D","b":["140","140","101","102","101","103","102","102","104","103","103","101","111","108","103","101","102","111","109","101","102","112","110","102"]},"The microchip laser  includes an emitter  and a substrate . The emitter  comprises CdSeS(with x having a value between 0 and 1, inclusively) whereas the substrate  may comprise Silicon Carbide (SiC) or sapphire (ALO3). The laser diode , the microchip laser , the photodiode , and the photodiode  are mounted on the heat sink  which helps to cool these components. The heat sink may be mounted on a Peltier cooler (not shown in ) to help regulate the temperature of the system. The detailed process by which the emitter  is fabricated is important. Previous attempts at fabricating CdSeShave relied upon thin-film growth via a crystal\u2212growth method such as MOCVD (Metal Oxide Chemical Vapor Deposition)<a well-known vapor growth method. Fabricating p-n junctions amenable to direct current injection in CdSeShas proven extremely difficult due to self-compensation of charge carriers (electrons or holes) of the doped materials and long-term instability of p-n junctions in CdSeS. This invention seeks to circumvent this difficulty by direct optical pumping which is largely insensitive to carrier compensation effects. Since there is no p-n junction, fabrication is greatly simplified, and this may be accomplished by a process such as, but no limited to, MOCVD, or any other chemical vapor deposition process. In the embodiment shown in, inter alia, , depending upon the output wavelength desired, a specific relative concentration of SeSis selected, as represented by x in . Once the composition has been chosen and the microchip laser  fabricated, the emission wavelength is fixed.","The radiation  from the microchip laser  may be monitored with the photodiode  to ensure stable power output. The radiation  and the radiation  emerge from the active region  as beams having elliptical cross-sections. These beams project elliptically shaped radiation spots onto the microchip laser  and the photodiode , respectively. These elliptically shaped radiation spots are a fundamental characteristic of laser radiation emitted from semiconductor devices. The laser diode  may be powered by a DC power supply (not shown) of approximately 5 volts via a p-side electrode  with the heat sink  acting as an n-side electrode. In a direct pumping configuration, the radiation  leaves the highly illuminated elliptical area  on the emitter .","In some embodiments, the radiation characteristic of the microchip laser  maybe similar to conventional laser diodes, since the microchip laser  may have approximately the same dimensions as the active region in most direct-current operated laser diodes.

The emitter  changes radiation wavelength in a linear manner from 490 nm to 690 nm as x varies from x=1 to x=0. The quantum efficiency, however, will be highest when the wavelength of the radiation  is closer to the wavelength of the radiation . The emitter  has a direct bandgap regardless of the alloy concentration chosen, thereby allowing highly efficient laser radiation. The use of so-called direct-bandgap materials is well known to those skilled in the field.","Due to the rapid extinction (absorption) of light (e.g., having a wavelength between about 375 nm and 450 nm) in the emitter , it may be very thin; its thickness D may be on the order of, for example, 2-5 \u03bcm. This is the effective depth that the emitter  can be optically pumped. The width D may be, for example, about 5-10 \u03bcm, enough to support a fundamental transverse mode (TEM) of the radiation . The length D may be, for example, between 30-50 \u03bcm or perhaps more depending on the gain length required to operate at a particular wavelength.","The emitter  may have a refractive index n=2.5, giving the emitter  air interface a reflectivity of only about 18%.
