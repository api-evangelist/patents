Currently, the largest computer network in existence is the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide interconnection of computer networks that communicate using a common protocol. Millions of computers, from low end personal computers to high-end super computers are coupled to the Internet.","The Internet grew out of work funded in the 1960s by the U.S. Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. For a long time, Internet was used by researchers in universities and national laboratories to share information. As the existence of the Internet became more widely known, many users outside of the academic\/research community (e.g., employees of large corporations) started to use Internet to carry electronic mail.","In 1989, a new type of information system known as the World-Wide-Web (\u201cthe Web\u201d) was introduced to the Internet. Early development of the Web took place at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory. The Web is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval system aimed to give wide access to a large universe of documents. At that time, the Web was known to and used by the academic\/research community only. There was no easily available tool which allows a technically untrained person to access the Web.","In 1993, researchers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released a Web browser called \u201cMosaic\u201d that implemented a graphical user interface (GUI). Mosaic's graphical user interface was simple to learn yet powerful. The Mosaic browser allows a user to retrieve documents from the World-Wide-Web using simple point-and-click commands. Because the user does not have to be technically trained and the browser is pleasant to use, it has the potential of opening up the Internet to the masses.","The architecture of the Web follows a conventional client-server model. The terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d are used to refer to a computer's general role as a requester of data (the client) or provider of data (the server). Under the Web environment, Web browsers reside in clients and Web documents reside in servers. Web clients and Web servers communicate using a protocol called \u201cHyperText Transfer Protocol\u201d (HTTP). A browser opens a connection to a server and initiates a request for a document. The server delivers the requested document, typically in the form of a text document coded in a standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format, and when the connection is closed in the above interaction, the server serves a passive role, i.e., it accepts commands from the client and cannot request the client to perform any action.","The communication model under the conventional Web environment provides a very limited level of interaction between clients and servers. In many systems, increasing the level of interaction between components in the systems often makes the systems more robust, but increasing the interaction increases the complexity of the interaction and typically slows the rate of the interaction. Thus, the conventional Web environment provides less complex, faster interactions because of the Web's level of interaction between clients and servers.","The present invention provides for the management of user information of both site server and regular web site users. A site server is provided with information stored thereon including preferences, roles, and details relating to users cataloged in a membership directory. A database separate from the site server and membership directory is also provided. The database has information stored thereon including preferences, roles, and details relating to the users. An identity of one of the users is authenticated. A single interface is displayed which provides the user access to both the site server and the database upon authentication of the identity of the user. The user is allowed to view and change the information that is stored on the site server and the database and that is associated with the user. The single interface is tailored based on the information associated with the user.","Additionally, the identity of the user may be authenticated by verifying a user name and a password, a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate, and\/or a log-in form. The preferences relating to the users may include a currency in which monetary values are displayed and a language in which text is displayed. Also, the roles relating to the users may include a customer, a manager, and an employee. Additionally, the details of the users may include a user name and a legal name.","The Resources eCommerce Technology Architecture (ReTA) is a solution that allows the use of packaged components to be integrated into a client based eCommerce solution. Before the present invention, the Resources architecture offerings provided services that supported the construction, execution and operation of very large custom built solutions. In the last few years, client needs have shifted towards requirements for solutions that continually integrate well with third party applications (i.e., data warehouse and portion of the present description management systems). Previous engagements have proven that it is difficult to integrate these applications into a new solution. As application vendors continue to produce new releases that incorporate technical advancements, it is even more difficult to ensure that these integrated applications continue to work with a given solution.","The ReTA approach to constructing, executing and operating a solution emphasizes the ability to change solution components with minimal impact on the solution as a whole. From this approach, ReTA views third party applications as another component in the overall solution. ReTA is component based, which means the engagement can choose to take only the pieces it needs to meet its specific business requirements. ReTA is especially suited to building small applications, implementing tools and packages, integrating applications and web enabling applications.","ReTA leverages the best capabilities from established market leaders such as Microsoft, SAP and Oracle. In addition, ReTA leverages some of the Resources prior efforts to integrate solutions. The present invention is an assembly of these best capabilities that helps to ensure a holistic delivered solution.","In short, the benefits ReTA provides to the Resources practice and clients are:\n\n","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, a system is provided for affording various features which support a resources eCommerce Technical Architecture. The present invention may be enabled using a hardware implementation such as that illustrated in . Further, various functional and user interface features of one embodiment of the present invention may be enabled using software programming, i.e. object oriented programming (OOP).","Hardware Overview","A representative hardware environment of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system.","Software Overview","Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for the principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each other's capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with them (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, the logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increase in the speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making all these things work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and a company. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:","Poor performance;","Restricted user interface capabilities;","Can only produce static Web pages;","Lack of interoperability with existing applications and data; and","Inability to scale.","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:","Improving performance on the client side;","Enabling the creation of dynamic, real-time Web applications; and","Providing the ability to create a wide variety of user interface components.","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, which are fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","Various aspects of ReTA will now be set forth under separate headings:","With reference to , a codes table framework  is provided for maintaining application consistency by referencing text phrases through a short codes framework. First, in operation , a table of codes each having a text phrase associated therewith is provided. Such table of codes is stored on a local storage medium. Next, in operation , the table of codes is accessed on the local storage medium. One of the text phrases is subsequently retrieved by selecting a corresponding one of the codes of the table, as indicated in operation . During operation, modification of the text phrases associated with each of the codes of the table is permitted. See operation .","The modification may be carried out during a business logic execution. Further, various services may be provided such as retrieving a single one of the text phrases, retrieving all of the text phrases in response to a single command, updating a single code and text phrase combination, updating all of the code and text phrase combinations, naming the table, adding a new code and text phrase combination, removing one of the code and text phrase combinations, and\/or adding another table.","Further, a name of the table may be stored upon retrieval of the text phrase. Further, a total number of code and text phrase combinations in the table may be determined and stored. In the case where a plurality of tables are provided, any number of the tables may be removed during operation. Additional information will be now be discussed relative to the various foregoing operations.","This portion of the present description details the ReTA Codes Table framework design from the perspective of the application developer. The purpose of a codes table is to maintain application consistency by referencing text phrases (to be displayed to the end user) through short codes. The code and text phrase (decode) are stored in a standard table format. The codes table component stores this table locally on the web server, thus reducing the overhead of accessing the database each time the application needs to translate a code.","Description","The role of this framework is to store frequently used code\/decode sets on the web server and provide services that enable the application developer to retrieve the decode(s) associated with code(s).

The role of this framework is to provide designs and templates that describe how to integrate an Internet application with a SAP server. Unlike the other ReTA frameworks, this does not provide any code components for connecting to SAP, but uses the SAP\/DCOM component connector created jointly by Microsoft and SAP.

It provides the development tools for connecting with SAP to standard SAP BAPI's (Business Application Programmer Interface) as well as custom developed or modified BAPI's. The DCOM component connector can connect to SAP on Windows NT or UNIX. The Application server needs to be R\/3 Version 2.1 or higher or R\/2 with 50D.","The ReTA SAP framework uses an adapter layer design that places a wrapper around the DCOM component connector. The adapter layer improves developer productivity by managing some of the lower level tasks, and improves the flexibility of the final solution.","The remainder of this portion of the present description describes the Execution and Development Architectures for the SAP framework.","SAP Framework Execution Architecture","The DCOM Component connector uses COM proxy components that map to SAP Business Objects. There is one proxy component for each SAP business object. The SAP business objects can contain both the standard BAPI's (Business Application Programmer Interface) as well as custom developed or modified BAPI's. The SAP\/DCOM component generation wizard connects to SAP, examines the SAP business object, and generates a proxy component with the same interface. The SAP\/DCOM connector component can connect to SAP on Windows NT or UNIX.  shows the execution architecture for components that make up the SAP Framework Execution Architecture .","Referring again to , the different layers in the SAP framework architecture are shown. The SAP\/DCOM connector generated components  provide the actual connection to SAP . These components are generated from the SAP Business Application Programmer Interface (BAPI) ,. The BAPI's are either the standard SAP BAPI's, custom created BAPI's or Remote Function Calls.","The ReTA framework uses an Adapter layer to provide a thin wrapper on the SAP\/DCOM connector components. The adapter layer provides the following benefits:\n\n","The SAP\/DCOM connector generated components use ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) recordsets to pass data to SAP. The adapter layer components map from these recordsets to the Business Objects or Business Data format used by the application.","If a given method returns business data from SAP then this is in the form of an ADO recordset. If a method updates information in SAP then one must pass in an ADO recordset with all the data. To initialize this ADO recordset one calls a separate standard interface method of the proxy component. SAP returns business errors by returning a separate ADO recordset that references an error table.","The ReTA framework's adapter layer maps the ADO recordsets that the DCOM connector uses to the business objects or data objects used by the application. The adapter layer also maps the error table recordset returned by SAP to the error handling mechanism used by the application.","SAP Framework Development Architecture","SAP\/DCOM Component Connector Generation","The SAP\/DCOM connector portion of the present description gives a detailed description of how to generate a COM proxy component for a given SAP BAPI. The steps for creating a proxy component are:\n\n","The DCOM Component connector may then generate C++ and IDL files, compile these files to create the proxy component and install this component in MTS.","SAP Adapter Component Design","This portion of the description describes the responsibility of the SAP adapter components and gives a template for a component.","The SAP Adapter components are responsible for:\n\n","There is a one to one mapping between the SAP Adapter components and the generated SAP\/DCOM connector components.","SAP Adapter Component Template","This template gives an example of an SAP connector component with one method to receive business data and one method to send business data.

As an option, a plurality of activity components may be provided. As another option, a call made by the activity component may also be identified to execute a second business component with the context object of the activity component utilized for controlling the scope of the execution of the second business component. As a further option, a call made by the activity component may be identified to execute an error logging component with an additional context object separate from the context object of the activity component being utilized for controlling the scope of the execution of the error logging component. The following material provides a more detailed description of the above-described method.","This portion of the present description details the ReTA approach to performing \u201clogical unit of work\u201d database operations in the context of transactions. Applications developed with ReTA implement transactions through Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). Within the MTS transaction context, ReTA applications group business components into transactions. The application developer designs each business component to define whether its actions should be performed within a transaction.","In addition, this portion of the present description details the MTS framework features and their implications on ReTA application design.","MTS Transactions: Application Design Implementation","Description","There are two main tasks the developer performs to design applications that use MTS to support transactions:","Code the application component to be MTS aware.","Use MTS services to group database operations into transactions.","Design MTS Aware Components",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0277","num":"0319"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","202"]},"Group Database Operations into MTS Transactions","The following portions of the present description include three database operations grouping scenarios that a ReTA application developer can implement through MTS.","Compose Work from Multiple Components in the Same Transaction","As illustrated in , in this scenario, the developer composes the work of a business activity  into a single transaction. Activity  uses business objects in components  and  to compete its work. Any database operations generated by either of these business components are completed in the context of a single transaction. To achieve this functionality, the developer uses the default transaction context scope that MTS provides. The developer sets the transaction attribute of the Activity component to Requires a transaction and the attribute of the business components to either Requires a transaction or Supports transactions. When the activity component initializes, MTS creates a corresponding context object . Subsequently, when the activity component initializes the business components, these business components share the same context object and are therefore committed in the same transaction.","When the Activity completes and the reference to the activity component is removed, the transaction is committed. If any of the database calls, fails or any of the components decides to abort the transaction, the transaction is aborted and all the database actions performed are rolled back.","Force a Component's Database Operations to Use a Separate Transaction.","In this scenario, as illustrated in , the developer creates a component whose database operations are always carried out in a separate transaction. For example, an error logging component  should not use the transaction context of the component generating the error. This could cause the error logged to the database to be rolled back if an error occurs in a separate database operation. This scenario has an activity component , two business components , and an error logging component . If an error occurs in the activity, then an error message is sent to the error logging component (which logs the error in a database). The transaction of the activity is rolled back, however, the transaction of the error logging component is committed to the database.","In this scenario, the developer uses the default behavior of MTS. The error logging component is registered as Requires a new transaction. When the activity component initializes the error logging component, MTS creates a new transaction context for the component. If an error occurs in the activity, the database operations for the activity is rolled back, but any database operations that the error component generates is committed.","Compose Work from Multiple Activities in the Same Transaction.","With reference to  (which illustrates the compose work form multiple activities in the same transaction), in this scenario, the developer creates two separate activities , whose work sometimes need to be composed into a single transaction. To achieve this functionality using MTS, the developer creates a third activity component  that calls the other two activities. The third activity component is registered as Requires a transaction. When this component initializes, MTS creates a new transaction context. When the activity  initializes the other two activities ,, they share the same transaction context  (and any objects they create also have the ability to share the transaction context).","MTS Features: Application Design Implications","Description","Note: A FinancialWorks Knowledge Exchange (kX) posting (Optimizing Performance) provided most of the content for this portion of the description.","This portion of the description provides insight on the following MTS features:","Connection Pooling","Stateless\/Stateful objects","Package threading","Transactions","Just in Time activation","Object creation","Parameter Passing.","Connection Pooling","MTS and ODBC provide connection pooling. MTS\/ODBC associates a connection pool with a specific user account. Therefore, it is important that all data access components have a pre-defined account to use when requesting database connections. In addition, connections are pooled only within the same process. This implies that every MTS package may have a pool of connections, as each MTS package runs in its own process.","Note that the ODBC connections are pooled, not the ADO connections. When the application code closes the ADO connection, the corresponding ODBC connection stays in the pool until a configurable timeout expires (cptimeout). The configurable timeout key is in the registry under \u201cHkey_Local_Machine\\Software\\ODBC\\ODBCINST.INI\\<driver name>\\cptimeout\u201d (with a default value of 60 seconds). Connection pooling can be turned off by setting this value to 0. In effect, connection pooling keeps more connections open with the database but saves the (expensive) overhead of re-creating the connection every time.","Note: Connection pooling is a feature of the ODBC resource manager. MTS automates the configuration of the ODBC resource to enable connection pooling.","Implications on Application Design:","Create accounts for account packages. Group components under the appropriate credentials and packages. The Database server is a resource bottleneck. To improve performance, ensure high bandwidth connections exist between application and database servers.","Connection pooling provides performance improvement especially in the case where connections are used and released frequently such as Internet application.","Stateful and Stateless Objects","MTS supports the concept of a stateful object. However, the object must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n","In general, be deliberate with MTS and state. When working with MTS components, it is recommended to keep the context(state) on the client and have the server components be service driven. These components are instantiated to provide a service and then are freed.","Package Threading","Every time a package receives a method call, MTS creates a new thread to service the request. At the time of writing this portion of the present description, MTS packages have a maximum limit of 100 threads per package. If the number of the incoming concurrent calls exceeds 100, MTS serializes all excess calls. Project testing (a FinacialWorks project) proved that performance degraded significantly after reaching the 100 concurrent threads mark.","Implication on Application Design:","Due to this limitation, package the application DLLs in a way to minimize thread contention. For future releases of MTS, Microsoft claims the limit for concurrent calls may increase to 1000.","Activities","MTS defines an activity as set of objects acting on behalf of a client's request. Every MTS object belongs to one activity. The activity ID is recorded in the context of the object. The objects in an activity consist of the object created by a base client and any subsequent object created by it and all of its descendants. Objects in an activity can be distributed across several processes (and machines).","Whenever a base client creates an MTS object, a new activity is created. When a MTS object is created from an existing context, the new object becomes part of the same activity. The object's context inherits the activity identifier of the creating context.","Implication on Application Design:","Activities define a single logical thread of execution. When a base client calls into an activity, all subsequent requests from other clients are blocked until control is returned to the original caller.","Automatic Transaction Control","MTS initiates a transaction when a method on a transactional component is called. MTS records the transaction ID in the component's object context. This transaction ID is passed to other MTS components' context objects requiring participation in the same transaction.","MTS operates with an optimistic assumption that the transaction is going to succeed. If the component never calls SetAbort, SetComplete, DisableCommit, or EnableCommit, the transaction commits when the client releases its last reference to the MTS component.","If the component calls SetComplete, the transaction commits as soon as the method call returns to the client. When the component calls SetAbort the transaction aborts as soon as the method call returns to the client.","If the component calls DisableCommit, the transaction aborts when the client releases its last reference to the component. If the component calls EnableCommit, the transaction commits when the client releases its last reference to the component.","Implications on Application Design:","When designing the transaction timeout, consider the potential for slow system and network response times. The application design should avoid long running transactions and attempt to break them into smaller ones.","Note:","There is no explicit Commit method. If no objects have aborted the transaction by calling SetAbort or disabled commitment by calling DisableCommit, MTS may automatically commit the transaction when the client releases its object references.","Manual Transaction Control","Transactions can also be manually controlled from a base client by using the transaction context to start and commit\/abort a transaction. This is particularly useful in the case where a stateful base client activates an MTS-managed transactional object to carry out a distributed transaction. In order to achieve that, MTS uses the Transaction Context created by the base client.","Just-In-Time Activation","For every business object created, MTS intercepts the call and creates a sibling object called the Object Context. It is the object context that may manage the transaction and the business object activation\/deactivation.","One of the interface methods on the context object is SetComplete. When SetComplete is called, the transaction (if any) is signaled as ready to be committed and the instance of the business object is destroyed releasing all resources used by it.","The next time the client issues a method call, MTS creates a new instance of the business object and delegates the call to it (this is assuming that the client did not release its original reference to the MTS-supplied context wrapper). In the MTS world, this is known as JIT activation.","The following method call trace illustrates JIT activation:\n\n","To take advantage of JIT activation, the clients do not release the reference to the MTS-supplied context wrapper (the client code does not set objICustomer=null). When the client requests a new operation, the Context wrapper creates a new instance of the Customer component and delegates the incoming call to it. By keeping the reference to the context wrapper, MTS does not need to recreate the object.","Implications on Application Design:","To take advantage of JIT activation, client applications acquire references to the server components as early as possible and uses them as needed. It would be ideal to obtain references at application startup, but this has the drawback of not being reliable. If for some reason the references were lost, this may result in run time errors.","Object Creation: New vs. CreateObject vs. CreateInstance","This portion of the description describes the appropriate usage of the different types of object creation methods.","New:","The keyword \u201cNew\u201d creates an object with private instantiation property. It is used with early binding.","CreateObject:","Normally used with late binding and used to create objects with public instantiation property. If other MTS object are instantiated using CreateObject (on the server), they run the risk of running in the wrong context. CreateObject can be used from the client to instantiate any MTS object.","CreateInstance:","It is the interface method of the context object used to instantiate other MTS objects. This is the only way to guarantee the newly created object participates in the same current transaction. When MTS instantiates a transaction, it records the transaction ID in the component's object context. This transaction ID is passed to other MTS components only when CreateInstance is used to create these objects.","Implication on Application Design:","When CreateObject is used, Java\/VB uses COM to create an instance of the object. If the Object is registered in MTS, MTS loads the DLL and creates a new instance passing back a MTS-managed handle to the object. The object gets a new MTS context.","When New is used in Java\/VB, the action depends on where the object being created lives. If it is in a different DLL, COM is used and the mechanism is the same as CreateObject. If it is in the same DLL Java\/VB creates the instance internally and may not create a new MTS-managed object, whereas CreateObject may. Private classes can only be created using New since they are not exposed to COM.","When one MTS object creates another MTS object, the new object gets a new context. If CreateObject (or New for an object in a different DLL) is used, the contexts are independent of each other. If a transaction is involved, the new context manages a completely different transaction from the original. If CreateInstance is used, the new object's context shares the same transaction as the invoking one.","Using New is only a problem in the following scenario. The application contains one DLL that contains more than one MTS-managed class. The application wants an instance of one of these classes to create an instance of the other (in separate contexts). New may not do this, whereas CreateObject and CreateInstance may. However, CreateInstance is required if they are to run under the same transaction.","Parameter Passing","If Visual Basic is the language of choice, make sure to pass parameters by value (as the default in VB is by reference). This may help reduce network trips and hence improves performance.","If one is passing the collection object in MTS, make sure to use the Microsoft provided wrapper collection object. The standard VB collection object is known to cause errors when running under MTS. It is better to use a variant array instead of collection to pass information around. It is more robust and performs better.","As parameters, MTS registered business objects are passed by reference as they use standard marshalling","When working with MTS objects, ensure that object references are exchanged through the return from an object creation interface such ITransactionContext.CreateInstance or IObjectContext.CreateInstance. This allows MTS to manage context switches and Object lifetime.","Data Access and Locking Policy","Database Locking should be in place to ensure the integrity of the database in a multi-user environment. Locking prevents the common problem of lost updates from multiple users updating the same record. The optimistic approach of record locking is based on the assumption that it is rarely the case for multiple users to read and update the same records concurrently. Such a situation is treated as exceptional processing rather than normal. Optimistic locking does not place any locks at read time; locks are actually placed at update time. A time stamp mechanism should be provided to ensure that at update or delete times the record has not changed since the last time it is read. It is recommended to use optimistic locking with ADO and MTS to improve performance. If the data access mechanism uses ADO disconnected RecordSets, then the only possible locking policy is optimistic.","Implication on Application Design:","If one is using optimistic locking and ADO, it is recommended that one uses disconnected recordsets to marshal data. Project experience (FinancialWorks project) shows that the application should avoid using the ADO RecordSet.GetRows method, as it significantly slows performance.","Data Marshaling","Use disconnected Recordsets. This may ensure high performance result when marshaling data across a network. Client applications have to reference an ADOR.Recrodset, which is a lighter version of the ADODB.Recordset designed specifically for client's use. With disconnected Recordsets only optimistic locking can be employed.","If the marshalling of data from client to server is done by collection, beware to use the wrapper collection provided on the MTS site. MTS may not work correctly when passing the VB standard collection object. It is known to cause runtime errors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0334","num":"0387"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806"]},"The sub-activity logic may be adapted for verifying that all required input has been received prior to generating the output. Access to the input received from the user by each of the sub-activities of the activities may also be allowed.","Optionally, the activity may include creating a service order. Further, the sub-activities each may additionally include at least one business component.","The interface may include a plurality of displays that are each displayed during the execution of a corresponding one of the sub-activities. The following material provides a more detailed description of the above-described method.","This portion of the present description details the ReTA Activity framework design from the perspective of the application developer. The primary role of this framework is to provide services that support the \u201cmodel view controller\u201d (MVC) design pattern. In this pattern, the application implements a \u201cseparation of concern\u201d among the user interface (view), logical unit of work (controller) and business components (model). Separating the user interface from the business logic increases reuse of the interface and the business component. In this design pattern, different types of interfaces can reuse the same model and the same interface can view different models. Another goal of separating presentation and storage responsibilities is to reduce the impact of change. For example, changing the user interface design should only impact the user interface components and not the business logic. Through modeling the \u201cseparation of concern\u201d pattern, the ReTA Activity framework increases application maintainability and flexibility. It also encourages \u201cbest practice\u201d coding standards.","Activity Framework","Description","See , which illustrates the MTS runtime environment .

For example, session level state is necessary to implement eCommerce functionality where a customer can select products on multiple product description pages and then submit a complete product order request from a confirm order page.

In this phase, the developer tests the change to ensure that the system's functionality works as designed. Furthermore, this test also ensures that the code change did not adversely affect other areas of the current system. This may entail running some pre-defined System Test scripts. For certain change requests, it is important to test the code change against a large volume of data. This may check if the change may handle all the data in the production environment. For any change requests which may impact interfaces both in and out of the target application, it is necessary to test that all the interfaces still work correctly. This may prevent a change request from adversely impacting other systems.","The developer should set the status of the change request in the Change Tracking tool to \u201cTesting\u201d.","User Acceptance Test","In this phase , the most appropriate person, whether it is the requester or a user who may be directly affected by the change, may assume the role of the test administrator. The administrator tests the change request to ensure that it meets the original business need. In some cases, the developer may actually run the test plans that the test administrator creates, and the test administrator may validate the test results. Once the test administrator agrees that the change satisfies all the test criteria, the developer needs to check the user acceptance test sign-off box in the Change Tracking Tool.","The sign-off is needed to migrate the change to production. This sign-off serves as a final quality checkpoint that the work on the change request meets the business needs of the change requester.","Fill Out Migration Form","In this phase, the developer goes through a final process before submitting the change request to be moved to production.

These issues relate to the fact that the application is based on the use of Active Server Pages, Microsoft Transaction Server components and Java Classes.","Sequence of Events","To perform the code migration, certain steps should be followed to ensure that users that are currently in the application are not adversely affected. This can be accomplished by performing the migration in the following order:","Using the Internet Information Server administration utility, monitor the site's number of active users. A count of zero indicates that no clients are currently hitting the site. Shut down the web listener to prevent additional users from connecting to the site.","Within the MTS Administration tool, shut down all server processes. This cleans up an components that may still be awaiting garbage collection from the Java Virtual Machine.","If the component interfaces have not been modified, it is possible to copy the new version of the Java Classes directly to the new environment. If the interfaces have been changed, the MTS administrator may need to delete and recreate the individual components within MTS.","Copy any new web server files (ASP, HTML, graphics, etc.) to the target directories on the web server.","Restart the web listener to allow users access to the application.","Module Location","There are basically three types of modules that get migrated during a ReTA engagement. Web Server files, Application files and database objects.","Web Server modules include Active Server Pages (ASP), static HTML portion of the present descriptions, graphics or images and JavaScript files. The ASP and HTML portion of the present descriptions may have security restrictions placed on them from within Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and from the Windows NT Server. Security can be set to include individual user accounts, groups\/roles, or no security.","Application Server\u2014Two file types are migrated within application servers, COM Dynamic Link Library's and Java Classes. Both files are created during the application and architecture build processes. The COM DLL's require registration within MTS by inserting them into a MTS Package. In the event that the Web and Application servers are two physically different machines, an export process is required between them to instruct the Web server where the business components physically reside. For more information on the registration and exporting processes refer to the MTS online help.","In the case of the Java Classes, they need to reside in a directory that is defined within the server's \u2018CLASSPATH\u2019 environment variable. For ReTA Phase 1 & 2 development and testing all runtime files were located with C:\\ReTA. Therefore the following classpath environment variable was defined on each developer's workstation:","CLASSPATH=C:\\WinNT\\Java\\Classes;C:\\WinNT\\Java\\TrustLib;C:\\ReTA\\Architec ture;C:\\ReTA\\Application","Database Server\u2014These items include tables, views, sequences, triggers, stored procedures and functions, and user\/schema information. These items are not necessarily particular to multi-tiered development. However, care should be taken to ensure that architecture tables and other objects are located separately from the application objects.","Security","Within the ReTA application model, security is enforced at the Web and Application Servers. In the case of Web server security, access to ASP and HTML files can be restricted using the Access Control List security provided by Windows NT. Security on these objects can be set at the group (role) or individual user levels.","A component within MTS utilizes role-based security to determine who may or may not have access to a specific COM component. A role is a symbolic name that defines a group of users for a package of components. Roles extend Windows NT security to allow a developer to build secured components in a distributed application.","For example,  depicts the application of Roles  within the Microsoft Transaction Server Management console . The package labeled \u2018ReTA Applications\u2019  has a single role defined as being able to access it, \u2018ReTA User\u2019 . Users that are members of the local \u2018ReTA Administrators\u2019 and \u2018ReTA User\u2019 Windows NT groups , are allowed to function in the ReTA User capacity defined for this package.","Due to the security options available at both the Web and Application server levels, care should be taken during code migration to ensure that security settings are consistent and applied correctly to ensure accurate execution.","MTS Transactions","Within MTS, every component has a transaction attribute that can be set by the MTS administrator to indicate what level of participation a component has within a transaction. Care must be taken during MTS component migrations to ensure that the correct transactional attributes are set within MTS. The transaction attribute can have one of the following values:\n\n","Many configuration management tools are available on the market today, some of which provide many features useful for code promotion and management.","During the ReTA Phase 1 engagement, Microsoft Visual SourceSafe was utilized for it's labeling and source code management capabilities. Additionally, the ReTA Change Tracker database could be utilized for source code migrations that required change management knowledge and approval. In the event that client requires the use of paper or email based migration control, the ReTA Migration Request template can be used.","Procedures\/Standards","Processes","The processes that guide development within ReTA engagement environments are represented in , which illustrates an environment migration process . These processes include creating a new application , modifying an existing application, and applying emergency bug fixes . The solid lines represent stages required for new\/modified application process. Dashed lines show the path for emergency bug fixes. Note: The term application used here is broadly applied to any managed module or component.","Processes are defined by stages shown as individual boxes. Through these stages, applications are eventually (or quickly in the case of emergency bug fixes) promoted to production. Stages provide for initiating, managing, securing and coordinating changes to applications.","The stages for the projects were developed in conjunction with representatives from each development team. It is important to note that the development stages represent the lifecycle of an application, not data. Within each development stage, there can be multiple data sets. For example, within the system test stage, an application team might wish to run several test cycles in parallel. In order to do that and keep the data consistent, a database for each cycle is required.","The CM process may ensure application modules are promoted through the development stages in a consistent manner. It is up to each application team to decide how to use each stage. For example, the application testing team may want four databases within the system test stage for different types of tests, whereas the assembly testing team may only want two.","Stage is used to consolidate and verify vendor changes. Depending on the change, it may be migrated to Development or System Test , directly. The order may be dictated by project requirements.","A very important tenet of the CM process is that an application modification can only be in one stage at any point in time. Consider the example of module1. Module1 starts out in development. When the development team indicates, the Source Code Librarian moves module1 into system test. As soon as that happens, no changes can be made to module1. Only after module1 is promoted to production  can modifications be made to the module (further enhancements, bug fixes, etc.). The purpose for this rule is to prevent the situation where one developer is modifying a module when that module needs to have a bug fix to continue testing. There is one exception to this rule, emergency fixes.","When the situation dictates an emergency fix, the module affected needs to be modified immediately. When this happens, the module in question should be fixed within the development stage. When the fix is made, the module may immediately be put back into production. However, the same change also needs to be applied\/promoted to the module in system test stage. This may allow modules in system test to always be current with what is in production.","The CM process depends on change control records (CCR) for tracking changes to the system. A change control record is created for every new module or modification. The CCR is used to coordinate migrations and communicate status for each module in the system. One may see the use of the CCR throughout every process description. The CCR processing system may be automated through Notes.","Major tasks and responsibilities define each stage of a process and are covered in the pages that follow. These tasks and responsibilities are not intended to be a development methodology. Any references to deliverables and\/or portion of the present descriptions is informational only and provided to help anchor an already existing development methodology. However, specific deliverables and portion of the present descriptions required for the change management process are required and may be highlighted.","Development\/Unit Test","Development team checks required application source code out of source code control. See , which illustrates a Development\/Unit test  for existing applications. Note: In the event that this is a new application, the developer may use the appropriate template from source code control.","As needed, DBA  checks required database source code out of source code control. Also as needed, DBA works with development team to approve and prepare modifications to development database. All work occurs on developer's workstation using local web and application server processes. Note: A shared web\/application may be used for vendor staging.","Unit testing is ongoing during development. The development team checks modified application source code into source code control. The development team also fills in a change control record indicating which modules have changed. As needed, the DBA checks modified database source code into source code control. A source Code Librarian  verifies\/prepares necessary objects for building new applications. Unit test and development is completed. In some cases, a string test may be required. The system test team is notified, such as by e-mail.","Deliverables from this stage might include:","Modified or new application","Modified or new database objects","Unit test data and output","CM Deliverables from this stage include:","A change control record with developer information filled in.","Assembly Test","With reference to , an assembly test team  reviews user requirements and prepares validation or test plan.

At a later point, it is possible to display the different labels and retrieve the desired version.","Environment Management","This portion of the description identifies the miscellaneous application and system-level services that do not deal with the human-computer interface, communication with other programs, or access to information. Environment Management Services identify each component used to perform the operating system services, system level services, application services, and run-time services.","Systems Management","In order to maintain an effective and secure infrastructure, System Management procedures are essential in the success of obtaining a stable environment. These systems require tools, utilities and processes that allow administrators to monitor running components and change their configuration. Systems Management involves all functions required for the day to day operation of the ReTA environment (e.g. event monitoring, failure control, monitoring, tape loading, etc.). Regardless of the changes taking place within the Net-Centric environment, Systems Management activities must take place in an on-going manner.","System Startup & Shutdown","A comprehensive development environment rapidly becomes sufficiently complex that the startup and shutdown of the environment must be managed carefully, and preferably automated. This is key to ensuring the integrity of the environment. Startup may involve the carefully sequenced initialization of networking software, databases, web servers and more. Similarly, shutdown involves saving configuration changes as needed and gracefully taking down running software in the correct sequence.","An Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) provides a server with power when the AC power fails or is marginal. The UPS may also shut the server down, in an orderly fashion, in the event of a power failure. The UPS may not shut down the server if the power failure is brief.","The Smart UPS 1400 should be configured with an interface to the server. The recommended interface is the serial port B (COM2) on most servers. PowerChute Plus 5.0 software from American Power Conversion is the recommended choice.","The basic purpose of PowerChute Plus is to safely shut down an operating system and server in the event of a power failure. To do this properly, PowerChute Plus needs the UPS to provide battery power to the system while PowerChute shuts down the system. This is where the correct sequencing of Events becomes important.","Clear and accessible portion of the present description of startup\/shutdown procedures","Automated startup\/shutdown process that rarely requires manual intervention","A product that has remote power on reset capabilities","Backup and Restore","The incremental value of the daily work performed on the development project is high. This investment must be protected from problems arising from hardware and software failure, and from erroneous user actions and catastrophes such as fires or floods. The repositories and other development information must therefore be backed up regularly. Backup and restore procedures and tools must be tested to ensure that system components can be recovered as anticipated. The large volumes of complex data generally require automation of backups and restores.","The advent of Netcentric technologies has introduced an increase in media content that requires storage. The environment may support a high volume of media files, which must be considered in the backup\/restore plans. Storage capacity planning should allow for the typically increased size of these file types.","As the amount of storage may grow significantly over time on a large project, the hardware requirements may increase. Sufficient room for growth should be planned when selecting the tools and hardware. Switching tools and hardware can be problematic due to lack of upward compatibility (DDS-DLT, various tools etc.).","The time required for backups must also be considered. Usually the number of hours without development per day decreases over time and if backups can only be performed when no user is logged in, this might become a problem. It is generally the case that the project may benefit from buying the fastest and largest backup hardware\/software it can afford.","Storage Management","ReTA may implement an automated tape management system that provides location\/retention special handling, file integrity and data protection.","Archiving","Archiving can be particularly useful to safeguard information from previous versions or releases. More generally, it is used to create a copy of information that is less time-critical than the current environment at a given time. Archiving may be performed to a medium, which is different from the backup medium, and may involve other tools, which, for example, provide a higher compression ratio.","Performance Monitoring","Performance Management ensures that the required resources are available at all times throughout the distributed system to meet the agreed upon SLAs. This includes monitoring and management of end-to-end performance based on utilization, capacity, and overall performance statistics. If necessary, Performance Management can adjust the production environment to either enhance performance or rectify degraded performance.","Operating System","Windows NT may function as the ReTA Phase 1 Development Environment operating system, handling Environment System Services such as multi-tasking, paging, memory allocation, etc.","System Level Services","The Windows NT Domain Controller allows users and applications to perform system-level environment services such as a login\/logoff process for authentication to the operating system; enforced access control to system resources and executables; and access to the local or remote system's user or application profiles.","Application Services","The ReTA Phase 1 Frameworks may perform application Security Services, Error Handling\/Logging Services, State Management Services and Help Services within the application.","State Management","State Management Services enable information to be passed or shared among windows and\/or Web pages and\/or across programs. In Netcentric environments, the HTTP protocol creates a potential need for implementing some form of Context Management Services (storing state information on the server). The HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. Every connection is negotiated from scratch, not just at the page level but for every element on the page. The server does not maintain a session connection with the client nor save any information between client exchanges (i.e., web page submits or requests). Each HTTP exchange is a completely independent event. Therefore, information entered into one HTML form must be saved by the associated server application somewhere where it can be accessed by subsequent programs in a conversation","Security Services","ReTA implements Application Security through the ReTA Session and Activity frameworks. The Session framework provides \u201cSession level Page access authorization\u201d, \u201cUser identification\u201d and \u201csession timeout\u201d services. The Activity framework provides \u201cActivity level Page access authorization\u201d.","Error Handling\/Logging Services","Error Handling Services support the handling of fatal and non-fatal hardware and software errors for an application. An error handling architecture takes care of presenting the user with an understandable explanation of what has happened and coordinating with other services to ensure that transactions and data are restored to a consistent state.","Logging Services support the logging of informational, error, and warning messages. Logging Services record application and user activities in enough detail to satisfy any audit trail requirements or to assist the systems support team in recreating the sequence of events that led to an error.","Runtime Services","The ReTA Phase 1 Development Environment may use the Microsoft Transaction Server and the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine as a Run-Time Environment System Service. This affords a layer of abstraction between the applications and the underlying operating system.","Problem Management","Problem Management tools help track each system investigation request\u2014from detection and portion of the present description to resolution (for example, Problem Tracking, Impact Analysis, Statistical Analysis). Several problem management software packages are available from a variety of vendors.","Tool Recommendation","SIR Workbench","The SIR Workbench is another Microsoft Access tool that was developed for small to medium sized projects. It provides basic functionality of entering, modifying and reporting of architecture and application problems encountered during the testing and release phases of the project life cycle.","Visual SourceSafe","Visual SourceSafe (VSS) from Microsoft ships with the Visual Studio suite and as such is tightly integrated with the Visual Integrated Development Environments.","One of the features provided by VSS is the ability to search through the source code for given text strings. This is useful for performing impact analysis.","Security Management","Security Management tools provide the components that make up the security layer of the final system, and may provide required security controls to the development environment. While some of these tools may be considered as nothing more than security-specific Packaged Components, many are an integral part of the development environment toolset.","Database","Development Database security may be minimal. Database User IDs may be setup to grant user-level security. The engagement Database Administrator (DBA) may have a logon to allow for full permissions. Otherwise, a Developer ID may allow read\/write access and a Core User ID may allow for read access only.","Network","A Windows NT Group created specifically for the engagement may protect the Development shared file folder and subsequent sub-folders (ex \u2018ReTAArch\u2019). Project members individual network accounts may be added to the Domain Group ensuring access. Local network administrators may be responsible for the creation and maintenance of individual and group account information.","Application Server","The application server has two forms of security: Static security and dynamic (context dependent) security.","A Windows NT group may be created for each Role in the completed application (e.g. Customer, Manager). Microsoft Transaction Server's integrated Windows NT security allows the developer to determine the security rights for each component. The dynamic, context dependent security is implemented by the developer using the Event Handler framework for the logging and display of errors to the user.","Web Server","The web server has static security for each page and security to maintain control of the flow between pages. The static security uses the Windows NT group for each user role to restrict access to each page. For the flow control, the developer uses the Session framework to restrict the ordering of page requests. The allowed ordering of pages are entered into the Session database tables.","Systems Building","System Building tools comprise the core of the development architecture and are used to design, build, and test the system.","Analysis & Design","The BI Methodology has several application development routes that apply to different development scenarios. Routes currently exist in the methodology for custom and packaged application development. Component development is among several routes to be developed. Until the component development route is completed, component-based projects should be planned using a combination of BI Methodology and ODM task packages.","In general, BI Methodology should be used for all tasks that are independent of a specific technology. For example, tasks related to business modeling, user interface design, training development, package selection, and product testing should all be taken from BI Methodology rather than ODM. These technology-independent tasks typically occur early (business modeling, solution strategy, and requirements gathering) and late (product testing through deployment) in the project.","ODM content should be used for all tasks that are related to component and object development. In addition, ODM is the primary source for those tasks related to obtaining characteristics associated with component- and object-based development (such as flexibility and reuse). When using ODM task packages, take care to ensure that one consider how they link with the other elements of business integration (such as human performance).","Data Modeling","Description","Data Modeling tools provide a graphical depiction of the logical data requirements for the system. These tools usually support diagramming entities, relationships, and attributes of the business being modeled on an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). Several techniques have evolved to support different methodologies (e.g., Chen, Gane & Sarson, and IDEF).","As systems are often built on top of legacy databases, some data modeling tools allow generation of an object model from the legacy database data model (DDL). By understanding the E-R diagram represented by the database, it is easier to create an efficient persistence framework, which isolates business components from a direct access to relational databases. Caution is required, however, as the resulting model is at best only partial, as an object model has dynamic aspects to it as well as static relationships, and may not correctly reflect the analysis performed in the problem domain.","When a component or object-based approach is used, data modeling is not performed. Rather, the object model represents both the data and the behavior associated with an object. In most systems, relational databases are used and the object model must be mapped to the data model. Standard mechanisms for mapping objects exist.","Tool Recommendation","Visual Studio","Microsoft's Visual Studio 6.0 includes a database diagram tool that helps developers visualize structures of tables and relationships within a relational database. See , which illustrates a Database Diagram  within Visual Studio . Using this project within Visual Studio it is possible to, for example:\n\n","Additionally, Rational Software's Rational Rose 98 provides Oracle8 data modeling functionality including schema analysis, SQL\/DDL generation, reporting and editing. For a complete description of the product and its features visit the Rational Rose Website at www.rational.com.","Performance Modeling\/Management","Description","The performance of a system must be analyzed as early as possible in the development process. Performance modeling tools support the analysis of performance over the network. A simple spreadsheet may be suitable in some well-known and understood environments, but dedicated performance modeling tools should be considered on any project with high transaction volumes or complex distributed architectures involving several platforms.","In the case of Internet-based applications, as the Internet is not a controlled environment, performance modeling is limited to those components within the domain of the controlled environment (i.e. up to the Internet Service Provider). However, in the case of intranet-based systems, where the environment is controlled from end-to-end, performance modeling may be performed across the entire system.","Performance modeling for components involves the analysis of the projected level of interaction between components and the level of network traffic generated by this interaction. It is important for performance reasons that communication between components is minimized, especially if these components are distributed.","Tool recommendation","Visual Quantify","Tivoli","Sniffer Basic","Application Expert","Object Modeling","Description","An object model usually contains the following deliverables:","Class Diagram (1 per functional area or 1 per component)","Class Definition (1 per class)","Class Interaction or Sequence Diagram (1 or more per scenario\/workflow)","Class State Transition Diagram (1 per Class with complex state)","Tools such as MS Word, MS PowerPoint, ABC Flowchart (MicroGrafix), may be used to produce these deliverables. See  illustrating Object Modeling  within Rational Rose . Specific modeling tools do exist, however, and provide advantages such as cross referencing (for example, are all the methods used in the Interaction diagrams described in the class definitions?), automatic propagation of changes to other diagrams, generation of reports, and generation of skeleton code. However, some tools have problems with:","Usability and stability","Single users or small numbers of concurrent users","Proprietary repositories (usually file-based, rather than DB-based)","Support of extensions\/customizations","As well as providing the usual editing and graphical functionality, a good modeling tool should:","Interface with a repository (to support versioning)","Support multiple users","Generate code from the design","The industry standard to represent the object model is UML notation (adopted by OMG).","Tool recommendation","Rational Rose 98","Visio 5.0","Visual Modeler 2.0 (Only valid for VB and VC++)","Component Modeling","Description","Component modeling can mean either designing components from scratch, or customizing and integrating packaged software. No specific component modeling tools exist, and current object modeling tools only provide limited support for components (e.g. for packaging related classes together). Class packages can be used to separate the object models for different components, with a separate class package(s) for the component model. This approach, however, is not enforced by current modeling tools, and requires project naming and structuring standards.","When component modeling is being performed using existing packaged software, some form of reverse engineering or importing is required from the modeling tool to capture the existing design.","During component design, the partitioned component model is designed, which defines physical interfaces and locations for components. It is important for performance reasons that communication between components is minimized, especially if they are distributed.","Tool recommendation","Rational Rose 98","Visio 5.0","Visual Modeler 2.0 (Only valid for VB and VC++)","Application Logic Design","Description","Application Logic Design tools graphically depicts an application. These tools include application structure, module descriptions, and distribution of functions across client\/server nodes.","A variety of tools and techniques can be used for Application Logic Design. Examples are structure charts, procedure diagrams (module action diagrams), and graphics packages to illustrate distribution of functions across client and server.","Application Logic Design functionality is also provided by a number of Integrated Development Environments (IDE).","With component-based development, Application Logic Design is performed through object and component modeling. The functionality is captured in use cases, scenarios, work flows and\/or operations diagrams along with interaction diagrams\/sequence diagrams. These are usually produced using MS Word, MS PowerPoint, ABC Flowcharter (Micrografix), or an object modeling tool.","Tool Recommendation","Rational Rose 98","Visio 5.0","Database Design","Description","Database design tools provide a graphical depiction of the database design for the system. They enable the developer to illustrate the tables, file structures, etc. that may be physically implemented from the logical data requirements. The tools also represent data elements, indexing, and foreign keys.","Many data design tools integrate data modeling, database design, and database construction. An integrated tool may typically generate the first-cut database design from the data model, and may generate the database definition from the database design.","With an object-based or component-based solution, the data-modeling task changes. In most cases, relational databases are still used, even where there are no dependencies on legacy systems. As there is an \u2018impedance mis-match\u2019 between an object model and a data model, a mapping activity must be undertaken. There are standard mechanisms for doing this. There are also tools on the market which allow the mapping of classes to relational tables, and which generate any necessary code to perform the database operations.","There is a tendency (especially when dealing with legacy systems) to treat data models and object models the same. It is important to recognize that at best, the data model represents only the static part of the object model and does not contain any of the transient or dynamic aspects. The physical data model may also change significantly (for DB optimization), further confusing the issue.","There can be performance problems with objects mapped to a relational database. In a worst case scenario, an object can be spread across many tables, with a single select\/insert for each table, and as each object is loaded one by one, the performance becomes very poor. Some tools provide lazy initialization (only loading the parts as they are needed) and caching (minimizing DB hits).","The current trend seems to be for object-relational databases, with vendors such as Oracle adding object features to their core products. Although the support provided at the moment is limited, it is likely that in future versions Java or C++ classes may be able to interface directly.","Tool recommendation","Rational Rose 98 (Only valid for Oracle 8)","ERwin","Presentation Design","Description","Presentation design tools provide a graphical depiction of the presentation layer of the application. Tools in this category include window editors, report editors, and dialog flow (navigation) editors. Window editors enable the developer to design the windows for the application using standard GUI components. Report editors enable the developer to design the report layout interactively. Placing literals and application data on the layout without specifying implementation details such as page breaks. The majority of these tools generate the associated application code required to display these components in the target system.","Using the dialog flow (navigation) editors, the developer graphically depicts the flow of the windows or screens. The Control-Action-Response (CAR) diagram is a commonly used technique for specifying the design of GUI windows.","The majority of Netcentric systems use Web browsers to provide a common cross-platform user interface. Presentation design for this type of environment therefore entails the generation of HTML pages, often with additional components (JavaScript, 3rd party ActiveX controls, Plug-ins) providing enhanced functionality or media content. Many tools are currently available for designing and creating web content, although HTML remains the common denominator, at the very least as a placeholder for the content.","In the case of systems published on the Internet, defining the target audience is less straightforward than in traditional systems, but equally important. Having a good understanding of the intended audience may be a big advantage when thinking about user interaction with the system, and therefore, the presentation layer of the system.","Within a ReTA based application, three types of web pages that are available include:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0806","num":"1001"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00075","num":"00075"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Page Type","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Static HTML","This page consists of a single HTML file"]},{"entry":[{},"containing static text, formatting, scripts,"]},{"entry":[{},"anchor tags, and imbedded images."]},{"entry":[{},"This type of portion of the present description"]},{"entry":[{},"is the most common as it can be created"]},{"entry":[{},"using an ASCII text editor such as"]},{"entry":[{},"Windows Notepad."]},{"entry":[{},"For designing web pages in a WYSIWYG"]},{"entry":[{},"format,"]},{"entry":[{},"Many popular editing tools are available"]},{"entry":[{},"including Microsoft FrontPage, Microsoft"]},{"entry":[{},"Visual InterDev, and HomeSite."]},{"entry":[{},"Design elements include:"]},{"entry":[{},"Static HTML v3.2\/v4.0 portion of the present"]},{"entry":[{},"descriptions"]},{"entry":[{},"Graphics\/Images"]},{"entry":[{},"JavaScript (client and server) v1.2"]},{"entry":["Active Server Page","This type of web page is created dynamically"]},{"entry":["(Non UI Framework)","at the web server and written to the requesting"]},{"entry":[{},"client."]},{"entry":[{},"These pages are useful when dynamic data is"]},{"entry":[{},"required within the web page itself."]},{"entry":[{},"Microsoft FrontPage and Visual InterDev are"]},{"entry":[{},"popular ASP editors with Visual InterDev"]},{"entry":[{},"providing ASP debugging functionality as well."]},{"entry":["Active Server Page","This type of web page is also created"]},{"entry":["(Using UI Framework)","dynamically at the web server and written to"]},{"entry":[{},"the requesting client, however, they make use"]},{"entry":[{},"of the ReTA User Interface Framework."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0","Rational Rose 98","Visio 5.0","Visual Modeler 2.0 (Only valid for VB and VC++)","Packaged Component Integration","Description","Packaged components are generally thought of as third party applications or services that provide ready-made business logic that is customizable and reusable. Additionally, legacy applications can be included in these discussions when there is a desire to reuse portions of or an entire pre-existing application. One of the benefits of component-based systems is the ability to separate the component interfaces from their implementation. This simple feature can help enormously with access to both third party components and legacy applications. The concept of putting an object or component interface on a non-object piece of software is called \u2018wrapping.\u2019","There are several arguments for putting a wrapper around an third party application or legacy system instead of custom building or replacing the functionality that they provide:\n\n","Component standards are maturing, particularly in eCommerce Applications. Although plug and play is not yet a reality, more application and ISV vendors are developing component based solutions for the eCommerce market place. Generally, this is the simplest form of integration if leading-edge eCommerce architectures are being deployed.","Care should be taken to allow for the migration from one vendor to another. To allow for this, the application developer should investigate encapsulating the component within an application wrapper.","Wrapped Component Integration","Many of today's vendors provide ActiveX or Java classes that provide a direct component interface into their application or services. Some vendors such as SAP expose component interfaces which can be accessed by ORBs e.g. Microsoft's DCOM connector. The underlying architecture however is not component-based. This is not a problem providing the package provides scalable and robust application execution.","Another example is the use of Microsoft's COM Transaction Integrator  and the Microsoft SNA Server for NT .

The Security Management Architecture deliverable is used to illustrate the potential security implications. The ReTA Security Management Architecture portion of the present description is divided into three main portions in order to encompass security requirements for Development, Execution and Operation Architecture.","Development Architecture Security Management","Preserving security of information as it travels across the Internet, or even your own intranet, has become increasingly complex. The Internet is a public resource accessible worldwide, and is built on a foundation of inherently insecure technologies. Information which is available across the Internet is becoming more and more sensitive as business continue to deploy to the Internet. Implementing effective security in our new Net Centric computing environments presents some challenges without a doubt, but not insurmountable ones. By designing security into your Net Centric solution, and implementing the appropriate application, infrastructure, and procedural controls, security can be appropriately aligned with business risk. See , which illustrates an IDEA Framework  with components in scope ReTA Phase 1.","Everyone today is talking about Net Centric security. Keeping up with all of the security issues surrounding Net Centric technologies is more than a full time job, it has become a full time obsession. When designing a Net Centric solution, security is always at the forefront of everyone's mind, but what are the important things to consider? How do I know that I've addressed all the appropriate questions? How may my solution affect the security of my computing environment? How may that security impact my business? This paper may answer these questions, providing an overview of \u201cthings to consider\u201d when designing a Net Centric solution. It may not attempt to provide detailed technical solutions, but it may navigate one to the right path to find that information.","Impacts","Security Impacts","There is no question that the trend toward Net Centric computing may impact the traditional computing environment. Systems are much more distributed, and applications are being used by a larger number of people to reach new objectives every day. Along with all of these changes come significant security impacts. So what is it about Net Centric computing that can lead to security problems?","First of all, the Internet is a public resource. Traditionally our computer systems were only used or accessible by a small audience which we knew and could control. Now our computer environment is linked to the Internet, which is accessible to virtually anyone who has the time and the money to invest. While most of these people have good intentions when it comes to using your resources, some have an evil purpose. Threats can come from many sources: teenage hackers, spies from other companies, even curious people who inadvertently cause damage. The public nature of the Internet also increases the ability of these malicious individuals to collaborate and recruit others, thus strengthening their cause. The Internet contains a wide variety of information that people are interested in, from public information resources to sensitive customer databases.","In addition to the very lure of interesting information on the Internet, there are vulnerabilities inherent to Internet technologies which can make that information more easily compromised. In fact, the original intent of the Internet was to share information, not to be used as a business tool. Security weaknesses are widespread and present in nearly all Internet related technologies. The very communication protocol used, TCP\/IP, was designed with few provisions to protect the security of the data packet.","Of course, security problems weren't created with the Internet; many of our standalone computer systems have the same types of security exposures. However, the global nature of the Internet now transfers these insecure services rapidly around the world. Weaknesses that before could only have been exploited by a small number of users with access to the system, can now be exploited by virtually anyone. These breaches are also now publicized to the entire Internet community. For example, many high profile web pages have recently been attacked, including NASA, the Department of Justice, and the CIA. Although these attacks were limited to vandalizing their web pages, (as far as we know), the publicity generated from the attacks has raised questions about the security of their systems in general. Internet access not only made these attacks possible, it also publicized the attack around the world.","This rapid transfer of information raises an issue regarding the dynamic nature of today's environment. The Net Centric environment includes traditional long term users of systems, as well as one time users who require instant logons and immediate connections. Security may stand in the way of business objectives if it is not flexible and dynamic enough to adapt to ever-changing business and technology requirements. In addition, new threats and risks evolve quickly in the Net Centric environment, and security programs may become ineffective and obsolete if not reviewed and updated regularly.","The Internet also brings with it a whole new set of legal issues, and topping the list are potential privacy implications. Businesses can now track your every movement on the Internet, from your email and IP addresses, to each site you surfed to and which ad one clicked. Does this constitute an invasion of your privacy? One may have freely given other businesses sensitive information aboutonerself, such as one's credit card number or one's social security number. To what lengths must that business go to in order to protect that information? If and when that information is compromised, who is liable? What is the penalty for breaking into a computer to which one is not granted access? What if one just looks around and does not cause any damage? These questions are just beginning to be addressed as cases are introduced in court and legislation is passed in Congress. But we are a long way from finding all the answers.","All of these security concerns have been widely publicized in the media, to the extent that the public now perceives security as a major issue on the Internet. These concerns may have the effect of impeding the success of an Internet solution, or even delaying a business decision to deploy to the Internet. Even as new technology emerges to solve many Internet related security problems, public opinion, legitimate or not, may still impact the success of any Internet solution.","Application Impacts","There are obviously a myriad of security implications from the move towards Net Centric computing. The Internet, and the growth of local intranets, has made our computing environment look much different today than it did five years ago. So what does this mean? When designing a business solution in this new environment, security implications have to be considered at every step of the process. Application design presents a specific set of security related challenges.","Application Design","The underlying theme in application design, from a security perspective, is to design in security from the beginning. Talk to Information Security representatives, and even internal auditors early on, and get their approval for your design. This can save retrofitting costs in order to achieve an adequate level of security, and may also end up giving one a more secure solution by integrating security right into the design of the application.","Once one is considering security, what is the best way to design it into your application? Even the most pompous security expert should recognize that your primary goal is not to build an application with really good security, it is to build an application that achieves a specific business goal. The challenge is to integrate security into that business goal so that it may not impede efficiency. Often security is tacked on a the last minute and impedes performance in the application, such that users may bypass security if possible, and curse it if not possible.","The next step is to consider the basic parameters of your application and how security applies to each of them.","Who needs access to the application, i.e. what is your user group? Is it all Internet users or some authorized subset? Does one only have one type of user or are multiple levels of authorization required?","Where may your application may be accessed from, the Internet or your intranet? How much control do one has over the security of that location and PC?","What is the confidentiality of the information your application may be transmitting or accessing? What implications would there be if that information fell into the wrong hands?","Once these questions have been answered one can begin to choose the appropriate tools or mechanisms to provide an adequate level of protection.","When designing your application, consider implementing the minimum level of functionality and authority required to meet your business goal. This is often contradictory to basic instinct when designing a new solution, but consider the potential implications. If your application does not need to allow users to execute arbitrary operating system commands, don't let it. If your application does not need to run as root or supervisor, don't let it. Designing for minimum functionality may obviously be a tradeoff between business and security benefits, but in general, it is better meet the level of authority required, not exceed it.","Security Integration","When designing security into your application, remember that one may not have to re-invent the proverbial wheel. Most information security groups may have corporate security strategies with which one can integrate. For example, an enterprise wide authentication scheme may be in use, with which one can integrate for remote access. Or there may be a single sign-on product with which your application may need to be compatible. Even if there is not a corporate security strategy in place today, consider the direction that the company is moving toward, and provide for future integration if possible.","Auditing and Logging","Application auditing and logging is often overlooked because it is less than glamorous, but it does provide security administrators with a crucial tool for monitoring use of an application. Good logs should be searchable for known or suspected patterns of abuse, and should be protected from alteration. Logs can monitor a virtual myriad of data, including access times, user IDs, locations from where the application was accessed, actions the user performed, and whether or not those actions were successfully completed.","Web Browser Security","While web browsers may not be exactly part of your application design, they are intimately related to many of the design decisions one may make, such as the programming tools one uses and the format your user interfaces take. The application programming tools portion of the description, above, discussed some possible ways a Web browser can exploit application security flaws. There are also design anomalies within the Web browsers themselves which can be exploited. Microsoft has fixed many of these flaws in their newest release of Internet Explorer, but their older versions are still vulnerable. This type of problem demonstrates that when considering integration with the major commercial web browsers, it is important to monitor news releases for recent security flaws. One may want to consider requiring your users to use the latest, most secure version of their Web browser if possible.","Infrastructure Impacts","Today's Net Centric computing infrastructure requires a complex mix of operating systems, web servers, database servers, firewalls, management tools, routers, and underlying network components. Each different component of this infrastructure has specific security considerations which need to be addressed. These requirements are always growing and changing, as are the solutions which can be implemented. When designing this complex infrastructure, similar to designing an application, security should be considered early on in the process.","Operating System Security","It is crucial to choose an operating system (OS) which can provide adequate security; and once chosen it is just as important to configure that OS in a secure manner. Any OS must address the same basic security questions, such as restricting permissions for what each user can access, limiting what actions each user can perform, providing monitoring and logging of user access, and restricting what services are available. Windows NT is without exception.","NT has been publicly available for over three years now, and while security issues may have appeared, fresh out of the box NT is a very secure OS. But there are still steps to take to improve this security. Configure your OS securely from the start, implement tools where appropriate, and continue to monitor the bulletin boards and vendor announcements for problems as they come up.","Web Server Security","Many of the OS security guidelines apply to web servers as well. Regardless of your choice of web server, it is important to configure that server securely. The server should be set to run under an ID which is used only by that web server, and never as root. Directory permissions should be assigned according to a need to know philosophy, and your portion of the present description root (where published information is stored) should be different from your server root (where server binaries and configuration files are stored.)","In addition to these somewhat generic operating system security tips, there are several features which are specific to a web server which could create security exposures. In general, if one doesn't need a feature, don't turn it on; and if one does need a feature, make sure the potential security risks are understood. Server side includes allow HTML authors to place commands inside their portion of the present descriptions that cause output to be modified whenever that portion of the present description is accessed by a user. Hackers can take advantage of server side includes if they are able to place arbitrary HTML statements on your server and then execute them.","Legacy System Integration","In order to truly take advantage of the power of Net Centric computing, new technologies need to be mixed and integrated with existing systems. More sophisticated intranets and extranets often require on line transactions or database inquiries of legacy environments which may not have the level of granular control required for secure access. In some cases, it may be possible to mirror the information from an existing platform to a more securable web server or database. This may protect the integrity of your sensitive systems while still providing the access for your on-line transactions. If a mirror system is not possible, a thorough audit should be performed of the security of your legacy system, to ensure that one is providing access to only those resources which are allowed.","Network Security","Now one has chosen your access control mechanisms, configured your OS, and it's time to connect to your network. This action may strike fear into the heart of many network and system administrators, because this may create one more way network security can be compromised. Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to establish and maintain effective network security. The first step is to understand what all of your network components are, and how they are connected. By examining your network topology, one can determine where all of your access points are, and (hopefully) the way that access to them is controlled. If remote access directly into your network is required, the use of your modems must be appropriately restricted.","Don't rely on knowledge of the phone number or a single static password as effective security controls.","In addition to identifying one's access points, one should examine the path that one's traffic follows, and determine if that path is vulnerable to snooping and attack. One of the more infamous hacker gangs, the Masters of Deception, once infiltrated a major telecommunication provider's data network, and had access to the corporate secrets of hundreds of companies as information was sent across the lines. Even if your data is just traveling over internal links, a network management station could still be monitoring traffic, or a sniffer could illicitly be installed anywhere along the line. There are two major security controls that mitigate these risks: firewalls to restrict who can access your secure network, and encryption to protect your data as it's sent over an insecure network.","Firewalls","Firewalls are often thought of as THE answer to network security. There is a common misconception that purchasing and installing the \u201cbest\u201d firewall available may automatically protect your network from the Internet. This is not necessarily true. In fact there are many factors to consider when choosing a firewall, and when placing and configuring that firewall in your environment. First of all, consider the type of network connection your are trying to protect. Firewalls are not only used to separate your intranet from the Internet, they can also be used to segregate a particularly sensitive or particularly insecure area of your intranet from the rest of your network. Depending on the services one wants to provide your users and what risk one is willing to accept, your choice of the \u201cbest\u201d firewall implementation may change.","There are many different components of the firewall architecture to consider. Packet Filtering Systems selectively route packets between internal and external hosts by either the type of packet, the originating host address, or the target host address. Packet filtering is typically implemented on a specific type of router called a screening router.","Proxy Services are specialized applications or server programs that run on a firewall host, which take users' requests for Internet services (such as ftp and telnet) and forward them, as appropriate according to the site's security policy, to the actual services. The proxies provide replacement connections and act as gateways to the services. For this reason, proxies are sometimes known as Application Level Gateways.","A Bastion Host is typically a dual-homed gateway with one interface on the internal network and one on the external network. It can be used to run proxy services or perform stateful packet inspection. The bastion host typically acts as the main point of contact for incoming connections from the outside world, including email, ftp and telnet requests, and DNS queries about the site.","A Perimeter Network or DMZ refers to a small network between your internal network and the Internet which provides an extra layer of security. Any publicly available resources one provides, such as a Web server or an ftp server, may typically be located in the DMZ, and restricted from one's internal network by a firewall machine or bastion host.","There are many commercially available firewall products that provide some or all of these features. Which product or firewall configuration is right for one may depend on what one's network looks like, what one is trying to protect, and what your users require.","Event Monitoring","Before an incident can be responded to, it must first be detected. In the Net Centric environment, your firewall, routers, web servers, database servers, applications, and network management tools must be monitored to ensure they are working correctly and no violations have occurred. Monitoring packages can be configured to take different actions on a series of specified events, such as sending an email message if a log fills up, flashing an icon on a system administrator's screen if someone's user ID is disabled, or paging a network administrator if a link to the ISP goes down. Once this initial notification takes place, there should be escalation procedures to decide whom to notify next. For example, if the link to the ISP goes down, how long does one wait before notifying one's manager? one's users? In addition, not all monitoring needs to be reactive. There are proactive monitoring tools available which can detect patterns of abuse or failure which may lead to larger problems, and can help one detect those problems before they affect your users.","Backup and Recovery","People kick over servers, accidentally delete files, and spill coffee on machines. For these reasons and a host of others, Net Centric resources must be backed up in a manner so that they can be recovered. This does not mean dumping a bunch of files onto data tapes and stacking them in a corner of the server room. An effective backup and recovery strategy should address how backups may be taken, the media on which they may be stored, the location where they may be stored, and the frequency with which they may be taken. Backups should also be periodically tested to make sure that they are recoverable, for example to make sure the backup tape drive is still working. When designing your backup strategy one should also consider the specific types of applications, databases, and hardware which are in use in your environment. For example an Oracle database may probably not be recoverable from a .tar file. In addition to software resources, consider what would happen if your router or your ISP link were to go down. It may be necessary to maintain a backup link to a secondary service provider in the event that your ISP goes down for an extended period of time.","Execution Architecture Security Management","The Execution Architecture Security focuses on Authorization, Encryption and Authentication in order to securely support applications and ensure data integrity throughout the life cycle of a single transaction. The ReTA Effort chose the Netcentric Architecture Framework (NCAF) to identify the appropriate components to focus on within the Execution Architecture. See  which illustrates a NCAF Framework  with the shaded components  in scope for Phase 1.","Authentication","Regardless of the operating system that one is using, access control is a major security concern. NT authenticate users by their knowledge of an ID and password that can be used multiple times however, all passwords are vulnerable in some manner. The advent of sniffing technologies allows passwords to be monitored and read over the network. Even if passwords are encrypted as they are sent, a keystroke capturing program could be installed at the client PC and used to capture passwords before they are encrypted. Perhaps advanced client side security can mitigate this threat as well, but even with the highest technology solution, a user could write his password down and stick it to the side of his PC, thereby defeating all of the technology just implemented.","The solution to this problem is some type of two factor authentication, meaning that users are authenticated with something they have, and something they know. The \u201csomething they know\u201d can still be a password, and the \u201csomething they have\u201d can range from the high end being a one time password generator, to the low end being an ID file stored on the user's PC or on a disk. In choosing an appropriate solution, one should consider ease of management and ease of distribution, the required strength of the solution, and integration into your environment. There are several examples of technologies which can meet your requirements, including the use of one-time passwords, time based passwords, or challenge response schemes. Once chosen and implemented, a secure authentication mechanism can be incorporated with both your operating system and your application to remove the risks associated with static passwords.

In order to guarantee confidentiality over any insecure network, including the Internet, some type of encryption must be used. Encryption may ensure that data cannot be read by anyone other than the secure target server, and that the data being transferred has not been altered. Today there are so many different strategies for implementing encryption, it is often difficult to choose which scheme is most appropriate. The specific encryption strategy chosen may rely on a number of factors.","What information exactly needs to be encrypted? If one is running a smart store over the Internet, maybe one only needs to encrypt the single piece of data that has the customer's credit card information. If one is allowing their system administrators to dial into their network via the Internet, one may probably want to encrypt the whole session.","How many users are there? If one want to just encrypt data between a few users and one's system, a private or secret key encryption scheme may be appropriate. If one is in a multi-user environment one may probably want to consider public key encryption, and the key management strategies that go along with it.","What does one's computing environment look like? If your applications or operating systems provide native encryption, these may be the easiest and most secure to implement.","Based on your answers to these questions, there are a number on encryption solutions available for implementation. If one is running a Netscape web server, one may want to consider Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, which provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication for a TCP\/IP connection. Another WWW security solution is Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP), which is a security-enhanced version of HTTP, developed by Enterprise Integration Technologies (EIT). S-HTTP supports end-to-end secure transactions by incorporating cryptographic enhancements to messaging at the application level. Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, is a common encryption solution for electronic mail.","PGP may both authenticate the sender of the message, and encrypt the contents of the message through the use of a public key\/private key pair. In electronic commerce solutions, the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) specification which is being jointly developed by Visa and MasterCard may be considered. SET may require authentication of all parties involved with a credit card transaction through the use of digital signatures and certificates, and may use a separate encryption handshake in order to guarantee both confidentiality and integrity.

ReTA abstracts database connection from the application developer through the Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) 2.0 connection pooling mechanism.","Object Messaging","Description","Object Messaging enables objects to transparently make requests of and receive responses from other objects located locally or remotely. Objects communicate through an Object Request Broker (ORB). An ORB enables client objects to access server objects either locally or remotely over a network and invoke operations (i.e. functions and methods) on them. ORBs typically provide interoperability between heterogeneous client and server environments: across languages and\/or operating systems and\/or network protocols.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Object Messaging services through Microsoft's COM\/DCOM mechanism.","Security Services","Communications Security services control access to network-attached resources. Combining network Security services with security services in other parts of the system architecture (e.g., application and database layers) results in robust security.","Authentication","Description","Authentication services verify network access requests by validating that users are who they claim to be.

ReTA also supports application defined \u201crequired workflow sequence\u201d web page access authorization through the ReTA Session framework.","Encryption","Description","Encryption services encrypt data prior to network transfer to prevent unauthorized interception. Encryption has two main components: the encryption algorithm, which is the series of steps that is performed to transform the original data; and the key, which is used by the algorithm in some way to encrypt the message. Typically, the algorithm is widely known, while the key is kept secret. There are several types of encryption in use today, including:","Secret key cryptography\u2014uses one key (the secret key) both to encrypt the message on one side and to decrypt the message on the other side.","Public key cryptography\u2014uses two keys, the public key and the private key. The public key and private key are mathematically related so that a message encrypted with the recipient's public key may be decrypted with the recipient's private key. Therefore, the public key can be widely published, while the private key is kept secret.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Encryption services through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) mechanism. ReTA also implements encryption for the User ID and User Password used by the ODBC mechanism through the ReTA Session framework.","Environment Services","Environment Services provide miscellaneous application and system level services that do not deal directly with managing the user-interface, communicating to other programs, or accessing data. Sub-components covered during the Phase 1 of ReTA include: Application Services, Component Framework, Operating System, Runtime Services, and System Services.","Application Services","Application Services are miscellaneous services which applications can use for common functions. These common functions can apply to one application or can be used across applications. They include: Application Security Services, Error Handling\/Logging Services, State Management Services, Help Services, and Other Common Services.","Application Security","Description","Besides system level security such as logging into the network, there are additional security services associated with specific applications. These include:","User Access Services\u2014set of common functions that limit application access to specific users within a company or external customers.","Data Access Services\u2014set of common functions that limit access to specific data within an application to specific users or user types (e.g., secretary, manager).","Function Access Services\u2014set of common functions that limit access to specific functions within an application to specific users or user types (e.g., secretary, manager).","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Application Security through the ReTA Session and Activity frameworks. The Session framework provides \u201cSession level Page access authorization\u201d, \u201cUser identification\u201d and \u201csession timeout\u201d services. The Activity framework provides \u201cActivity level Page access authorization\u201d.","Codes Table Services","Description","Codes Table Services enable applications to utilize externally stored parameters and validation rules. For example, an application may be designed to retrieve the tax rate for the State of Illinois. When the user enters \u201cIllinois\u201d on the screen, the application first validates the user's entry by checking for its existence on the \u201cState Tax Table\u201d, and then retrieves the tax rate for Illinois. Note that codes tables provide an additional degree of flexibility. If the tax rates changes, the data simply needs to be updated; no application logic needs to be modified.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Codes Table Services through the ReTA Codes Table framework.","Error Handling\/Logging","Description","Error Handling Services support the handling of fatal and non-fatal hardware and software errors for an application. An error handling architecture takes care of presenting the user with an understandable explanation of what has happened and coordinating with other services to ensure that transactions and data are restored to a consistent state.","Logging Services support the logging of informational, error, and warning messages.","Logging Services record application and user activities in enough detail to satisfy any audit trail requirements or to assist the systems support team in recreating the sequence of events that led to an error.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Error Handling\/Logging Services through the ReTA Event Handler and Persistence frameworks.","Other Common Services","Description","Catchall category for additional reusable routines useful across a set of applications (e.g., Date Routines, Time Zone Conversions, Field Validation Routines).","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements client side Field Validation Services through the ReTA UI framework.","State Management","Description","State Management Services enable information to be passed or shared among windows and\/or Web pages and\/or across programs. In Netcentric environments, the HTTP protocol creates a potential need for implementing some form of Context Management Services (storing state information on the server). The HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. Every connection is negotiated from scratch, not just at the page level but for every element on the page. The server does not maintain a session connection with the client nor save any information between client exchanges (i.e., web page submits or requests). Each HTTP exchange is a completely independent event. Therefore, information entered into one HTML form must be saved by the associated server application somewhere where it can be accessed by subsequent programs in a conversation.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements State Management Services through Microsoft's IIS Session component and the ReTA Session, Activity and UI frameworks.","Component Framework","Description","Component Framework Services provide an infrastructure for building components so that they can communicate within an application and across applications, on the same machine or on multiple machines across a network, to work together. COM\/DCOM and CORBA described in Communication Services are the two leading component industry standards. These standards define how components should be built and how they should communicate.","Object Request Broker (ORB) services, based on COM\/DCOM and CORBA, focus on how components communicate. Component Framework Services, also based on CORBA and COM\/DCOM, focus on how components should be built.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Component Framework Services through the ReTA Activity framework.","Operating System","Description","Operating System Services are the underlying services such as multi-tasking, paging, memory allocation, etc., typically provided by today's modern operating systems. Where necessary, an additional layer or Application Programming Interface (API) may be provided to gain either operating system independence or a higher level of abstraction for application programmers.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Operating System Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Runtime Services","Runtime services convert non-compiled computer languages into machine code during the execution of a program. They include: Language Interpreter Service and Virtual Machine Service.","Language Interpreter","Description","Language Interpreter Services decompose a 4th generation and\/or a scripting languages into machine code (executable code) at runtime.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Language Interpreter Services through NT server 4.0 and IIS 4.0.","Virtual Machine","Description","Typically, a Virtual Machine is implemented in software on top of an operating system, and is used to run applications. The Virtual Machine provides a layer of abstraction between the applications and the underlying operating system and is often used to support operating system independence.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Virtual Machine Services through NT 4.0 Virtual Machine component.","System Services","Services which applications can use to perform system-level functions. These services include: System Security Services, Profile Management Services, Task and Memory Management Services, and Environment Verification Services.","Environment Verification","Description","Environment Verification Services ensure functionality by monitoring, identifying and validating environment integrity prior and during program execution. (e.g., free disk space, monitor resolution, correct version). These services are invoked when an application begins processing or when a component is called. Applications can use these services to verify that the correct versions of required Execution Architecture components and other application components are available.","Profile Management","Description","Profile Management Services are used to access and update local or remote system, user, or application profiles.

They minimize an application's dependence on the physical storage and location within the network. Information Services can be grouped into two categories: Database Services, and Portion of the present description Services. Portion of the present description Services may not be covered during ReTA Phase 1.","Database Services","Database Services are responsible for providing access to a local or a remote database, maintaining integrity of the data within the database and supporting the ability to store data on either a single physical platform, or in some cases across multiple platforms. Database Services include: Access Services, Indexing Services and Security Services.","Access","Description","Access Services enable an application to retrieve data from a database as well as manipulate (insert, update, delete) data in a database. This can be done through the following:","Standards Based Structured Query Language (SQL) API","SQL Gateways","Distributed Relational Data Access (DRDA)","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Database Access Services through the ReTA Persistence framework, which utilizes the Standards Based SQL API approach through ODBC.","Indexing","Description","Indexing Services provide a mechanism for speeding up data retrieval.

The only difference is the technology used to develop the Forms. The most common type of Forms within a browser are Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) Forms. The HTML standard includes tags for informing a compliant browser that the bracketed information is to be displayed as an editable field, a radio button, or other form-type control. Currently, HTML browsers support only the most rudimentary forms\u2014basically providing the presentation and collection of data without validation or mapping support. When implementing Forms with HTML, additional services may be required such as client side scripting (e.g., VB Script, JavaScript).","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Form Services through the NT 4.0 operating system, Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.0.

These User Navigation Services can be subdivided into three categories:","Hyperlink\u2014the hyperlink mechanism is not constrained to a menu, but can be used anywhere within a page or portion of the present description to provide the user with navigation options.","Customized Menu\u2014a menu bar with associated pull-down menus or context-sensitive pop-up menus.","Virtual Reality\u2014A virtual reality or a virtual environment interface takes the idea of an image map to the next level by creating a 3-dimensional (3-D) environment for the user to walk around in.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements the Hyperlink functionality of web browser Navigation Services through the ReTA UI framework.","Window System","Description","Typically part of the operating system, the Window System Services provide the base functionality for creating and managing a graphical user interface (GUI)\u2014detecting user actions, managing windows on the display, and displaying information in windows.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Window System Services through the NT 4.0 operating system.","Transaction Services","A transaction is a unit of work that has the following (ACID) characteristics:","A transaction is atomic; if interrupted by failure, all effects are undone (rolled back).","A transaction produces consistent results; the effects of a transaction preserve invariant properties.","A transaction is isolated; its intermediate states are not visible to other transactions.","Transactions appear to execute serially, even if they are performed concurrently.","A transaction is durable; the effects of a completed transaction are persistent; they are never lost (except in a catastrophic failure).","A transaction can be terminated in one of two ways: the transaction is either committed or rolled back. When a transaction is committed, all changes made by the associated requests are made permanent. When a transaction is rolled back, all changes made by the associated requests are undone.","Transaction Services provide the transaction integrity mechanism for the application. This allows all data activities within a single business event to be grouped as a single, logical unit of work.","Transaction Monitor","Description","The Transaction Monitor Services are the primary interface through which applications invoke Transaction Services and receive status and error information. Transaction Monitor Services, in conjunction with Information Access and Communication Services provide for load balancing across processors or machines and location transparency for distributed transaction processing.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Transaction Monitor Services through MTS 2.0. ReTA uses the Activity framework to define a transaction.","Resource Management","Description","A Resource Manager provides for concurrency control and integrity for a singular data resource (e.g., a database or a file system). Integrity is guaranteed by ensuring that an update is completed correctly and entirely or not at all. Resource Management Services use locking, commit, and rollback services, and are integrated with Transaction Management Services.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Resource Manager Services through MTS 2.0.","Transaction Management","Description","Transaction Management Services coordinate transactions across one or more resource managers either on a single machine or multiple machines within the network. Transaction Management Services ensure that all resources for a transaction are updated, or in the case of an update failure on any one resource, all updates are rolled back.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Transaction Management Services through Microsoft's Distributed Transaction Manager and MTS 2.0.","Transaction Partitioning","Description","Transaction Partitioning Services provide support for mapping a single logical transaction in an application into the required multiple physical transactions. For example, in a package or legacy rich environment, the single logical transaction of changing a customer address may require the partitioning and coordination of several physical transactions to multiple application systems or databases. Transaction Partitioning Services provide the application with a simple single transaction view.","ReTA Implementation","ReTA implements Transaction Partitioning Services through Microsoft's Distributed Transaction Manager and MTS 2.0.","Business Logic","The execution architecture services are all generalized services designed to support the applications Business Logic. Normally, how Business Logic is to be organized is not within the scope of the execution architecture. However, the ReTA Application Frameworks extend the services of the execution architecture to support the \u201cInterface Controller Model\u201d (ICM) pattern approach to packaging the Business Logic as components.","Business Logic is the core of any application, providing the expression of business rules and procedures (e.g., the steps and rules that govern how a sales order is fulfilled). As such, the Business Logic includes the control structure that specifies the flow for processing business events and user requests. In a ReTA application, the Application Frameworks define a structured approach to the concepts of Interface, Application Logic, and Data Abstraction.","Interface logic interprets and maps the actions of users into business logic processing activities. With the assistance of Presentation Services, Interface logic provides the linkage that allows users to control the flow of processing within the application. ReTA implements this service through the UI and Activity Frameworks.","Application Logic is the expression of business rules and procedures (e.g., the steps and rules that govern how a sales order is fulfilled). As such, the Application Logic includes the control structure that specifies the flow for processing for business events and user requests. The isolation of control logic facilitates change and adaptability of the application to changing business processing flows. ReTA implements this service through the Activity Framework.","Information Access Services isolate the Business Logic from the technical specifics of how information is stored (e.g., location transparency, RDBMS syntax, etc.). Data Abstraction provides the application with a more logical view of information, further insulating the application from physical information storage considerations. ReTA implements this service through the Persistence Framework.","The ReTA Application Frameworks provides services that encourage and support the thin-client model. Also, the Frameworks shield business logic developers from the details and complexity of architecture services (e.g., information services, component services) and other business logic.","Execution Architecture Physical Model","Purpose","The ReTA Execution Architecture Physical Model portion of the description shows the actual components comprising the Execution Architecture and their relative location and interfaces. Additionally, the model depicts the platforms on which the components may reside as well as the distribution across the environment. The components in the Physical Model may support a portion of a function or more than one function from the functional model.","Physical Configuration","The content for this portion of the description is defined in the Technology Infrastructure Procurement List portion of the present description.","Physical Model",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1064","num":"1284"},"figref":"FIG. 47","b":["4700","4702","4704","4706","4708","4710"]},"Operations Architecture Design","Overview","The Operations Architecture is a combination of tools, support services, procedures, and controls required to keep a production system up and running efficiently. Unlike the Execution and Development Architectures, its primary users are the system administrators and the production support personnel. With reference to , all components of the Operations Architecture  are integral to the successful management of a distributed environment. Any processes, procedures, or tools developed or chosen as an operational management solution for a specific operational area must be able to integrate with any existing or planned process, procedure, tool solutions for other Operations Architecture areas.","Operations Architecture Component Design","Physical Environment ","Implementing\u2014Initial Installation","Description","Initial Installation prepares the physical location for the rollout of a new site or service, pre-assembles the equipment (hardware and software) based on developed specifications, installs the equipment and tests that the equipment is fully functional prior to allowing the users to utilize the system in a production environment. Precise build procedures must be delivered early enough to drive Release Testing, Procurement, and rollout plans. For large multi site installations that require significant rollout of new hardware, optimization of the configuration tasks (hardware and software) can be achieved through the use of a central staging facility.","Planning Considerations","The deployment of the physical environment must be scheduled as early as possible, and detailed communication regarding the technology infrastructure deployment plan should be distributed regularly to key stakeholders.","Where a pilot implementation has taken place previously, or is in progress, the experiences from this activity need to be incorporated into the deployment plans. The purpose of a pilot implementation essentially is to minimize the risks of full implementation. Any experiences from the pilot should be identified and plans to avoid trouble, or accelerate progress, should be included within the deployment work plan.","Ensure that the organizational functions are ready for the change. Functions of the organization may need to be ready for the technology infrastructure change before it is deployed. These functions include:","Help Desk","Support Systems","System Maintenance","Operations","The organizations supporting these functions need to understand how their support roles may change, and what new demands the technology infrastructure may place upon them. Ensuring that these areas are comfortable supporting the new infrastructure, and that they are able to troubleshoot problems is critical to the overall support and success of the business capability.","Event\/Data Management","Event\/Data management is the process of receiving and classifying events. An event is a change in the state of a network component. There are two types of events\u2014solicited and unsolicited. A solicited event results from the direct (synchronous) polling of a network component  by a network management station  as represented in .","An unsolicited event occurs when a network component  sends (asynchronously) data to the network management station  as represented in .","Once the event is received, the management station classifies the event. If it is classified as a fault, it would then be passed to the fault management facility. Otherwise it is classified as a normal event and is logged for historical trending purposes.","Event Processing","Event processing manipulates the raw data obtained in the event\/data generation layer into a more workable form. This layer performs functions such as event filtering, alert generation, event correlation, event collection and logging, and automated trouble ticket generation. Event processing routes the processed information on to either the presentation or management applications layers. Again it is important to consider the interface of the event processing component with the other components of the operational architecture.","Event Management in a Net-Centric Environment","The MODEnc project has further defined Net-Centric Computing as the standards and considerations involved with Internet\/Intranet\/Extranet environments.","When using the Internet-based net-centric model , as shown, for example, in , Internet standards such as TCP\/IP, HTML and CGI are used to publish, interact, and transact with data\/content on the public Internet . Typically, a firewall  is implemented to secure a service provider's internal resources  from the public Internet. A service provider locates Internet-based resources outside of the firewall and may provide controlled access from the web to internal information through mechanisms such as CGI . Access to Internet resources may be through web browsers as depicted or via other mechanisms such as e-mail or ftp.","When using the Intranet-based net-centric model  as illustrated in , Internet standards are used within the confines of a private network to implement publish-, interact-, and transact-based applications. Browsers  are used to access HTML pages or other services located and controlled through internal web servers .","When using the Extranet-based net-centric model , as illustrated in  companies share computing resources by connecting over the Internet  or Virtual Private Network (VPN). Each company typically shields its internal networks from the public Internet via firewalls , and provides controlled access through the firewalls to its partner's resources.","When performing the Event Management function in a net-centric environment, the following factors should be considered:","Lack of event management on the Internet","New events","Integration with other system management tools","Centralized event polling issues","Intra-application events should be analyzed","SNMP difficulties in managing net-centric environments","Lack of Event Management on the Internet [Internet, Extranet]","Net-centric service providers must consider that the Internet provides few event management services. Though a service provider's systems that reside outside the firewall may host SNMP and\/or other event management agents, public Internet hosts currently may not provide event management data to a 3party service provider.","New Events [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","New event metrics such as metrics related to an Internet connection may be required to get an accurate overall picture of the net-centric environment health. The emerging thin client architecture may also require new event categories.","Integration with other System Management Tools [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Events generated by net-centric management tools may need to integrate with other system management applications.","Centralized Event Polling Issues [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Management of a net-centric environment relies more heavily on remote sites generating and queuing their own event management information. The reason for this is if there is a network failure, a centralized polling approach to event management may not be able to assess the health of nodes behind a broken network link. Remote nodes must generation their own events, queue them in case of failure, and resends the queued events upon reestablishment of network connections","Intra-application events should be analyzed [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Service Providers should monitor not only what pages\/interfaces that users are accessing, but what they are doing within each page\/interface to maximize the marketing value of usage data. This can also provide valuable input to application design teams in making application refinements.","SNMP in a Net-Centric Environment [Internet, Intranet, Extranet]","Since SNMP traps may have to traverse multiple networks, and MIBs may need to send management information to multiple stakeholders, managing events across net-centric environments can be difficult. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) may have to consider clever filtering to ensure that the right traps get to the right users.","Presentation","The presentation component provides the interface between the manager(s) of the system and management data generated by the system. Data can be manipulated for various forms of output. By integrating the operational architecture it is possible to reduce the number of front-end interfaces required. Commonly, the presentation component uses a GUI front-end interface. This component is also responsible for real-time and historical report generation.","Management Applications","Management applications are those tools which are used to manage the system. Most of the MODE functions tie directly into this component. The management applications component ties in directly with the integration platform component as the management applications tools must comply with the standards set by the integration platform. Management applications receive data from the event\/data generation, event processing, and repositories components and then send data to the presentation or repositories components. Management applications tools include capacity planning tools, performance management tools, license management tools, remote management tools, systems monitoring tools, scheduling tools, help desk tools, etc.. Some Enterprise Management tools even poll the event\/data generators for information but these options may impact network performance. Web Server management has been introduced as part of the management operations framework. As Corporate Internets and Extranets implement Web based software products to sell and advertise business services, corresponding administrative, security, event notification and performance requirements must be performed similarly for the companies web based system. The two critical path issues are security management and network management.","Security Management","Security Management controls both physical and logical security for a Net-Centric environment. Due to the nature of the environment, security may need to be managed either centrally, remotely or through a combination of the two methods.","Security Management also handles the logging of proper and illegal access, provides a way to audit security information, rectify security breaches and address unauthorized use of the system.","Network Mangement","Network & Systems Management Planning is responsible for the planning activities involved in running the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the production systems","Capacity Planning","Performance Planning","Repositories","Repositories contain all the management data generated or used during the management process. This includes historical data, capacity data, performance data, problem knowledge bases, asset databases, solution sets, and management information bases (MIBs). The repositories component interacts with the management applications, integration platform, supporting infrastructure, and presentation components. Again it is important to make sure that the other components of the operational architecture are compatible with the database tools.","Backup\/Restore","Archiving","Integration Platform","The integration platform provides a common platform for the operational architecture. At the lowest level this means deciding on common standards, interfaces, massage formats, and file logging forms to be used with all the management tools. Products like Tivoli Management Environment, require the use of a separate integration platform component into which the management applications are connected. Many third party vendors insist that they provide solutions which incorporate the event\/data generation, event processing, repositories, and presentation components of the MAP operational architecture. It must be noted however that some of these total solution providers may sell a proprietary based solution, at best, and\/or may include customized Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Software Development Kit capabilities in order to completely integrate your non-proprietary network.","Lastly, some environments use a home grown integration platform. The choice of integration platforms depends upon its ability to integrate with the execution and development environments.","Supporting Infrastructure","The supporting infrastructure is the subset of operating systems, utilities, languages, and protocols used to support the management of the system. The supporting infrastructure is most often determined by the execution and development environments and the business applications on the system. It is necessary to ensure that the other components of the operational architecture are compatible with the existing supporting infrastructure.","Managing Hardware","Managing hardware is all hardware directly used to manage the environment. This includes all staging components. These components are devoted to systems management functions. Examples of managing hardware include management servers, management controllers, management consoles, probes, and sniffers. One significant component in the hardware monitoring arena is Firewall access control policy management. Firewalls are regularly used for network based security management. It is typically a system or group of systems that enforce access control between two or more networks and\/or perform network data packet filtering. Usually packet filtering router hardware and application gateways are used to block unauthorized IP packets and enforce proxy defined user commands.","Management Tool Selection","It is important to note that there may be requirements which cannot be met by any tools. In this case, in-house development may be an alternative. This approach is likely to be more expensive, however, and more difficult to support the long term, and thus should usually be avoided if possible. Were possible, the tool with the best fit should be purchased, and customized to meet the necessary requirements. Some additional considerations are outlined below:","Central vs. Distributed Control","Platform Constraints","Integration with other Functions","Anticipated Volume of Data & Transaction Throughput","Number of Users for the Tool","Level of Support Required","Installation","Oracle Database Installation","Overview","Assumptions","This portion of the present description assumes:","That the target hardware configuration for the database server meets the specified requirements for the software being installed.","Embodiments mentioned within this portion of the present description may not be current as of the time of this reading.

A general knowledge of these technologies is important as one builds your Membership site.","Directory Services and the Membership Directory","A directory service is a database that stores organizational data and is highly optimized for database lookups (reads). Directory services provide an index of users and network resources. Site Server 3.0 contains Microsoft's most recent directory service, the Membership Directory. It is the central repository for user data, including member accounts, permissions, and site resources. All directory services use LDAP as their communicating protocol. In the future Microsoft Windows\u00ae 2000 Server may implement the much-talked-about Active Directory, which may take the Membership Directory to the next level. The Active Directory may also be responsible for storing all the information needed for the Windows NT domain architecture.","Lightweight Directory Access Protocol","Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the underlying protocol used by Site Server Membership to communicate with the Membership Directory. LDAP was designed to be the standard Internet protocol for accessing directory services. LDAP runs on TCP\/IP networks and is independent of platform, allowing directory-based information to be shared across operating systems. Site Server Membership implements an LDAP service for reading and writing information to the Membership Directory database.","Active Directory Service Interfaces","As stated previously, the Membership Directory must be accessed using the LDAP protocol. Rather than making raw LDAP calls to the Membership Directory, Site Server Membership uses Active Directory Service Interfaces, better known as ADSI. ADSI provides a common standard interface to multiple directory services (through ADSI providers) and communicates with the directory services using LDAP. ADSI makes life easier by allowing the developer to write code to one API while working with multiple directory services.","Active User Object","Site Server provides the Active User Object (AUO) as a single component that aggregates all of a user's attributes from multiple Active Directory Service (ADS) providers. The primary provider is always the Membership Directory. The AUO is a COM object called membership.userobjects. It uses ADSI to retrieve a user's information from the Membership Directory and greatly simplifies the code a developer writes by automatically binding to the current user's information in the Membership Directory. The binding occurs when the component is created, but requires that the Web site be mapped to a Membership Server and that the user is authenticated.","Membership Directory Authentication","Authentication Choices","When one sets up a Membership Directory for a Web site, one must choose the type of authentication to be used. Membership may be set up to use Windows NT accounts (Windows NT Authentication) or accounts that reside solely in the Membership Directory database (Membership Authentication). Windows NT Authentication is most useful for intranet sites where one wish to leverage existing accounts and use the Windows NT Security Accounts Manager (SAM) for authentication. However, Membership Authentication is a good choice for Internet sites, especially sites in which the number of users may increase dramatically over time. As your user base grows, it is much easier to administer your accounts and privileges using Membership Authentication.","Since Integrated Direct Channel (IDC) uses Membership Authentication for the purposes mentioned above, further detail into that authentication method is discussed below:","Membership Server Mapping","It is important to note that Membership Authentication maps Membership groups to proxy Windows NT group accounts to determine a member's security permissions. One still has the benefit of the strong security of Windows NT and can administer security permissions for a Membership group by assigning permissions (ACLs) to the proxy account. For every group in the Membership Directory, Membership creates a corresponding Windows NT group called Site_directoryname_groupname, where directoryname is the name of the Membership Directory and groupname is the name of the Membership group.","Membership Authentication Configuration Options","Under Membership Authentication, there are also several options for configuration. There are four Security Support Providers available: 1) Automatic Cookie Authentication, 2) HTML Forms Authentication, 3) Distributed Password Authentication (DPA), and 4) Clear Text\/Basic Authentication. At all four of these levels, there is an Allow Anonymous option, which allows unrecognized users to access the site as a generic account called IUSR_[server_name].","1. Automatic Cookie Authentication","This method provides us with a quiet and discreet authentication method for both anonymous users and registered members. Cookie authentication issues two cookies\u2014SITESERVER and MEMUSER\u2014to store information on the user's computer. When this option is selected, the ISAPI (Internet Server Application Program Interface) filter (which was installed by the mapping of the Membership Server) parses the headers of the client and looks for the two cookies. There are three possibilities. If the cookies exist then the information found therein is used to authenticate and bind to a member. If the cookies are invalid then the member is redirected to an ASP page in the _mem_bin virtual directory. If the cookies don't exist then the ISAPI filter creates and binds to a new member in the Membership Directory, in the ou=AnonymousUsers container. Once bound to this user, two cookies are written to the browser. These two new cookies SITESERVER and MEMUSER may be used in future sessions to identify the member uniquely.","2. HTML Forms Authentication","To provide a more secure (but equally simple) form of authentication, we can use HTML Forms Authentication. This method of authentication uses HTTP's POST method to send the user's credentials to an ASP page, which handles the submission. The ASP page then makes use of a special COM object\u2014the VerifUser object\u2014to verify the user's credentials. HTML Forms Authentication also makes use of the ISAPI Membership Authentication filter. When a user makes a call to a page that uses HTML Forms Authentication, ISAPI traps that call and redirects to a special ASP page called FormsLogin.asp. This page is provided in the _mem_user virtual directory of the web application. FormsLogin.asp is nothing more than an asp page with form elements for user login name and password. Upon submission, the page redirects with the form elements to verifpwd.asp, which contains the script to verify a user's credentials. If the user is authenticated, the user is taken to the page s\/he was trying to access and issues a FormsAuth cookie in addition to the SITESERVER and MEMUSER cookies.","3. Distributed Password Authentication (DPA)","DPA works for Membership authentication in much the same way as Challenge\/Response works for Windows NT Authentication. For DPA, users are authenticated against the Membership Directory (rather than the Windows NT SAM database). Moreover, since the username and password are never sent across the wire, DPA is very secure. Unfortunately, it's only possible for Windows Internet Explorer clients to use DPA where usernames and passwords are hashed with a challenge sent by the server.","4. Clear Text\/Basic Authentication","When we select Basic Authentication, we authenticate any user that requests a resource against the credentials stored in the Membership Directory. We can specify extra information with the user, from which to authenticate users. But here lies a difference between Basic Authentication under Windows NT authentication and Basic Authentication under Membership Authentication: in the former case this extra information is in the form of a domain, and in the latter case the information represents sub-containers in the directory. The Clear Text\/Basic Authentication method is supported by a number of applications, including Netscpape, and most clients should be able to use it.","Other Considerations","DPA and Clear Text\/Basic Authentication can be selected simultaneously. In this case, the server may first attempt to issue a DPA authentication challenge. If (and only if) the client cannot interpret the challenge, the server may offer the Clear Text\/Basic Authentication request.","IDC and Membership Authentication","The Integrated Direct team used HTML Forms Authentication with anonymous support under certain circumstances for a few reasons. First of all, this authentication method provides an html interface as opposed to a pop up dialog box. This gives the application a more consistent look and feel since the FormLogin.asp page is customizable with graphics and layout. HTML Forms Authentication is also has no compatibility issues that DPA or Clear Text\/Basic Authentication methods may have. It is simply an html page, which posts form elements to another asp page, which contains authentication methods. Finally, HTML Forms Authentication issues one session essential cookie, the FormsAuth cookie. The use of one cookie makes user administration issues, such as session time and logout, simpler.","Description","This portion of the description provides the steps necessary to configure a workstation for use doing application or architecture development on a ReTA engagement.","Assumptions","This portion of the present description assumes:","That the target hardware configuration for the workstation meets the specified requirements for the software being installed.","Embodiments mentioned within this portion of the present description may not current as of the time of this reading.

Accordingly, no attempt is made to explain HTML concepts such as frames and tables.","Scope","These standards are intended to be independent of any particular hardware, operating system, or development tool. Due to the nature of the Internet, platform independent code is imperative.","This guide covers standards for HTML 2.0 and does not cover standards for HTML 3.2. This embodiment can be assumed to be \u201csafe\u201d for all Web browsers. However, HTML 3.0 and 3.0+ offer an extensive array of non-standard elements which enhances the presentation of a Web page. This guide may include tables and frames which are not fully supported by all browsers. Thus, when implementing tables or frames, it is important to consider your target audience and the type of browsers they may be using to surf the Internet.","There are a variety of tools to aid the authoring process of HTML. A HTML editing tool like WebEdit or a HTML template like Internet Assistant may not be consistent with our standards and guidelines. Projects using these HTML editors and converters are subject to the proprietary standards of their respective software applications.","Convention","In this guide, standards are presented as follows:","Text for rule or standard here.","The statement of one or more standards is usually followed by a discussion of the standard(s). Such a discussion may include justifications for using the particular rule, common alternatives, other supplementary information, or even situations where the standard may not apply.","Program Organization","Source Code","Organize source code as follows:","file comment block","<HTML>","<HEAD>","<TITLE>","<\/TITLE>","<HEAD>","<BODY>","insert body text","<\/BODY>","<\/HTML>","Defining a standard source file layout makes it easier to understand and maintain code written by other programmers.","File Names","HTML files adhere to the same naming and directory standards set forth by the Internet Center of Excellence (ICE). For more information, refer to the ICE portion of the present description on file naming and directory standards.","Programming Styles","HTML Tags","All HTML tags and attributes should be capitalized.","HTML is not case sensitive, however, to preserve readability, it is important to adhere to uppercase lettering for HTML tags.","However, some HTML editors, such as Microsoft FrontPage, generate lower-case HTML tages. Since more HTML editing may probably be done through similar tools, it does not make sense to have to go back through the code and make any changes. For this situation, simply adopt the format that your HTML tool generates, and make it consistent throughout your project.","All open tags must be terminated by an end tag.","Excluding tags such as <LI>, <HR>, <BR>, <IMG>, <META>, <BASE> and <P>, it is important to close a HTML tag with a <\/(tag name)>. For example, an open HTML tag is <HTML> and a closed HTML tag is <\/HTML>. Failure to close a HTML tag may cause undefined behavior with the appearance of the HTML page.","Do not skip levels of headings.","Headings should be not more than one level below the preceding heading level. For example, <H3> should not follow <H1>.","Use underline for hypertext links only.","Adhere to this standard to eliminate any confusion between a hypertext link and a text underlined for emphasis. To emphasize text, use the following tabs: <EM> for emphasis in italics, <STRONG> for text emphasis, <B> for bold and <I> for italics.","Employ the logical styles rather than physical styles.","Not all browsers are capable of displaying italics <I> or the boldface <B> tag. Physical styles indicate the specific appearance of individual words or sentences and include such tags as <B> for bold text, <I> for italic text, and <TT> typewriter text, e.g., fixed-width font. The following is a list of logical styles tags:","<CITE> for citation (e.g., HTML Coding Standards). Typically displayed in italics.","<CODE> for computer code (e.g., Enter <stdio.h> header file). Typically displayed in a fixed-width font.","<DFN> for definition (e.g., Guru means god-like). Typically displayed in italics.","<EM> for emphasis (e.g., It is advisable that one uses this than typing italics within a tag). Typically displayed in italics.","<KBD> for user keyboard entry (e.g., Enter passwd). Typically displayed in a fixed-width font.","<SAMP> for a sequence of literal characters (e.g., Segmentation fault: Core dumped). Typically displayed in a fixed-width font.","<STRONG> for strong emphasis (e.g., NOTE: This is a reminder). Typically displayed in bold.","<VAR> for a variable (e.g., rm filename deletes the file). Typically displayed in italics.","The use of <P> should be avoided directly before any other element which already implies a paragraph break.","The <P> element should not be placed before the headings, HR, ADDRESS, BLOCKQUOTE, or PRE.","It should also not be placed immediately before a list element of any stripe. That is, a <P> should not be used to mark the end-of-text for <LI>, <DT> or <DD>. These elements already imply paragraph breaks.","Investigate the possibility for using server-side includes for repeated blocks of HTML, such as footers and headers.","The server-side include tag allows one to keep one copy of a footer or header. Updating this one copy may update all portion of the present descriptions that reference it.","Investigate the Client's use of the <META> tag, which is used to help with searches and portion of the present description information.","The <META> tag provides a way to store information about the portion of the present description that is not available elsewhere in the portion of the present description. For example, the META tag can contain catalog, author, or index information that various search engines can use.","An example might be:","<HEAD>","<META NAME=\u201ckeywords\u201d CONTENT=\u201cHTML portion of the present description reference Netscape\u201d>","<\/HEAD>","This portion of the present description is indexed under the terms \u201cHTML\u201d, \u201cportion of the present description\u201d, \u201creference\u201d, and \u201cNetscape\u201d.","HTML Tag Parameters","Include HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes in all IMG tags.","Adhering to this standard may eliminate the problem when using JavaScript code in HTML portion of the present descriptions with IMG tags. Without the HEIGHT and WIDTH parameters in IMG tags, JavaScript event handlers are ignored on subsequent form elements and also images are not displayed on screen.

For these browsers and users, the ALT attribute specifies the text to be displayed instead of the image. For example, <IMG SRC=\u201caclogo.gif\u201dALT=\u201cAndersen Consulting logo\u201d>. If a Web browser cannot display aclogo.gif or a Web user wishes not to view the logo, the text \u201cCompany Logo\u201d may be displayed to screen instead.","Indicate a specific font size rather than incrementing it with the \u00b1.","Be careful when using the \u00b1 in the SIZE attribute in the FONT tags.

The rules and guiding principles have been chosen to support this goal. In cases with more than one acceptable alternative, one alternative has been chosen (more or less arbitrarily) rather than leaving it up to the individual programmer. The purpose of this is to ensure consistency in the source code. Note: Some of the rules are beneficial only if applied consistently. Apply them!","Coding Priorities","This portion of the description defines coding (and, to some extent, design) priorities on the various platforms. The first table defines the meaning of each priority item; the second table specifies their ranking on the three platforms.","Use these tables as a guide for resolving design and implementation issues.","In some cases, coding priorities are clearly opposed to one another. As an example, consider a choice of sorting algorithms. For simplicity and safety, there is nothing to beat the bubble sort\u2014it is simple enough that one can code it from scratch each time one needs it and still be fairly confident that it works correctly the first time. The problem is, the bubble sort is slow. Just about any other sorting algorithm may be faster; it may also be complex enough that one may need to crack a book to implement it.

Static variables are initialized and static initializer blocks are executed. This happens in the order they are listed, from top to bottom. Instance variables, instance initializer blocks and methods don't figure into this.","Note that static and instance initializer blocks are allowed in Java 1.1. Static initializer blocks are executed in order when the class is first instantiated; instance initializer blocks are executed in order after the superclass constructor runs, but before the class constructor runs.","Instance initializer blocks are executed whenever a class is instantiated. During object initialization (instance initialization), things happen in the following order: If this is the first time the class is instantiated, all the class (static) initialization takes place.","We enter a constructor. If we have not specified a constructor, a default constructor with no arguments is supplied automatically by the compiler.","The superclass constructor is called. If your constructor does not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor, the default (argument-less) superclass constructor is called anyway.","All instance variables are initialized and instance initializer blocks are executed.","This happens in the order they are listed, from top to bottom. Class variables, class initializer blocks and methods don't figure into this.","Use initializer blocks to perform any initialization that can't be performed by direct variable initialization; put each initializer block immediately following the variable in question.

The Netcentric Architecture Framework (NCAF) identifies those common, run-time services required when an application executes in a Netcentric environment. The services can be broken down into logical areas:","Presentation Services, Information Services, Communication Services,","Communication Fabric Services, Transaction Services, Environment Services, Base Services and Business Logic.","Execution architecture services typically provide either an interface between the application and some system component, or an interface connecting application components (for example a distribution service that allows client applications to execute server application transactions). The technology architecture assembly test focuses on testing the end-to-end function and quality of these execution architecture services.","The execution architecture components considered for Assembly test are:","Environment Services\u2014Application Services","Codes Table services: static data code-decode implementation","Common services: creation of ASP header file to provide common architecture constants and functions within application Active Server Pages","Information Services\u2014Database Services","Access: ADO Persistence layer","Presentation Services\u2014Web Browser","Form: UI Controls","Client-side field validation (JavaScript)","Client architecture file to provide common JavaScript functions (field validation, date validation, message boxes, etc.).

The purpose of the development architecture is to support the tasks involved in the analysis, design, construction, and maintenance of business systems, as well as the associated management processes.","The development architecture components considered for Assembly test are:","System Building Services\u2014Construction","Application developer coding templates for Active Server Pages, Activity, Sub-Activity, View, Mapping, Factory and Business Object.","Standards and Procedures","Operations Architecture","The Operations Architecture is a combination of tools, support services, procedures, and controls required to maintain a production system and keep it running efficiently.

In addition, each cycle may be run three times (i.e., three passes):","The objective of pass 1 is to get through the test as quickly as possible, finding as many defects as possible and implementing workarounds where needed.","The objective of pass 2 is to regression test the defects fixed from pass 1, and determine if the pass 1 workarounds caused any more defects.","The objective of pass 3 is to regression test defects fixed from pass 2; no defects should be found.","By planning three passes, regression tests can be built in to ensure that defects are completely fixed and the fixes did not break anything else.","It is important to note that the Technology Architecture Assembly Test Approach applies to both testing after normal construction and testing during \u201cfix-it\u201d or \u201cdebug\u201d mode. Technology architecture assembly testing for normal development may cover all interactions between the technology architecture components, while an assembly test in \u201cfix-it\u201d mode may cover only the interactions which apply to the fix [fixes] being implemented.","Risks","The risks and risk management approach for the Assembly Test stage are outlined below:","Concurrent development and configuration management","During the phase 1, there may be several simultaneous enhancement efforts. It may be essential to follow strict configuration management procedures in order to prevent version overwriting.","Mitigation Plan","All components to be modified should be checked out of the version control tool (Visual Source Safe) with a detailed label stating the change description and the developer's name. If separate enhancement efforts require the same file, developers should coordinate file control so not to overwrite the other's work.","Contingency Plan","Defects may be tracked during the Assembly Test. If a large number of defects are attributed to version mismatch or overwriting, the configuration management approach for development may be reevaluated. Additional resources may need to be added to the build and Assembly Test effort.","Scope of Test Effort","Since almost every module may be modified (due to name changes), there may need to be extensive assembly testing to ensure no functionality is broken.","Mitigation Plan","This Assembly Test approach relies on automation and reuse. There may be an effort to automate all Assembly Testing, so that it is easy to both execute the test and verify the expected results.","Contingency Plan","Defects may be tracked during the Assembly Test. If a large number of defects are found for modules, the approach to coding and component testing the modules may be reevaluated.","Regression Testing Approach","After a fix is put into the system, the fix is tested to ensure that it is correct. Other functions are \u201cregression\u201d tested in order to ensure that they were not adversely affected (broken) by the fix; this is regression testing. In general, the regression test should include all functions either directly or indirectly impacted by the fix and be executed during each pass.","At the end of each test stage, a clean test pass for that stage may be conducted. If non-critical errors do remain at the end of a test stage, the team leader for that stage must sign-off on their portion of the present description. The time required to execute the last test pass ought to be minimal, since the cycles should execute correctly.","The three pass approach for technology architecture assembly test may facilitate regression testing of defects found in the current test. In addition, the entire technology architecture assembly test model may be portion of the present descriptioned, repeatable and automated (where possible) in order to be easily re-executed for each pass.","For each code fix, a complete Assembly Test may be re-executed.

Each test and its accompanying test cycles may be designed to simulate varying user volumes.","Key Differences between Load, Stress and Performance Testing","For the purpose of this portion of the present description, Load, Stress and Performance Testing may be distinguished. It is important to understand the subtle differences amongst the three types of testing.","Load Testing","Load testing is used to subject a server to the load conditions that may be realized in a live production environment. This should enable the tester to make a more predictable assessment of the performance of a production system and thus eliminate much of the uncertainty. Load testing focuses on the number of users accessing the server, the combination of business transactions that are executed on the server, and the impact of the combination of users and transactions on different environment components.","Stress Testing","Stress testing extends the focus of the load test. Whereas load testing stresses the server to normal production levels to determine performance, stress testing focuses on locating the point at which server performance breaks down. This is achieved by steadily increasing the number of simulated users that execute a given transaction until a breaking point is reached. In addition, a variation of this test would be to execute a single transaction repeatedly for an extended period of time.","Performance Testing","Performance testing focuses on measuring performance for a specific transaction. The performance of a server should be measured under different user load conditions. For ReTA Phase 3 testing, cycles may be executed against both Oracle 8 Enterprise and Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 databases.","Testing Process","For each of the performance tests, the following process may be used to plan, execute, and evaluate the results of the tests:","Plan the Scenario","Determine the goal of the test such as the number of simulated users, the transactions to be performed and the transactions to be timed.","Record Web Scripts","Record the steps a user may take to complete a transaction with the application. The majority of automated testing tools available on the market offer recording capabilities for the tester to capture the various actions that make up a single transaction as the tester navigates through the application.","Define the Scenario","A list of virtual users has to be defined in each workstation that is used for testing.","The number of virtual users and the scripts to be used by each virtual user have to be set up before the scenario can be run.","Run the Scenario","Since the execution script is pre-recorded, simply clicking a button can run it. The testing tool may automatically launch all the virtual users and keep track of their test status. It should also record and measure the server response time as well as other statistics.","Analysis of Performance Graphs and Reports","After the scenario has completed its run, the performance graphs may be generated and shown to the tester automatically. The tester can then analyze the graphs and reports available. Graphs should be available that provide individual page averages, complete scenario execution times, and high\/low response times.","Testing Application","The application to be used during the ReTA Phase 2 Performance Tests provides three simple business and operational function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2016","num":"2249"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00156","num":"00156"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Functional Area","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Review\/Submit","This set of dialogs provides functionality for"]},{"entry":["Feedback","inputting and reviewing feedback.

It may discuss the selection approach, the product requirements, and the evaluation of the products, in order to obtain a final recommendation.  illustrates the end to end process associated with Performance Modeling. Components include Performance Modeling Analysis , Product Evaluation , and Tool Recommendation .","Net-Centric and other advanced computing paradigms have brought about an entirely new generation of advanced business applications. These distributed applications place tremendous demands on the network. Corporate computing networks must endure the effects of increased usage, multiple protocols, heterogeneous networking hardware and software, a variety of application performance profiles, and a distributed user base. Designing and implementing high performance applications on distributed networks today can be challenging. This is especially true in regions that are characterised by limited WAN bandwidth, generally poor communication infrastructures, and distributed environments, such as EMEAI.","Moreover, end-user performance expectations are becoming increasingly more demanding, requiring the network to be designed, sized, and managed with performance in mind. New networking technologies are claiming confusing performance characteristics. Technology industry benchmarks provide only minimal insight into true effective performance. Performance measurement standards are currently in a state of flux. And performance management tools themselves may provide only limited assistance in predicting and monitoring network performance. The result is a complicated situation for approaching, understanding, predicting, and analysing network performance in network intensive applications and computing infrastructures. This portion of the present description may identify the elements of network performance management, presents a network performance product evaluation, and outlines necessary network performance activities, strategies, and design considerations in order to produce a high level recommendation and implementation strategy.","Performance Management Principles","Basic Concepts","The term network performance management broadly covers many different concepts that are used to evaluate and improve the capabilities and utilization of network resources. This portion of the description provides a foundation for understanding network performance management concepts. Understanding and implementing these concepts promotes effective network performance management. Benefits of effective network performance management include:","Response time improvement","Reduction of telecommunications costs due to optimized line utilization","More flexibility in the application architecture","In order to achieve these benefits, effective network performance management requires the right application performance design, the right resources and technologies, and the right plans and approaches.","Network Performance Management involves several activities. These activities cover stages in the planning, designing, monitoring, analyzing, and tuning of networks.  illustrates the area  of Effective Network Performance Management that occurs where the right application performance design , the right resources and technologies , and the right plans and approaches 8806 overlap. Effective network performance management requires people, processes, tools and knowledge. Effective network performance management yields the optimal performance of network resources in order to meet the business needs.","Network Performance Management Tools are designed to simulate, test, monitor, and analyze the different elements of network performance. Tool functions, categories, limitations, and numerous products are discussed in detail later in this portion of the present description. Note that tools at best provide only a component to successful network performance management.","Performance Measurement involves the determination of network performance based on metrics, such as those defined later in this portion of the description. Performance measurements are often needed to verify performance level agreements are met and to analyze bottlenecks in the network operation. Note that no single tool today can provide comprehensive end-to-end measurement of all components in distributed client\/server networks. As there are a large number of components involved in today's corporate networks, detailed performance measurement can be both complicated as well as time consuming. This should be considered when defining performance agreements. Aids to performance measurement include software and hardware monitors.","A generic network performance analysis is presented towards the end of this portion of the description. This highlights the complexity involved in performance measuring.","Terms and Definitions","These terms describe network performance from a user perspective. A Bottleneck is the point in a system where capacity is lower than at surrounding points. In data communications networks there are normally multiple bottlenecks. A system or network is limited by the performance of the slowest bottleneck.","Price\/Performance Index is a general term used to define the performance characteristics of a component relative to the cost. Generally, performance is considered directly proportional to price, the better the performance the higher the price. With the range of WAN service alternatives and advanced technologies today, it could be beneficial to investigate this index in detail. When analyzing price\/performance indexes, it is important to have a clear definition of what performance is required. Often, performance increases more rapidly than price, thus a high performance ATM network may cost much less per megabit than a 64 Kbps X.25 connection. However, if only 64 Kbps of bandwidth is required, then the X.25 option may be much less expensive. For a given set of requirements there may normally be numerous options. The price of these options often varies widely depending on such factors as region and carrier strategy.","Response Time is the time from when the user presses a key to perform a function until the response appears on the screen. It is the cumulative result of all the individual response times of each of the network components, as well as the application and other components. Several network components are involved in aggregate response times. A response time analysis example below reveals the various factors of influence in a large client\/server banking application.","The following table illustrates an Engagement Response Time Analysis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2146","num":"2390"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00167","num":"00167"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"APPC","Service","APPC","Processing of",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"ACK","execution","ACK","the response"]},{"entry":["Startup","Load","delay","and","delay","and the LAN"]},{"entry":["of an","program","(from","message","(from","and"]},{"entry":["OS\/2","from","CICS to","transport","gateway)","workstation","GUI"]},{"entry":["Session","disk","gateway)","time","to CICS)","Level","display"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["9%","26%","7%","30%","7%","12%","9%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Reliability refers to the probability that a system may not fail during a given time.

Likewise scheduled outages of shared network resources can also be significant. On any network, it is difficult to notify all users of all scheduled outages. Thus, for these users scheduled downtime is effectively unscheduled downtime. Also, many users or applications may not be willing or able to alter their schedules to that of the network. Therefore, availability should be analyzed in terms of both the unscheduled unavailability as well as the scheduled unavailability.","The number of users affected and the business impact of affecting those users should also be considered. If the area of impact is limited to a single workgroup, then outages may be more acceptable than for an entire office.","Network Terms","These terms describe the performance qualities of various network components.","Bandwidth is the rated speed of communications lines or links, normally expressed in bits per second (bps). This is typically the first factor that is considered in network performance management. A lack of adequate bandwidth decreases response times. Bandwidth is also referred to as line speed or, as a general term, the capacity of the system.","The following table outlines the bandwidth of common WAN links:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2159","num":"2403"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00168","num":"00168"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Bandwidth in"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Bandwidth in Bits","Bytes per Second"]},{"entry":[{},"Class","per Second (bps)","(Bps)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"T1","1.544 M","193 K"]},{"entry":[{},"E1","2.048 M","256 K"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In the table Mbps refers to one million bits per second and KBps refers to one thousand bytes per second. Performance analysis generally first requires converting bandwidths between bits and bytes to analyze application data throughput.","Latency is typically the second most important quality considered after bandwidth in performance analysis. Latency is the time delay from delivery of the first bit of the packet to the network until the receipt of the last bit of the packet at the destination. A satellite link may have a line speed of 512 Kbps, but a latency of half a second. This means that it takes half a second for a signal to travel from the sender to the satellite and then to the receiver. From a performance standpoint, latency may add a delay in the response time of all applications. Latency is particularly important to consider in interactive applications. In batch applications the latency may not be as critical. If a packet crosses the network in a relatively short period of time, it is said to have low latency. High latency occurs when packets take long periods to cross a network. Latency is also referred to as propagation delay and network response.","Latency is often dependent on the type of data that is being transmitted. Data can be broken up into two types: isochronous and plesiochronous. Isochronous data has a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and must be transmitted through regular discreet intervals such as voice and video. Plesiochronous data is not constant; it has a Variable Bit Rate (VBR). Examples of this type include file transfers and most types of LAN traffic. Note that although a voice transmission requires minimal bandwidth, it has a constant bit rate requiring low latency.","Serialization is a network quality that reveals the degree to which low bandwidth can cause high latency. When a network device, such as a switch or a router receives a packet, it reads in the whole packet then processes and forwards it. Low speed links may cause a delay, as the network device has to read in the packet in serial, process it, and then send it out in serial. In higher speed links, devices may be able to process packets faster, with less of a delay. Small packet sizes may also decrease the time it takes to read in a packet. This serialization is the delay that is caused while reading and sending the packet.","The following equation outlines the serialization time for a single link",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2165","num":"2409"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"ST","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"8","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u00d7","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":[{"mi":["bits","Byte"],"mo":"\/"},{"mi":["Bytes","Packet"],"mo":"\/"}],"mi":["Number","of"]},"mi":"BW"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-2","num":"00002.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"ST","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["Serialization","Time"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-3","num":"00002.3"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"BW","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["Bandwidth","in","bits","per","second"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}}}]},"For example, the serialization time for a 512 byte packet is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2167","num":"2411"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00169","num":"00169"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Serialization Time",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Bandwidth","(ST)","ST in seconds"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"9600 bps","427 milliseconds",".4 seconds"]},{"entry":[{},"64 Kbps","62.5 milliseconds",".06 seconds"]},{"entry":[{},"1.544 Mbps","2.65 milliseconds",".003 seconds"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Serialization delay is more notable when a packet travels through multiple network devices (routers) to reach its destination.

line speeds are generally much slower than processor speeds, the serialization delay at each node is a major component of network latency. Fragmenting user data into small packets introduces pipelining if packets pass through several nodes.","Pipelining is when multiple devices are each working on a part of the transfer. For example, multiple switches are simultaneously working on a different packet in the file transfer. This improves end-to-end response time, because the switches are working in parallel.","The calculations above assume that the time for the switch to process the packet is effectively zero. Although the line speeds are typically much less than the processing speeds, this assumption may not be valid for some environments. The processing time is normally different for different packet sizes. It takes longer to process larger packets.","Serialization delay can be a significant factor in designing large internetworks. There are different ways of decreasing serialization delays:","Decrease packet size","Increase bandwidth between switches","Increase bandwidth between customer equipment and switch","Decrease number of \u201chops\u201d","Note that serialization can occur in switches as well as in any other devices that processes packets, such as routers or gateways. Serialization delays should be considered early in the network design phase.","Packet, Frame, Cell, Message, and Protocol Data Unit (PDU) all define a \u201cfragment\u201d of data. When applications send data across the network, the data is broken up into manageable pieces. Each of these terms describe these fragments.

Each of the data packets must contain addressing and other control information. From a performance perspective, this additional information is generally referred to as overhead.

As shown below this can result in a significant amount of overhead. Each layer adds a header and possibly a trailer that contains information for the corresponding layer at the destination.  illustrates an example of overhead introduced at lower layers. Such layers include an application layer , a presentation layer , a session layer , a transport layer , a network layer , a data link layer , and a physical layer .","Inter-packet Gap is the time lapse between the sending of packets on the network. When data is packaged and overhead addressing and control data added, it is possible to send packets independently of other packets. The delay between sending packets is referred to as the inter-packet gap. Some protocols mandate delays between packets. From a performance perspective, this delay is considered negative.","For example, Ethernet requires that after a packet is transmitted by any station on the network, every station must wait a random amount of time before it can transmit. If there are many stations on the network and two stations wait the same amount of time, a collision may occur when they both try to transmit. The collision may force all stations to wait again, thus degrading performance. The effective throughput of Ethernet is therefore much less than its rated bandwidth of 10 Mbps.","Traffic Profile refers to the combination of protocols and applications that a network supports. The traffic profile has significant effects on network performance. For example, batch file transfers typically do not perform well when mixed with voice over the network. Large batch file transfers tend to require much of the available bandwidth. Voice communication only requires a small portion of the bandwidth, but continuously. If a file transfer is delayed by a second, the effect is negligible. However, if a voice communication has even short delays, it is disconcerting to the users. Traffic profile is also referred to as traffic mix.","Packet Size is the length of each packet. Generally, it is a configurable parameter. This includes both a data portion and an overhead portion. Overhead is generally a fixed size for each packet, thus larger packets have a lower proportion of overhead. Packet size also has other performance effects. To lower the overhead proportion, the largest packet size should be used. However, there are several reasons for using a smaller packet size, such as to decrease the serialization delay. There are many other factors influencing the optimal packet size.","Message Size is the length of messages sent by the applications. For example, an interactive terminal application normally sends relatively short messages, each consisting of a single keystroke, whereas a client\/server file transfer application might send larger messages each consisting of a portion of the file. Ideally, from a performance perspective, message size should be configured to fit within the data area of the packet size or integer multiples of the size of the data area.","The message size has a direct affect on performance and response time. It is normally a configurable parameter within the application accessing the network. Identifying the optimal message size for an application and network is a key activity in performance management. The example below illustrates the effect message size and number of users has on response time.","Effective Throughput is the \u201ctrue\u201d bandwidth that is available to an application after all the overhead, inter-packet gaps, and other factors are considered. The effective throughput can be used to identify the performance of different components. For example, the effective throughput of an Ethernet LAN is different from the effective throughput of a file transfer over an Ethernet LAN. Effective throughput is always much lower than the rated bandwidth. The effective throughput of Ethernet and FDDI are much lower than their rated bandwidth as illustrated in the table below. Note that the effective throughput is dependent on the network configuration, however, these numbers represent an average.

For example, one test of an FTP file transfer over a shared Ethernet provided only 15% effective throughput versus rated bandwidth.","When discussing bandwidth and other performance related terms it is important to clearly define them and obtain agreement between project members and client. For example, it should be determined if the client is referring to absolute bandwidth, the effective throughput of the media service, the effective throughput of the application, or something else.","The \u201cabsolute\u201d bandwidth of FDDI is 250 Mbps. Theoretically, this is accurate, because the actual clock speed of FDDI is 125 MHz. Each of the two FDDI rings can be used simultaneously, making it possible to send 250 Mbps. However, FDDI is commonly said to have a bandwidth of 100 Mbps. This is because only one ring is used in practice to transfer data and 25% of that is overhead.

The applications should be considered when analyzing network performance requirements. Applications can be designed to make optimal use of the network. This chapter offers unique application considerations for several network intensive applications.","Effective throughput of the applications, user response time, and availability are key factors in analyzing network performance. These factors determine how the business user views the performance of the network. Most other performance characteristics may be attributes of these factors.","Observations","The following general observations should be considered about performance management.","Effective network performance management can be a complicated process. Networks using the same technologies, the same standards, and the same designs can have three different performance profiles. Each client therefore has a unique situation to address performance.","A key success criteria is to mutually understand the terms, concepts, and issues. Network performance is often defined by many different terms and benchmarks. These terms and benchmarks are often defined by vendors attempting to differentiate their products. Likewise, the performance issues can be complicated and it is valuable to have client awareness.","Network performance management is an iterative process. The optimal network configuration may change as the applications, network usage, technologies, and procedures change. Network performance management must be ongoing before, during, and after installation. Any change to network applications or usage can greatly influence network performance.","Identifying \u201cbottlenecks\u201d is a key to obtaining maximum network performance.","The OSI Reference Model can be used to understand how each of the layers adds another level of overhead.","Client awareness of potential performance issues early in the engagement is key to providing effective network performance management.","ReTA Product Evaluation","Network performance management tools provide various performance planning, designing and managing capabilities. These tools range from extremely complex to rudimentary in functions and operations. Tools from all network performance management categories and complexity levels are presented in this portion of the description.","State of the Market","Legacy systems performance management tools are relatively well developed and provide a robust set of tools that manage all aspects of mainframe systems and communication networks. However, these existing legacy tools do not provide the same capabilities today for distributed networks supporting client\/server and multimedia applications. It is important to understand the tool market before selecting an NPM tool. The state of the tool market can be summarized as follows:\n\n","There are several network performance management related tools on the market today. The top four tool categories are: network traffic analysis , drawing and documentation , baseline and discovery , and modeling and simulation .  illustrates how the four tool categories relate to each other.","Network Traffic Analysis","A traffic analysis tool provides insight into the traffic patterns on a data network. It collects data, analyzes it, decodes the information and summarizes information in graphical and\/or report format.","Recommendation","A protocol analyzer is the most versatile type of network analysis tool. It is a key tool for network baselining, testing, troubleshooting, and monitoring. Every Network Solutions analyst and consultant should be familiar with and have access to this type of tool. Software based protocol analyzers do not require any specialized hardware and therefore are economical enough for a wide distribution within the global Network Solutions practice.","Sniffer Basic from Network Associates is the best software based protocol analyzer evaluated for this project. It provides a full range of features and had the most detailed decode and filtering features of the tools tested. Its user interface is both user friendly and elegant. The same user interface may be used for the next release of Network Associates' high-end protocol analyzer Sniffer Pro, which is the most widely used protocol analyzer. Personnel may be able to build protocol analysis skills while using Sniffer Basic, which may be directly transferable to Sniffer Pro, the analyzer they are most likely to encounter at a client site. In addition Network Associates offers upgrade protection for Sniffer Basic so that in those situations where a higher-end tool is required, it can be upgraded to Sniffer Pro without sacrificing the investment in Sniffer Basic. Sniffer Basic should be purchased in quantities so that a copy can be loaned to Network Solutions projects that request a copy.","Tivoli from IBM is the first real enterprise security solution allowing the consistent definition, implementation and enforcement of security policy across the entire network computing environment\u2014from data center to the desktop. In all the tools tested, Tivoli takes the most hands-off approach to native operating system security however, customization is required based on the size of one's infrastructure. Tivoli from IBM offers a full range of product that gather control over system resources (files, directories and system processes) in adds them into a common database, which is abstracted from the host operating system.","Optimal's Application Expert is a unique product that can significantly increase the speed at which application benchmark and performance testing can be accomplished. It can be used to quickly capture all of the application data needed for network capacity and performance analysis. It also provides a simple analytical response time prediction and \u201cwhat-if\u201d features. Application Expert is a focused tool that would only be used during the testing phase of a project.","Baselining and Discovery","Baselining and discovery tools are used to get information about the current state of an existing network for a network baseline. Baseline analysis is starting point for all types of network analysis. It can be used to determine the \u201cnormal\u201d state of the network, as a benchmark to analyze troubleshooting data against, a reference point for historical trend analysis and a source of network portion of the present description. Baselining tools generally collect network traffic statistics and produce reports which can be used for network portion of the present description, troubleshooting, simulation and management. Discovery tools generally collect network topology and inventory information in the form of graphical, textual, or mathematical representations of the network. They are used to populate network drawings, create network models for simulation and generate inventory data. Baselining and discovery tools collect data about the status of network from varying sources including remote monitoring agents, traffic analysis tools, network management platforms, inventory tools and directly from the network.","Recommendation","Because most of these tools are tied to specific tools in other tool categories, the recommendation in this category is driven by the recommendations in the other categories. Comnet Baseliner and Optimal Surveyor are both associated with simulation tools. They promise help to create more accurate network models in less time, which would justify their purchase with the associated simulation tool. However, since a simulation tool has not been recommended for the networking tool kit these tools can not be recommended at this time either. NetSuite Professional Audit is a very competent discovery tool but due to its price and the lack of versatility of its associated drawing tool it is not recommended for the networking tool kit.","Modeling and Simulation","Modeling and simulation tools create a mathematical model of a network from models of network components. A simulation engine then uses statistical representations of workload as inputs to the model and performs calculations to simulate the network over a period of time. These tools are used to test the viability of new network designs, troubleshoot existing networks and predict the effects of changes to existing networks.","Network modeling and simulation is a very important function that allows network designers to analyze the performance of applications running on a network before networking hardware or application software is purchased or implemented. It decreases the risk for implementation of new network applications by giving designers and decision makers accurate information about how new applications or design changes may effect the performance of the network. As the demand for business critical client\/server and intranet applications grows, so may the demand for network simulation. It is important to develop the skills and processes needed for cost effective network simulation so that it is ready to meet the demand of clients as they grow.","Consulting firms are in a unique position to leverage these expensive network simulation tools and the skilled employees required to use them across many client IT projects thus driving the cost of these services down to a level that allows simulation to become viable for a wide range of IT projects.","The recommendation in this tool category is dependent on how the tool is used and what type of distribution is planned for it. The first alternative is to use the tool to supplement and speed the capacity analysis that is already being done on most projects. This type of use would dictate a wide distribution to a large number of analysts and consultants. The key characteristics of a tool for this use would be versatility, ease of use, laptop compatibility and economical price. Analytical modeling tools come close to this description but none of the tools evaluated would be well suited to this type of distribution due to high price and limited network and traffic modeling functionality. A second alternative is to use the tool to build deep simulation skills within the practice and provide new simulation and modeling services to our client services profile. This type of usage would dictate the use of a robust discrete events simulation tool for accuracy and detailed results. Due to the complexity of the discrete events simulation tool distribution, a core group of skilled users would be required to provide these services. The most important characteristics for a tool under this scenario would be accuracy, size of the component model library and capability to import network data from other tools.","The most benefit can be derived from the second alternative expanding the service offerings of Network Solutions to include Network Simulation. This approach would lend it self to the selection of a discrete events simulation tool that is accurate and capable of modeling a wide range of networks like Comnet III or Opnet Planner. However to successfully leverage this type of tool, deep skills in simulation, which take time to grow, would be necessary. It is not cost effective to buy an expensive tool of this type up front. To bridge the knowledge gap, relationships should be built and leveraged with one or more tool vendors to provide simulation services and experience for project teams while the deep skills necessary for effective use of these tools are developed internally. These tools can then be reevaluated from a skilled user's perspective within the framework of client services offerings.","Development of a core skills group to develop deep simulation skills, processes and client services would be an appropriate step. Group members would be responsible for the selection and maintenance of tools to provide simulation services. As well as developing modeling and simulation processes and methodologies. Formalization of a simulation skill group would enable greater communication between team members for sharing of experience and techniques which would lead to the development of deeper skills. It would also provide a formal channel for assessment of simulation skills. The focus of the skills team would diminish the need for ease of use and hardware compatibility allowing the team to choose an industrial strength simulation tool.","ReTA Tool Summary","For performance-modeling and network management purposes, one wants to be able to produce meaningful reports that describe how a metric is trending relative to a baseline, as discussed earlier on in this portion of the present description. For the most critical services elements one may examine such report every day or once a week. Time may not allow one to verify every measured element with such frequency, so one needs some mechanism by which one is alerted when a particular metric has changed in a significant manner. This is achieved by means of thresholds and alarms. A threshold is a baseline set to a level of the metrics at which one wants to become aware of trends in the metric.","When a threshold is exceeded, one wants to be notified by means of an alarm, e-mail, page or other \u201cpushed\u201d indicators. SNMP has the capability to send traps from devices in a network to a network management system. This is normally used to notify when a line is down or a specific device is not responding, however is can also send alerts when a certain device is not responding.","Other mission critical functions when selecting proper performance tools for any given infrastructure are:","Easy to use\/easy to deploy","Report Generating","Proactive Management","Remote Management","Traffic Monitoring","Node Monitoring","Server Management","Scalability","Focus was given to the top two performance modeling products.","The products selected above are recognized as the best currently available.
