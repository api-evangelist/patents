title: System and method for webtier providers in a cloud platform environment
abstract: Described herein is a system and method for supporting a webtier provider in a cloud computing environment. In accordance with an embodiment, the service types made available in a cloud platform (e.g., CloudLogic) domain can include information which describes dependency on a webtier provider, which in turn provides load-balancing capability to a service whose deployment may span multiple virtual machines. A webtier provider can associate one or more provisioned services with a webtier runtime, to satisfy the webtier dependency of a service. After a service is provisioned, a webtier provider service management engine (SME) can associate the service with a webtier runtime by creating a configuration therein. The webtier runtime can subsequently provide a single point of access to the service, including load-balancing requests to service nodes, or providing support for additional capabilities such as failure detection and failover.

Generally, a cloud computing model enables some of those responsibilities which previously may have been provided by an organization's own information technology department, to instead be delivered as service layers within a cloud environment, for use by consumers (either within or external to the organization, according to the cloud's public\/private nature).","As an illustrative example, a cloud computing model can be implemented as Platform as a Service (PaaS), in which consumers can use software programming languages and development tools supported by a PaaS provider to develop, deploy, and otherwise control their own applications, while providers manage or control other aspects of the cloud environment (i.e., everything below the run-time execution environment). In addition, the providers can provide support to satisfy a service's infrastructural requirements.

Described herein are a variety of hardware and\/or software components and features, which can be used in delivering an infrastructure, platform, and\/or applications to support cloud computing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","20","60","70","15"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, each of the IaaS, PaaS, and\/or SaaS layers can generally include a variety of components. For example, in accordance with an embodiment, the IaaS layer can include a shared database hardware (e.g., an Exadata machine), and\/or shared application server hardware (e.g., an Exalogic machine); while the PaaS layer can include one or more PaaS services, such as a database service, application server service, and\/or WebCenter service; and the SaaS layer can include various SaaS services, such as enterprise applications (e.g., Oracle Fusion SaaS), and\/or ISV or custom applications. The cloud environment can also include a shared enablement and managing infrastructure , which provides enablement and management tools that support the various service layers, for example, identity management, virtual assembly builder, system provisioning, tenant management, or other components.","In accordance with an embodiment, the cloud environment can include a PaaS platform component  (referred to herein in some embodiments as a PaaS platform, or CloudLogic), which enables the provisioning of enterprise software applications within the environment. For example, the PaaS platform can be provided as an installable software suite that provides a self-service provisioning experience for enterprise applications such as Fusion Middleware (FMW).","As shown in , in accordance with an embodiment, the PaaS platform can include one or more service definition package (SDP) , service management engine (SME) , virtual assembly (VA) , PaaS administration server , service domain  including one or more service applications (apps)  for use by one or more cloud accounts or tenants , and\/or elasticity manager  components.","The example shown in  is provided as an illustration of an exemplary cloud environment and PaaS platform. In accordance with other embodiments, different and\/or other types or arrangements of components can be included.","In accordance with an embodiment, the following terms are used herein.","PaaS Platform Component (PaaS Platform, Platform, CloudLogic): In accordance with an embodiment, a PaaS platform component is an installable software suite that provides a self-service provisioning experience for enterprise applications, such as FMW or other enterprise applications.\n\nSite: In accordance with an embodiment, a site is the entity created and configured by the Platform Administrator from a PaaS platform installation, which tenants and Platform Administrators interact with to perform the various operations in the platform. In accordance with an embodiment, a site can be implemented as a WebLogic domain.\n\nTenant: In accordance with an embodiment, a tenant (referred to herein in some embodiments as an account) is an entity that is associated with users that consume the platform as a service, and establishes an administrative scope that administrators use to access PaaS services. For example, a tenant can be created for an organization, department, or group. Roles such as Tenant Administrator can be associated with a tenant; and quotas can be assigned to a tenant. A tenant can create one or more environments, and have one or more sub-tenants. Consumed resources, such as services with their virtual machines, databases, DNS entries, load balancer and other configurations, can be associated with a tenant.\n\nSub-tenant: In accordance with an embodiment, a sub-tenant is an entity that exists under a tenant. A sub-tenant has a quota assigned from the overall tenant's quota. For example, a tenant can have one or more sub-tenants, and the Tenant Administrator can assign a quota from the overall tenant quota to each sub-tenant. A sub-tenant can create one or more environments.\n\nService Definition Package: In accordance with an embodiment, a service definition package (SDP) is a package that contains the information necessary for a particular type of service to be offered by the PaaS platform. For example, each type of FMW service can provide its own SDP. An SDP can contain custom code that is installed into the cloud platform, and a virtual assembly that contains the topology and configuration of a set of virtual appliances that will comprise a running instance of the service, upon being deployed onto a set of virtual machines (VMs).\n\nService Management Engine: In accordance with an embodiment, a service management engine (SME) provides a generic means to plug any service type into the system. For example, an SME takes care of the service-specific provisioning, lifecycle, management, and monitoring support for a service type or provider type.\n\nService Type: In accordance with an embodiment, a service type is a representation of software functionality that can be instantiated within the PaaS platform site for a tenant. A service type is created based on an SDP, with additional configuration information supplied by the Platform Administrator. Some of this configuration information may supply values that are specific to an installation of the PaaS platform product or the enterprise in which it is running; while some configuration information may reflect the Platform Administrator's choices of options supported by the SDP. Multiple service types can be created from a single SDP, by making different configuration choices.\n\nEnvironment: In accordance with an embodiment, an environment is a collection of services and their associated providers that are managed together as a group. An environment can be created for the purpose of running an application or providing some higher level service. Environments provide the ability to operate on the collection of services as a whole, with operations such as start, stop, backup, and destroy. An environment provides the functions of an association group, and a management group.\n\nService: In accordance with an embodiment, a service is an instantiation of a service type. An environment can be associated with multiple services; and within a particular tenant there can be one or more environments with multiple services for a single service type. Typically, a service provides both a service administration interface, and an end-user interface. A service can be associated with identity, database, or other service features that are required by the service; and with a service runtime that runs on one or more VMs.\n\nProvider Type: In accordance with an embodiment, a provider type is a special form of service type that supports providers instead of services. Provider types are created by the Platform Administrator in the same way as service types. As with service types, a provider type is created based on an SDP, with additional configuration information supplied by the Platform Administrator. Some of this configuration information may supply values that are specific to this installation of the PaaS platform product or the enterprise in which it is running; while some configuration information may reflect the Platform Administrator's choices of options supported by the SDP. Multiple provider types can be created from a single SDP, by making different configuration choices.\n\nProvider: In accordance with an embodiment, a provider is a specialization of a service. Unlike services, which are created by explicit action of a Tenant Administrator, providers are created on-demand to satisfy the dependencies of services. A provider is an instantiation of a provider type, and represents the use of the resource managed by the provider type by a particular instance of a service type. Services can be associated with multiple providers. When creating a service, an orchestration engine matches the requirements of a service type with the capabilities of the configured provider types, and then requests the service type to create an instance of a service, and the provider types to create instances of the providers for use by this instance of the service. The orchestration engine then associates the service with the providers.\n\nAssociation Resource: In accordance with an embodiment, an association resource (sometimes referred to as a provider resource) enables a service to keep track of configuration information for a particular association. For example, if a Java Service is associated with two different database providers, it may need to create a connection pool for each database. The association resource enables the Java Service to keep track of which connection pool is associated with which database, so that, if the orchestration engine needs to change one of the associations, the Java Service will know which connection pool to change.\n\nRuntime: In accordance with an embodiment, a runtime is a representation of the installed and operational software that provides the functionality of a service or a provider. Runtimes are managed by the custom code included in an SDP, in some instances using facilities provided by the PaaS platform, such as its virtualization and provisioning support. Runtimes can be layered, with each layer being shared (multi-tenant), or not shared (dedicated). For example, with a Java Service, the runtime layers may include an application server, a Java virtual machine (JVM), a guest operating system (OS), and a host operating system. When unqualified, the expression \u201cservice runtime\u201d generally refers to the top-most layer. For example, a multi-tenant service runtime is a runtime that is shared by multiple services; while a dedicated service runtime is a runtime that is not shared among multiple services.\n\nService Resource Type: In accordance with an embodiment, a service resource type is a special form of service type that supports service resources instead of services. Service resource types are created by the Platform Administrator in the same way as service types. As with service types, a service resource type is created based on an SDP, with additional configuration information supplied by the Platform Administrator. Multiple service resource types can be created from a single SDP, by making different configuration choices.\n\nService Resource: In accordance with an embodiment, a service resource is a specialization of a service. Unlike services, which are created by explicit action of a Tenant Administrator, and providers which are created on-demand to satisfy the dependencies of services, service resources are associated with services to satisfy the dependencies of artifacts\/applications deployed to services. A service resource can be associated, or disassociated, with a service after the service has been created. A service resource dependency of a service is optional and may be configured by the Platform or Tenant Administrator based on the needs of the artifacts\/applications that would be deployed to the service. For example, a service may indicate support for multiple kinds of service resource dependencies; and the Platform or Tenant Administrator may associate multiple service resources for a dependency. A service resource is an instantiation of a service resource type, and represents the use of the infrastructure managed by the service resource type, by a particular instance of a service type. A Service can be associated with one or more service resources. The association of a service to a service resource can happen at any time in the lifecycle of the service, once the service and service resource have been created.\n\nQuota: In accordance with an embodiment, a quota provides a mechanism to limit consumption of a resource, by establishing an upper bound on the resource usage. Examples of quota-controlled resources include CPU, disk, and the number of VMs in use. PaaS layer quotas can also be supported, for example the number of services that can be provisioned. Quotas can be assigned to tenants, and a Tenant Administrator can allocate their quota to projects or groups which they manage.\n\nNamespaces: In accordance with an embodiment, the PaaS platform can use a naming hierarchy, such as a Nimbula-style naming hierarchy and multipart naming scheme. There can be reserved namespaces for SDPs, service-types, provider-types, service-resource-types, service-resources, environments, and services. Namespaces can be defined and reserved at the global level, and per tenant.\n\nPlatform Administrator\/System Administrator (Role): In accordance with an embodiment, a Platform or System Administrator is responsible for installing, configuring, managing, and maintaining the PaaS platform infrastructure and environment, including the resources that are made available to applications running in the environment. The Platform or System Administrator is also responsible for downloading and installing SDPs to support additional service types, setting up or configuring virtualization technology for the platform to use, and installing and configuring providers.\n\nCloud Account Administrator (Role): In accordance with an embodiment, a Cloud Account Administrator is responsible for the provisioning of new services, management of generic service properties such as their Quality of Service (QoS) settings and their associations, and the locking and termination of services. A Cloud Account Administrator can assign Service Administrators for each service.\n\nTenant Administrator (Role): In accordance with an embodiment, a Tenant Administrator is responsible for creating sub-tenants and assigning Tenant Administrator to the sub-tenant groups, and for the provisioning of new services, management of generic service properties, and the locking and termination of services. A Tenant Administrator can assign Service Administrators for each service.\n\nService Administrator (Role): In accordance with an embodiment, a Service Administrator is responsible for administering and managing a specific service after it has been provisioned. A Service Administrator interacts with the service's administration interface to perform administration and management operations.\n\nService Runtime Administrator (Role): In accordance with an embodiment, a Service Runtime Administrator is responsible for configuring and managing service runtimes.\n\nApplication Deployer (Role): In accordance with an embodiment, an Application Deployer deploys an application to the provisioned service, and is responsible for installing, configuring, and running the application. Once the application is running, it can be made available to an End User.\n\nEnd User (Role): In accordance with an embodiment, an End User is the user of the applications that are deployed to the service. The End User interacts with the user interface provided by the application running in the service. If the service itself provides an interface for users to consume the functionality that it exposes, then the End User can use that service's interface.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["108","120","121","122","124"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, the PaaS administration server can be implemented as a WebLogic (WLS) server application, together with, e.g., Glassfish modules embedded therein to provide cloud platform functionality. A service domain, including a service app and service console , can be provided for housing enterprise applications, such as FMW applications, that will ultimately service user requests. In accordance with an embodiment, the service domain components may be instantiated multiple times as part of provisioning requests.","In accordance with an embodiment, provider server types that will be used by the PaaS administration server and the service domain, examples of which include LDAP , database , and Web tier  or load-balancer  providers, can be provided in pools that are not provisioned by the administration server, but are external services registered with the cloud environment. In accordance with an embodiment, the PaaS platform can make use of a load-balancer provider to forward all incoming, e.g., Web requests, that are directed to the services. For example, each service can be associated with a virtual host name that will be registered with the load-balancer provider during service provisioning.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["141","140","142","143","144"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["150","151","152"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, some service types may support both dedicated and multitenant uses, based on their particular configuration. Other service types may support either only dedicated use, or only multitenant use. Service types that are able to support multiple tenants on the same runtime can provision their runtimes in a multitenant manner, during the instantiation process, based on the configuration of the service type. A single instantiated service runtime that has been marked as multitenant-capable will be reused for a finite number of additional service provisioning requests, as determined by the service type and based on its configuration. Generally, it is left to the service application to support a particular tenancy mode; service applications that are not multitenant will only be able to support a single account for each service instance. Once a service has been instantiated from its VM assembly, end users  can interact with the system and the instantiated services, in the same manner as they would interact with an on-premise version of that service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["160","170","162","164","166","173","180","183","184","182","174","181"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, users can either be managed within an identity store  managed by the PaaS platform, or alternatively can be provided from an external, e.g., corporate LDAP, or other means of user identification; and can access the cloud account manager through an administration interface . Account and configuration data can also be stored on a file system or other means of storage that is accessible from nodes of a CPAS cluster.","Service Definition Package (SDP)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["192","196","193","197","194","198","195","199"]},"For example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, each SDP can include an assembly, reference, package, archive, or template, which can be used to install a service on a particular virtualization provider (e.g., OVAB); an assembly bundled within the SDP or a reference to an assembly (e.g., an EC2-specific reference); a service management engine (SME) plugin for the service type, which enables platform functionality such as elasticity metric gatherers, or alerts to be used with the service; a plugin for use with a VAB deployer (e.g., OVAB Deployer) during its assembly rehydration process; and other dependency and configuration information, such as scalability limits or whether the service is a multitenant or dedicated service.","In accordance with an embodiment, installing an SDP will install, e.g., the OVAB assembly into the OVAB repository; appropriate SME plugins will be registered with the cloud platform; and metric gatherers, alerts and actions will be installed in the PaaS platform. After a System Administrator installs the SDP, a Cloud Account Administrator can then use a cloud account administration interface to request for a service of that type.","In accordance with an embodiment, when an SDP is installed into a PaaS platform domain, it is consumed by an SDP Manager , which is responsible for obtaining a list of SDPs available to be installed the local system, downloading an SDP if necessary, installing parts of the SDP into the right places, maintaining a list of those SDPs that have been installed, and, if necessary, uninstalling an SDP by uninstalling all of its parts from the places they were previously installed.","In accordance with an embodiment, the SDP manager can interface with other system components by installing an SME plugin to the CPAS, which can then take responsibility for replicating the SME plugin to other CPAS instances in the cluster, installing the VAB assembly ,  into the VAB deployer, interfacing with other tools such as Enterprise Manager to provide a customized console interface for the service if the service provides one, and installing configuration data for the service into the CPAS. Subsequently, during realization  of a service, the service  can be realized as an instance of those service types defined by the SDP and installed as assemblies in the VAB repository.","Service Management Engine (SME)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"In accordance with an embodiment, each service type supported in the PaaS platform domain maps to a specific service SME. A service SME handles all service-related activities, such as creation, monitoring, management, patching, upgrade, and deletion for that service. In accordance with an embodiment, the contract that is implemented by an SME is referred to as a Service Management Interface (SMI).","Referring to the example shown in , when OVAB is used as a virtualization provider, interaction with the OVAB Deployer can be handled by a virtualization API (e.g., an OVAB client API). In accordance with an embodiment, the orchestration process can then proceed as follows: a Cloud Account Administrator can discover, e.g., SOA service types ,  that are available in the PaaS platform domain, and initiate creation of an, e.g., SOA service. The orchestration engine iterates through the available service SMEs in the system, and determines which service SMEs can handle this service type . In this example, the orchestration engine can discover an appropriate SOA SME to handle creation of the SOA service. The orchestration engine can then call into the SME to get all provider dependencies for that SME . For example, the SME may return database and load-balancer provider dependencies. The orchestration engine can then call a get-user or similar configurable properties function for the SME, and expose those properties in a user interface, so that the Cloud Account Administrator can edit the properties if desired. User-provided inputs can be supplied to the SME, for example to update an OVAB deployment plan. The orchestration engine then performs any pre-provisioning association between the SME and the provider SMEs upon which it depends. For example, the orchestration engine can perform pre-provisioning association between the SOA SME and a database provider SME, which results in the creation of schema and tables required by the SOA service, in addition to populating the deployment plan with the database provider configuration. When any pre-provisioning association is complete, the orchestration engine can then call into the SME  to provision the service.","At this point, the deployment plan is generally complete except for network configurations. In accordance with an embodiment, the deployment plan together with an assembly ID can be pushed, e.g., to the OVAB API, which takes care of filling the deployment plan with the remaining network configurations. Then, the orchestration engine can call, e.g., a Web service API of the OVAB Deployer, to provision the OVAB assembly. Once the assembly is provisioned, the virtual machine information can be retrieved and passed back to the SME, which in turn passes the information back to the orchestration engine. The orchestration engine can then perform any post-provisioning association between the SME and the provider SMEs on which it depends. For example, post-provisioning association between the SOA SME and a load-balancer provider SME may result in the creation of a virtual server to handle and route requests for this SOA service.","Orchestration Engine (OE)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"In accordance with an embodiment, the orchestration engine, as part of creating a service, ensures that dependencies of the service, such as its provider dependencies, are satisfied, by selecting appropriate providers, and coordinating association between the providers and service. The act of association can be performed during pre-provisioning and\/or post provisioning-phases. The act of installing and configuring an SME can be performed by the SDP manager as part of registering a pre-packaged service type or a customized service type. The orchestration engine helps expose the deployment plan configuration, which can be configured by the Cloud Account Administrator, including recognizing phases and tasks that match the requirements of the platform for its service creation action, and other life-cycle related activities.","In accordance with an embodiment, the orchestration engine also acts as a gateway for service management, monitoring, scaling actions that could be initiated by other containers in the PaaS platform domain, or by an administrator. For example, the elasticity engine, described in further detail below, can communicate with the orchestration engine to manage, monitor, and scale services based on a service's QoS configuration. The orchestration engine can also play a role in service maintenance actions, such as patching and upgrade, which may require disassociating or re-associating services in a phased manner.","In accordance with an embodiment, services created by a cloud account administrator are visible and accessible only to that particular cloud account (tenant), and are isolated from other cloud accounts in the PaaS platform domain. Such isolation can be provided by the orchestration engine with the help of a cloud account management module.","In accordance with an embodiment, SMEs can be registered with the orchestration engine such that multiple SMEs for a given \u201cfamily\u201d of service (e.g., \u201cdatabase\u201d) can be present in the system. A default SME can also be configured for a particular service family on a per-cloud account basis.","As shown in , in accordance with an embodiment, the orchestration and service management components can interface with the virtualization layer through a virtualization service , plugin , and virtualization API  that abstracts supported virtualization operations. In accordance with an embodiment that uses OVAB, this API can be an OVAB Deployer interface, which enables OVAB Deployer to perform the tasks of assembly creation. In accordance with an embodiment, the orchestration engine\/SME can upload and deploys assemblies through the OVAB virtualization API, in addition to managing their lifecycle.","To support developer or demonstration scenarios, in accordance with an embodiment, the system can also implement solutions that run on native OS processes (i.e., with no virtualization). This capability can be implemented by providing a \u201cphysical plugin\u201d, which implements a portion of the virtualization API.","Elasticity Manager (EM)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["260","262","264","265","270","272"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, a metric gatherer is an object that collects and maintains metric data about a service periodically. For example, a metric gatherer may periodically collect heap statistics such as used or committed memory; or metrics regarding CPU usage. Generally, the metric gatherers provide information about the state of some resource usage. Metrics can also be provided by external monitoring tools, for example by a Java bean component.","In accordance with an embodiment, an alert object periodically checks the health of a service in an environment, by analyzing metric data gathered by one or more metric gatherers over a period of time. For example, an alert may examine CPU usage for a previous several minutes to determine if the environment is under stress. After the alert determines the state of the service or environment, it can execute an action, such as sending an email, logging a message, sending an event, or scaling-up or scaling-down a service. In accordance with an embodiment, an alert can take multiple actions.","In accordance with an embodiment, the elasticity manager can include a unified Expression Language (EL) engine , which allows alerts and metric gatherers to be specified as EL expressions. In accordance with an embodiment, the elasticity manager allows external EL Resolver objects  to be registered, which enables other types of objects, such as MBeans or POJOs, to be used in an expression.","Update and Patching of SDPs","In accordance with an embodiment, services can be periodically maintained to ensure that they are up-to-date with, e.g., bug fixes, security updates and configuration changes. To help ensure homogeneous environments, services should be updated in a timely manner, with the same set of patches and configuration updates. In accordance with an embodiment, an update is defined to be a change which has to be made to the system; examples of which include application of a security patch, upgrade of a component, or changing of a configuration value. Depending on the type of update, some updates may require a service or system downtime, while other updates may not require a downtime; and each of these scenarios can be taken into account.","Identity Management (IDM) Providers","In accordance with an embodiment, an identity management (IDM) provider can provide an identity store (e.g., LDAP directory) configuration for use by a cloud platform (e.g., Cloud Logic) service. In accordance with an embodiment, the IDM provider can centrally manage one or more identity store configurations, and supply a particular configuration to the orchestration engine when a service is being provisioned, so that the service can then be launched with an appropriate identity store. This allows a platform administrator to specify identity store configurations once and in one place, instead of having to create an identity store configuration for each service.","In accordance with an embodiment, a particular identity store configuration can be specified for use with a service when a service type is created. Each configuration can be represented with a provider type entry in a domain configuration file. The IDM provider lifecycle and configuration mechanism can be determined by the SDP manager, which can support multiple versions of a particular SDP, and provide isolation from the format of the SDP file. IDM provider handling can be defined by the orchestration engine (OE); while the interfaces of the IDM provider can be defined by a service management engine (SME).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"As illustrated in , in accordance with an embodiment, the system can include a cloud platform component  as described above, provided within a cloud computing environment , that supports provisioning of enterprise applications. The cloud platform can include a service SDP , an IDM provider SME , an orchestration engine , and an IDM provider . An administration interface , including a command line interface , allows a user  to issue commands  to interact with  various components in the cloud platform.","As further shown in , in accordance with an embodiment, the IDM provider can store and manage multiple identity store configurations -. A service SDP (e.g., a Java service SDP) can declare dependencies on the IDM provider. When a service type  is created from the service SDP, a dependency on a particular identity store configuration can be specified, to match one of the multiple identity store configurations stored by the IDM provider. By allowing such a dependency to be specified, the platform administrator is given the option of satisfying IDM provider dependencies for different identity stores in different services.","As an illustrative example, a service type with a declared dependency on a particular identity store configuration can be created as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"padmin create-provider-type --sdp IDM ldap-corp"},{"entry":"padmin create-provider-type --sdp IDM ldap-dept"},{"entry":"padmin create-service-type --sdp JavaService"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"--dependencies IDM_DEPENDENCY=ldap-dept js-idm-dept-type"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As illustrated by the commands above, two different provider types, e.g., ldap-corp and ldap-dept, each defining a particular identity store configuration, can be created from a same provider SDP; while a particular dependency, e.g., ldap-dept, can be specified as the identity store dependency of the service type, in this example a JavaService service type.","In accordance with an embodiment, when a service  is provisioned based on the service type, the orchestration engine can associate the IDM provider with the service, obtain  the identity store configuration specified in the service type from the IDM provider, and invoke the service SME  to supply  the configuration to the service, so that the service can be launched with a correct identity store configuration. The service's association with the IDM provider can be performed during a pre-provisioning or post-provisioning phase, or during any of the association lifecycle phases.","In accordance with an embodiment, the specified identity store configuration can be used to point to an identity store , e.g., an LDAP server. For example, the identity store can be one of an Oracle Internet Directory (OID), an Active Directory (AD), or an OpenLDAP server.

Each configuration (endpoint) can be represented by a provider type entry -, in a domain configuration file  (e.g., a domain.xml file). Since an identity store configuration, such as an LDAP configuration, can be complex, involving schemas and filter settings, in order to provide a more usable means of defining an IDM provider configuration, a set of core, e.g., LDAP-related options can be provided when creating an identity store configuration, with a plurality of detailed options defaulted on or derived from a type of LDAP server or server type, or supported from a service by use of service-specific tooling.","As an illustrative example, in accordance with an embodiment, an LDAP server type can be used by the service SME to derive additional context about the configuration handling. For example, a WebLogic Server (WLS) Java service SME can set up LDAP authentication configuration using a specified LDAP authentication type for that service.","In accordance with an embodiment, the IDM provider can support both shared and dedicated tenancy models. The platform administrator can define a configuration that can be used by multiple service types (e.g., a corporate LDAP server); or a configuration for a particular service type in those cases where a dedicated LDAP server may be required (e.g., a departmental LDAP server).","In accordance with an embodiment, although as described above options can be defaulted or derived based on the LDAP server type, the following LDAP-related context must be supplied: Connection User (Principal); Connection Password (Credential); User Base Distinguished Name; and Group Base Distinguished Name. The LDAP server type property can be used by an SME to derive additional context about the configuration handling, if supported by the SME. For example, a WLS Java Service SME may setup the LDAP authentication configuration in a service domain using the specified LDAP authenticator type (e.g., OracleInternet DirectoryAuthenticator).","Table 1 illustrates various properties that a Platform Administrator can enter for LDAP server configuration settings using a create-provider-type command against the IDM provider, in accordance with an embodiment:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Property","Default Value","Comments"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["IDM Provider Specific",{},{}]},{"entry":["idm-server-type","OID","OID, ActiveDirectory,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Open LDAP"]},{"entry":["idm-trust-certificate ","N\/A","Coordinates used to obtain"]},{"entry":[{},{},"trust certificate from the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"credential service"]},{"entry":["LDAP Server","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["idm-credential","N\/A","Expected use of Password"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Alias support"]},{"entry":["idm-host","localhost","Single host name or IPV4"]},{"entry":[{},{},"address"]},{"entry":["idm-port","389",{}]},{"entry":["idm-principal","N\/A","User connecting to the server"]},{"entry":[{},{},"in order to perform lookups"]},{"entry":["idm-ssl-enabled","false","A trust certificate (or store) is"]},{"entry":[{},{},"needed for 1-way SSL support"]},{"entry":["Group Caching","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["idm-group-hierarchy-cache-ttl","60 sec",{}]},{"entry":["idm-max-group-hierarchies-in-","100",{}]},{"entry":["cache",{},{}]},{"entry":["User","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["idm-user-base-dn","N\/A",{}]},{"entry":["idm-user-name-attribute","Varies","Based on server type: cn"]},{"entry":[{},{},"[generic: uid]"]},{"entry":["idm-user-object-class","Varies","Based on server type: person,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"user"]},{"entry":["Group","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["idm-group-base-dn","N\/A",{}]},{"entry":["idm-static-group-name-attribute","Varies","Based on server type: cn"]},{"entry":["idm-static-group-object-class","Varies","Based on server type:"]},{"entry":[{},{},"groupofuniquenames, group,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"groupofnames"]},{"entry":["idm-static-member-dn-attribute","Varies","Based on server type:"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uniquemember, member"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"As described above, in accordance with an embodiment, a service's association with the IDM provider can be performed during a pre-provisioning or post-provisioning phase, or any of the association lifecycle phases.

service with a provider. During association with the IDM provider, the IDM provider SME can obtain, e.g., the Service Administrator credentials for validation with the external LDAP server, if supplied.

The service SME can obtain the associated LDAP configuration from the IDM provider, and provision the service to use the LDAP configuration.","In order to obtain a specific provider configuration or provider type, the service SME can implement an association handler object interface, and read the properties via an association result object from the IDM provider.","For example, when a Java service is provisioned based on the service type during the create-service operation, the Java service configuration can be setup to use the associated IDM provider configuration. The Java service SME will be responsible for obtaining the specific LDAP endpoint data and provisioning the service to use the external LDAP configuration.

A PaaS environment generally will not provision a service where the service administration interface is not usable or accessible. As such, in accordance with an embodiment, the IDM provider supports the ability to validate service administrator credentials when the service administration user resides in the identity store represented by the IDM provider. The IDM provider SME can obtain the service administrator credentials for validation with an external LDAP server.","In accordance with an embodiment, the IDM provider can implement a validator interface, e.g., com.oracle.cloudlogic.service.spi.ServiceConfigurationValidator, to verify LDAP connection credentials and check for other configuration issues (e.g., that a trust certificate is defined when SSL is enabled). In the event that a service administrator is created local to the service or is not accessible to the IDM provider, the service can set an association rule disabling the IDM provider validation logic during the association phase, e.g., by setting \u201cIdentity Management.ValidateServiceAdminCredentials\u201d to false.","Credential and Certificate Storage Handling (SSL Support)","In accordance with an embodiment, connections to the LDAP server can be established using the configured principal and credential properties of the IDM provider type. When SSL is enabled, an SSL port can be specified in the properties of an IDM provider type.

An LDAP server trust certificate (i.e., Certificate Authority) can be stored and retrieved using a key and credential service, to allow for proper access and sharing between the provider and service SMEs.","Progress Status","In accordance with an embodiment, the IDM provider can support progress status handling by calling an API available from the IDM provider association handler implementation.","IDM Provider Method",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"As shown in , in accordance with an embodiment, at step , one or more computers including a cloud environment and a PaaS platform component (PaaS platform) executing thereon, are provided.","At step , an IDM provider that centrally stores and manages a plurality of identity store configurations is provided. In accordance with an embodiment, each identity store configuration is created by a platform administrator and can be represented with an IDM provider type entry in a domain configuration file.","At step , a service type can be created from a service SDP that specifies a dependency on the IDM provider, wherein the service type can further specify a dependency on a particular identity store configuration stored on the IDM provider.","At step , the specified identity store configuration can be obtained from the IDM provider and supplied to the service for use.","Webtier Providers","In accordance with an embodiment, the service types made available in a cloud platform (e.g., CloudLogic) domain can include information which describes dependency on a webtier provider, which in turn provides load-balancing capability to a service whose deployment may span multiple virtual machines. A webtier provider can associate one or more provisioned services with a webtier runtime, to satisfy the webtier dependency of a service. After a service is provisioned, a webtier provider service management engine (SME) can associate the service with a webtier runtime by creating a configuration therein. The webtier runtime can subsequently provide a single point of access to the service, including load-balancing requests to service nodes, or providing support for additional capabilities such as failure detection and failover.","In accordance with an embodiment, when a service is updated, corresponding changes can be made to an associated webtier runtime (e.g., an Oracle Traffic Director (OTD), or Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) runtime). When the service is stopped, the webtier runtime can prevent access to the service. The webtier runtime can also serve as a coordinator in applying rolling upgrades to the service.","In accordance with an embodiment, when a service is created, a locator such as a URL for the service can be generated and provided to the webtier runtime by the webtier provider For each provisioned service, the webtier provider SME can configure the webtier runtime by creating a virtual server configuration, origin server pool configuration, and other configurations necessary for load balancing in the webtier runtime. The configurations can then be used to direct incoming requests for the service, to server nodes in an origin server pool that hosts the service, based on the URL of the service.","Virtual Server Configuration Creation","In accordance with an embodiment, the webtier runtime provider can be configured with a base domain name, with each provisioned service then having its own domain name created based on certain parameters. A complete domain (URL) for a service can be generated using a combination of a service name, an account name, and a base domain name.","As an illustrative example, the URL for a service administrator can be admin-javasvc1-acct1.cloudlogic.com, and the URL for an end user can be javasvc1-acct1.cloudlogic.com, where \u201cjavasvc1\u201d is the service name, \u201cacct1\u201d is the account name, and \u201ccloudlogic.com\u201d is the base domain name.","In accordance with an embodiment, an origin server pool can be created by mapping servers\/nodes created as part of a service creation. The virtual server configuration on the webtier runtime can map incoming requests on a virtual host name pattern (which can match the service's domain name) to servers\/nodes in the origin server pool.","Pool and Origin Servers","As described above, in accordance with an embodiment, a webtier provider is configured with a base domain name, with each service having its own domain name based on certain parameters. In accordance with an embodiment, the process or pattern to generate a domain name for a particular service can be as follows:","A domain name is created using a combination of service-name and account-name.","A virtual server configuration is created per service which matches the domain name pattern for that service.","An origin server pool is created mapping the servers\/nodes created as part of service.","The virtual server configuration maps all the incoming requests on the host name (which must match service's domain name) pattern to the servers\/nodes in a particular origin server pool, thus enabling the load-balancing of requests.","In accordance with an embodiment, a service admin domain name can be created based on admin-<service-name>-<account-name>.<base-domain-name>, for example admin-javasvc1-acct1.cloudlogic.com. A service end-user domain name can be created based on <service-name>-<account-name>.<base-domain-name>, for example javasvc1-acct1.cloudlogic.com.","In accordance with an embodiment, the origin server pool is a pool of origin servers, wherein each origin server points to one of the service nodes, and can be configured for either HTTP or HTTPS protocol access, and is considered to be homogeneous.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"As illustrated in , in accordance with an embodiment, the system can include a cloud platform component  as described above, provided within a cloud computing environment , that supports provisioning of enterprise applications.

The virtual server configuration matches the domain name pattern of the service. For example, for a service whose domain name is javasvc1-acct1, the virtual server for the service can be configured with the same domain name.","In accordance with an embodiment, the origin server pool configuration can comprise information about server nodes on which the service has been provisioned, e.g., host-port pairs for each service node. Each virtual server configured for a service can be associated with an origin server pool configured for that service. When the webtier runtime has an SSL port enabled, the webtier provider SME can create a certificate matching the domain name of the service.","In accordance with an embodiment, a health monitoring configuration can be generated per origin server pool, and thereafter used by the webtier runtime for failure detections.

When receiving the request, the webtier runtime can route the request to the virtual server whose domain name matches that of the service.","In accordance with an embodiment, the virtual server configuration, in conjunction with the origin server configuration, can route the request to an appropriate service node in the origin server pool.","Certificate Generation","As described above, in accordance with an embodiment, the webtier provider SME can create a certificate matching the domain name of the service when the webtier runtime has an SSL port enabled. The default mechanism for certificate generation can be self-signed certificates. For example, the SME implementation can generate a self-signed certificate such that a common name in the certificate matches the service's domain name.","In accordance with an embodiment, certificates used in a private PaaS solution are internal to customers and can be transferred over the wire for certificate authority (CA) signed certificates in the cloud platform environment. In accordance with an embodiment, a wild card certificate can match any sub-domain based on its base domain name. For example, a wildcard SSL certificate for *.cloudlogic.com can match any sub-domain, such as dept1.cloudlogic.com, dept2.cloudlogic.com, etc.","In accordance with an embodiment, a cloud account administrator may want to use a specific signed certificate for their service, instead of wild-card certificate. In such situations, a signed service specific certificate, e.g., in PKCS#12 format, which packages both the certificate and a private key together in a single file, can be provided as part of association rules via a property.","Alternatively, a cloud account administrator can work in an offline manner with, for example an OTD system administrator, to install a signed service specific certificate in OTD; and specify, via a property, the name of the pre-installed certificate as part of an association rule. The webtier SME can ensure that a given service is tied to a specified certificate name.","Health Monitoring Configuration","In accordance with an embodiment, a health monitoring configuration can be generated per origin server pool. The health monitoring configuration can be used by a webtier runtime for failure detection on the origin server pool, and can be created either using the default values provided at the time of registration of the webtier runtime, or with values provided when creating a service type or a service.","End-to-End SSL","In accordance with an embodiment, the default behavior for the webtier runtime is to terminate SSL connections from a client at the webtier runtime, in which case the connection between the webtier runtime and service endpoints can be over non-SSL. However, some services may require connections between the webtier and service endpoints to be secured. In accordance with an embodiment, this can be achieved by enabling end-to-end SSL by the webtier provider. If end-to-end SSL is enabled, a service can be made available over an SSL port of the webtier runtime. Additionally, server certificates from the service can be installed in a trust-store of a runtime, e.g., Oracle Traffic Director (OTD), certificate database such that the traffic director trusts the certificate sent by service nodes when an SSL connection to them is initiated. An OTD client certificate can be installed in the trust store of the service nodes, such that these service nodes trust the client certificates presented to the server nodes when OTD initiates a connection to them.","Context-Root Matching","In accordance with an embodiment, the service administrator or end-user URL can specify a context-root, in which case the webtier provider SME can generate appropriate configurations such that requests matching the context-root can be forwarded to appropriate service nodes, while other requests are rejected by the webtier (e.g., OTD) runtime itself.","Maintenance Mode","In accordance with an embodiment, during service patching or upgrade, the service can enter a maintenance phase. When a service is in a maintenance phase, an appropriate error page is displayed to the end user; following completion of the maintenance phase, the service can be enabled again in the webtier (e.g., OTD). As services are updated, the corresponding changes can be made to the webtier runtime. As a service is stopped and terminated, the runtime can prevent access to the service, and can be used as a coordinator in applying rolling upgrades to a service.","In accordance with an embodiment, there can be two modes of maintenance: rolling upgrade\/patching, and complete service shutdown.","In the rolling upgrade mode, a service can be upgraded or patched in a rolling fashion. Only one node is down at any given time so that the service can be accessible on the remaining nodes. Under this approach, a node under maintenance can be removed from an origin server pool and once the maintenance is completed and resumes operation, it can be added back to the origin server pool. The service SME can be implemented in such a way that a node under maintenance can be excluded from a list of URIs returned by APIs, e.g., getInternalEndUserURIs( ) and getInternalAdminURIs( ). The webtier provider SME can appropriately configure the origin server pool for a service based on the information returned by the APIs.","In the complete service shutdown mode of maintenance, if a service needs to be brought down completely from maintenance, then the webtier (e.g. OTD) runtime needs to be configured such that a \u201cservice under maintenance\u201d page can be returned to users trying to access the service. Once the service maintenance phase is over, the runtime can be configured to resume normal operation for the service.","Vanity Domain Name","In accordance with an embodiment, a vanity domain name for a service can be provided at the time of service creation. For example, a name javasvc1.abc.com can be associated as a domain name to be used for service javasvc1. In such case, the webtier provider SME can generate configurations using javasvc1.abc.com as the domain name for the service, and bypass the default mechanism to auto-generate a domain name for the service.","Shared Versus Dedicated Providers","In accordance with an embodiment, the webtier provider can provide support for a shared tenancy model, wherein a single webtier runtime can be shared by multiple services. The implementation of the webtier provider SME can ensure that conflicts do not arise as a result of a webtier runtime being shared by multiple services. In cases where such conflicts cannot be resolved, the association can fail with appropriate errors.","Webtier Provider SME","In accordance with an embodiment, the webtier provider SME can provide an interface to handle association between the webtier provider and the service. As a result of the association or re-association, an association result object can be generated that includes a list of properties for the consumption of the service post-association. Example properties can include a webtier URL that exposes the service administration interface of the service, and a webtier URL that exposes the end user interface of the service.","Certificate Input File","In accordance with an embodiment, the webtier provider SME can provide support for certificate generation based on a domain name generated for a particular service. When a certificate is generated, there are certain inputs that are expected, which by default can be left blank except for common name, which can match the service's domain name. The webtier provider SME can provide an input file which contains inputs that can be used for the certificate generation. In accordance with an embodiment, this file can be provided either while creating a provider using lb-service-default-cert-input-file, or while creating a service type\/service using lb-service-cert-input-file.","Association","In accordance with an embodiment, the service SDP can define dependency on a webbtier in its service definition (e.g., xml) file. The service can be associated with the webtier after the service is provisioned, so that endpoints for end users and service administrators can be exposed for them to access the service. Similarly, the service can be dissociated with the webtier pre-unprovisioning, so that the endpoints for end users and service administrators can be removed from the webtier before the service runtime is made unavailable. As described above, a service SDP can define dependency on the webtier in its service definition xml, an example of which is illustrated in Listing
