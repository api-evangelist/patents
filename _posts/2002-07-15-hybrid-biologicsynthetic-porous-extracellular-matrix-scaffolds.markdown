One such ECM is small intestine submucosa (SIS). SIS has been used to repair, support, and stabilize a wide variety of anatomical defects and traumatic injuries. Commercially-available SIS material is derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa that remodels the qualities of its host when implanted in human soft tissues. Further, it is taught that the SIS material provides a natural matrix with a three-dimensional microstructure and biochemical composition that facilitates host cell proliferation and supports tissue remodeling. SIS products, such as Oasis material and Surgisis material, are commercially available from Cook Biotech, Bloomington, Ind.","An SIS product referred to as RESTORE\u2122 Orthobiologic Implant is available from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in Warsaw, Ind. The DePuy product is described for use during rotator cuff surgery, and is provided as a resorbable framework that allows the rotator cuff tendon to regenerate itself. The RESTORE\u2122 Implant is derived from porcine small intestine submucosa that has been cleaned, disinfected, and sterilized. Small intestine submucosa (SIS) has been described as a naturally-occurring ECM composed primarily of collagenous proteins. Other biological molecules, such as growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, etc., have also been identified in SIS. See Hodde et al., Tissue Eng. 2(3): 209-217 (1996); Voytik-Harbin et al., J. Cell Biochem., 67:478-491 (1997); McPherson and Badylak, Tissue Eng., 4(1): 75-83 (1998); Hodde et al., Endothelium, 8(1):11-24 (2001); Hodde and Hiles, Wounds, 13(5): 195-201 (2001); Hurst and Bonner, J.

Ed., 12(11) 1267-1279 (2001); Hodde et al., Biomaterial, 23(8): 1841-1848 (2002); and Hodde, Tissue Eng., 8(2): 295-308 (2002), all of which are incorporated by reference herein. During seven years of preclinical testing in animals, there were no incidences of infection transmission form the implant to the host, and the RESTORE\u2122 Implant has not decreased the systemic activity of the immune system. See Allman et al., Transplant, 17(11): 1631-1640 (2001); Allman et al., Tissue Eng., 8(1): 53-62 (2002).","While small intestine submucosa is available, other sources of submucosa are known to be effective for tissue remodeling. These sources include, but are not limited to, stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory, or genital submucosa, or liver basement membrane. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,379,710, 6,171,344, 6,099,567, and 5,554,389, hereby incorporated by reference. Further, while SIS is most often porcine derived, it is known that these various submucosa materials may be derived from non-porcine sources, including bovine and ovine sources. Additionally, the ECM material may also include partial layers of laminar muscularis mucosa, muscularis mucosa, lamina propria, stratum compactum and\/or other tissue materials depending upon factors such as the source from which the ECM material was derived and the delamination procedure.","For the purposes of this invention, it is within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to clean, delaminate, and\/or comminute the ECM, or even to cross-link the collagen fibers within the ECM. It is also within the definition of naturally occurring ECM to fully or partially remove one or more sub-components of the naturally occurring ECM. However, it is not within the definition of a naturally occurring ECM to separate and purify the natural collagen or other components or sub-components of the ECM and reform a matrix material from the purified natural collagen or other components or sub-components of the ECM. While reference is made to SIS, it is understood that other naturally occurring ECMs (e.g., stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory, and genital submucosa, and liver basement membrane), whatever the source (e.g., bovine, porcine, ovine) are within the scope of this disclosure. Thus, in this application, the terms \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d or \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d are intended to refer to extracellular matrix material that has been cleaned, disinfected, sterilized, and optionally cross-linked. The terms \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d and \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d are also intended to include ECM foam material prepared as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d, filed concurrently herewith.","The following patents, hereby incorporated by reference, disclose the use of ECMs for the regeneration and repair of various tissues: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,187,039; 6,176,880; 6,126,686; 6,099,567; 6,096,347; 5,997,575; 5,968,096; 5,955,110; 5,922,028; 5,885,619; 5,788,625; 5,762,966; 5,755,791; 5,753,267; 5,711,969; 5,645,860; 5,641,518; 5,554,389; 5,516,533; 5,445,833; 5,372,821; 5,352,463; 5,281,422; and 5,275,826.","The manipulation of scaffold pore size, porosity, and interconnectivity is of emerging importance in the field of tissue engineering (Ma and Zhang, 2001, J. Biomed Mater Res. 56(4): 469-477; Ma and Choi, 2001, Tissue Eng., 7(1):23-33), because it is believed that the consideration of scaffold pore size and density\/porosity influences the behavior of cells and the quality of tissue regenerated. In fact, several researchers have shown that different pore sizes influence the behavior of cells in porous three-dimensional matrices. For example, it has been demonstrated in the art that for adequate bone regeneration to occur scaffold pore size should to be at least 100 microns (Klawitter et al., 1976, J Biomed Mater Res, 10(2):311-323). For pore sizes and interconnectivity less than that, poor quality bone is regenerated, and if pore size is between 10-40 microns bone cells are able to form only soft fibro-vascular tissue (White and Shors, 1991, Dent Clin North Am, 30:49-67). The current consensus of research for bone regeneration indicates that the requisite pore size for bone regeneration is 100-600 microns (Shors, 1999, Orthop Clin North Am, 30(4):599-613; Wang, 1990, Nippon Seikeigeka Gakki Zasshi, 64(9):847-859). It is generally accepted that optimal bone regeneration occurs for pore sizes between 300-600 microns.","Similarly, for the regeneration of soft orthopaedic tissues, such as ligament, tendon, cartilage, and fibro-cartilage, scaffold pore size is believed to have a substantial effect. For example, basic research has shown that cartilage cells (chondrocytes) exhibit appropriate protein expression (type II collagen) in scaffolds with pore sizes of the order of 20 microns and tend to dedifferentiate to produce type I collagen in scaffolds with nominal porosity of about 80 microns (Nehrer et al., 1997, Biomaterials, 18(11):769-776). More recently, it has been shown that cells that form ligaments, tendons, and blood vessels (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) exhibit significantly different activity when cultured on scaffolds with differing pore sizes ranging from 5 to 90 microns (Salem et al., 2002, J Biomed Mater Res, 61(2):212-217).","Copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d, DEP-747), filed contemporaneously herewith and hereby incorporated by reference, describes methods for making ECM foams wherein the porosity is controlled. Using the methods so described, ECM foams are made having the desired porosity for a particular application.","In some applications, it is also desirable to control the rate of resorption of the scaffold. It is known in the art to make implantable three-dimensional synthetic scaffolds with controlled porosity and controlled resorption rates. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,333,029 and 6,355,699, hereby incorporated by reference. These synthetic foams may be isotropic in form, or may be anisotropic, providing various gradient architectures.","In addition to synthetic foams, it is known that resorption rates of an implant may be controlled by providing a synthetic portion comprising a perforated or non-perforated sheet or a mat with a woven, knitted, warped knitted (i.e., lace-like), nonwoven, or braided structure. It is understood that in any of the above structures, mechanical properties of the material can be altered by changing the density or texture of the material. The fibers used to make the reinforcing component can be for example, monofilaments, yarns, threads, braids, or bundles of fibers. These fibers can be made of any biocompatible material. In an exemplary embodiment, the fibers that comprise the nonwoven or three-dimensional mesh are formed of a polylactic acid (PLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) copolymer at a 95:5 mole ratio. Illustrated examples of the synthetic portion also include 90\/10 PGA\/PLA, 95\/5 PLA\/PGA, and polydioxanone (PDO) nonwoven mats, and perforated thin sheets of 60\/40 PLA\/PCL (polycaprolactone) or 65\/35 PGA\/PCL.","A variety of biocompatible polymers can be used to make fibers for the synthetic portion. Examples of suitable biocompatible, bioabsorbable polymers that could be used include polymers selected from the group consisting of aliphatic polyesters, poly(amino acids), copoly(ether-esters), polyalkylenes oxalates, polyamides, poly(iminocarbonates), polyorthoesters, polyoxaesters, polyamidoesters, polyoxaesters containing amine groups, poly(anhydrides), polyphosphazenes, biomolecules and blends thereof. For the purpose of this disclosure aliphatic polyesters include but are not limited to homopolymers and copolymers of lactide (which includes lactic acid, D-,L- and meso lactide), glycolide (including glycolic acid), \u03b5-caprolactone, p-dioxanone (1,4-dioxan-2-one), trimethylene carbonate (1,3-dioxan-2-one), alkyl derivatives of trimethylene carbonate, \u03b4-valerolactone, \u03b2-butyrolactone, \u03b3-butyrolactone, \u03b5-decalactone, hydroxybutyrate (repeating units), hydroxyvalerate (repeating units), 1,4-dioxepan-2-one (including its dimer 1,5,8,12-tetraoxacyclotetradecane-7,14-dione), 1,5-dioxepan-2-one, 6,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxan-2-one 2,5-diketomorpholine, pivalolactone, \u03b1,\u03b1-diethylpropiolactone, ethylene carbonate, ethylene oxalate, 3-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione, 3,3-diethyl-1,4-dioxan-2,5-dione, 6,8-dioxabicycloctane-7-one, copolymers, and polymer blends thereof. Other synthetic polymers are known in the art and may be used within the scope of this disclosure.","The particular polymer may be selected depending on one or more of the following factors: (a) bio-absorption (or bio-degradation) kinetics; (b) in-vivo mechanical performance; and (c) cell response to the material in terms of cell attachment, proliferation, migration and differentiation and (d) biocompatibility. With respect to the bio-absorption kinetics, it is known to control resorption rates by selection of the polymer or copolymer. By way of example, it is known that a 35:65 blend of \u03b5-caprolactone and glycolide is a relatively fast absorbing polymer and a 40:60 blend of \u03b5-caprolactone and (L)lactide is a relatively slow absorbing polymer. Optionally, two or more polymers or copolymers could then be blended together to form a foam having several different physical properties.","In some orthopaedic applications, it is desirable to combine the tissue remodeling properties of ECM with the controlled resorption properties of synthetic foams, mats, or sheets. Thus, methods are provided for making porous scaffolds for the repair or regeneration of a body tissue, wherein the scaffolds comprise an ECM component and a synthetic portion. According to one illustrative embodiment, there is provided a method of making an implantable scaffold for repairing damaged or diseased tissue. The method includes the steps of suspending pieces of an ECM material in a liquid and mixing a polymer solution into the liquid. The mixture is formed into a mass and, subsequently, the liquid is driven off so as to form interstices in the mass. In another embodiment, the method includes suspending pieces of an ECM material in a liquid and forming a mass. A polymer mat, for example, a mesh or nonwoven, is coated with the ECM material, and, subsequently, the liquid is driven off, forming a foam having a combination of mechanical and biological features.","In one specific implementation of an exemplary embodiment, the liquid is driven off by lyophilizing the ECM and synthetic material and the liquid in which they are suspended. In such a manner, the liquid is sublimed thereby forming the interstices in the mass.","The material density and pore size of the scaffold may be varied by controlling the rate of freezing of the suspension. The amount of water into which the pieces of extracellular matrix material are suspended may also be varied to control the material density and pore size of the resultant scaffold. Furthermore, as discussed above, the resorption rate may be controlled by varying the synthetic polymer structure or composition.","In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, there is provided an implantable scaffold for repairing or regenerating tissue prepared by the process described above.","Thus, one aspect of this disclosure is directed to a method of making an implantable scaffold for repairing or regenerating body tissue, the method comprising the steps of suspending ECM material in a liquid to form a slurry, adding a synthetic portion to the slurry to make an ECM\/synthetic composition, freezing the composition to form crystals therein, and driving off the crystals to form a foam. In one illustrated embodiment, the ECM is comminuted. In another illustrated embodiment, the liquid is water, the crystals are ice, and the crystals are driven off by lyophilization.","In another aspect of this disclosure an implantable scaffold for repairing or regenerating body tissue is provided, the scaffold comprising a porous ECM foam and a synthetic mat imbedded therein.","Yet another aspect is an implantable scaffold comprising a mass of ECM intermixed with a fibrous synthetic portion in a composition dried to have a desired porosity.","Still, another aspect of this invention is an implantable scaffold comprising a porous foam comprising ECM and a synthetic portion distributed within the foam.","The above and other features of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following description and the attached drawings.","The present disclosure relates to porous scaffolds for implanting into the body of a patient to repair or regenerate damaged or diseased tissue. The porous scaffold is constructed from a naturally occurring extracellular material and a synthetic polymer. For example, the scaffold may be constructed from a mat of mesh or nonwoven synthetic material coated with SIS, a mixture of SIS and a synthetic polymer, or from layers of SIS and synthetic polymer. The material density, pore size, and resorption rate of the porous scaffold may be varied to fit the needs of a given scaffold design.","Such porous scaffolds may be fabricated by first suspending pieces of an ECM material in a liquid. As used herein, the term \u201csuspending\u201d is intended to include any placement of a solid (e.g., pieces of ECM) in a liquid whether or not an actual suspension is created. As such, the term \u201csuspending\u201d is intended to include any mixing of a solid in a liquid or any other placement of a solid in a liquid. As a result, the term \u201csuspension\u201d is likewise not intended to be limited to suspensions, but rather is intended to mean any mass having a solid present in a liquid. Suspension of the pieces of ECM material in the liquid forms a mass in the form of, for example, a \u201cslurry\u201d. The slurry may be used to coat a mat of mesh or nonwoven synthetic portion or a solution of a synthetic polymer may be added to the slurry, and the liquid may then be subsequently driven off of so as to form interstices therein. The liquid may be driven off in a number of different manners. For example, as will herein be described in greater detail, the liquid may be driven off via sublimation in a freeze drying process. Alternatively, the liquid may also be driven off by subjecting the suspension to vacuum under a controlled heating process. The liquid may also be driven off from the suspension ultrasonically. Microwave energy may also be utilized to drive the liquid off of the suspension. Moreover, the liquid may include a water-soluble filler that is driven off, for example, by use of an alcohol.","While any of the aforementioned processes for driving off the liquid from the suspension may be used, along with any other process known by one skilled in the art, the processes of the present disclosure will herein be exemplary described in regard to a lyophilization process (i.e., freeze drying). However, it should be understood that such a description is merely exemplary in nature and that any one or more of the aforedescribed processes for driving off the liquid from the suspension may be utilized to fit the needs of a given scaffold design or process design.","As discussed above, one useful process for fabricating the porous scaffolds of the present disclosure is by lyophilization. In this case, an ECM\/polymer composition is frozen and subsequently lyophilized. Freezing the suspension causes the liquid to crystallize. These crystals are then sublimed during the lyophilization process, thereby leaving interstices in the material in the spaces previously occupied by the crystals. The material density and pore size of the resultant scaffold may be varied by controlling, among other things, the rate of freezing of the suspension and\/or the amount of water in which the ECM material is suspended in at the start of the freezing process.","As a specific example of this process, fabrication of porous SIS\/synthetic hybrid scaffolds by lyophilization will be described in detail. However, it should be appreciated that although the example is herein described in regard to an SIS\/synthetic scaffold, fabrication of a scaffold constructed from other ECM materials and synthetic polymers may also be performed in a similar manner.","The first step in fabricating a porous scaffold with a desired pore size and density is the procurement of comminuted SIS. Illustratively, scissor-cut SIS runners (\u02dc6\u2033 long) are positioned in a 1700 series COMITROL\u00ae machine, commercially available from Urschel Laboratories (Valpraiso, Ind.). The SIS material is processed and thereafter collected in a receptacle at the output of the machine. The material is then processed through the machine a second time under similar conditions. The resultant material is a \u201cslurry\u201d of SIS material (thin, long SIS fibers \u02dc200 microns thick\u00d71-5 mm long) suspended in a substantially uniform manner in water. Although the suspension is herein described as being formed as a byproduct of the comminuting process, it should be appreciated that the pieces of SIS may be suspended in the liquid (i.e., water) in other manners known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, while other methods are known for comminuting SIS, it is understood that for the purposes of the present disclosure, comminuted SIS comprises ribbon-like or string-like fibers wherein at least some of the individual pieces of ECM and SIS material have lengths greater than their widths and thicknesses. Such fibers may be interlaced to provide a felt-like material, if desired.","Process parameters can be varied using the above-identified 1700 series COMITROL\u00ae machine, including the choice of blade used, whether water is used, the amount of water used, the speed at which the blades turn, and the number of times the material is passed through the machine. As an example, cutting head 140084-10 and a VERICUT\u00ae, sealed impeller from Urschel Laboratories may be used, with a flow of water of about two (2) gallons per minute, with the blade running at a constant speed of about 9300 rpm. A first pass through the machine at these parameters will produce fibrous SIS material of varying sizes, and a second pass will produce SIS fibers of a more uniform size. By way of example, the comminuted material may be tested to determine if it has the consistency of that which is desired for use in regard to the illustrative embodiments described herein by the following process: the comminuted SIS suspension or slurry is centrifuged, excess water is poured off and the remaining slurry is poured into a dish. By hand, a small amount of the comminuted SIS material in the dish is pinched between the thumb and index finger and gently lifted from the dish. Illustratively, at least a small amount of additional SIS, beyond the portion pinched between the thumb and index finger, will lift along with the material that has been pinched. This additional comminuted SIS material lifts with the material that is between the thumb and index finger because the individual pieces of comminuted SIS material are comingled or intertwined. Prior art methods of \u201ccomminuting\u201d SIS using a freezer mill produce particles, rather then ribbon-like fibers. The prior art particles are not capable of significant intertwining and, for purposes of the present disclosure, are not included within the definition of comminuted SIS. See copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d.","The terms \u201ccohesive ECM\u201d, \u201ccohesive SIS\u201d, \u201ccohesive ECM pieces\u201d and \u201ccohesive SIS pieces\u201d are used herein to respectively denote ECM or SIS material that has been comminuted or otherwise physically processed to produce ECM or SIS pieces that are capable of comingling or intertwining (in the wet or dry state) to form a mass of discrete pieces of ECM or SIS that remain massed together under some conditions (such as under gravity), regardless of the shape or shapes of the individual ECM or SIS pieces. One method of demonstrating that the ECM or SIS material comprises cohesive pieces is the \u201cpinch test\u201d described in the preceding paragraph. Examination of the final ECM or SIS product produced may also provide evidence that the base material comprised cohesive ECM or SIS pieces. Illustratively, the ECM or SIS pieces are sufficiently cohesive to each other (or to other pieces in the mix or slurry) that they remain unified throughout the process used to produce the foam structure.","A polymer solution is also prepared, as is known in the art. By way of example, a 95:5 weight ratio solution of 60\/40 PLA\/PCL is made and poured into a flask. The flask is placed in a water bath, stirring at 60-70\u00b0 C. for 5 hrs. The solution is filtered using an extraction thimble, extra coarse porosity, type ASTM 170-220 (EC) and stored in flasks.","Thereafter, the comminuted SIS suspension is mixed or layered with the polymer solution. In another embodiment, the SIS suspension is used with or without an intermixed polymer solution to coat a mat of mesh or nonwoven polymer. The SIS\/polymer composition is frozen and lyophilized (i.e., freeze dried). In particular, the SIS\/polymer composition is frozen at a controlled rate of temperature drop to control the size of the formed crystals. Once frozen, and without allowing the material to thaw, the lyophilization process sublimes the crystals directly to a vapor under vacuum and low temperatures. This leaves voids or interstices in the spaces previously occupied by the crystals. In the embodiments wherein the polymer component is a mat of mesh or nonwoven material, the SIS forms a foam around the polymer component, and, depending on the size of the interstices, the foam may form therethrough.","Any method for freezing the composition to a desired temperature may be used Likewise, any commercially available lyophilizer may be used for the lyophilization process. One exemplary machine for performing the lyophilization process is a Virtis GENESIS\u2122 Series lyophilizer that is commercially available from SP Industries, Inc. (Gardiner, N.Y.).","The process parameters of the aforedescribed fabrication process may be varied to produce scaffolds of varying pore sizes and material densities. For example, the rate at which the suspension is frozen, the amount of water present in the suspension, and the compactness of the ECM material each may be varied to produce scaffolds of varying pore sizes and material densities.","For instance, to produce scaffolds having a relatively large pore size and a relatively low material density, the composition may be frozen at a slow, controlled rate (e.g., \u22121\u00b0 C.\/min or less) to a temperature of about \u221220\u00b0 C., followed by lyophilization of the resultant mass. To produce scaffolds having a relatively small pore size and a relatively high material density, the SIS suspension may be tightly compacted by centrifuging the material to remove a portion of the liquid (e.g., water) in a substantially uniform manner prior to mixing with the polymer component. If desired, the fibers of the hybrid foams may be crosslinked, for example physically, chemically, or enzymatically, to increase mechanical strength of the scaffold.","Additionally, because of the porosity of the scaffolds, the scaffolds of the present disclosure may be used to deliver various biologically active agents to a damaged tissue, in addition to those already present in the ECM, including one or more exogenous biologically-derived agents or substances, one or more cell types, one or more biological lubricants, one or more biocompatible inorganic materials, one or more biocompatible synthetic polymers and one or more biopolymers. Various biologically active agents can be added to the foams, for example, prior to lyophilization, or subsequent to lyophilization by adsorption onto the surface or back filling into the foams after the foams are made. For example, the pores of the foam may be partially or completely filled with biocompatible resorbable synthetic polymers or biopolymers (such as collagen or elastin) or biocompatible inorganic materials (such as hydroxyapatite) and combinations thereof.","\u201cBioactive agents\u201d include one or more of the following: chemotactic agents; therapeutic agents (e.g. antibiotics, steroidal and non-steroidal analgesics and anti-inflammatories, anti-rejection agents such as immunosuppressants and anti-cancer drugs); various proteins (e.g. short chain peptides, bone morphogenic proteins, glycoprotein and lipoprotein); cell attachment mediators; biologically active ligands; integrin binding sequence; ligands; various growth and\/or differentiation agents (e.g. epidermal growth factor, IGF-I, IGF-II, TGF-\u03b2 I-III, growth and differentiation factors, vascular endothelial growth factors, fibroblast growth factors, platelet derived growth factors, insulin derived growth factor and transforming growth factors, parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone related peptide, bFGF; TGF superfamily factors; BMP-2; BMP-4; BMP-6; BMP-12; sonic hedgehog; GDF5; GDF6; GDF8; PDGF); small molecules that affect the upregulation of specific growth factors; tenascin-C; hyaluronic acid; chondroitin sulfate; fibronectin; decorin; thromboelastin; thrombin-derived peptides; heparin-binding domains; heparin; heparan sulfate; DNA fragments and DNA plasmids.

The slurry is placed within a beaker on a stirring plate for approximately 3 minutes to ensure that the SIS is evenly dispersed in the suspension.","A polymer solution of 95:5 weight ratio solution of 60\/40 PLA\/PCL is made and poured into a flask. The flask is placed in a water bath, stirring at 60-70EC for 5 hrs. The solution is filtered using an extraction thimble, extra coarse porosity, type ASTM 170-220 (EC) and stored in flasks.","An equal amount of the polymer solution is added to the SIS slurry, to form an SIS\/polymer mixture. The mixture is stirred on a stirring plate to make sure that the SIS and polymer are evenly dispersed in the suspension.","The porous scaffolds are obtained by freezing a comminuted SIS suspension at a slow, controlled rate (\u22121\u00b0 C.\/min or less) to \u221220\u00b0 C., followed by lyophilization, as follows: a slow-freeze ethanol bath is prepared by pouring enough ethanol to obtain about a 1 centimeter head in a flat-bottomed plastic container large enough to hold four 24-well culture plates. The container is placed in a \u221220\u00b0 C. freezer. Under a sterile hood using sterile conditions, an approximately 3 ml aliquot of the comminuted SIS\/polymer material is placed in each well of the tissue culture plates. The culture plates are then placed into the ethanol freeze bath and allowed to freeze overnight.","The frozen plates are then removed from the ethanol bath and placed in a suitable lyophilizer, such as the Virtis GENESIS\u2122 Series lyophilizer described above. The parameters used in the lyophilization process include a first period at a primary drying temperature of 13\u00b0 C. for 8 hours, followed by a second period at a secondary drying temperature of 35\u00b0 C. for 4 hours.","The resulting foam may be shaped or sculpted for the particular application. It is also understood that the mold could be provided in the desired shape, reducing or obviating the need for sculpting or trimming.","While Example 1 is directed to porous SIS\/polymer scaffolds having a relatively large pore size, it is understood that the freezing and lyophilization profiles may be adjusted to produce scaffolds of desired size. Copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/195,354 entitled \u201cPorous Extracellular Matrix Scaffold and Method\u201d, already incorporated by reference, provides various freezing and lyophilization profiles for the control of porosity.","An SIS slurry and a polymer solution are prepared as in Example 1. However, rather than mixing a solution of polymer with the SIS, the solution of the polymer is layered over the mass. The layered mixture is then frozen and lyophilized as in Example 1, forming a foam having several layers of different mechanical and biological composition. However, because the foam layers are formed together and expand somewhat into the interstices of the adjacent layer, there would not be a discrete demarcation between the synthetic foam and the ECM foam. Allowing the layers to mix slightly prior to lyophilization will increase the width of the transition zone between the layers.","In this example, a layered construct is formed wherein the scaffold has an SIS foam component and a synthetic mat component.","An SIS slurry is prepared as in Example 1. Next, a 2 cm\u00d72 cm piece of a 90\/10 PGA\/PLA mat is presoaked in water and then placed in the beaker with the SIS slurry. The 90\/10 PGA\/PLA piece is fully immersed within the slurry, resulting in an SIS-coated mat, having a thick coating of the SIS material on the synthetic mat. Several such SIS-coated 90\/10 PGA\/PLA mats are prepared. The coated mats are immediately transferred to a \u221280\u00b0 C. freezer. After freezing, the coated mats are lyophilized as in Example 1.","While 90\/10 PGA\/PLA is used for the mat in this example, it is understood that the additional structural component can be made of any biocompatible material, including bioabsorbable materials such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polydioxanone (PDO), trimethylene carbonate (TMC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), copolymers or blends thereof. Furthermore, it is understood that additional structure may be provided by a variety of woven and nonwoven felts, meshes, textiles or other materials. As with the synthetic foam component, the composition of the additional structural component may be selected to provide an appropriate resorption rate.","An SIS-coated 90\/10 PGA\/PLA mat is prepared as in Example 3. The SIS-coated 90\/10 PGA\/PLA mat is \u201cneedled\u201d using stainless steel needle pad (having a plastic base with several closely spaced, about 1 mm apart, stainless steel needles). The needling procedure involved applying the wet hybrid implant to the needle pad and applying thumb pressure to drive the needles through the thickness of the implant. The needling is believed to enhance mechanical entangling between the synthetic and SIS portions of the hybrid scaffold, resulting in between adherence of the layers. The implant is then transferred to the \u221280\u00b0 C. freezer, and subsequently lyophilized, as in Example 3.  shows a similar foam made with a VICRYL\u00ae mat.  is also similar, having several layers of VICRYL\u00ae.","An SIS slurry is prepared as in Example 1. 2 cm diameter 90\/10 PGA\/PLA mats are placed into individual wells of a six well tissue culture plate. 4 mL of the SIS slurry is pipetted onto each 90\/10 PGA\/PLA mat. The plate is centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes. The water is decanted off and another 2 mL of the slurry is added and the plates are centrifuged in the same way. This treatment resulted in an approximately 1 mm thick coating of SIS on the 90\/10 PGA\/PLA disk. Some of these implants are needled in the same way as described in Example 4. Others were not needled at all. The implants are then frozen and lyophilized as described in Example 3.  shows a similar foam using VICRYL\u00ae.","As can be seen from the forgoing description, the concepts of the present disclosure provide numerous advantages. For example, the concepts of the present disclosure provide for the fabrication of a porous implantable scaffold which may have varying mechanical properties to fit the needs of a given scaffold design. For instance, the pore size and the material density may be varied to produce a scaffold having a desired mechanical configuration. In particular, such variation of the pore size and the material density of the scaffold is particularly useful when designing a scaffold which provides for a desired amount of cellular migration therethrough, while also providing a desired amount of structural rigidity. Additionally, by selecting an appropriate polymer, mechanical strength and resorption rates can be controlled, to provide mechanical support for a desired length of time subsequent to implantation.","While the disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and has herein be described in detail.
