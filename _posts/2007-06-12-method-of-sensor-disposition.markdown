title: Method of sensor disposition
abstract: A process is provided for disposing a sensor in an environment for optimally obtaining characteristic measurements. The process includes modeling covariant sets of environment elements that correspond to conditions of the environment and of sensor elements that correspond to characteristic functionalities of the sensor. The process further includes covariantly coupling the environmental elements with the sensor elements to produce a third set of configuration elements; and combining the configuration elements to obtain a fitness function parameter. The process may additionally include adjusting the environment elements and the sensor elements; repeating operations for covariantly coupling and combining until obtaining the fitness function parameter over a defined region of the environment within a set of fitness function parameters. Also, the process may include determining an extreme value within the set of fitness function parameters, which may also include optimizing the fitness function parameter as an optimum value with a genetic algorithm over the set of fitness function parameters.

In particular, the invention relates to integration of cellular automata and a genetic search algorithm together with a fitness landscape.","Measuring pressure and velocity characteristics in an environment that may include boundary layer separation requires careful disposition of instrument sensors in order to adequately characterize the flow-field phenomena. Placement of sensors involves evaluation of types and capabilities of sensors, as well as the environment whose characteristics are to be measured. These sundry considerations can represent a significant challenge, particularly for optimization by minimizing the quantity and intrusiveness of the instrumentalities being employed.","Conventional procedures for sensor displacement yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, the process disclosed herein provides for disposing a sensor in an environment for optimally obtaining characteristic measurements. The embodiments include modeling covariant sets of environment elements that correspond to conditions of the environment and of sensor elements that correspond to characteristic functionalities of the sensor. The embodiments further include covariantly coupling the environmental elements with the sensor elements to produce a third set of configuration elements; and combining the configuration elements to obtain a fitness function.","Other various embodiments alternatively or additionally provide for adjusting the environment elements and the sensor elements; repeating operations for covariantly coupling and combining until obtaining the fitness function over a defined region of the environment within a set of fitness function parameters. Additionally, other various embodiments alternatively or additionally provide for determining an extreme value within the set of fitness function parameters, which may also include optimizing the fitness function as an optimum value with a genetic algorithm over that set.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","As provided by the embodiments to be described, a suite of three algorithms provide a software capability to optimize selection, placement and orientation of a sensor in a flow-field. A threat detector for platform or area protection represents an application example. Two of the algorithms are established in the applied mathematics community, entailing a cellular automata based fluid model and a genetic search algorithm.","A third algorithm involves the concept of a fitness landscape, discussed in detail herein, heretofore unknown to sensor placement and thus novel to such applications. In this disclosure, the terms optimized and optimal in the colloquial sense connote a maximized or maximal state, respectively. Thus, the sensor placement problem generically is recognized to represent a constrained optimization problem leading to sub-optimal solutions.","A 2004 DARPA report on sensor metrics, included findings that (a) sensor requirements are ill defined, (b) sensors need to have multiple operating modes allowing variability in sensor capabilities to meet operational needs, (c) testing and characterization is outdated, and (d) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are essential for development, testing and evaluation of chemical-biological sensors. The report concluded that sensor performance characterization is most meaningful when done with the sensor operating in a real-world environment. However, the report also acknowledged that the ideal of generating ROC curves requires \u201ca very large amount of field data, which is [sic] difficult and expensive to acquire\u201d (p. 10). The report further identified the key sensor metrics of sensitivity, probability of correct detection, false positive rate and response time.","Artisans of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that ROC curves represent a graphical measure of sensitivity for binary discrimination. Such ROC curves may be used to represent ratios between rates of true positives (a condition correctly categorized as satisfying the threshold) and false positives (a condition incorrectly categorized as satisfying the threshold). These may be mapped into ROC space as a predictive mechanism of correct categorization.","A sensor's performance depends upon the following broad areas: 1) Operational environment; 2) Innate sensor design; and 3) Sensor-environment interface or coupling (sampling efficiency). A software tool, as disclosed herein, addresses these performance areas in an integrated fashion through a suite of algorithms that incorporate sensor design functions, environmental functions and a novel approach that characterizes the coupling efficiency and design functionalities of the sensor. This approach may be termed simulated performance. The algorithm is completely generic and as such can fundamentally address the performance characteristics implicit in ROC curves.","Outputs of this algorithm are optimized sensor type selection for given environments and optimized sensor placement around objects for monitoring air quality. Consequently, the procedure provides a capability that can have important applications in industry, fire protection, and chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) defense.","The procedure is iterative, as described further herein. In particular, a value may be assigned to the different possible configurations by employing a concept\u2014inspired by theoretical biology\u2014known as fitness. In summary, the fitness of a biological species determines its ability to survive and pass on its genetic pool to subsequent generations (i.e., its performance). Naturally, its survivability depends upon its innate compatibility with its local environment and its ability to adapt to environmental changes.","In theoretical biology, fitness has been mathematically abstracted by introducing the concept of a fitness function that plays the role of a genome (string of genetic information) whose variations due to mutation or mating generate a fitness landscape. In the parlance of genetics, a fitness landscape abstracts the concept of phenotypic plasticity, where high plasticity implies strong environmental consequences reflected in the genotypes or phenotypes and fitness translates to enhanced replication rates. See e.g., C. M. Readys et al., \u201cCombinatorial Landscapes\u201d, v. 44, iss. 1, pp. 3-54, 2002.","Mathematically, a fitness landscape is a locus of points (e.g., a surface if the function is continuous) that is composed of mappings of each and every variation of the state vector onto the real numbers. This mapping quantifies value or fitness. As an example, the Royal Roads Fitness Function (RRFF) may be applied to this concept of the sensor placement problem. See e.g., E. van Nimwegen et al., \u201cStatistical Dynamics of the Royal Road Genetic Algorithm\u201d, v. 229, iss. 1-2, pp. 41-102, November 1999. The RRFF consists of a state vector (genome) of 1s and 0s (genes).","By simply summing all of the elements (the fitness map), a numerical value (e.g., an integer) can be obtained that may be interpreted as a measure of fitness. Thus, by changing or rearranging any of the 1s or 0s, a new fitness can be determined and compared. There exists possibility for equal valued finesses; this is termed neutrality. The collection of all fitness values associated with all elemental variations constitutes (in this case discrete) the fitness landscape.","The concept of a fitness landscape thus traces back to Darwin's seminal notion of natural selection and is the biological analogue of a cost or utility function found in optimization theory. It provides a conceptually simple way to account for environmental effects upon the dynamical states of systems when exposed to changing conditions. In complexity-theoretic language, the environment affects a top-down influence upon the system elements favoring particular elemental configurations. Conversely\u2014and equally important\u2014is the idea that the individual elements have a collective bottom-up effect upon their host environment as well.","This mutual coupling between scales has profound consequence throughout the sciences and constitutes the essence of complexity theory. Accordingly, fitness landscapes have found ubiquitous utility in analyzing the global dynamics of many-body and complex systems. Landscape theory also provides opportunities for study in many fields of applied and pure mathematics; e.g., combinatorial enumeration, discrete and continuous topology, as well as graph theory.","Various exemplary embodiments utilize the concept of a fitness landscape that characterizes both the coupling of sensors to their local environment as well as the design and\/or selection of appropriate sensors for given environmental conditions. The first component of the software suit thus involves simulating the environment. Toward this objective, a cellular automata (CA) based flow module may be provided to simulate bulk flow around mobile and stationary structures for varying meteorological conditions.","CA represents a mature technique that has been developed and applied in academic and industrial circles and has fostered understanding in such diverse fields as crack formation-and-propagation, traffic flow, fluids engineering, and biosystems, among others. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Lagrangian particle, or Gaussian-puff predictions and\/or direct measurement can be used to characterise envionment as well. A genetic algorithm such as simulated annealing can be used to perform global optimization on the multi-modal FLS.","The algorithmic suite may include the following four modules: cellular automata (CA), fitness landscape, genetic algorithm and interface.","I. Cellular automata (CA) module. Existing or developed CA bulk-flow capabilities may be employed as the inherent local nature of CA uniquely affords the possibility of changing simulation parameters and observing subsequent transient responses without the need for grid generation or restarting the simulation. The code can be written in modular form using open architecture principles so as to afford ease for future modifications or interfacing with other techniques such as CFD or Lagrangian particle simulations. Existing CFD data are envisioned to be utilized in conjunction with existing test data for CA development and verification.","II. The fitness landscape module. Fitness may be composed by forming the array product of two state vectors defined as follows: The first is dynamical flow-state vector, denoted as \u03c6, that represents varying environments generated by the CA module introduced above will produce a flow-field state vector of the form:\n\n\u03c6=()={\u03c6(), \u03c6(), . . . , \u03c6()}, \u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere the functional notion F[\u03c6](r,t) expressly indicates the dependence upon the independent variables of space and time. The space variable, denoted by radius vector r includes directional elements in three spatial co\u00f6rdinants described as elements in the mapping domain r\u2208. Time, denoted as a time scalar t is described as an element in domain t\u2208. With respect to these independent variables, optimization ensues to ascertain optimized placement. The functions \u03c6represent environmental variable that change in space and time, e.g., density, velocity, pressure and temperature.\n","The second state vector involved in generating the fitness landscape characterizes the various possible sensor capabilities and limits, denoted as \u03c3. In defining this state vector, the ielement is physically conjugate to the ielement of the flow-state vector \u03c6 for reasons explained subsequently. The sensor state is described by the relation:\n\n\u03c3=[\u03c3]={\u03c3, \u03c3, . . . , \u03c3}, \u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3represents the sensor state for its accompanying parameter \u03bbfor each value i=1,2, . . . n.\n","The sensor state vector \u03c3 is considered static in being spatially and temporally independent. However, this vector is parametrically dynamic by affording variation of sensor design through the parameters \u03bb, such as thresholds and sampling fraction. The combination of eqns. (1) and (2) produces a function for application-specific sensor design as well by optimizing upon the design parameters.","The fitness function can be determined, for example, by taking the array product (elemental multiplication) of the sensor and flow terms that are defined as:\n\n\u03a6[()]()\u2261{\u03c6()\u03c3, \u03c6()\u03c3, . . . , \u03c6()\u03c3}, \u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere the parameter vector \u03bb represents the sensor characteristics, which may be combined with the spatial and temporal variations in the flow-field. In this form, the spatial-temporal dependence and the parametric dependencies are shown explicitly. These dependencies constitute the multivariate nature of this problem. Thus, eqn. (3) represents a high-dimensional configuration space that represents all combinations of all possible environmental factors coupled with all relevant sensor characteristics.\n","Finally, the fitness landscape f is formed by mapping the configuration space \u03a6 onto the real numbers by an appropriate p-norm:\n\n()\u2261\u2225()\u2225=\u2225{\u03c6()\u03c3, \u03c6()\u03c3, . . . , \u03c6()\u03c3, }\u2225, \u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere geometrically, f is a high-dimensional surface whose multiple extrema represent positions of optimized placement, orientation and design. The double-bar enclosure denotes the norm magnitude of power value p, typically rendered to be an absolute value. (For example, p1-norm corresponds to addition of first-order terms, p2-norm corresponds to addition of squared terms.) The conjugation yields n-pairs of multiplied values.\n","III. A genetic algorithm, such as simulated annealing to perform global optimization on the multi-modal landscape. These are known in the art.","IV. GUI based interfaces. These are also known in the art.","In the following, an instantiation of the above procedure is provided by an illustrative example. The flow state vector \u03a6 is defined by performing a two-dimensional (2D)-simulation of the density of agent \u03c1 and the normalized flow velocity, {circumflex over (v)} along the edge of an object's surface of interest:\n\n\u03a6={\u03c1(), ()}, \u2003\u2003(5)\n\nwhere r represents a one dimensional vector demarcating the parameter of the object and t, the time chosen to interrogate.\n","In more general form, the flow state vector can be expressed, similarly to eqn. (1), as:\n\n\u03a6()={\u03c6(), \u03c6(), . . . , \u03c6()}, \u2003\u2003(6)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is the vector representing the flow state, for an m-valued group of such states. The elements in the group \u03c6, such that i=1,2, . . . m, are functions of r representing a direction vector, t representing time, and \u03bbrepresenting parameters within the flow state that remain effectively static in the temporal and spatial boundaries. Examples of such parameters may include molecular weight, thermal conductivity and heat capacity.\n","The sensor state vector a is defined by assuming a unidirectional sensor (e.g., sampling tube) that includes a sampling threshold with perfect sampling (i.e., no error occurring). The equation can be represented, differing slightly in form from eqn. (2), as:\n\n\u03c3={\u03c3(), \u03c3(), . . . , \u03c3()}, \u2003\u2003(7)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the vector representing a sensor state, for an n-valued group of such states. The elements \u03c3, such that i=1,2, . . . n, are functions of t representing time and \u03bbrepresenting parameters within the sensor state. Examples of such parameters include instrument range, dynamic response and environmental sensitivity.\n","The first element is chosen to be the inverse of the threshold for reasons to be explained subsequently. The second component is defined to be an outward normal vector {circumflex over (n)} perpendicular to the face of the sampling inlet. An example of this circumstance is depicted in .","In particular,  shows an isometric view of an instrument in a flow-field. The system  includes an axi-symmetric measuring instrument  having the outward normal vector {circumflex over (n)} . The instrument  is disposed within a flow-field having a streamline vector {circumflex over (v)} . An angle-of-attack \u03b8 (in this example) denotes angular offset between the normal vector {circumflex over (n)}  and the streamline vector {circumflex over (v)} .","In simplified form, the fitness function can be obtained through a configuration space array \u03a9 obtained by multiplying the covariant components of the flow state vector and the sensor state vector, such as by the relation:\n\n\u03a9\u2261{\u03c6\u03c3, . . . , \u03c6\u03c3}, \u2003\u2003(8)\n\nand this array can be quantified in the form of a magnitude-denoting scalar within space  for the p-norm as a fitness function:\n\n(\u03a9)\u2261\u2225\u03a9\u2225\u2208 . \u2003\u2003(9)\n","An example of this circumstance would include a flow state vector \u03a6 that includes fluid density \u03c1 and normalized velocity {circumflex over (v)} from eqn. (5), both of which varying with direction r and time t. With these flow-field elements, a state vector \u03c3 may be postulated whose elements couple to eqn. (5) in physically meaningful manner.

(11) reaches unit value upon as the sensor detecting a value that reaches (or exceeds) the threshold. (This assumes no error in the model.) Similarly, the dot product between the outward normal {circumflex over (n)} and the normalized vector {circumflex over (v)} corresponds to a value not greater than a magnitude unit due to the definition of the cosine function, i.e.,\n\n()\u00b7=cos(\u03b1()), \u2003\u2003(12)\n\nwhere \u03b1 represents the angle-of-attack between these vectors. This illustrates engineering judgment involved in assigning conjugate elements. As a result, the sensor state \u03c3 can be represented as a cosine function accounting for the angle-of-attack, denoted as \u03b1 that varies as a function of direction r and time t in relation to the normal vector {circumflex over (n)}.\n","Mapping the fitness function f involves selecting a norm, with some physical constraints available for guidance. In this notional example, the p2-norm (i.e., the Euclidian norm familiar from Pythagoras' postulate) would lose information regarding the direction of the sensor because negative value of the cosine function would be hidden by square function. Thus, a simple additive fitness function in the p1-norm may be selected in this circumstance for which the sensor points in the opposite direction to the flow (i.e., the fitness diminishes due to the negative values of the cosine function).","For this example, the fitness function f(r,t;\u03c1) varies spatially, temporally and triggered to a threshold.

The procedure begins with step  to develop adequate models to simulate bulk environmental effects, followed by step  to develop models for key sensor functionalities. Subsequently, at step  the process continues to model the physical coupling between the sensor functionalities and the environment.","In particular, at step , the resulting functions depend upon the variables over which optimization will be performed. Additionally, at step , the algorithm correlates directly with the performance areas delineated above. The process continues at step  to calculate a measure of value for the present state of the coupling and record. Then the process proceeds at step  to modify the coupling.","This modification may be accomplished by any combination of: (a) displacing the sensor, (b) changing the environment; and\/or (c) affecting a sensor design modification. Subsequently, a query at step  is performed to determine whether all desired variations have been evaluated. A negative response returns the process to repeat step  until satisfaction of the query at step , from which the process proceeds to step  to perform optimization with a standard genetic algorithm over the set of all values derived in step .
