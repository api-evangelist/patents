No. 12\/045,757, entitled \u201cFraud Mitigation through Avatar Identity Determination,\u201d filed on Mar. 11, 2008, contains subject matter related, in certain aspects, to the subject matter of the present application. The above-identified patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention is generally directed to a system and method for providing an avatar, that is, a user having an on-line alias, with a mechanism for communicating with other users electronically, and based on context, present a desired name to the target party regardless of the currently active alias of the sender. More particularly, the present invention is directed to processes and systems variously described as Alias Resolution, Name Resolution, Alias Translation, Name Translation, Alias Conversion and Name Conversion in virtual universes.","In a virtual environment, alias names are used to preserve privacy, and yet there is often a need to know the identity of the real person with whom one is talking or interacting in order to hold meetings and conduct business. The inverse is also true, where an on-line user does not want to disclose a real name and wishes for disparate target parties to know the user under disparate on-line alias names. In modern society, most on-line users have multiple on-line alias names, some of which may include real identity data. As an example, a user's business e-mail address may contain a real name, where the same user may have additional email addresses, on-line gaming aliases, virtual world aliases, and the like, which often do not include identity data. As the world of on-line communication grows smaller, most of these environments provide external communication mechanisms, such as chat, so that an alias in one environment can communicate with an alias in a disparate environment. A problem arises, however, when an Avatar\/alias needs to communicate to another on-line user, but does not wish to be known by the current on-line alias. As an example, a user currently playing World of Warcraft\u00ae may be logged-on using the alias MegaMonster. If that user has a need or desire to communicate with a business associate, it is unlikely that they would want to send an email, establish a chat session, or otherwise make contact using the identity of MegaMonster. This invention solves this problem by providing a system and method to control and manage identity presentation in on-line environments.","A virtual world is a computer-based simulated environment intended for its users to inhabit and interact via avatars. This habitation usually is represented in the form of two or three-dimensional graphical representations of humanoids (or other graphical or text-based avatars). Some, but not all, virtual worlds allow for multiple users.","The world being computer-simulated typically appears similar to the real world, with real world rules such as gravity, topography, locomotion, real-time actions, and communication. Communication has, until recently, been in the form of text, but now real-time voice communication using VOIP is available. This type of virtual world is now most common in massively multi-player on-line games (Second Life\u00ae, Entropia Universe\u00ae, The Sims On-Line\u2122, There\u2122, particularly massively multiplayer on-line role-playing games such as EverQuest\u00ae, Ultima On-Line\u2122, Lineage\u2122, World of Warcraft\u00ae, or Guild Wars\u2122. Second Life\u00ae and other on-line virtual environments present a tremendous new outlet for both structured and unstructured virtual collaboration, gaming and exploration, as well as real-life simulations in virtual spaces. These activities, along with yet to be disclosed new dimensions, in turn provide a wide open arena for creative and new marketing methods and mechanisms.","It should not be assumed that the utility of virtual worlds is limited to game playing, although that is certainly seen to be useful and valuable insofar as it has become a real economic reality with real dollars being exchanged. However, the usefulness of virtual worlds also includes the opportunity to run corporate conferences and seminars. It is also used to conduct virtual world classroom sessions. Governmental and instructional opportunities abound in the virtual world. Accordingly, it should be fully appreciated that the term \u201cvirtual\u201d as applied to this technology does not in any way make it less real or less valuable than the \u201creal\u201d world. It is really an extension of current reality. Moreover, it is an extension that greatly facilitates human communication and interaction in a non-face-to-face fashion.","The present invention allows an on-line user to specify the name or alias by which that user is known when communicating with other target users, regardless of the name or alias under which the sending user is currently logged-in. It also provides a mechanism to block messages from sending parties that are not willing to divulge real identity.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a method is given for providing appropriate and selective identities for user messages in a virtual universe, by establishing an association between a user and at least two aliases for use on different accounts in the virtual universe. A name conversion agent, having target information and user defined rules for these aliases, is enabled. A user identity is determined by the name conversion agent using the target information, selected or specified rules and the alias information.","In a further embodiment of the present invention, a computer readable medium containing program instructions thereon, for a data processing system is provided. The data processing system establishes an association between the user and at least two aliases for use on different accounts in said virtual universe. The data processing system enables a name conversion agent having target information and user defined rules for the aliases and determines a user identity via the agent, using the target information, the rules and the aliases.","In yet a further embodiment of the present invention, there is described a data processing system whose memory includes program instructions, for: (1) establishing an association between the user and at least two aliases for use on different accounts in a virtual universe; (2) enabling a name conversion agent having target information and user defined rules for the aliases; and (3) determining a user identity by the agent using the target information, the rules and the aliases.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention.","The recitation herein of desirable objects which are met by various embodiments of the present invention is not meant to imply or suggest that any or all of these objects are present as essential features, either individually or collectively, in the most general embodiment of the present invention or in any of its more specific embodiments.","The present invention is related to Ser. No. 12\/045,757, \u201cSystem for Fraud Mitigation through Avatar Identity Determination\u201d where methods are described to ascertain the true identity of the human user behind an Avatar or other on-line alias. This invention expands upon the previous methods and provides controls for a message sender and target in managing name\/alias presentation.","In order to better understand the present invention and the advantages that it produces, it is useful to provide descriptions of some of the VU concepts and terms that are encountered. The list below is exemplary and is not intended to be all inclusive.\n\n","Note too that, throughout this disclosure, for clarity of presentation only, reference is made to an individual or avatar, which is a digital representative of the individual. However, it should be noted that this term not only applies to an individual, but also to any computerized processes that may execute on behalf of the individual, using the same credentials and capabilities of the individual that owns\/controls the process. In general, this embodies many forms, such as prescheduled, automatically running maintenance processes, system level processes (owned by the system administrator), etc. In all cases, this process is treated like an avatar, with the same inputs and outputs, regardless of whether the credentials come directly from an individual or from a computerized process acting in his or her stead.","The present invention allows an on-line user with multiple virtual identities (alias names) to communicate with other users while presenting a desired identity to a target party. As an example, real user John Doe may have a work account at IBM of jdoe@ibm.com (see reference numeral  in ), a Second Life\u00ae account with an alias of J_Firestorm (see reference numeral  in ), and an Instant Messenger (IM) account with an alias of JD1977 (see reference numeral  in ). Each of these accounts is associated with John Doe, but each uses a different on-line alias name.","The present invention enables user John Doe to communicate with others identifying himself as any of the alias names (see reference numeral  in ), regardless of which alias is currently active. As an example, if John Doe is currently in an IM session and sends a note to a colleague at work, he could address such a note as coming from jdoe@ibm.com, even though the currently active IM ID is JD1977.","Name service solutions, such as Domain Name Services (DNS), exist in which multiple clients can refer to a single server by different names, and each client has the server name translated and connects to the server. However, the present invention is used so that the clients do not actually have to know the real name of the physical server in order to connect to a service.  depicts a name services scenario for clients ( and ) using name service  in order to access server .","In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is enabled through the use of agent code and a name conversion database. A Name Conversion Agent runs on the client machine and, based on message context (target information) and user defined rules, either passes the message as is or modifies the sender's identify information according to the rules. In another embodiment, this functionality is integrated into the individual applications or is accomplished using an application programming interface (API).","Additionally, in preferred embodiments there is a registration process in which user John Doe is only permitted to use alias IDs that he actually owns, and is not permitted to spoof another user's alias names. This is accomplished by sending a onetime message to the agent (see reference numeral  in ) from each active ID. For example, during an IM session a user sends a message to NameAgent@IM to register new IM name. The Agent recognizes this as a registration request and adds JD1977 to the alias database (see reference numeral  in ). Upon registration of an ID, John Doe then has the ability, through the agent, to establish rules for that ID.  depicts high level component interaction.","The present invention expands upon existing name services by providing a client with the ability to present a preferred identity to either an existing name service, to a server, or to another client, regardless of the current active client ID.","As each alias is registered and rules are configured, and the data is written to a name conversion database that stores each contextual relationship, thus establishing name association rules. In a preferred embodiment, data from the Name Conversion Database is cached by the agent such that name conversions are made very rapidly without the need to read the database for each message sent. The following describes some exemplary name conversion rules.","The rules now described are exemplary of rules that are desirable for use by the Name Conversion Agent. In preferred embodiments there are two rule sets: one describing specific relationship rules and another providing global rules. Upon receipt of a message, the agent first looks for a specific rule and applies it, followed by scanning global rules if no specific rule was found, and finally passing the message as-is if no rule was found. The following are examples of such rules.","\u201cSend-message-as\u201d function (send using any valid registered alias)\u2014This rule allows the sender to specify, in real-time, the sending ID that is associated with an outbound message.","Use specific sender name for messages to specific target environment\u2014This rule governs all outbound traffic to a specific target environment. As an example, all messages sent to ibm.com are provided with a sending address of jdoe@ibm.com and all messages sent to Second Life\u00ae are provided with a sending address of J-Firestorm.","Use specific sender name to specific target name\u2014This rule governs all outbound traffic to a specific target name. As an example, any messages sent to rick@ibm.com are provided with a sending address of jdoe@ibm.com and any messages sent to rick@aol.com are provided with a sending address of JD1977.","Always translate outbound name to real name\u2014In the absence of any specific rule, this global rule would identify the sender by real name.","Always translate in-world name to in-world name\u2014In the absence of any specific rule, this global rule uses the current contextually based name (for example, IBM name, Second Life\u00ae name, IM name)","Always translate other-world name to other-world name\u2014In the absence of any specific rule, this global rule uses the target environment contextually based name. For example, a message sent to Second Life\u00ae is provided with a sending address of the sender's Second Life\u00ae identity.","Always send using current alias or name\u2014In the absence of any specific rule, this global rule uses the currently active ID as the sender ID (for example, if sending from IM, use sender's IM name).","Block messages from all\/some in-bound\/out-bound unresolvable alias names\u2014In a preferred embodiment, both a sender and receiver have the option of not sending and\/or receiving messages from other parties that do not have a real name on record.","It should be noted that each of these rules are used individually and\/or jointly to provide the desired outcome.","It should be further noted that the above rules can be applied:\n\n","For example, when interactions occur during working hours in the home zone, translation is performed accordingly; on a Sunday afternoon, no translation occurs. Time of year or season is also employed.","In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a business method that performs the process steps of the invention on a subscription, advertising, and\/or fee basis. That is, a service provider, such as a Solution Integrator, offers to provide a mechanism for providing selectively appropriate identity for user messages in a virtual universe. In this case, the service provider creates, maintains, supports, et cetera, a computer infrastructure that performs the process steps of the invention for one or more customers. In return, the service provider receives payment from the customer(s) under a subscription and\/or fee agreement and\/or the service provider receives payment from the sale of advertising content to one or more third parties.","One embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in . In a first step (), there is established an association between a user and at least two aliases for use on different accounts in a virtual universe. In a second step (), a name conversion agent having target information and user defined rules for the aliases is enabled. In a third step (), user identity is determined by the agent using the target information, the rules and aliases.","In summary, this invention provides a convenient mechanism for sending messages to target parties using a desired sender alias without the need to start or change active applications, and is presently very helpful and its utility is only expected to grow as the number of alias identities each individual person owns continues to increase.","In any event an end user environment in which the present invention operates is shown in . The present invention operates through a data processing environment which effectively includes one or more of the computer elements shown in . While  is more suited for illustrating an end user environment, it is noted that a similar, albeit typically much larger, data processing system is connected via the Internet to the local environment depicted. In particular, a similar non-volatile memory  is typically present at the server end to contain program instructions for carrying out the virtual reality program which are loaded into a corresponding main memory  for execution. Turning to a local focus, computer  includes central processing unit (CPU)  which accesses programs and data stored within random access memory . Memory  is typically volatile in nature and accordingly such systems are provided with nonvolatile memory typically in the form of rotatable magnetic memory . While memory  is preferably a nonvolatile magnetic device, other media may be employed. CPU  communicates with users at consoles such as terminal  through Input\/Output unit . Terminal  is typically one of many, if not thousands, of consoles in communication with computer  through one or more I\/O unit . In particular, console unit  is shown as having included therein device  for reading media of one or more types such as CD-ROM  shown in . Media , an example of which is shown in , comprises any convenient device including, but not limited to, magnetic media, optical storage devices and chips such as flash memory devices or so-called thumb drives. Disk  also represents a more generic distribution medium in the form of electrical signals used to transmit data bits which represent codes for the instructions discussed herein. While such transmitted signals may be ephemeral in nature they still, nonetheless constitute a physical medium carrying the coded instruction bits and are intended for permanent capture at the signal's destination or destinations.","While the invention has been described in detail herein in accordance with certain preferred embodiments thereof, many modifications and changes therein may be effected by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The subject matter which is regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification.
