Furthermore, it is required that the present invention is understood, not simply by the actual terms used but by the meanings of each term lying within.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In reference to , an electronic device  includes a tuner , a mobile communication unit , a demodulator , a network interface , a signal processor , a display , an audio output unit , an input device , a storage , a controller  and an external signal receiver . The electronic device  may be a personal computer system such as a desktop, laptop, tablet and handheld computer. The electronic device  may be a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, smart phone, digital broadcasting terminal, PDA (Personal Digital Assistants), PMP (Portable Multimedia Player), navigation and the like or a fixed-type electric appliance such as a digital TV and the like.","The tuner  selects one of RF (Radio Frequency) broadcasting signals received via an antenna, corresponding to a channel selected by a user, and it converts the selected RF broadcasting signal into a middle frequency signal or a baseband video or audio signal. For example, when the selected RF broadcasting signal is a digital broadcasting signal, the tune  converts the selected RF broadcasting signal into a digital IF signal (DIF). When it is an analog broadcasting signal, the tuner  converts the selected RF broadcasting signal into an analog baseband video or video signal (CVBS SIF). That is, the tuner  may process the digital broadcasting signal or analog broadcasting signal. The analog baseband video or audio signal (CVBS SIF) outputted from the tuner  may be inputted to the signal processor  directly.","In addition, the tuner  may be receive a RF broadcasting with a single carrier according to ATSC (Advanced Television System Committee) or a RF broadcasting signal with a plurality of carriers according to DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting).","An electronic device  according to another embodiment of the present invention may include at least two tuners. When the at least two tuners are provided, a second tuner selects one of RF broadcasting signals received via the antenna, which is corresponding to a channel selected by the user, like a first tuner, and the second tuner converts the selected RF broadcasting signal into a middle frequency signal or baseband video or audio signal.","In addition, the second tuner sequentially selects RF broadcasting signals of the received RF signals, which are corresponding to all of the stored broadcasting channels via a channel memory function, and it converts them into the middle frequency signals or baseband video\/audio signals. The second tuner may perform conversion of all of the broadcasting channels periodically. Because of that, the electronic device  may provide images of broadcasting signals converted by the first tuner and it may provide a thumbnail type of images converted by the second tuner simultaneously. In this case, the first tuner converts a main RF broadcasting signal selected by the user into a middle frequency signal or baseband video\/audio signal, and the second tuner sequentially and periodically selects the other RF broadcasting signals except the main RF broadcasting signal and it converts them into middle frequency signals or baseband video\/audio signals.","The demodulator  receives a digital IF signal (DIF) converted by the tuner  and it performs demodulation of DIF. For example, when the digital IF signal outputted from the tuner  is an ATSC system, the demodulator  performs 8-VBS (8-Vestigial Side Band) demodulation. Alternatively, when the digital IF signal outputted from the tuner  is a DVB system, the demodulator  performs demodulation of COFDMA (Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation).","The demodulator  may perform channel decoding. For that, the demodulator  may include a trellis decoder, a de-interleaver and a reed Solomon decoder to perform trellis decoding, de-interleaving and reed Solomon decoding.","After performing the demodulation and channel decoding, the demodulator  may output a stream signal (TS). At this time, the stream signal may be a signal multiplexed of video, audio and data signals. For example, the stream signal may be MPEG-2 is (Transport Stream) multiplexed of MPEG-2 format video signal, Dolby AC-3 format audio signal. Specifically, MPEG-2 Ts may include 4 byte header and 184 bite payload.","The stream signal outputted from the demodulator  may be inputted to the signal processor . After performing demultiplexing and signal processing, the signal processor  outputs an image to the transparent display  and it outputs a sound to the audio output unit .","In case of the digital broadcasting receiver having at least two tuners, the corresponding number of demodulators to the at least two tuners may be provided. The demodulators may be provided independently based on ATSC and DVB system.","The mobile communication unit  transmits and receives a wireless signal to and from at least one of a base station, an external terminal, a server. The wireless signal may include various types of data according to a speech call signal, video telephony call signal and texture\/multimedia message transmitting\/receiving.","The network interface  receives packets from the network and transmits the received packets to the network. That is, the network interface  receives IP packets configured to transport broadcasting data from the service providing server via the network. Here, the broadcasting data includes contents, an update message configured to notify contents updating, metadata, service information, software codes and A\/V data. The service information may include service information on a real-time broadcasting service and service information on an internet service. Here, the internet service means a service provided via the internet, for example, a Cod (Content's on Demand) service, YouTube service, an information service for weather, news, community information and search, an entertainment service for a game and karaoke, and a communication service for TV mail and TV SMS (Short Message Service). As a result, the digital broadcasting receiver according to the present invention may include a network TV, web TV and broadband TV. Also, the broadcasting service may include an internet service as well as a broadcasting service provided via terrestrial, satellite and cable.","The controller  implements commands and it performs an operation related to the electronic device .

Here, the separable storage medium includes a CD-ROM, PC-CARD, memory card, floppy disc, magnetic tape and network component.","The display  may put into operation, connected with the controller . The display  may be represented to be an organic light emitting panel or plasma panel.","The display  may display a graphic user interface (GUI)  configured to provide an easy interface usable between the user of the electronic device and the operating system or a predetermined application implemented on the operating system. The GUI  represents a program, a file and operation options as graphic image. The graphic image may include a window, field, a dialog box, menu, icon, button, curser and scrollbar. Such images may be aligned in a layout defined in advance or they may be generated dynamically to help the user's specific handling. During the operation, the user may select and enable the image to start functions and works related to the variety of graphic images. For example, the user may select a button to implement opening, closing, minimizing and maximizing of a window or an icon to start a specific program.","The input device  may be a touch screen disposed on or in front of the display . The touch screen may be integral with the display  or an independent element. The touch screen may be named as touch screen display. When the touch screen is disposed in front of the display , the user may operate the GUI  directly. For example, the user may place only his or her finger on an object which will be controlled and there is no one-to-one relation on a touch pad.","The touch pad is placed on another plane, separated from the display . For example, the display  is typically located on a vertical plane and the touch pad is located in a horizontal plane. This allows usage of the touch pad less intuitive and it is quite difficult, compared with the touch screen. In addition to the touch screen, the input device  may be a multipoint input device.","The controller  may recognize a gesture  applied to the input device  and it may control the electronic device  based on this gesture . Here, the gesture may be defined as predetermined interaction with the input device , which is mapped onto at least one specific computing operation. The gesture  may be generated by a variety of human fingers, specifically, motion of human fingers. Alternatively, the gesture may be generated by a stylus in addition to the motion of human fingers.","The input device  receives the gesture  and the controller  implements commands configured to perform operations related to the gesture . Moreover, the storage  may include a gesture operation program  which may be a part of the operating system or auxiliary application. The gesture operation program  includes a series of commands to recognize generation of the gesture  and\/or to instruct which step has to be taken in response to the gesture  to at least one software agent.","When the user generates one or more gestures, the input device  transports gesture information to the controller . Using a command transported from the storage , specifically, the gesture operation program , the controller  translates the gesture and it controls each component of the electronic device such as the storage , the display , the audio output unit , the signal processor , the network interface  and the input device. The gesture  may be detected as command for performing operation of an application stored in the storage , for modifying the GUI object displayed on the display , for modifying data stored in the storage  and for performing operation of the network interface  and the signal processor. For example, such commands may be related to zooming, panning, scrolling, page turning, rotating, size adjusting, image channel changing, content receiving and internet access. In addition, the commands may be related to starting of a specific program, opening of a file or document, menu viewing, selecting, command implementing, log-on an internet site system, allowing of an identified person to have access to a limited area of a computer system, loading of user profile related to user preference arrangement on a wall paper and\/or the like.","A variety of difference gestures may be usable. For example, the gesture may be a single point or multipoint gesture, a static or dynamic gesture, a continuous or segmented gesture, and\/or the like. The single point gesture is a gesture performed according to a single touch point. For example, this gesture is performed according to single touch such as a single human finger, palm or stylus. The multipoint gesture is a gesture performed according to multiple points. For example, this gesture is performed according to plural touches such as plural human fingers, human fingers and palm, human fingers and stylus, plural styli and\/or combination of them. The static gesture is a gesture having no motion and the dynamic gesture is a gesture having motion. The continuous gesture is a gesture is a gesture performed according to a single stroke and the segmented gesture is a gesture performed according to an independent sequence of steps or strokes.","The object and the touch on the touch screen have a variety of different patterns, typically. For example, a single point gesture on the touch screen includes a down event and a following up event performed at an identical location or almost identical location of the down event. The dynamic gesture on the touch screen includes a down event and at least one dragging event following the down event and an up event following the at least one dragging event.","According to some embodiments, a parameter is used to describe a process in which a human finger approaches to the touch screen display to touch the touch screen display and to recede from the touch screen display. This parameter may be at least one function of the distance between the human finger and the touch screen display, the pressure of the human finger applied to the touch screen display, the touch area between the human finger and the touch screen, the voltage between the human finger and the touch screen, the capacitance between the human finger and the touch screen display and physical parameters.","According to some embodiments, when the size of the parameter between the human finger and the touch screen display (for example, the capacitance) is higher than a predetermined threshold value level, the down event is performed. While the parameter is the predetermined threshold value level or higher, with a curser position corresponding to the human finger moved from a position \u2018A\u2019 to a position \u2018B\u2019, the dragging is performed.
