No. 61\/546,747, filed on 13 Oct. 2011, herein incorporated by reference.","The Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) is a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by aldosterone and regulates the expression of many genes involved in electrolyte homeostasis and cardiovascular disease. Increased circulating aldosterone increases blood pressure through its effects on natriuresis, with potentially additional effects on the brain, heart and vasculature. In addition, hyperaldosteronism have been linked to many pathophysiological processes resulting in renal and cardiovascular disease. While hyperaldosteronism is commonly caused by aldosterone-producing adenomas, resistant hypertensive patients frequently suffer from increased aldosterone levels often termed as \u201cAldosterone Breakthrough\u201d as a result of increases in serum potassium or residual AT1R activity. Hyperaldosteronism and aldosterone breakthrough typically results in increased MR activity and MR antagonists have been shown to be effective as anti-hypertensive agents and also in the treatment of heart failure and primary hyperaldosteronism.","In addition, in visceral tissues, such as the kidney and the gut, MR regulates sodium retention, potassium excretion and water balance in response to aldosterone. MR expression in the brain also appears to play a role in the control of neuronal excitability, in the negative feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and in the cognitive aspects of behavioral performance (Castren et al., J. of Neuroendocrinology, 3, 461-66 (1993)).","Eplerenone and spironolactone are two MR antagonists that have been shown to be efficacious in treating cardiovascular disease, particularly hypertension and heart failure (RALES Investigators (1999) The Effect of Spironolactone on Morbidity and Mortality in Patients with Severe Heart Failure, N. Engl. J. Med., 1999, 341(10):709-717; Pitt B, et al., EPHESUS investigator (2003) Eplerenone, a Selective Aldosterone Blocker, in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction After Myocardial Infarction, N. Engl. J. Med., 348(14):1309-1321; Funder J W., (2010) Eplerenone in Chronic Renal Disease: the EVALUATE trial, Hypertens. Res., 33(6):539-40.). Moreover, multiple studies have shown that treatment with spironolactone or eplerenone significantly lower systolic blood pressure in mild-moderate, obese, systolic, PHA, and resistant hypertensive patients (Calhoun D A, et al., (2008) Effectiveness of the Selective Aldosterone Blocker, Eplerenone, in Patients with Resistant Hypertension, J.

Hypertens., 2008 November-December; 2(6):462-8; Huang B S, et al., (2010) Central Neuronal Activation and Pressor Responses Induced by Circulating ANG II: role of the brain aldosterone-\u201couabain\u201d pathway, Am.

J. Heart Fail., 12(6):617-22).","Evidence in preclinical models also suggests that MR antagonists would be efficacious in treating the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis (Takai, S. et al, (2005) Eplerenone inhibits atherosclerosis in nonhuman primates. Hypertension. 46(5):1135-9; Tirosh, A. et al., GK. (2010) Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the metabolic syndrome. Curr Hypertens Rep. 2010 August; 12(4):252-7).","Also, published PCT application WO 2002\/17895 disclosed that aldosterone antagonists are useful in the treatment of subjects suffering from one or more cognitive dysfunctions including, but not limited to psychoses, cognitive disorders (such as memory disturbances), mood disorders (such as depression and bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders and personality disorders.","Elevation in aldosterone levels, or excess stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptors, is linked to several physiological disorders or pathologic disease states, including Conn's Syndrome; primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism, increased sodium retention, increased magnesium and potassium excretion (diuresis), increased water retention, hypertension (isolated systolic and combined systolic\/diastolic), arrhythmias, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial infarction, Bartter's Syndrome, and disorders associated with excess catecholamine levels. (Hadley, M. E., ENDOCRINOLOGY, 2Ed., pp. 366-81, (1988); and Brilla et al., Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, 25 (5), pp. 563-75 (1993). Compounds and\/or pharmaceutical compositions which act as MR antagonists might be expected to be of value in the treatment of any of the above conditions.","Despite significant therapeutic advances in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, the current standard of care is suboptimal and there is a clear unmet medical need for additional therapeutic\/pharmacological interventions. This invention addresses those needs by providing compounds, compositions and possible methods for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, other cardiovascular disorders and other aldosterone disorders.","The present invention relates to compounds which have Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) antagonist activity, which have the potential to be valuable pharmaceutically active compounds for the possible treatment of diseases, for example for treating aldosterone-mediated disorders, including cardiovascular disease.

Where multiple substituent moieties are disclosed or claimed, the substituted compound can be independently substituted by one or more of the disclosed or claimed substituent moieties, singly or plurally. By independently substituted, it is meant that the (two or more) substituents can be the same or different.","Where a substituent or variable has multiple definitions, it is understood that the substituent or variable is defined as being selected from the group consisting of the indicated definitions.","Optical Isomers\u2014Diastereoisomers\u2014Geometric Isomers\u2014Tautomers\u2014Atropisomers:","Compounds of structural Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereoisomeric mixtures and individual diastereoisomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of structural Formula I.","Compounds of structural Formula I may be separated into their individual diastereoisomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof, or via chiral chromatography using an optically active stationary phase. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.","Alternatively, any stereoisomer or isomers of a compound of the general structural Formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known absolute configuration.","If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereoisomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereoisomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.","For compounds described herein which contain olefinic double bonds, unless specified otherwise, they are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.","Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention.","In the compounds of structural Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominately found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of structural Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and deuterium (H, also denoted as D). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within structural Formula I, can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and\/or intermediates. Thus, the present invention covers isotopically-enriched compounds, including deuterated compounds.","The present invention includes all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have S configuration or R configuration. The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis\/trans isomerism, the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at the stage of the compounds of the Formula I or at the stage of an intermediate during the synthesis. The present invention also includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I.","The present invention includes all atropisomer forms of the compounds of Formula I. Atropisomers are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers. Atropisomers display axial chirality. Separation of atropisomers is possibly by chiral resolution methods such as selective crystallization.","Salts:","It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of structural Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment of hypertension, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of myocardial infarction.","Furthermore, a subject of the present invention are pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which comprise as active component an effective dose of at least one compound of the Formula I and\/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances and\/or additives.","Thus, subjects of the invention are, for example, said compound and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts for use as a pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical preparations which comprise as an active component a therapeutically effective dose of said compound and\/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and the uses of said compound and\/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the therapy or prophylaxis of the abovementioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes.","The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions, syrups, emulsions or suspensions, or rectally, for example in the form of suppositories. Administration can also be carried out parenterally, for example subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously in the form of solutions for injection or infusion. Other suitable administration forms are, for example, percutaneous or topical administration, for example in the form of ointments, tinctures, sprays or transdermal therapeutic systems, or the inhalative administration in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures, or, for example, microcapsules, implants or rods. The preferred administration form depends, for example, on the disease to be treated and on its severity.","The amount of active compound of the Formula I and\/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from 0.2 to 700 mg, preferably from 1 to 500 mg, per dose, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical preparation it can also be higher. The pharmaceutical preparations usually comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of the Formula I and\/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of the pharmaceutical preparations can be carried out in a manner known per se. For this purpose, one or more compounds of the Formula I and\/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical carrier substances and\/or additives (or auxiliary substances) and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds having therapeutic or prophylactic action, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human or veterinary medicine.","For the production of pills, tablets, sugar-coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, starch, for example maize starch, or starch derivatives, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carriers for the preparation of solutions, for example of solutions for injection, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, physiologically sodium chloride solution, alcohols such as ethanol, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, mannitol, vegetable oils, etc. It is also possible to lyophilize the compounds of the Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and to use the resulting lyophilisates, for example, for preparing preparations for injection or infusion. Suitable carriers for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid.","Besides the active compounds and carriers, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain customary additives, for example fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.","The dosage of the active compound of the Formula I to be administered and\/or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of the Formula I. In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg\/kg, in particular 0.3 to 5 mg\/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose can be administered in a single dose or, in particular when larger amounts are administered, be divided into several, for example two, three or four individual doses. In some cases, depending on the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose.","The compounds of the Formula I bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor and antagonize the biological effects of aldosterone and cortisol.
