{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to telecommunications systems and, in particular, to an improved system and method for muting alarms during a conference.","The development of various voice over IP protocols such as the H.323 Recommendation and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has led to increased interest in multimedia conferencing. In such conferencing, typically, a more or less central server or other device manages the conference and maintains the various communications paths to computers or other client devices being used by parties to participate in the conference. Parties to the conference may be able to communicate via voice and\/or video through the server and their client devices.","Instant messaging can provide an added dimension to multimedia conferences. In addition to allowing text chatting, instant messaging systems such as the Microsoft Windows Messenger\u2122 system can allow for transfer of files, document sharing and collaboration, collaborative whiteboarding, and even voice and video. A complete multimedia conference can involve multiple voice and video streams, the transfer of many files, and marking-up of documents and whiteboarding.","During a conference, a participant in the conference may use a computer or other client type device (e.g., personal digital assistant). The participant may receive or be confronted with multiple alarms or other notifications while participating in the conference. For example, the participant may receive a calendar alert, task reminder, urgent email alert, instant message alert, etc., each of which may set off an audible alarm on the participant's computer. Since such audible alarms may be detected or picked up by the computer's microphone, telephone microphones, Web cam microphones, etc., the alarms may be heard by other people participating in the conference or transmitted to the client devices used by the other people.","As such, there is a need for a system and method for one or more kinds of audible alarms or other alerts to be muted or otherwise disabled during a conference.","Embodiments provide a system, method, apparatus, means, and computer program code for muting or disabling audible alarms or other alerts during a conference or collaboration event. During the conference or collaboration event, users may participate in the conference via client devices (e.g., computers, personal digital assistants) that are connected to or in communication with a server or collaboration system. The server or collaboration system facilitates communication and sharing of documents between the users via their respective client devices. According to some embodiments, the server, collaboration system or other device or application detects the setting of a mute alarm preference regarding one or more users (e.g., invitees to a conference, participants in a conference). This may occur prior to a conference or during the conference. The server, collaboration system or other device then may cause the appropriate muting to occur at the appropriate or desired client devices.","Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention shall be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by the practice of the invention.","According to some embodiments, a method for facilitating a conference may include initiating a conference, the conference having at least one associated user; detecting setting of a mute alarm preference for the at least one associated user; and disabling an audible alarm setting for a device associated with the at least one user based on the mute alarm preference. In some other embodiments, a method for facilitating a conference may include detecting setting of a mute alarm preference for at least one user associated with a conference; disabling an audible alarm setting for a device associated with the at least one user based on the mute alarm preference; and adding or enabling a visual alarm setting for the device. Other embodiments may include means, systems, computer code, etc. for implementing some or all of the elements of the methods described herein.","With these and other advantages and features of the invention that will become hereinafter apparent, the nature of the invention may be more clearly understood by reference to the following detailed description of the invention, the appended claims and to the several drawings attached herein.","Applicant has recognized that there is a market opportunity for systems, means, computer code, and methods that allow audible alarms or alerts to be muted during a conference. During a conference, different participants may be in communication with a server or conference system via client devices. A person coordinating, participating in, and\/or moderating a conference may want to mute alarms occurring on or created by the different client devices used by participants in the conference. Such audible alarms may be detected by microphones located on or near the client devices and the client devices may provide or transmit detected sounds to other participants in the conference or to their respective client devices.","Referring now to , a diagram of an exemplary telecommunications system  according to some embodiments. As shown, the system  includes a local area network (LAN) . The LAN  may be implemented using a TCP\/IP network and may implement voice or multimedia over IP using, for example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

As shown with reference to computer , the computers may include one or more controllers , such as Pentium\u2122 type microprocessors, and storage  for applications and other programs.","Finally, the computers -may implement Interaction Services -according to embodiments. As will be described in greater detail below, the Interaction Services -allow for interworking of phone, buddy list, instant messaging, presence, collaboration, calendar and other applications. In addition, according to some embodiments, the Interaction Services  allow access to the collaboration system or module  and the action prompt module  of the server  and thus permit the user to access and manipulate conference summaries.","Turning now to , a functional model diagram illustrating the collaboration system  is shown. More particularly,  is a logical diagram illustrating a particular embodiment of a collaboration server . The server  includes a plurality of application modules  and a communication broker module . One or more of the application modules and communication broker (CB) module  may include an inference engine, i.e., a rules or heuristics based artificial intelligence engine for implementing functions according to some embodiments. In addition, the server  provides interfaces, such as APIs (application programming interfaces) to SIP phones  and gateways\/interworking units .","According to the embodiment illustrated, the broker module  includes a basic services module , an advanced services module , an automation module , and a toolkit module . The automation module  implements an automation framework for ISVs (independent software vendors)  that allow products, software, etc. provided by such ISVs to be used with or created the server .","The basic services module  functions to implement, for example, phone support, PBX interfaces, call features and management, as well as Windows Messaging\u2122 software and RTC add-ins, when necessary. The phone support features allow maintenance of and access to buddy lists and provide presence status.","The advanced services module  implements function such as presence, multipoint control unit or multi-channel conferencing unit (MCU), recording, and the like. MCU functions are used for voice conferencing and support ad hoc and dynamic conference creation from a buddy list following the SIP conferencing model for ad hoc conferences. In certain embodiments, support for G.711 and G.723.1 codecs is provided. Further, in certain embodiments, the MCU can distribute media processing over multiple servers using the MEGACO protocol. In some embodiments, an MCU may provide the ability to set up ad hoc voice, data, or multimedia conferencing sessions. During such conferencing sessions, different client devices (e.g., the computers -) may establish channels to the MCU and server , the channels carrying voice, audio, video and\/or other data from and to participants via their associated client devices. In some cases, more than one participant may be participating in the conference via the same client device. For example, multiple participants may be using a telephone (e.g., the telephone ) located in a conference room to participate in the conference. The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) may be used to facilitate or manage communications or data exchanges between the client devices for the participants in the conference.","Presence features provide device context for both SIP registered devices and user-defined non-SIP devices. Various user contexts, such as In Meeting, On Vacation, In the Office, etc., can be provided for. In addition, voice, e-mail, and instant messaging availability may be provided across the user's devices. The presence feature enables real time call control using presence information, e.g., to choose a destination based on the presence of a user's device(s). In addition, various components have a central repository for presence information and for changing and querying presence information. In addition, the presence module provides a user interface for presenting the user with presence information.","In addition, the broker module  may include the ComResponse\u2122 platform, available from Siemens Information and Communication Networks, Inc. The ComResponse\u2122 platform features include speech recognition, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech, and allows for creation of scripts for applications. The speech recognition and speech-to-text features may be used by the collaboration summarization unit  and the action prompt module .","In addition, real time call control is provided by a SIP API  associated with the basic services module . That is, calls can be intercepted in progress and real time actions performed on them, including directing those calls to alternate destinations based on rules and or other stimuli. The SIP API  also provides call progress monitoring capabilities and for reporting status of such calls to interested applications. The SIP API  also provides for call control from the user interface.","The toolkit module  may provide tools, APIs, scripting language, interfaces, software modules, libraries, software drivers, objects, etc. that may be used by software developers or programmers to build or integrate additional or complementary applications.","According to the embodiment illustrated, the application modules include a collaboration module , an interaction center module , a mobility module , an interworking services module , a collaboration summarization module , and an action prompt module .","The collaboration module  allows for creation, modification or deletion of a collaboration session for a group of users. The collaboration module  may further allow for invoking a voice conference from any client. In addition, the collaboration module  can launch a multi-media conferencing package, such as the WebEx\u2122 package. It is noted that the multi-media conferencing can be handled by other products, applications, devices, etc.","The interaction center  provides a telephony interface for both subscribers and guests. Subscriber access functions include calendar access and voicemail and e-mail access. The calendar access allows the subscriber to accept, decline, or modify appointments, as well as block out particular times. The voicemail and e-mail access allows the subscriber to access and sort messages.","Similarly, the guest access feature allows the guest access to voicemail for leaving messages and calendar functions for scheduling, canceling, and modifying appointments with subscribers. Further, the guest access feature allows a guest user to access specific data meant for them, e.g., receiving e-mail and fax back, etc.","The mobility module  provides for message forwarding and \u201cone number\u201d access across media, and message \u201cmorphing\u201d across media for the subscriber. Further, various applications can send notification messages to a variety of destinations, such as e-mails, instant messages, pagers, and the like. In addition, the subscriber can set rules that the mobility module  uses to define media handling, such as e-mail, voice and instant messaging handling. Such rules specify data and associated actions. For example, a rule could be defined to say \u201cIf I'm traveling, and I get a voicemail or e-mail marked Urgent, then page me.\u201d","Further, the collaboration summarization module  is used to identify or highlight portions of a multimedia conference and configure the portions sequentially for later playback. The portions may be stored or identified based on recording cues either preset or settable by one or more of the participants in the conference, such as a moderator. The recording cues may be based on vocalized keywords identified by the voice recognition unit of the ComResponse\u2122 module, or may be invoked by special controls or video or whiteboarding or other identifiers.","The action prompt module  similarly allows a user to set action cues, which cause the launch of an action prompt window at the client. In response, the clients  can then perform various functions.","Turning now to , a diagram of a graphical user interface  according to some embodiments is illustrated. In particular, shown are a variety of windows for invoking various functions. Such a graphical user interface  may be implemented on one or more of the network clients (e.g., the computer ). Thus, the graphical user interface  interacts with the Interactive Services unit  to control collaboration sessions.","Shown are a collaboration interface , a phone interface , and a buddy list . It is noted that other functional interfaces may be provided. According to particular embodiments, certain of the interfaces may be based on, be similar to, or interwork with, those provided by Microsoft Windows Messenger\u2122 or Outlook\u2122 software.","The buddy list  is used to set up instant messaging calls and\/or multimedia conferences. The phone interface  is used to make calls, e.g., by typing in a phone number, and also allows invocation of supplementary service functions such as transfer, forward, etc. The collaboration interface  allows for viewing the parties to a conference or collaboration and the type of media involved. It is noted that, while illustrated in the context of personal computers , similar interfaces may be provided the telephones or cellular telephones or PDAs. During a conference or collaboration, participants in the conference or collaboration may access or view shared documents or presentations, communicate with each other via audio, voice, data and\/or video channels, etc.","Now referring to , a monitor  is illustrated that may be used as part of a client device (e.g., computer, workstation) by a user participating, initiating, or scheduling a conference. The monitor  may include a screen  on which representative windows or interfaces , , ,  may be displayed. The monitor  may be part of the server . While the windows or interfaces , ,  illustrated in  provided individual users or client devices (e.g., the computer ) the ability to participate in conferences, send instant messages or other communications, etc., the windows or interfaces , , ,  may allow an person using or located at the server  and\/or one or more of the client computers -the ability to establish or change settings for a conference, monitor the status of the conference, and\/or perform other functions. In some embodiments, some or all of the windows , ,  may not be used or displayed and\/or some or all of the windows , , ,  might be displayed in conjunction with one or more of the windows , , .","In some embodiments, one or more of the windows , , ,  may displayed as part of a \u201ccommunity portal\u201d that may include one or more Web pages, Web sites, or other electronic resources that are accessible by users participating in a conference, a person or device monitoring, controlling or initiating the conference, etc. Thus, the \u201ccommunity portal\u201d may include information, documents, files, etc. that are accessible to multiple parties. In some embodiments, some or all of the contents of the community portal may be established or otherwise provided by one or more people participating in a conference, a person scheduling or coordinating the conference on behalf of one or more other users, etc.","As indicated in , the window  includes information regarding a conference in progress, the scheduled date of the conference (i.e., 1:00 PM on May 1, 2003), the number of participants in the conference, the number of invitees to the conference, etc.","The window  includes information regarding the four current participants in the conference, the communication channels or media established with the four participants, etc. For example, the participant named \u201cJack Andrews\u201d is participating in the conference via video and audio (e.g., a Web cam attached to the participant's computer). The participants named \u201cSarah Butterman.\u201d \u201cLynn Graves,\u201d and \u201cTed Mannon\u201d are participating in the conference via video and audio channels and have IM capabilities activated as well. The participants named \u201cSarah Butterman.\u201d \u201cLynn Graves,\u201d and \u201cTed Mannon\u201d may use the IM capabilities to communicate with each other or other parties during the conference.","The window  includes information regarding three people invited to the conference, but who are not yet participating in the conference. As illustrated in the window , the invitee named \u201cTerry Jackson\u201d has declined to participate, the invitee named \u201cJill Wilson\u201d is unavailable, and the server  or the collaboration system  currently is trying to establish a connection or communication channel with the invitee named \u201cPete Olivetti.\u201d","The window  includes information regarding documents that may be used by or shared between participants in the conference while the conference is on-going. In some embodiments, access to and\/or use of the documents also may be possible prior to and\/or after the conference.","As previously discussed above, in some scenarios, a person coordinating, participating in, and\/or moderating a conference may want to mute alarms occurring on the different client devices used by participants in the conference. Such alarms may be detected by microphones located on or near the client devices and the sounds of the conference system may provide or transmit the sounds to other people participating in the conference.","In some embodiments, as soon as a conference or collaboration session is initiated, some or all of the audible alerts or alarms for client devices used by some or all of the participants in the conference or collaboration session may be muted automatically by the server  or conference system . At the end of the conference, the server  or conference system  may restore the original settings.","If a moderator or other user associated with a conference wishes to mute one or more alarms for one or more client devices used by participants in the conference, the moderator or user may click on or select the \u201cControls\u201d link in the window . Clicking on or selecting the \u201cControls\u201d link in the window  may cause the server  or the collaboration system  to display the window  on the screen , as illustrated in FIG. . Some or all of the windows , , ,  may remain displayed on the screen  or may be removed from the screen . As alternative to the window , however, a \u201cmute IM alarms\u201d, \u201cmute calendar alarms\u201d, \u201cmute email alarms\u201d, \u201cmute all alarms\u201d, etc. button, icon, or other indicator may be provided on the window  or appear in another window, toobar, menu, pop-up display, etc. displayed on the screen .","In some embodiments, different participants or users may have different permissions or abilities to mute or disable the alarms of other participants and users. Thus, permission settings for one or more usings may be established. For example, a moderator or host of a conference may be able to mute or disable the audible alarms of all participants in a conference while a participant in the conference may only be able to mute or disable the audible alarms for devices associated with the participant or used by the participant to participate in the conference.","As illustrated in the window , different check boxes  may allow for muting of the IM alarms created by the participants' computers. For example, if the user clicks on or checks the check box , the server  or the collaboration system  may mute the IM alarms for all of the four participants. The participants still will receive their instant messages, only now their respective computers or clients devices will not provide audible alarms to indicate the arrival of a new instant message. In some embodiments, the server  or the collaboration system  may send a signal to the participants' computers to indicate to the computers that such audible alarms should not be used or provided. As another example, if the user clicks on or checks the check box , the server  or the collaboration system  may mute the entire client device for the participant named \u201cTed Mannon.\u201d Thus, for example, the speakers for the client device may be turned off or muted. As a third example, if the user clicks on or checks the check box , the server  or the collaboration system  may create a visual alarm or alert for the conference participant named \u201cLynn Graves\u201d when he or she receives an instant message. Different applications, participants, audible alerts, etc. may receive different types of visual alarms or alarms and different permissions may be applied to different people with regard to their respective abilities to mute or disable audible alarms and\/or enable or establish visual alarms. In other embodiments, dialog boxes may be used instead of or in conjunction with visual alarms or cues. Different applications, participants, audible alerts, etc. may receive different types of dialog boxes. In some embodiments, the server  or the collaboration system  may send a signal to the participant's computer to indicate to the computer that such visual alarm should be used or provided instead of an audible alarm. As seen by these examples, the server  or the collaboration system  may be able to control or communicate with the client devices used by participants in the conference such that muting of the IM alarms and\/or changing of the IM alarms from audible alarms to visual alarms can be accomplished.","In some embodiments, one or more users may be limited to which participant's alarms or types of alarms they can mute. For example, some participants may be limited to muting only their own alarms, only IM related alarms, etc. The window  may be presented or configured differently for different users of the window  to reflect the different privileges or permissions of the users. In addition, in some embodiments, windows displayed to different users by their respective client devices might include a \u201cmute my IM alarms\u201d, \u201cmute my calendar alarms\u201d, \u201cmute my email alarms\u201d, \u201cmute my all alarms\u201d, etc. button, icon, or link.","In a manner similar to that described above in relation to IM alarms, in some embodiments a user may be able to mute or change alarms relating to other types messages, reminders, etc. For example, now referring to , clicking on or selecting the \u201cControls\u201d link in the window  may cause the server  or the collaboration system  to display the window  on the screen . The window  may include check boxes  that allow the user to mute email alarms, calendar alarms, task reminders, or other types of alarms, set up visual alarms instead of audio alarms, etc.","As illustrated in  to , in some embodiments the server  of the conference system  may be adapted to display a window indicating participants in the conference and adapted to receive input via the window, the input being indicative of a type of audible alarm to be muted, the input indicating that an audible alarm associated with at least participant in the conference is to be muted, and\/or the input indicating that a visual alarm is to be provided to at least one participant in the conference. The server  or conference system  may be adapted to receive data indicative of a type of alarm to be muted and\/or data indicative of at least one user for whom an alarm is to be muted.","Process Description","Reference is now made to , where a flow chart  is shown which represents the operation of a first embodiment of a method. The particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart  is not meant to imply a fixed order to the method ; embodiments can be practiced in any order that is practicable. In some embodiments, some or all of the elements of the method  may be performed or completed by the server , the collaboration system , or another device or application, as will be discussed in more detail below.","Processing begins at  during which the server  or the collaboration system  facilitates, conducts or otherwise initiates a conference or collaborative call. In some embodiments,  may include or be the establishing of the conference, which may include such things as establishing or identifying the date\/time of the conference, establishing or identifying the invitees and\/or participants for the conference, establishing or identifying the documents to be used in the conference, etc. Thus,  may occur prior to the actual conference date\/time. As a result, the muting of IM or other alarms for participants may occur as part of the set up of the conference or before the conference actually starts. In some other embodiments,  may occur during or as part of the conference and\/or include beginning the actual conference on the established date and time. In some embodiments,  may include facilitating communication between at least two participants in a conference. In some embodiments,  may include or be facilitating or conducting the conference.","During , the server  or the collaboration system  detects a setting of a mute setting alarm preference for one or more users. In some embodiments, the user may be an invitee or expected participant in the conference if the conference has not yet started, or an actual participant in the conference if the conference has already started. In some embodiments, the server  or collaboration system  may provide or display a screen or window, such as the window , , and\/or  to allow a user to indicate a desire to mute an audible alarm relating to an instant message, email message, calendar notification, task reminder, etc. In some embodiments,  may include or be the server  or the collaboration system  receiving data indicative of such a need, preference or desire to mute such an alarm. Thus, in some embodiments, a mute alarm preference may be indicative or representative of a desire to mute an audible alarm for one, some, or all participants in a conference, a desire to mute a specific type of alarm (e.g., IM alarm, email alarm, calendar alarm) for one, some or all participants in conference, a desire to mute an instant message alarm (e.g., a tone or sound indicating receipt or arrival of an instant message), an email message alarm (e.g., a sound or tone indicating receipt or arrival of an email message), a calendar alarm (e.g., a sound or tone indicating the occurrence of a specific time, date, meeting, etc. or a reminder message), a task reminder alarm (e.g., a sound or tone designed to indicate or coincide with a reminder message), etc.","During , the server  or the collaboration system  disables or mutes the audible alarm settings for the one or more users as directed in . In some embodiments, the server  or the collaboration system  may send a signal, message, or other data to a computer or other device (e.g., the computer ) used by a participant in the conference to cause or initiate the appropriate alarm muting at the device. Thus, in some embodiments,  may include or be the sending of the signal, message or other data. In some cases, the signal, message, or other data sent to the participant's device may cause muting of all sound from the device. In some embodiments, muting of one or more audible alarms for one or more participants, applications, etc. may occur automatically at the start of a conference. Thus, a setting to mute one or more alarms during a conference may occur in advance of the conference.","In some embodiments, the method  may include reestablishing or enable the original alarms settings after the conference is over. For example, at the end of a conference, the server  or the collaboration system  may enable or unmute the alarm settings that were muted during . The server  or the collaboration system  may send a signal, message, or other data to a computer or other device (e.g., the computer ) used by a participant in the conference to cause or initiate the resetting or enabling of the appropriate alarm muting function at the device or to enable the original settings at the device. This may occur during or after the conference. In some embodiments, the method  may include determining the end of the conference or ending the conference initiated during .","In some embodiments, the method  may include setting or creating a visual or other type of alarm for the one or more users. For example, in some embodiments, the server  or the collaboration system  may send a signal, message, or other data to a computer or other device (e.g., the computer ) used by a participant in the conference to cause or initiate a visual alarm to occur at the device instead of an audible alarm.","In some embodiments of the method ,  might not be needed. For example, a method for facilitating a conference may include detecting setting of a mute alarm preference for at least one user associated with a conference; and disabling an audible alarm setting for a device associated with the at least one user based on the mute alarm preference.","Reference is now made to , where a flow chart  is shown which represents the operation of a second embodiment of a method. The particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart  is not meant to imply a fixed order to the elements; embodiments can be practiced in any order that is practicable. In some embodiments, some or all of the elements of the method  may be performed or completed by the server , the collaboration system , or another device or application, as will be discussed in more detail below.","The method  includes , , and  previously discussed above. In addition, the method  includes  during which a visual alarm is enabled or established for the user in replacement of the audible alarm that was muted or disable during . In some embodiments, the server  or the collaboration system  may send a signal, message, or other data to a computer or other device (e.g., the computer ) used by a participant in the conference to cause or initiate the appropriate visual alarm at the device. Thus, in some embodiments,  may include or be the sending of the signal, message or other data.","During , the original settings for the user are enabled or reestablished. For example, when the conference ends the server  or the collaboration system  may reestablish the user's original alarm settings. In some embodiments, the server  or the collaboration system  may send a signal, message, or other data to a computer or other device (e.g., the computer ) used by a participant in the conference to reestablish or enable the original settings at the device. Thus, in some embodiments,  may include or be the sending of the signal, message or other data.","Server","Now referring to , a representative block diagram of a server or controller  is illustrated. The server  can comprise a single device or computer, a networked set or group of devices or computers, a workstation, mainframe or host computer, etc., and may include the components described above in regards to FIG. .
