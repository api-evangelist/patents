No. 08\/766,307, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,116 filed on Dec. 13, 1996, by inventors Mark D. Riggins, R. Stanley Bailes, Hong Q. Bui, David J. Cowan, Daniel J. Mendez, Mason Ng, Sean Michael Quinlan, Prasad Wagle, Christine C. Ying, Christopher R. Zuleeg and Joanna A. Aptekar-Strober, which subject matter is hereby incorporated by reference. This related application has been commonly assigned to RoamPage, Inc., now Visto Corporation.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to computer networks, and more particularly to a system and method for enabling secure access to services in a computer network.","2. Description of the Background Art","In its infancy, the Internet provided a research-oriented environment where users and hosts were interested in a free and open exchange of information, and where users and hosts mutually trusted one another. However, the Internet has grown dramatically, currently interconnecting about 100,000 computer networks and several million users. Because of its size and openness, the Internet has become a target of data theft, data alteration and other mischief.","Virtually everyone on the Internet is vulnerable. Before connecting, companies balance the rewards of an Internet connection against risks of a security breach. Current security techniques help provide client and server authentication, data confidentiality, system integrity and system access control.","The most popular of the current security techniques is a firewall, which includes an intermediate system positioned between a trusted network and the Internet. The firewall represents an outer perimeter of security for preventing unauthorized communication between the trusted network and the Internet. A firewall may include screening routers, proxy servers and application-layer gateways.","For users on the internet to gain access to protected services on the trusted network, they may be required to provide their identity to the firewall by some means such as entering a password or by computing a response to a challenge using a hardware token. With proper authentication, the user is allowed to pass through the firewall into the local network, but is typically limited to a predetermined set of services such as e-mail, FTP, etc.","Some local network managers place just outside the firewall a server, often referred to as a \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d for storing non-confidential data which is easily accessible by the remote user but providing little security.","A De-Militarized Zone, or DMZ, sits between two firewalls protecting a trusted network. The external firewall protects servers in the DMZ from external threats while allowing HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. The internal firewall protects the trusted network in the event that one of the servers in the DMZ is compromised. Many companies use DMZs to maintain their web servers.","Another security technique for protecting computer networks is the issuance and use of a public key certificates. Public key certificates are issued to a party by a certificate authority, which via some method validates the party's identity and issues a certificate stating the party's name and public key. As evidence of authenticity, the certificate authority digitally signs the party's certificate using the certificate authority's private key.","Thus, when a user via a client computer connects to a server, the client computer and server exchange public key certificates. Each party verifies the authenticity of the received certificates by using the certificate authority's public key to verify the signature of the certificate. Then, by encrypting messages with the server's public key the user can send secure communications to the server, and by encrypting messages with the user's public key the server can send secure communications to the user. Although any party might present a public key certificate, only the real user and the real host have the corresponding private key needed to decrypt the message. Examples of authentication and key distribution computer security systems include the Kerberos\u2122 security system developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the NetSP\u2122security system developed by the IBM Corporation.","These security techniques do not, however, solve problems associated with a roaming (traveling) user. For the roaming user, maintaining identification and authentication information such as passwords, certificates, keys, etc. is a cumbersome process. Further, accessing multiple systems requires multiple keys, which often are too complex to track and use. Also, direct access to systems behind firewalls compromises security. Therefore, a system and method are needed to enable remote access to computer services easily and securely.","The present invention provides a system and method for enabling secure access to services in a computer network. The network system includes a global server coupled via a computer network to computer services. The global server includes a communications engine for establishing a communications link with a client; security means coupled to the communications engine for determining client privileges; a servlet host engine coupled to the security means for providing to the client, based on the client privileges, an applet which enables I\/O with a secured service; and a keysafe for storing keys which enable access to the secured services. The global server may be coupled to multiple sites, wherein each site provides multiple services. Each site may be protected by a firewall. Accordingly, the global server stores the keys for enabling communication via the firewalls with the services.","A method includes the steps of establishing a communications link with a client; identifying and authenticating the client; determining client privileges; providing to the client, based on the client privileges, an applet which enables I\/O with a secured service; and retrieving a key which enables access to the secured service.","The system and method of the present invention advantageously provide a globally\/accessible trusted third party, i.e., the global server. This trusted third party securely stores keys, and acts as a single identification and authentication service. Other systems may be accessed through the global server. The global server uses the stored keys to authenticate the user under an identity that is understood by the other system's existing security services, and establishes a secure communications channel to the desired service. Because of a firewall protecting the global server (referred to herein as a global firewall the global server is substantially protected from external threats. Accordingly, the global server provides authorized clients with secure communication through firewalls with services. The global server may enable multiple levels of identification and authentication services. Accordingly, the global server may enable multiple levels of resource access based on the user's status, the strengths of the identification and the authentication and on the privacy of the communications channel.","Because of the global firewall and the identification and authentication services performed by the global server, corporations can store relatively secret information on the global server for use by authorized clients. Yet, the present invention also enables corporations to maintain only a portion of their secret information on the global server, so that there would be only this limited loss should the trusted third party system be compromised. Further, the global server advantageously may act as a client proxy for controlling access to services, logging use of keys and logging access of resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","100","112","118","138","143","102"]},"Company network  includes a firewall  coupled between the Internet  and a client computer . Company network  includes a firewall  coupled between the Internet  and an internal network signal bus . Company network  further includes a first server for providing a first service , a second server for providing a second service , a first client computer storing a program for providing a third service and a second client computer , each being coupled to signal bus . Example services \u2013include an e-mail service program, an address book service program, a calendar service program, a paging service program, and a company database service program.","The kiosk network  includes a first client computer and a second client computer , each being coupled to the Internet . The ISP network  includes an ISP  coupled via a wireless channel  to a first client computer and coupled via modems  and  and via transmission line  to a second client computer ","The Internet  includes a global server  which is protected by a firewall  referred to herein as a \u201cglobal firewall\u201d  includes a server for providing a service . Intercommunication between client computers \u2013and services \u2013is accomplished via the global server . If, for example, a user of any one of the client computers \u2013wants to access a service \u2013(which is provided at a location within system , that is unknown to the user), then the user applies a known Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to access a web page operated by global server . An example web page  is shown in and described with reference to . The global firewall  protects the global server  from external threats.","Before obtaining access privileges to the functionality provided by the global server , the user must first obtain authorization from the global server . Obtaining authorization typically requires user identification and authentication, for example, using public-key certificates. Once authenticated, the global server  provides the user with access to the services \u2013. It will be appreciated that varying levels of access to services \u2013will be granted based on varying strengths of identification and authentication and on the privacy of the communications channel.","To enable user access to and control of the services \u2013, the global server  may use conventional applets, servlets or agents in a distributed network environment, such as Java\u2122 distributed environment produced by the Netscape Corporation. The global server  provides the user's client with access to and control of the service \u2013. The global server  may redirect the user's client to access the service \u2013, the global server  may access the service \u2013and provide I\/O to the client by proxy, or the global server  may provide the service \u2013itself. These three different modes of access to the services \u2013are described with reference to .","The global server  maintains the network addresses of all the services \u2013, the user's public and private keys, the user's account numbers, firewall authentication information, etc. Firewall authentication information includes the necessary identification, passwords and certificates needed to pass firewalls  and . Accordingly, the user need only maintain the URL of the global server , and identification and authentication information such as a password or hardware token for obtaining access to the functionality of the global server . Thus, the roaming user can access computer services \u2013using any computer terminal which is connected to the Internet .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["114","114","114","114","114","210","220","230","240","210","250","260","270","240","210","250","114","102"],"i":["a","d "]},"An operating system  includes a program for controlling processing by CPU , and is typically stored in data storage device  and loaded into RAM  for execution. Operating system  includes a communication engine  for generating and transferring message packets to and from the internet  via the communications interface .","Operating system  further includes an internet engine such as a web browser , e.g., the Netscape\u2122 web browser produced by the Netscape Corporation or the Internet Explorer\u2122 web browser produced by the Microsoft Corporation. The web browser  includes an encryption engine  for encrypting messages using public and private keys, and an applet engine  for executing applets  downloaded from the global server  to enable the access to computer services \u2013. Downloaded applets  may include security applets  for performing services such as user identification and authentication, message integrity services, and certificate verification. The browser  further receives web page data (, ), configuration data  and information identifying a set of selectable services \u2013, and uses the information to display the web page (, ). The web browser  enables a user via the client \u2013to select one of the services \u2013for execution.","It will be appreciated that a client \u2013such as client may include a service engine  (see ) for providing a service \u2013such as service . Thus, it is possible for a client user to request access to service via the global server , without knowing that the service is provided by client . Accordingly, the global server  will provide client  with an applet  for providing user interface I\/O of service back to client ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","310","320","330","340","310","350","360","370","340","310","350","102","114","106","106"]},"Operating system  includes a program for controlling processing by CPU , and is typically stored in data storage device  and loaded into RAM  for execution. Operating system  includes a communication engine  for generating and transferring message packets to and from client computers  via the communications interface .","Operating system  further includes, as part of global firewall , security services  for opening a communications channel with users. For example, when a client attempts to access the global server , the security services  first determines whether the global server  accepts in-bound communications from a particular port (not shown) and whether a servlet host engine , described below, is authorized to connect to that particular port. If so, the security services  allows the communications engine  to open a communications channel via the particular port to the client \u2013. Otherwise, no channel will be opened.","The operating system  further includes a web server  which, based on user's identification, the strength of the user's authentication and the privacy of the communications channel, forwards web page data  and information identifying a set of available services \u2013to the client \u2013. An example web page  is shown and described with reference to . The web server  enables a user to select a service \u2013from the web page .","The web server  includes a servlet host engine , which downloads security applets  including an authentication applet (not shown) to the client computer  and accordingly executes an authentication servlet  of servlets  for performing identification and authentication services. The authentication applet  prompts the user for identification and authentication information, and then communicates the information to the authentication servlet . The authentication servlet  verifies that the information is correct. It will be noted that the user's authentication information is not necessarily sent to the authentication servlet , but rather its existence and correctness can also be proven via a secure means such as a secure hash. The servlet host engine  further includes a secure communications engine  which may use public key certificates to negotiate a secure communications channel with the client computer .","Upon selection of a service \u2013, the servlet host engine  downloads a corresponding applet , corresponding configuration data  and corresponding user data  and may download corresponding service address information  to the client computer . Configuration data  includes information for configuring the user's web browser , for configuring the downloaded applets , and for configuring the selected service \u2013. Configuration is described in the related co-pending application referenced above. User data  may include user-and-service-specific information such as stored bookmarks, calendar data, pager numbers, etc. which was specifically stored on the global server  for easy access. Service address information  identifies the location of the services \u2013provided in system  by the global server . The client computer  executes the corresponding downloaded applet , which via the servlet host engine  (possibly using a corresponding servlet ) enables the user to access and to control the corresponding services \u2013. The downloadable applets , configuration data , user data  and service address information  may be stored on the data storage device .","A keysafe  is a data file for storing each user's identification information, each user's public and private keys, each firewall's password information, etc. The keysafe  is organized in a linked list format so that, based on the selected service \u2013, the global server  can retrieve the appropriate firewall's password information, the appropriate user's identification information and keys, etc. The keysafe  may be stored on the data storage device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["108","108","108","114","108","108","410","420","430","440","410","450","460","470","440","410","450","114"],"i":["a","c ","b "]},"The operating system  includes a program for controlling processing by CPU , and is typically stored in data storage device  and loaded into RAM  for execution.

The service server  in step  initiates the service engine . The global server  in step  selects one of the three modes of access described in  for enabling the client computer  to communicate with the corresponding service engine . For example, if the user selects the service on server , which is not protected by a separate firewall, then the global server  may provide the user with direct access. If the user selects service provided by server within company network , then the global server  may access the service as a proxy for the user. It will be appreciated that each firewall  and  may store policies establishing the proper mode of access the global server  should select. Other factors for selecting mode of access may include user preference, availability and feasibility. The global server  in step  provides the client  user with access to the selected service \u2013.
