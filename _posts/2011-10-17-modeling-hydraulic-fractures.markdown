No. 61\/449,994, filed Mar. 7, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","Implementations of various technologies described herein generally relate to geomechanical and petrophysical data processing.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","This section is intended to provide background information to facilitate a better understanding of various technologies described herein. As the section's title implies, this is a discussion of related art. That such art is related in no way implies that it is prior art. The related art may or may not be prior art. It should therefore be understood that the statements in this section are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.","Hydraulic fracturing generally includes the process of pumping fracturing fluid into a wellbore with hydraulic pumps to create enough downhole pressure to crack or fracture a formation in the subsurface of the earth. The fracturing allows proppants to be injected into the formation, thereby creating a plane of high-permeability sand through which fluids, such as hydrocarbons, can flow. After the hydraulic pressure is removed, the proppants remain in place, prop open the fracture and enhance the flow of the fluids into the wellbore.","In order to generate production forecasts of a reservoir or wellbore that uses fracturing, hydraulic fracture simulations are used to determine permeability properties of the reservoir or the wellbore. In spite of the investment by the research and industrial communities in developing various generations of hydraulic fracture simulators, these hydraulic fracturing simulators are still limited in that they fail to effectively account for variations in geomechanical and petrophysical properties of the earth.","Described herein are implementations of various techniques for modeling hydraulic fractures of a well. In one implementation, a method for modeling hydraulic fractures of a well may include receiving a reservoir model that describes petrophysical properties of a subsurface of the earth near a reservoir. The method may then include receiving one or more mechanical properties of the reservoir and generating a geomechanical model of the reservoir based on the reservoir model and the mechanical properties. After generating the geomechanical model of the reservoir, the method may then include generating a three dimensional (3D) representation of the hydraulic fractures based on the geomechanical model and the reservoir model.","The above referenced summary section is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description section. The summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","The discussion below is directed to certain specific implementations. It is to be understood that the discussion below is only for the purpose of enabling a person with ordinary skill in the art to make and use any subject matter defined now or later by the patent \u201cclaims\u201d found in any issued patent herein.","This patent application generally describes one or more implementations of various techniques directed to modeling hydraulic fractures of a well.

Initially, the computer application may receive a reservoir model and geomechanical properties of the reservoir. The computer application may then build a geomechanical model of the reservoir based on the received reservoir model and the geomechanical properties of the reservoir. The computer application may then use the geomechanical model of the reservoir to simulate hydraulic fractures of a well. The simulated hydraulic fractures indicate the fracture geometry and the permeability profile along a planar fracture in the well. The computer application may then map the simulated hydraulic fractures onto the reservoir model in order to generate a 3D representation of the hydraulic fractures of a stimulated well.

Reservoir model  may describe the flow of fluids in the reservoir. Reservoir model  may also indicate various petrophysical properties of the subsurface of the earth near the reservoir. In one implementation, the petrophysical properties  may include pore pressure properties  in the subsurface of the earth and permeability properties along the trajectory of a well in the reservoir. Pore pressure properties  may include pore pressure changes along a well in the reservoir.","At step , the computer application may receive mechanical properties  of the reservoir. Mechanical properties  describe mechanical properties of the subsurface of the earth. For instance, mechanical properties  may include faults, fractures and mechanical properties of the rock mass in which the reservoir resides.","At step , the computer application may build a geomechanical model of the reservoir based on reservoir model  and mechanical properties . In one implementation, the geomechanical model may incorporate pore pressure properties  such as pore pressure changes together with mechanical properties . Pore pressure properties  may include pore pressure loading. In one implementation, in addition to pore pressure properties , gravity loading and tectonics loading may be used to calculate a 3D stress state over the geomechanical model of the reservoir.","In one implementation, the computer application may use pore pressure loading, gravity loading and tectonics loading elements to globally solve a set of three dimensional equilibrium equations. As a result, the computer application may account for the effects of faults\/fractures in the calculation of the stresses, the lateral contrasts between mechanical properties  and the interaction between the earth layers.","In one implementation, pore pressure changes (i.e., pore pressure properties ) in reservoir model  may be used to calculate corresponding stress fields in the geomechanical model of the reservoir. As a result, the geomechanical model of the reservoir may include stress fields near the well, elastic mechanical properties of the earth near the well, pore pressure properties along the trajectory of the well, the porosity and impact flow permeability properties along the trajectory of the well and the saturation properties (water, gas and oil saturations) of the subsurface of the earth near the well. In one implementation, the geomechanical model of the reservoir may be represented as a three dimensional model or map of the stress tensors or principal stresses of the subsurface of the earth (e.g., stresses ).","After generating the geomechanical model of the reservoir, the computer application may import the geomechanical model into a seismic-to-simulation software to generate petrophysical and geomechanical parameter logs. The petrophysical and geomechanical logs may include stress contrast zones that may be used to more efficiently simulate hydraulic fractures in a simulator.","At step , the computer application may simulate a hydraulic fracture of the well based on the geomechanical model of the reservoir and the reservoir model. In one implementation, inputs for the simulation of the hydraulic fracture may include stresses  (e.g., the 3D stress map from the geomechanical model of the reservoir), mechanical properties  from the geomechanical model of the reservoir, pore pressure properties  from reservoir model , and petrophysical properties  from reservoir model . Petrophysical properties  may include properties of the reservoir such as clay volume, total porosity, effective porosity, water saturation, permeability and the like. Simulated hydraulic fracture  may indicate the fracture geometry such as variations in height, width and length of the fracture. Additionally, simulated hydraulic fracture  may also indicate the permeability profile along a one-dimensional or two-dimensional planar fracture.","By using the geomechanical model of the reservoir and the reservoir model to simulate the hydraulic fracture of the well, the computer application may be able to enhance the understanding of the effects of the stress state on hydraulic fracture stimulations, thereby simulating more accurate hydraulic fracture paths or propagation directions.","At step , the computer application may map simulated hydraulic fractures  onto reservoir model  using stresses  to generate a three dimensional representation of the hydraulic fracture  for a stimulated well. In one implementation, the computer application may generate the three dimensional representation of the hydraulic fracture  by building a three dimensional volume of the hydraulic fracture using the geometry information as indicated in simulated hydraulic fractures . The computer application may build the three dimensional volume starting from the well location for each grid cell in reservoir model  on a cell-by-cell basis using the stress directions, as indicated in stresses , as a guide to determine the hydraulic fracture path. Although simulated hydraulic fractures  may be planar features, by using a three dimensional stress field as indicated in stresses  as a guide, the computer application may generate non-symmetrical hydraulic fracture propagations away from the well in order to build the three dimensional volume of the hydraulic fracture.","In one implementation, the computer application may use the three dimensional representation of the hydraulic fracture  to create a hydraulic fracture design for the reservoir. Data regarding the hydraulic fractures in the wellbore may then be gathered and used to recalibrate simulated hydraulic fractures . The recalibration process may be used to reduce uncertainties in mechanical properties , petrophysical properties  and simulated hydraulic fractures . In one implementation, the recalibration process may be repeated until the discrepancy between a first set of recalibrated data and a subsequent set of recalibrated data is less than a predetermined value.","At step , the computer application may update the permeability properties of each grid cell in the reservoir model that has been intersected by the three dimensional representation of the hydraulic fracture . In one implementation, the computer application may use the permeability properties  from reservoir model  as the initial permeability properties in the reservoir model. The computer application may update the initial permeability properties  of reservoir model  based on the three dimensional representation of the hydraulic fracture . In one implementation, the permeability update may be done using tracking software that ensures that the hydraulic fracture direction on a cell-by-cell basis in the reservoir model  follows the direction of the maximum principal horizontal stress.","In one implementation, the computer application may then use the updated permeability properties to generate an updated reservoir model  having the updated permeability properties. In another implementation, the computer application may determine production forecasts for the stimulated well based on the updated permeability properties.","Although method  has been described as being used to determine updated permeability properties and production forecasts, it should be noted that method  is not limited to being used for these tasks. For instance, method  may also be used to determine an optimum stimulation design, thus allowing for an enhanced prediction of reservoir performance, and enhanced predictions of projected revenue.","Advantages","Method  creates a 3D representation of the hydraulic fractures. In contrast, traditional methods for simulating hydraulic fractures use the principal stresses in the pay zone, such as a minimum principal horizontal stress, as an input in its simulator. The minimum principal horizontal stress may be calculated using a one-dimensional mechanical earth model (MEM). In this manner, the traditional method for simulating hydraulic fractures use a one dimensional mechanical earth model for doing rock mechanics calculations and simulations. The benefits of the three dimensional representation become apparent when opening up new areas of predictive modeling such as the prediction of changes in stress magnitudes and directions caused by production. As a result, the predicted stress magnitudes and directions can be used to guide the design of better stimulation treatments.","Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600"]},"The computing system  may include a central processing unit (CPU) , a system memory  and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to the CPU .
