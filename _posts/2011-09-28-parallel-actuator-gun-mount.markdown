title: Parallel actuator gun mount
abstract: A gun mount is provided that includes a first linear actuator, a second linear actuator, and a gimbal. Each of the first linear actuator and second linear actuator is terminated by a ball joint at either end thereof. One ball joint associated with each linear actuator is coupled to a location on a gun where the two locations are proximate to one another. The remaining ball joint associated with each linear actuator is coupled to a support base. An angular relationship is defined between the two linear actuators. The gimbal is one that provides two-degree-of-freedom movement, and is coupled to the gun forward of the ball joint attachment locations. The gimbal further is coupled to the support base so that the gun is supported by the gimbal and the linear actuators.

When a gun mount must provide and support adjustments in elevation and azimuth, gun mounts tend to become complex, heavy, and expensive.","Conventional gun mounts yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Accordingly, various exemplary embodiments provide a gun mount that can adjust a gun in azimuth and elevation, and\/or simultaneously make adjustments in azimuth and elevation.","Various exemplary embodiments enable simple construction of azimuth and elevation adjusting gun mount of simple construction. Other objects and advantages of various exemplary embodiments will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with various exemplary embodiments, a gun mount includes a first linear actuator, a second linear actuator, and a gimbal. The first linear actuator is terminated by a ball joint at either end thereof. The second linear actuator is terminated by a ball joint at either end thereof.","One ball joint associated with the first linear actuator is coupled to a first location on a gun and the remaining ball joint associated with the first linear actuator is coupled to a support base. One ball joint associated with the second linear is coupled to a second location on the gun in proximity to the first location, and the remaining ball joint associated with the second linear actuator is coupled to the support base.","An angular relationship is defined between the first linear actuator and the second linear actuator. The gimbal is one that provides two-degree-of-freedom movement, and is coupled to the gun forward of the first location and the second location. The gimbal further is coupled to the support base so that the gun is supported by the gimbal, the first linear actuator and the second linear actuator.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.","Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","In various exemplary embodiments, the gun mount  includes two linear actuators  and , and a gimbal , which provides two-degrees-of-freedom (2 DoF) in motion (effectively pitch and yaw). In general, each of linear actuators  and  is any mechanized\/motorized and controllable actuator that generates a linear motive force as indicated by two-headed arrows  and , respectively.","For example, each of linear actuators  and  can have respective piston rods A and A that move linearly along their length as indicated by respective arrows  and . Gimbal  is any such mechanism that provides two-degree-of-freedom movement (i.e., tilting) about its axis A. Such gimbal mechanisms are well known in the art. Generally, gimbal  includes a fixed and rigid outer ring B used to mount gimbal  in its application.","Each of linear actuators  and  is supported at one end thereof by a support base , and is coupled at another end thereof to gun stock  for support thereby. Linear actuators  and  extend away from the gun such that an angle \u03b1 is formed therebetween. Ball joints , ,  and  are used at each attachment or coupling point.","More specifically, ball joint  couples linear actuator  to base  and ball joint  couples the outboard end of piston rod A to gun stock . In a similar fashion, ball joint  couples linear actuator  to base  and ball joint  couples the outboard end of piston rod A to gun stock . In the illustrated embodiment, ball joints  and  are in proximity to one another and are positioned equidistant from gimbal .","While such positioning simplifies geometrical calculations for azimuth\/elevation adjustments, it is to be understood that this is not a requirement of the present invention. The angle \u03b1 between linear actuators  and  can be acute, right, or obtuse depending on the application.","Gimbal  is located forward of ball joints  and  where \u201cforward\u201d means that gimbal is closer to the muzzle  of barrel  than ball joints  and . For example, gimbal  can be coupled to barrel  with the gimbal's axis A aligned with the longitudinal axis A of barrel . Gimbal  is rigidly coupled to base  by, for example, at least one strut  coupled to outer ring B. In this way, barrel  can be tilted through any angle with respect to gimbal axis A.","Base  is generally a rigid support to prevent any relative movement between each actuator  and , and between actuators ,  and gimbal . Base  can be a free-standing base in which case the gun mount  can include base . Base  could also be an independent structure (e.g., building, turret, etc.) to which the above-described elements of gun mount  are coupled. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the nature of base  is not a limitation of the present invention.\n\n","The simple two-leg geometry defined by conventional linear actuators  and  is readily adjusted to a desired azimuth\/elevation using basic geometric relationships. The simple linear geometry of actuators  and  in combination with the two-degrees-of-freedom movement of gimbal  provide for any gun orientation change with simple linear movements  and  to simultaneously adjust barrel  in azimuth and elevation.","Although specific exemplary embodiments have been described, there are numerous variations and modifications that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. For example,  illustrates another embodiment of the present invention where common reference numerals are used for the elements described earlier herein.","In this embodiment, ball joints  and  are co-located or defined by a unified ball joint assembly that supports each piston rod A and A and their respective linear movements  and . It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, various additional embodiments of the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","10","102","300","100","16","12","14","18","20","22","24","26","200","500"]},"While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
