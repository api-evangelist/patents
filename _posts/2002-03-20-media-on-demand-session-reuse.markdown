{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates in general to session-based media content delivery.","With recent advances in digital transmission technology, subscriber television systems are now capable of providing much more than traditional analog broadcast video. In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal device (\u201cHCT\u201d), otherwise known as the set-top box, has become an important computing device for accessing media content services (and media content within those services) and navigating a user through a maze of available services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video functionality, digital HCTs (or \u201cDHCTs\u201d) now also support an increasing number of two-way digital services such as video-on-demand (VOD).","Typically, a DHCT is connected to a cable or satellite, or generally, a subscriber television system, and includes hardware and software necessary to provide the functionality of the digital television system at the user's site. Some of the software executed by a DHCT can be downloaded and\/or updated via the subscriber television system. Each DHCT also typically includes a processor, communication components, and memory, and is connected to a television or other display device, such as a personal computer. While many conventional DHCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television, a DHCT and\/or its functionality may be integrated into a television or personal computer or even an audio device such as a programmable radio, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","Two-way digital services, such as VOD, often require the establishment of network resources (i.e., the allocation of hardware and\/or software components and setting of the component parameters) to enable the delivery of media content (e.g., VOD movies) to a requesting DHCT subscriber, and the \u201ctearing down\u201d of these resources (i.e., the release of the components to enable further resource establishment) when, for example, the media content presentation has ended. The establishment of network resources for the delivery of media content defines the beginning of a session. Session setup and release are typically costly and\/or time consuming insofar as they can require frequent communication between various subscriber television system hardware and\/or software components.","Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.","The preferred embodiments of the invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. In particular, the preferred embodiments include a mechanism for re-using sessions, which will be described in the context of on-demand media content delivery in a subscriber television system. By re-using sessions, hardware and\/or software interactions that are typically integral to terminating and creating sessions for the delivery of media content are reduced, providing for an efficient utilization of network resources and reduced latency in the delivery of media content.  illustrate an example subscriber television system architecture that would benefit from re-using sessions.  describe general signaling interactions that occur within the subscriber television system to deliver on-demand media content.  illustrate the signaling interactions between resources to re-use sessions.","It will be understood, within the context of the below description, that re-using sessions is not limited to implementations that are connection oriented, and that non-connection oriented media content delivery is also within the scope of the preferred embodiments. This invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those having ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, all \u201cexamples\u201d given herein are intended to be non-limiting, and are provided as an exemplary list among many examples contemplated but not shown.","One embodiment of the invention is generally implemented as part of a subscriber television system (STS), which includes digital broadband delivery systems (DBDS) and cable television systems (CTS). As a non-limiting example, a subscriber television system (STS) and its operation will be described initially, with the understanding that other conventional data delivery systems are within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention.  shows a block diagram view of an STS , which is generally a high quality, reliable and integrated network system that is typically capable of delivering video, audio, voice and data services to digital home communication terminals (DHCTs) . Although  depicts a high level view of an STS , it should be appreciated that a plurality of subscriber television systems can tie together a plurality of regional networks into an integrated global network so that DHCT users can receive media content provided from anywhere in the world. Further, it will be appreciated that the STS  shown in  is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention. For instance, subscriber television systems also included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention include systems not utilizing physical structured cabling for transmission, such as, but not limited to, satellite systems. Further, transmission media included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, Hybrid Fiber\/Coax (HFC), optical, satellite, radio frequency (RF), frequency modulated (FM), and microwave. Further, data provided from the headend  to the DHCTs  and programming necessary to perform the functions discussed below will be understood to be present in the STS , in accordance with the description below.","The STS  typically delivers broadcast video signals as digitally formatted signals in addition to delivering traditional broadcast analog video signals. Furthermore, the system can typically support one way broadcast services as well as both one-way data services and two-way media content and data services. The two-way operation of the network typically allows for user interactivity with services, such as Pay-Per-View programming, Near Video-On-Demand (NVOD) programming according to any of several known NVOD implementation methods, Video-on-Demand (VOD) programming (according to any of several VOD implementation methods), and interactive applications, such as Internet connections.","The STS  also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to access media content from media content services, and distributes media content to DHCT users. As shown in , a typical STS  comprises a headend , hubs , an HFC access network , nodes , taps , and DHCTs . It should be appreciated that although a single component (e.g., a headend) is illustrated in , the STS  can feature a plurality of any one of the illustrated components, can omit components, or may be configured with alternative embodiments for any one of the individual components or with yet other additional components not enumerated above.","Media content provided by one or more content providers (not shown) is communicated by the content providers to one or more headends . From those headends  the media content is then communicated over a communications network  that includes a plurality of HFC access networks  (only one HFC access network  is illustrated). The HFC access network  typically comprises a plurality of HFC nodes , each of which may serve a local geographical area. The hub  connects to the HFC node  through a fiber portion of the HFC access network . The HFC node  is connected to a tap , which is preferably connected to a digital home communication terminal (DHCT) . Coaxial cables are typically used to couple nodes  and taps  because the electrical signals can be easily repeated with RF amplifiers. As the high-level operations of many of the functions of an STS  are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, further high level description of the overall STS  of  will not be contained herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","260","264","268","272","276","16","17","11","12"]},"As depicted in , the STS  () can simultaneously support a number of transmission signal types, transmission rates, and modulation formats. The ability to carry analog and digital signals over a large bandwidth are characteristics of an HFC network typically employed in an STS, as in the STS  of . As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, analog and digital signals in HFC networks can be multiplexed using Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), which enables many different types of signals to be transmitted over the STS  to the DHCT . Typically, an STS  using HFC supports downstream (i.e., in the direction from the headend  to the DHCT ) frequencies from 50 mega-hertz (MHz) to 870 MHz, whereas upstream frequencies (i.e., in the direction from the DHCT  to higher levels of the system) are in the 5 MHz to 42 MHz band. Generally, the RF bandwidth spacing for analog and digital services is 6 MHz. Furthermore, for a typical 870 MHz system in the United States (U.S.), a possible downstream RF spectrum subdivision plan uses 6 MHz frequency subdivisions, or spans, within the 50 MHz to 550 MHz band for analog video transmission signals and within the 550 MHz to 870 MHz range for digital transmission signals.","Analog transmission signals (ATSs)  shown in  are typically broadcast in 6 MHz frequency subdivisions, typically referred to in analog broadcasting as channels, having an analog broadcast signal composed of analog video and analog audio, and include Broadcast TV Systems Committee (BTSC) stereo and Secondary Audio Program (SAP) audio. Referring again to , the downstream direction transmission signals, having been multiplexed, and in one embodiment using FDM, are often referred to as in-band transmission signals and include Analog Transmission Signals (ATSs)  and Digital Transmission Signals (DTSs) , ,  (also known as Digital Transport Signals). These transmission signals carry video, audio, and data services. For example, these transmission signals may carry television signals, Internet data, or any additional types of data, such as Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data. Additionally, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, additional data can be sent with the analog video image in the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) of the video signal and stored in DHCT memory or a DHCT local physical storage device (not shown). It should be appreciated, however, that the amount of data that can be transmitted in the VBI of the analog video signal is typically significantly less than data transmitted in a DTS.","Like the ATSs , the DTSs , ,  each typically occupies 6 MHz of the RF spectrum. However, the DTSs , ,  are digital transmission signals consisting of 64- or 256-Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) digital signals preferably formatted using Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standards such as MPEG-2 transport streams, allocated in a separate frequency range. The MPEG-2 transport stream enables transmission of a plurality of DTS types over each 6 MHz RF subdivision, as compared to a 6 ATS. The three types of digital transport signals illustrated in  include broadcast digital transmission signals , carousel digital transmission signals , and on-demand transmission signals .","MPEG-2 transport may be used to multiplex video, audio, and data in each of these DTSs. However, because an MPEG-2 transport stream allows for multiplexed video, audio, and data into the same stream, the DTSs do not necessarily have to be allocated in separate 6 MHz RF frequencies, unlike ATSs , in one embodiment. On the other hand, each DTS is capable of carrying multiple broadcast digital media content instances, multiple cycling data carousels containing broadcast data, and data requested on-demand by the subscriber. Data is formatted, such as in Internet Protocol (IP), mapped into MPEG-2 packets, and inserted into the multiplexed MPEG-2 transport stream. Encryption can be applied to the data stream for security so that the data may be received only by authorized DHCTs. The authorized DHCT  is provided with the mechanisms to receive, among other things, additional data or enhanced services. Such mechanisms can include \u201ckeys\u201d that are required to decrypt encrypted data.","Each 6 MHz RF subdivision assigned to a digital transmission signal (DTS) can carry the video and audio streams of the media content instances of multiple television (TV) stations, as well as media content and data that is not necessarily related to those TV media content instances, as compared to one TV channel broadcast over one ATS  that consumes the entire 6 MHz. The digital data is inserted into MPEG transport streams carried through each 6 MHz frequency subdivision assigned for digital transmission, and then demultiplexed at the subscriber DHCT so that multiple sets of data can be produced within each tuned 6 MHz frequency span, or subdivision.","Although broadcast in nature, the carousel DTSs  and on-demand DTSs  offer different functionality. Continuing with , the broadcast DTSs  and carousel DTSs  typically function as continuous feeds for indefinite time, whereas the on-demand DTSs  are continuous feed sessions for a limited time. In one embodiment, all DTS types are capable of being transmitted at high data rates. The broadcast DTSs  carry typical data comprising multiple digitally-MPEG-2 compressed and formatted TV source signals and other continuously fed data information. The carousel DTSs  carry broadcast media content or data that is systematically broadcast in a cycling fashion but updated and revised as needed. Thus, the carousel DTSs  serve to carry high volume data such as media content and data and possibly, other data at high data rates. The carousel DTSs  preferably carry data formatted in directories and files by a Broadcast File System (BFS) (not shown), which is used for producing and transmitting data streams throughout the STS , and which provides an efficient means for the delivery of application executables and application media content and data to the DHCT, as will be described below. Media content and data received by the DHCT  in such manner can then be saved in the DHCT memory and\/or transferred to the DHCT storage device for later use. The on-demand DTSs , on the other hand, can carry particular information such as compressed video and audio pertaining to subscriber requested media content instance preview and\/or media content instance descriptions, as well as other specialized data information. Preferably, the User-to-Network Download Protocol of the MPEG-2 standard's DSM-CC specification (Digital Storage Media\u2014Command and Control) provides the data carousel protocol used for broadcasting data from a server located at headend , or elsewhere. It also provides the interactive download protocol for reliable downloading of data from a server (possibly the same server) to an individual DHCT through the on-demand DTSs. Each carousel and on-demand DTS is preferably defined by a DSM-CC session. Therefore, some of the basic functionality reflected in the DHCT  when the DHCT does not have a local physical storage device is somewhat similar to a networked computer (i.e., a computer without a persistent storage device), in addition to traditional set top box functionality, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A DHCT  with a storage device reduces data access latency when the data is stored in the local physical storage device ahead of time.","Also shown in  are Out-Of-Band (OOB) signals that provide continuously available two-way signaling to the subscribers' DHCT  regardless of which in-band signals are tuned to by the individual DHCT in-band tuners. The OOB signals consist of a Forward Data Signal (FDS)  and a Reverse Data Signal (RDS) . The OOB signals can comply to any one of a number of well known transport protocols but preferably comply to either a Digital Audio Visual Council (DAVIC) 1.1 Transport Protocol with an FDS of 1.544 mega-bits per second (Mbps) or more using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation and an RDS of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation, or to a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) Transport Protocol with an FDS of 27 Mbps using 64-QAM modulation and an RDS of 1.544 Mbps or more using QPSK modulation or 16-QAM modulation. The OOB signals provide the two-way operation of the network, which allows for subscriber interactivity with the applications and services provided by the network. Furthermore, the OOB signals are not limited to a 6 MHz spectrum, but generally to a smaller spectrum, such as 1.5 or 3 MHz.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["11","12","12","11","11","319","320","323","332","319","463"]},"The DNCS  provides management, monitoring, and control of the network's elements and broadcast services provided to users. In one implementation, the DNCS  uses a data insertion multiplexer  and a data QAM  to insert in-band broadcast file system (BFS) data into an MPEG-2 transport stream that is broadcast and received via DHCT's communication interface  () and tuner system  (). The DNCS  also contains a session management functionality preferably implemented through the use of modules, including a digital resource manager (DRM)  and a digital session manager (DSM)  (as explained below), that preferably uses the Digital Storage Media Command and Control (DSM-CC) protocol to set up and maintain MOD sessions. These modules  and  preferably process user to network (U-N) session signaling messages, manage allocation of session-related network resources, support network management operations, act as a point of contact to the network for the DHCT's  in the network  to establish individual sessions, and support MOD services by providing the signaling interface to establish, maintain and release client initiated exclusive sessions. The session manager modules  and  also define a resource descriptor structure, which is used to request the network resources within a session. Resource descriptors are mechanisms to carry data, and are typically structured with a header and a payload comprising fields that carry information about sessions, for example, bit rate. In the preferred embodiments, the DRM  matches, or correlates, new resource requests with resource sets available for re-use from previous sessions. More specifically, the DRM  uses resource descriptors and the resource descriptor attributes (the data items such as bit rate) of the resource descriptors and matches one or more of the attributes of the resource descriptors of the new session with a re-usable session. Further information on resource descriptors and existing session set-up protocol for connection oriented data communications, such as DSM-CC, can be found in ISO\/IEC 13818-6:1998, and Session Protocol by Time Warner Cable, Version 1.0, Jun. 10, 1999, both herein incorporated by reference. Also included with in the DNCS  is a QAM manager , which is used to provide an interface for communications between the DNCS  and a QAM of the service (or QAM) groups .","A service application manager (SAM) server  is a server component of a client-server pair of components, with the client component being located at the DHCT  (). Together, the client-server SAM components provide a system in which the user can access services, which are identified by an application to run and a parameter, such as particular data content, specific to that service. The client-server SAM components also manage the life cycle of the applications on the system, including the definition, activation, and suspension of services they provide and the downloading of the applications into the DHCT  as necessary.","Applications on both the headend  and the DHCT  () can access the data stored in a broadcast file system (BFS) server  in a similar manner to a file system found on operating systems. The BFS server  is a part of a broadcast file system that has a counterpart BFS client module  () in a DHCT  connected to the network . The BFS server  repeatedly sends data for applications on a data carousel (not shown) over a period of time in cyclical repeated fashion so that a DHCT  that is in need of reading any particular data file or parts thereof may receive it when requested by a user or one or more of its internal running processes.","A VOD content manager  is responsible for managing the content on the video pumps  of the VOD content servers . The MOD server application  controls both the VOD content manager  and the VOD content servers  and utilizes them to help deliver the video and audio streams that make up VOD services. In one embodiment, a MOD content manager and MOD content servers (not shown) could run respectively in parallel to the VOD content manager  and VOD content servers  to manage other types of on-demand media content. In an alternate embodiment a MOD content manager replaces the VOD content manager  and the MOD content servers replaces the VOD content servers . The QAM modulators that comprise the QAM group  receive the MPEG-2 transport streams from the VOD content servers , convert them into encrypted RF signals at a specified frequency (channel), and transmit them to a DHCT  () via the network .","The QPSK modem  is responsible for transporting the out-of-band Internet protocol (IP) datagram traffic between the distribution headend  and a DHCT  (). Data from the QPSK modem  is routed by a headend router  within the headend . The headend router  is also responsible for delivering upstream application traffic to the various application servers, for example application servers  and .","A transaction encryption device (TED)  is a special-purpose processor. The DNCS  employs the TED , in one embodiment, to create an interactive session key (ISK). For example, in asymmetric cryptography, the DNCS  supplies templates for each of two Entitlement Management Messages (EMM) (i.e., one used for the QAM of the QAM group  (herein, QAM) and the other used for the DHCT ) as well as public keys for the QAMs and the DHCT . The TED  preferably generates a triple-DES cryptographic key that will be used as the ISK. The TED  inserts this key in each EMM, then encrypts each EMM using the public key appropriate for the EMM's destination. The TED  returns the two resulting encrypted EMMs to the DNCS . The DNCS  sends the EMMs to the QAM and the DHCT . The QAM receives its EMM, decrypts the EMM using its private key, and extracts the triple-DES ISK. The QAM then proceeds to generate a stream of single-DES keys and uses each, in turn, to encrypt a portion of the session in question. At substantially the same time, the QAM inserts each single-DES key into an Entitlement Control Message (ECM), encrypts the ECM using the ISK, and inserts the encrypted ECM in the video stream along with the encrypted video. The DHCT  decrypts its EMM using its private key, extracts the ISK, and uses the ISK to decrypt the ECMs. In this way, it acquires the single-DES keys used by the QAM when encrypting the media content. In addition, there are markers in the encrypted video stream indicating when the QAM switched between single-DES keys. Note that in other embodiments, the functionality of the TED  can be implemented through software, such as the software of the DNCS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["16","11","441","16","16","463","11","16","16","442","11","18","11","18"]},"The DHCT  further preferably includes one or more processors, such as a processor , for controlling operations of the DHCT , an output system  for driving the television display , and at least one tuner system  for tuning into a particular television channel or frequency to display media content and for sending and receiving various types of data or media content to and from the headend . The DHCT  may include, in other embodiments, multiple tuners for receiving downloaded (or transmitted) media content. The tuner system  can select from a plurality of transmission signals () provided by the subscriber television system. The tuner system  enables the DHCT  to tune to downstream media and data transmissions, thereby allowing a user to receive digital or analog media content delivered in the downstream transmission via the subscriber television system. The tuner system  includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner for bi-directional QPSK data communication and one or more QAM tuners (in band) for receiving television signals. Additionally, a receiver  receives externally generated information, such as user inputs or commands from an input device, such as a remote control device , or other devices.","According to another embodiment of the invention, a telephone modem (not shown) in the DHCT  can be utilized for upstream data transmission and a headend , hub  () or other component located upstream in the STS  () can receive data from a telephone network corresponding with the telephone modem and can route the upstream data to a destination internal or external to the STS , such as an application data server in the headend  or a content provider.","The DHCT  may also include one or more wireless or wired interfaces, also called communication ports (not shown), for receiving and\/or transmitting data to other devices. For instance, the DHCT  may feature USB (Universal Serial Bus), Ethernet (for connection to a computer), IEEE-1394 (for connection to media devices in an entertainment center), serial, and\/or parallel ports. The user inputs may, for example, be provided by a computer or transmitter with buttons or keys located either on the exterior of the terminal or by a hand-held remote control device or keyboard that includes user-actuated buttons, or the user inputs may be aural.","The DHCT  can include one or more storage devices (not shown), preferably integrated into the DHCT  through an integrated drive electronics (IDE) or small computer system interface (SCSI), or externally coupled to the DHCT  via one of the communication ports described above. The storage device can be optical, among other technologies, but is preferably a hard disk drive.","In one implementation, the DHCT  includes system memory , which includes FLASH memory  and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) , for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor . Basic functionality of the DHCT  is provided by an operating system  that is preferably stored in FLASH memory . Among other things, the operating system  includes at least one resource manager  that provides an interface to resources of the DHCT  such as, for example, computing resources.","One or more programmed software applications, herein referred to as applications, are executed by utilizing the computing resources in the DHCT . Note that an application typically includes a client part and a server counterpart that cooperate to provide the complete functionality of the application. The applications may be resident in FLASH memory  or downloaded (or uploaded) into DRAM . Applications stored in FLASH memory  or DRAM  are executed by the processor  (e.g., a central processing unit or digital signal processor) under the auspices of the operating system . Data required as input by an application is stored in DRAM  or FLASH memory  and read by the processor  as need be during the course of the application's execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM  by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the DHCT , or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application at the time it was generated as a software application, in which case it is stored in FLASH memory . Data generated by an application is stored in DRAM  by the processor  during the course of the application's execution. DRAM  also includes application memory  that various applications may use for storing and\/or retrieving data.","An application referred to as a navigator  is also resident in FLASH memory . The navigator  provides a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT . The navigator  preferably handles channel navigation keys on the remote control device . It also preferably displays a channel banner with information about the selected channel. The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment\/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The navigator  also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT functions such as, for example, blocking a channel or a group of channels from being displayed in a channel menu.","The FLASH memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, a hyper-text markup language (HTML) parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a service application manager (SAM) client . The window manager  provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the display device screen regions and user input. The window manager  on the DHCT  is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and de-allocation of the limited DHCT  screen resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows.","The window manager  also maintains, among other things, a user input registry  in DRAM  so that when a user enters a key or a command via the remote control device  or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry  is accessed to determine which of various applications running on the DHCT  should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands, also called events. Events are the typical manner of communication between the operating system  and applications. When the user presses a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device , the command is received by the receiver  and relayed to the processor . The processor  dispatches the event to the operating system  where it is forwarded to the window manager  which ultimately accesses the user input registry  and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application.","The SAM application  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the headend , typically in the DNCS  (). A SAM database  (i.e., structured data such as a database or data structure) in DRAM  includes a data structure of services and a data structure of channels that are created and updated by the headend . Herein, database will refer to a database, structured data or other data structures as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Many services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. Examples of services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, presenting television programs (available through a WatchTV application ), pay-per-view events (available through a PPV application ), digital music (not shown), media-on-demand (available through an MOD application ), and an electronic program guide (EPG) (available through an EPG application ). In general, the identification of a service includes the identification of an executable application that provides the service along with a set of application-dependent parameters that indicate to the application the service to be provided. For example, a service of presenting a television program could be executed by the WatchTV application  with a set of parameters to view HBO or with a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represents a particular service that has a unique service I.D. The SAM application  also interfaces with the resource manager  to control resources of the DHCT .","Applications can also be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the SAM application , typically in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend . In the example DHCT  depicted in , DRAM  contains a media-on-demand application (MOD) , an e-mail application , an electronic program guide application , and a web browser application . It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for this present embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may, as an alternative embodiment, be resident in FLASH memory . These applications, and others provided by the cable system operator, are top level software entities on the network for providing services to the user.","In one implementation, applications executing on the DHCT  work with the navigator  by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application utilizes the SAM application  for the provision, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application shares DHCT  resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the SAM application , the operating system , and the DHCT . Third, an application handles situations where resources are only available with navigator  intervention. Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the SAM (the navigator  will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator (i.e., power, channel +\/\u2212, volume +\/\u2212, etc.).","The MOD application , in providing its service, engages in a direct two-way IP connection with the VOD content server  (). The MOD application server  () is responsible for providing configuration and service data to the MOD application , such as the catalog of titles available for purchase and\/or rental by the user. The MOD service may be activated when the user tunes to the MOD service. The user may access the MOD channel in a variety of ways, such as by accessing by direct channel number entry, as one example.","Preferably, when the user tunes to the MOD channel, the navigator  asks the SAM  for the service mapped to the channel, which is a service provided by the MOD application . The navigator  then uses the SAM  to activate the MOD service. If the MOD application  is not resident in the memory of the DHCT , the SAM  uses facilities of the operating system to download the MOD application  using the BFS client . Once loaded in DHCT  memory, the MOD application  is executed. An activate service event is then delivered to the MOD application . Contained in the event is the parameter data defined for the service by the MOD application server  () when it was provisioned by the system operator. The parameter preferably includes the URL for the MOD catalog on the BFS  (), the IP address and port of the MOD application server , and other system operator configurable parameters such as the initial browse-by category to display the catalog screen, a trailer channel to tune upon activation, etc.","The first time the MOD application  is activated, it connects to the MOD application server  () and retrieves information about the user. The MOD application  opens a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket and sends the MOD application server  a request for current user information. The request includes a Media Access Control (MAC) address uniquely identifying the DHCT , and thus identifying the user. The MOD application server  then returns the requested user information, including but not limited to current rental information and user configuration information. This information has been stored in the MOD application server  database previously based on the MOD application  creating VOD sessions and from commands from the MOD application  over a UDP socket to store user configuration information.","The titles presented in the MOD title catalog screen (not shown) that are grouped in the various title categories are arranged by a system operator through an interface (not shown) at the headend . The interface is provided by the MOD application server  (). The interface enables the system operator to configure separate catalogs and also the various title categories within each catalog. Mapping of titles to category is 1: N, and can be defined by the system operator via a MOD application server graphical user interface (GUI) (not shown).","Whenever a catalog or title category is updated or created, the catalog manager (not shown) of the MOD application server  () generates and updates the catalog file(s) using the BFS server  (). As described above the BFS server  is in constant communication with a BFS client  in the DHCT  to provide updates and new applications to the DHCTs  in the subscriber television system  ().","To provide the MOD service to the user, the MOD application  preferably interacts with the VOD content server  () and other elements in the headend  to establish a DSM-CC session. Previous control systems implemented each DSM-CC session (herein session(s)) requests quite literally. When a client or server requested a new session, the control system created one. When asked to release a session, the control system freed all network resources associated with the session. However, the preferred embodiments of the present invention include optional session re-use. As described above, a session will be understood to mean the allocation and arrangement (i.e., establishment) of hardware and\/or software resources in the headend  and\/or hub  () or elsewhere in the subscriber television system to provide media content to one or more DHCTs. Session creation, maintenance, and termination (for connection oriented media content delivery) are largely dictated by the DSM-CC protocol. The DNCS  implements session setup and release preferably through two DNCS session manager components, or modules: the Digital Session Manager (DSM)  and the Digital Resource Manager (DRM) . The DSM  is responsible for implementing the DSM-CC session signaling protocol, whereas the DRM  arranges network resources (for example, headend hardware and\/or software and encryption configuration) in support of sessions. Sessions for video on demand, IP, standing broadcast services, BFS data carousels, application-specific data carousels, audio-on-demand, and others, are similarly structured, and generally differ in the types of resources that are used. In the examples that follow, sessions will be described for video on demand (VOD), with the understanding that the same or similar mechanisms can be applied for IP and other session-based infrastructures, as well as other types of media on demand, as will be appreciated, in the context of the description herein, by one having ordinary skill in the art.","Any process descriptions or blocks in the flow charts and\/or flow diagrams that follow should be understood as representing modules, segments, or portions of code which include one or more executable instructions for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process, and alternate implementations are included within the scope of the preferred embodiment of the present invention in which functions may be executed out of order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrently or in reverse order, depending on the functionality involved, as would be understood by those reasonably skilled in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 3","FIGS. 5B and 5C","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["11","505","16","323","16","505","16","463","463","323","322","16","323","463","323"]},"Step  provides that the DNCS  forwards the request to the VOD content server  in the form of a session indication. In one embodiment, the DNCS  does not interpret the user-to-user data, but instead just forwards the request to the VOD content server . In other embodiments, the DNCS  performs some decision processing functionality, such as load balancing servers, matching proprietary devices (e.g., remote server to DHCT), and selection of communication terminals to optimize signal strength, among other functions.","After the VOD content server  receives the session indication, it interprets the request and makes a determination as to whether it can supply the requested movie. The VOD content server  also determines the resources and resource parameters (herein collectively referred to as resources) necessary to fulfill the session request. These resources can include the QAMs of the QAM group  () (herein, QAM or QAMs), video pumps (and\/or corresponding input transport stream identification (TSID)), MPEG input and\/or output program numbers, encryption, data rates, the audio\/video configuration (e.g., one video, 2 audio, stereo or mono) or elementary streams, and the signaling path between the VOD content server  and the DHCT  for bi-directional communication. Further, in some implementations, the VOD content server  can determine if the request is for content that is authorized for access by the requester (i.e., the DHCT  user), such as parental control personal identification numbers.","In some implementations, the VOD content server  can be in communications with a separate billing entity that determines the issue of authorized access and other billing issues. Also, in some implementations, the VOD content server  will have a table (not shown) that will correlate groups of users to particular QAMs (or input TSID's). In other implementations, the VOD content server  can provide a list of input TSID's for QAMs that can illuminate a requesting DHCT , and the DNCS  can decide the most acceptable input TSID of these choices. In some embodiments, the DNCS  may send the DHCT  a session proceeding indicating message (not shown) to alert the DHCT  that the session request is being processed.","If the VOD content server  determines that it can deliver the service, it sends back a resource request to the DNCS  to reserve and arrange the network resources to deliver the service (Step ).","Resource descriptors are used to define the resources that are allocated to a session. An interactive session preferably has two resource \u201cviews.\u201d The VOD content server  resource descriptor view (i.e., server view) defines the resources that are used to deliver the service from VOD content server  into the network  (). The MOD application  resource descriptor view (i.e., client view) defines resources that are used in order for the DHCT  to receive the service from the network . The descriptors have the same format, and in large part have the same content, but typically different data. For example, the TSDownstreamBandwidth descriptor in the server view includes the ID for the stream (i.e., TSID) from the VOD content server  to the network  at the server side of the QAM. In the client view, the TSID is the ID for the modulated output from the QAM modulator (i.e., the client side of the QAM).","For the VOD content server  resource descriptor view, several resource descriptors are used, including TSDownstreamBandwidth, MPEGProgram, as well as two other resource descriptors (ServerConditionalAccess and HeadEndID) that will be described below in association with . The TSDownstreamBandwidth resource descriptor contains a transport stream ID field and a bandwidth field. The transport stream ID identifies the physical connection from the VOD content server  to the network  (), as described above. This transport stream ID is typically assigned by a network operator when a new connection is installed. The DNCS  preferably maintains a table of input TSID's (i.e., the output of a particular video pump) to a corresponding QAM. A TSID is unique to a particular video pump (and thus to a particular QAM port). The bandwidth field identifies, in bits per second, the amount of bandwidth to deliver a service. This amount of bandwidth will be reserved in the network  (e.g., by the DNCS  communicating to a QAM the minimum required bandwidth, from which the QAM can adhere strictly to, in some implementations, or treat as advisory in other implementations) for the duration of the VOD session with the DHCT  that requests the service.","The MPEGProgram resource descriptor is another VOD content server  resource descriptor. This resource descriptor identifies the MPEG program number that is carrying the service and is passed by the DNCS  to the QAM, which in one implementation, picks the media content instance associated with the program number from the input transport stream and passes it to the QAM output for delivery to a requesting DHCT .","The second resource view of an interactive session is the MOD application  resource descriptor view (i.e., client view). This view is used for all services that use MPEG to deliver the downstream data. The resource descriptor, \u201cTSDownstreamBandwidth,\u201d contains a transport stream ID field and a bandwidth field. The transport stream ID identifies the QAM modulator in service group  () that is transmitting a service. In one implementation, the transport stream ID is assigned by a network operator (not shown) when a new QAM  is installed.","The bandwidth field identifies, in bits per second, the bandwidth at which a service will be delivered. The MPEGProgram resource descriptor identifies the MPEG program number that is carrying the service. This resource descriptor is used by the DHCT  to determine which media content instance from a transport stream identified by the TSDownstreamBandwidth resource to decode. As with the server view, the client view also includes the HeadEndID descriptors and a ClientConditionalAccess descriptor, as described below.","In Step , the DNCS  requests that the identified QAM start a session. This request includes directing the QAM to start a session with a particular input TSID. In general, the DNCS  (and cooperating hardware and\/or software) takes an MPEG program from a transport stream (coming from the VOD content server ) and ensures that the MPEG program (with program number or elementary stream PIDs potentially remapped) is modulated by a modulator whose output can be read by a client device (i.e., DHCT ). When setting a session on a QAM, the DNCS  communicates to the QAM both an input port and an output port. Each port maps one-to-one to a TSID. The output port also has a frequency, which was established when the QAM first started in the network  (). In asynchronous serial interface (ASI) and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) input scenarios, the DNCS  communicates the input MPEG program number to the QAM. In response to the request by the DNCS  to start a session, the QAM returns an acknowledgement that the session has started (Step ).","Continuing with the flowchart of  and the flow diagram of , the DNCS , in response to the acknowledgement (), requests an interactive session key (ISK) from the transaction encryption device (TED) , according to Step . The ISK is used in a similar way that the key to an entitlement management message (EMM) is used in broadcast encryption. The TED  forwards the ISK to the DNCS  (Step ), which then forwards the ISK to the QAM (Step ). The QAM repeatedly generates keys used to encrypt the media content. The QAM then encrypts these keys using the ISK, thereby creating entitlement control messages (ECMs), which are transmitted with the media content. The DHCT  receives the ISK via a client-view resource descriptor (e.g., the ClientConditionalAccess resource descriptor) included in the session confirmation (Step , described below). The DHCT , having received the ISK via the VOD session signaling, uses the ISK to decrypt the ECMs. The DHCT  then extracts the content keys from the ECMs and uses them to decrypt the elementary streams.","Referring to , with continued reference to , Step  provides that the DNCS  sends a resource confirmation to the VOD content server  to confirm that the resources requested by the VOD content server  have been established. In some implementations, the DNCS  can have discretion as to what input TSID of several available TSID's listed by the VOD content server  to choose from, and thus the resource confirmation can include an identification of what TSID was used. In Step , the VOD content server  sends to the DNCS  a session response accepting what has been done, and the VOD content server  starts delivering the requested media content to the allocated video pump (Step ).","Step  provides that the DNCS  forwards the information of the session response to the DHCT  in a session confirmation. The information in the session confirmation includes specifics about the resources set-up by the DNCS , including what frequency the DHCT  must tune to, the output MPEG program number (output from the QAM) the DHCT  must select to retrieve the requested on-demand media content instance, and the ISK message from which the DHCT extracts the ISK to decrypt the encrypted media content, as described above.","Finally, the QAM delivers the requested media content to the DHCT  (Step ), encrypting as media content is passed through the QAM from the video pump. Although this media content is delivered over a dedicated session, it is carried on a transport stream in MPEG packets over the defined carrier frequency from the QAM. The transport stream, due to the nature of MPEG, can be carrying a plurality of on-demand media content instances via VOD sessions to other users.","Other signaling supported by the network infrastructure is a periodic \u201ckeep-alive\u201d between the DNCS  and the DHCT . The DHCT  periodically sends a ClientSessionInProgress message (not shown), which lists the sessions currently terminating at the DHCT . The primary purpose is for the DNCS  to detect when a DHCT  powers off or reboots. The DNCS  keeps a transmission control protocol (TCP) connection open to each server, and synchronizes when it loses that connection. In some embodiments, a ServerSessionInProgress message as defined by DSM-CC can similarly be used for detection of loss of power or reboots.","The DHCT  can initiate a regular VOD session tear down. The regular session teardown includes the release of the network resources used to provide a VOD session. The release of the network resources enables the initiation of a new VOD session.  is a schematic diagram of the signaling interactions between network resources for tearing down a session using a client initiated session release. A session that is active on that particular DHCT  may be torn down by the DCHT . The relevant network resources include the DHCT , the VOD content server , the DNCS (broken down into component parts that include the DSM , the DRM , and the QAM manager ), and the QAM of service (or QAM) group . To initiate this process, the DHCT  sends a MOD application release request  to the DSM . The DHCT  typically sends the client release request  after it has stopped using all resources for a session that it is attempting to tear down. The DSM  forwards the request to the DRM  (Step ), and the DRM  sends a delete session request  to the QAM manager , which requests that the QAM delete the session (Step ). The QAM responds with a confirmation to the QAM manager  (Step ). The QAM manager  confirms to the DRM  that the session is deleted (Step ), and the DRM responds to the DSM  with a Release Rsrs Done message (Step ). The DSM  also, upon receiving the client release request , initiates a VOD server release indication  to the VOD content server . The VOD content server  responds with a server release response  to the DSM  which is then passed to the DHCT  in the form of a VOD client release confirm message . The DNCS  (through the DRM  and DSM  and QAM Manager ) preferably releases the resources provided for the session before the receipt of the VOD server release response  from the VOD content server .","A regular session tear down may also be initiated by the VOD content server .  is a schematic diagram  of the process for a VOD content server  to initiate a tear down session. Note that the DNCS  is not broken down into component elements for ease of discussion. The VOD content server  issues a server release request  to the DNCS  after it has stopped using all resources for a particular session that it is attempting to tear down. The DNCS  initiates a client release indication message  to the MOD application  () on the DHCT  which is responded to in the form of a client release response . The DNCS  then initiates a server release confirm message  to the VOD content server  that initiated the tear down. The DNCS  preferably releases the resources for the VOD session before the client release response message  is received by the DNCS .","A regular VOD session tear down may also be initiated by the DNCS . Again, as with , the DNCS  is not broken down into component elements for ease of discussion.  is a schematic diagram  of the DNCS  initiated session tear down. The DNCS  initiates a server release indication message  to the VOD content server  providing the VOD session. The DNCS  may also simultaneously send the client release indication message  to the DHCT  notifying the DHCT  of the tear down sequence. The VOD content server  that received the server release indication message  responds by a server release response message , and the DHCT  responds to the client release indication message  with a client release response message . The resource attributed or assigned to the VOD session is preferably released before both the client release response message  and the server release response message  is received by the DNCS .","The VOD content server  () preferably provides an applications programming interface (API) (not shown) by which the application servers can register interest in session setup and tear down events. Information describing these events is sent to registered application servers and include the session ID and the user (application) data contained in the session setup request, such as the MAC address of the DHCT , the title ID, and the rental option in the case of the MOD application. In this way the MOD application server  () can be notified when a VOD session is established with the VOD content server  by the MOD application  (). Additionally, the MOD application server  may use the API to request that the VOD content server  tear down the session if the user of the DHCT  is not authorized for the MOD service for billing reasons.","Session setup and release are typically costly insofar as they require communication with headend hardware and encryption devices. Individual VOD servers tend to serve content of a single type, resulting in session resource requests that, typically, seldom vary. For example, a single server that delivers VOD media content tends to request the same data rate for all of the sessions that it serves. The preferred embodiments preserve settings on headend hardware across sessions, requiring less communication with that hardware. The preferred embodiment will release network resources when necessary, and will re-use hardware setups whenever possible, as described below. Other embodiments release and re-use to a lesser extent. This is best illustrated by first showing changes to session release, as illustrated by the schematic diagram in .  is similar to the illustration of session termination depicted in , but with a description that is limited to the relevant resources for re-using sessions. As described above, the DHCT  issues a VOD client release request to the DSM  (Step ). The DSM  communicates this request to the DRM  (Step ). When asked to release session resources, the DRM  will hold the session for re-use (Step ) rather than instruct the headend hardware and\/or software to release the session. The DSM  replies to the DHCT  with a confirmation that the resource release has been initiated (Step ), with a later confirmation to the DHCT  when the resource release has been completed. The DSM  forwards the VOD client release to the VOD content server  in the form of a VOD server release indication (Step ). The VOD server  responds with a VOD server release response (Step ). The DRM  then responds to the DSM  with a confirmation that resources have been released (Step ), even though the resources are indeed being saved for re-use. In one implementation, the duration that the resources can be saved for re-use can be operator configurable.","Subsequently, the saved session may be used to satisfy a new session request, as shown in .  is a schematic diagram illustrating how sessions are re-used to satisfy resource requests. The steps shown in this display diagram prior to the allocation of network resources are similar to the steps followed in the session set-up as described in the flow diagram of , except the interactions between the DSM  and DRM  modules of the DNCS  are illustrated, and the resources are re-used, in accordance with the preferred embodiment. Step  provides that the DHCT  requests a VOD session to the DSM  of the DNCS . The DSM , in Step , forwards that request to the VOD content server  in the form of a session indication. The VOD content server  determines if it can supply the requested on-demand media content instance, and then submits its resource requirements to the DSM  (Step ). In Step , the DSM  forwards this request to the DRM .","Step  provides that the DRM  finds re-usable session resources. Once the DRM  has session information available for re-use, it can satisfy resource requests using pre-existing resource sets from previous sessions. In a preferred embodiment, the DRM  evaluates one or more resource descriptor attributes to make the determination as to whether resources match. For example, the DRM  can ensure that the session to be re-used will match the bit rate required by the new session. In one embodiment, the DRM  ensures that the bit rate of the re-used session is at least enough to satisfy the bit rate required for the new session. The DRM  can also evaluate whether encryption is required in the new session, and whether the re-usable sessions are configured for encryption. Another possible evaluation can include determining the constraints of the available video pumps  (), for example what MPEG program numbers are requested for the new session and what MPEG program numbers can be generated by the available video pumps . From that point, the DRM  can inform the DSM  that resources are allocated for the requested session (Step ), and the DSM  can forward that message in a confirmation to the VOD content server  (Step ). Following from there is a resource response (Step ) and session confirmation (Step ).","Thus, in the preferred embodiment, one or more of steps - ( and ) that occur during the initial session set-up can be eliminated for subsequent sessions to reduce the time and resources required to tear down and re-create sessions. As an illustrative example, assume the session for a first DHCT  has ended, and a session for a second DHCT  is requested. If the prior session for the first DHCT  included Lethal Weapon on MPEG program number , then Out of Africa, as requested by the second DHCT , is inserted in MPEG program number  in the same input transport stream ID, using the same QAM ports and thus the same output transport stream ID, without going through steps -.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["323","334","322","910","910","334","920","920","920"]},"From the session table , the DRM  can access the server view resource descriptors  and the client view resource descriptors  for comparison between the requested session and the sessions available for re-use, as described below.","In the preferred embodiment, as described above, the DRM  correlates new session resource requests with resource sets available for re-use from previous sessions. Resource descriptors and resource descriptor attributes (data items) that are considered in this correlation include TSDownstreamBandwidth , MPEGProgram , ServerConditionalAccess  (and its client view analog, the ClientConditionalAccess ), and the HeadEndId . The TSDownstreamBandwidth  includes the downstreamBandwidth field (not shown). The downstreamBandwidth field indicates the data rate in bits per second, which have been allocated to the session for delivery of application data to the DHCT. The TSDownstreamBandwidth  descriptor also includes the downstreamTransportID field (not shown), which identifies the TSID through which the session enters the network (i.e., output from the VOD pump).","The MPEGProgram  includes the mpegProgramNum field (not shown). This field is used to specify the program number being used to transport the video stream from the server to the network. Either the VOD content server  () or the DNCS  () can select the program number, and it is preferably agreed upon. Preferably, from one session to the next that has the same parameters, the program association table (PAT) will stay the same because the program number will typically stay the same. Thus, when the QAM builds a new PMT, it actually takes an input PMT and changes the PIDs. It may also change the program number because the input program number may be used by a different media content instance at the output, so the output program number may also be changed (e.g., after being re-mapped at the QAM). The PMT is saved in the QAM memory (not shown), and the QAM continues to send out the same memory location at the output until the DNCS  tells it to tear the session down. At that point, the DNCS  abandons the entries of the latest PMT, and new entries are created that are almost identical. In other words, the output table is not really destroyed, just modified based on new parameters. Thus, program  from one session may still be called program  in a succeeding session, thus re-using the parameters but sending different program content (e.g., Out of Africa instead of Lethal Weapon).","The ServerConditionalAccess  and ClientConditionalAccess  include two fields (not shown): CaSystemId and CopyProtection. The presence of the ServerConditionalAccess  descriptor in the resource request indicates that the server wants the session encrypted. The ServerConditionalAccess  appears in the server view of a session. The ServerConditionalAccess  identifies the clients (i.e., the DHCTs) that should have access to the session. The ClientConditionalAccess  appears in the client view of a session, and carries data used by the conditional access system to provide access to the session. For example, in the asymmetric cryptography described above, this resource descriptor carries an EMM that includes the ISK for the session. The CaSystemId shall specify the conditional access system to be used to protect the session. This field may be server assigned or assigned by the DNCS . Almost all sessions started in a given system will preferably have the same CaSystemId. The CopyProtection shall specify if copy protection shall be enabled for the asset by the client, and thus is relevant to application functionality.","The HeadEndId  includes three fields (not shown): HeadEndFlag, HeadEndId, and TransportStreamId fields. The HeadEndFlag takes one of four values that determine how the remaining fields should be interpreted. In typical use, this flag indicates that the HeadEndId field should be ignored. The HeadEndId field is an OSI NSAP (Open System Interconnection, Netscape Server API) address that is used to specify distribution of a session content to a particular Head End. This form of the resource descriptor is not used for VOD. It is used when starting broadcast sessions, to indicate a portion of the system to which the session should be delivered. The TransportStreamId field is used to identify the terminating transport stream of the connection through the network. The server may use this field to request that a specific QAM modulator carry a session.","As a non-limiting example implementation, upon receiving a request from the DSM  () for resources to satisfy a new session, the DRM  () will first determine whether the session request names a specific QAM modulator. If it does not, the DRM  will choose an appropriate QAM modulator for the session. An appropriate QAM modulator can include one or more QAM modulators that can illuminate the DHCT  requesting the new session, and\/or a QAM modulator that can receive the media content from a particular video pump  (). Whether the session request identifies a specific QAM or not, once a QAM modulator has been identified, the DRM  will use that modulator's output transport stream ID to index the list of re-usable sessions, looking for a session with one or more matching resource descriptor attributes. If a suitable re-usable session is found, the DRM  will use that existing session in response to the DSM .","The DRM  may succeed in matching resources, in which case the results will be returned to the DSM  (). If, on the other hand, the DRM  fails to allocate a new session, the DRM  will identify whether the failure is due to insufficient resources. If it is, this will indicate that out-of-use but re-usable sessions may be consuming resources needed by the new session. In response, the DRM  will release a session from the list of re-usable sessions for the output transport stream ID in question. The selected session will have a downstream bandwidth value at least as large as that for the new session. Upon releasing this unused session, which involves re-configuring hardware devices, the DRM  will again attempt to find resources for the new session. Another failure will result in a failure return to the DSM . If no such session is found, the DRM  will proceed with standard resource processing, attempting to configure devices to support the new session.","A recently released session is likely to be more useful if the VOD content server  () requests a new session with the same downstream bandwidth, MPEG program number, and encryption setting on the same QAM modulator. Encrypted settings can be used to carry content that need not be encrypted. Therefore, the DNCS  () can force encryption on all sessions, ensuring that a resource setup can be used to satisfy both encrypted and un-encrypted session requests. VOD content servers preferably use a single downstream bandwidth for all sessions. Servers will preferably re-use MPEG program numbers, but in some embodiments, can cycle through all MPEG program numbers. It is preferable to allow the DNCS  to choose the program number for a VOD session.","The DRM  () takes the responsibility for tracking resources for re-use. Resources of past sessions will preferably be released under two circumstances. First, when a new session requires a combination of resources that can not be satisfied by those used for a previous session, some old resource sets may be released to make room for the new session. Second, resource sets that have been dormant for a time will be released to free otherwise unused assets, thus reducing exposure to problems such as hardware failures.","The ability to ensure sessions can be re-used is provided for via several embodiments. In an ATM embodiment, the elementary streams are provided for, which enable a determination by the VOD content server  () of the video, audio, and\/or data configuration required. In the case of embodiments using ASI inputs to the QAM, the MPEG program number is used and it is preferably the responsibility of the QAM to keep the elementary streams apart. For example, in a VOD implementation with MPEG coming in through ASI ports, as long as the data rate is constant, changes in parameters will preferably cause the re-reading of the program specific information table (PSI). Changes in parameters will preferably be monitored by the VOD content server , for instance by providing a generation number in the header of a PMT whenever changes are made to the PMT. This change in generation number will preferably cause the QAM to re-read the PMT. A non-limiting example of a change would be MPEG program number. The server may index the media content such that program number  is the first media content instance on the VOD content server , program number  is the second media content instance, etc. However, in some implementations, the QAM may automatically re-number the program numbers (e.g., in ASI implementations) in order to associate the program numbers with a particular session. In other implementations, this re-numbering may not be automatic (e.g., in ATM implementations), thus resulting in a re-mapping of program numbers by the DNCS  (), or in some embodiments, the VOD content server  ().","The DNCS  () and its modules DRM  and DSM , among other supporting functionality, can be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. In the preferred embodiment(s), the DNCS  and its modules DRM  and DSM  are implemented in software or firmware that is stored in a memory and that is executed by a suitable instruction execution system. If implemented in hardware, as in an alternative embodiment, the DNCS  and its modules DRM  and DSM  may be implemented with any or a combination of the following technologies, which are all well known in the art: a discrete logic circuit(s) having logic gates for implementing logic functions upon data signals, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) having appropriate combinational logic gates, a programmable gate array(s) (PGA), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), etc.","The DNCS  () and its modules DRM  () and DSM  (), which comprises an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions, can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions.
