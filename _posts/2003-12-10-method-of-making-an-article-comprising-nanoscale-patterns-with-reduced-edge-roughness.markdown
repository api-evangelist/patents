The government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to nanoscale patterned articles having patterned surface features of minimum lateral dimension under a micrometer and preferably under 100 nanometers or less. It is directed to such articles having patterned edges and walls of reduced roughness compared to those conventionally available and to methods of making such patterned articles.","Nanoscale patterned articles, such as nanoscale gratings and wires, have many important applications in optics, electronics, biotechnology, and micro-fluidics. They can be used to filter and direct light, to facilitate fabrication of nanoscale mechanical and electronic devices, and to analyze biological molecules.","A typical nanoscale patterned article comprises a substrate with a microscopically patterned surface. A nanoscale grating, for example, can comprise a substrate, such as silicon or resist coated silicon, having a surface array of protruding parallel lines separated by intervening recessed lines. The lines can have a minimum dimension of under 100 nanometers and the spacing between successive lines can be on the order of 200 nm or less. Other articles use different surface patterns of comparably small feature size.","The roughness of line edges and sidewalls in such nanoscale surface patterns has an important bearing on device performance. Studies have shown that roughness causes scattering loss in optical devices, impedes electron transport through nano-scale wires and degrades performance in bio-analytic and micro-fluidic systems.","A variety of approaches have been proposed for the fabrication of smooth nanoscale surface patterned devices, but most are unsuitable for large-scale production. Previous fabrication methods include electron-beam lithography and interference lithography. Electron beam lithography, however, is a serial processing technique of inherently low throughput. Interference lithography is affected by random factors such as disturbances and instabilities in the exposure system which contribute to roughness.","Other approaches to reducing roughness include anisotropic wet etching and thermal oxidation of pattern sidewalls with etch-back. Anisotropic wet etching, however, can only be used on a limited class of crystalline materials. And thermal oxidation requires high temperature processing incompatible with many desirable materials.","Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a promising approach to patterning smooth nanoscale features. In NIL, a nanofeatured molding surface is typically imprinted into a surface, such as a polymer-coated substrate. The imprinted pattern can then be coated, as with metal, or the imprinted material can be selectively removed to expose the substrate surface for further processing. Further details concerning nanoimprint lithography are set forth in applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,905 issued Jun. 30, 1998 and entitled \u201cNanoimprint Lithography\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 6,482,742 issued Nov. 19, 2002 and entitled \u201cFluid Pressure Imprint Lithography.\u201d The '905 and '742 patents are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention provides articles comprising nanoscale patterns with reduced edge and sidewall roughness through adaptations in NIL processing.","In accordance with the invention, an article comprising a nanoscale surface pattern, such as a grating, is provided with a nanoscale patterns of reduced edge and\/or sidewall roughness. Smooth featured articles, can be fabricated by nanoimprint lithography using a mold having tapered profile molding features. Another approach especially fabricates the mold to provide smooth sidewalls of reduced roughness, and yet a third approach provides the article with a post-imprint smoothing step. These approaches can be utilized individually or in combination to make the novel smooth featured articles.","It is to be understood that these drawings are for the purpose of illustrating the concepts of the invention and, except for the photographs and graphs, are not to scale. Similar components are similarly designated throughout the drawing.","The description is divided into four parts. Part I describes an exemplary article having a nanoscale pattern with smooth edges and\/or sidewalls, and Parts II, III and IV describe approaches for making such articles.","I. Exemplary Article","Referring to the drawings,  is a schematic top view of an exemplary article  comprising a nanoscale patterned surface . Typical useful nanoscale surface patterns  are comprised of a plurality of protruding features  and one or more recessed features  having at least one protruding feature with a minimum lateral dimension l of less than 100 nm. State of the art is less than 25 nm and as small as 10 nm or less. The depth d between a protruding feature and a recessed feature is typically less than 250 nm and can be as small as 5 nm. Molds for making the patterns have complementary patterns with correspondingly small dimensions. In accordance with the invention, the surface patterns are provided with smooth pattern edges  and\/or smooth pattern sidewalls  having reduced roughness as compared with conventional nanoscale surface patterns. The article  differs from conventional nanoscale gratings in that the edges  have a low roughness of less than about 10 nanometers (i.e. no protrusions from the edge larger than 10 nanometers will appear on an SEM) and preferably less than about 5 nanometers and\/or the sidewalls  have a low roughness of less than about 5 nanometers.","A particular embodiment of such an article can be a large area sub-200 nanometer period grating. In a typical grating, the protruding features form an array of parallel lines separated by intervening recessed regions. Such gratings are cornerstone structures for many applications. They can be used in UV optical filters, polarizers, sub-wavelength optical devices and ultrahigh density patterned magnetic media.","II. NIL Using Tapered Molds To Reduce Pattern Edge Roughness","Unlike previous imprint-based patterning techniques, the present approach uses grating molds with tapered and preferably triangle-shaped profiles. The complement of the triangle profile relief pattern on the mold is then transferred into a resist thin film carried on a substrate by pressing the mold into the resist and removing the mold.","In essence, this first approach to making a nanoscale surface patterned article with smooth pattern edges and sidewalls comprises the steps of 1) providing a mold with a molding surface having a plurality of tapered regions; 2) providing a workpiece with a moldable surface; 3) pressing the molding surface and the moldable surface together to reduce the thickness of the moldable surface under the protruding features. This step produces reduced thickness regions; and 4) separating the mold and the moldable layer. The workpiece can then be further processed in the patterned regions to complete a nanoscale surface patterned article.","In exemplary subsequent steps, metal (or other suitable material) can be coated selectively onto the tips of the resist triangles through oblique angle deposition (e.g. shadow evaporation). After removing the portions of the resist that are not covered by the evaporated material to expose the underlying substrate, the grating pattern in the resist can be replicated in a material that is added onto the substrate or can be replicated directly into the substrate.","This approach offers many advantages over the prior art. First, the mold can be patterned to achieve extremely smooth (on the atomic level) sidewalls. The smoothness can be preserved and replicated in the resist (and the underlying substrate) because of the high-resolution (<10 nm) of nano-imprint lithography. Thus the approach produces patterns with smoothness unattainable by the prior art.","Second, this approach offers an advantageous way for controlling the grating duty cycle simply by changing the angle of incidence for shadow evaporation. Different line-widths can be obtained even when using the same mold. Our experiments show the line-width is linearly dependent on the angle of incidence, and it provides a line-width tunable range from 25% to 75% of the grating period. This is believed unachievable with the prior art.","Thirdly, the approach utilizes the natural crystalline orientations of the material that makes up the mold body. The resulting triangle grating lines will have the same apex angle in spite of the possible variations of line-width in the original pattern. Thus, the approach standardizes the mold topology and, at the same time, improves line-width uniformity across a wafer and from wafer to wafer.","We now describe how to provide a mold with tapered projecting features in  and how to use the mold to make a nanoscale patterned article in  et seq.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["12","10","12","10"]},"The mask layer  is then patterned into mask portions  (here a grating) to expose portions  of the mold surface () using suitable patterning techniques such as interference lithography, imprint lithography, electron beam lithography, or pattern transfer techniques such as lift off or reactive ion etching (RIE).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1D"],"b":["18","14"]},"In one experiment, the mold body  was made in a (100) silicon substrate, with the mask material  being a layer of thermally grown silicon dioxide.

The line-widths in the final replicated pattern are determined by the width  of the portions of the resist protected by the oblique angle coated mask . This width can be easily changed by adjusting the angle of incidence  for the oblique coating step. The change depends on the geometry of the triangle profile of the grating, described by angle . In the case of using a wet-etched (100) silicon mold, the angles  and  in the resist are 70.52\u00b0 and 54.74\u00b0, respectively. Preferably the angle  is in the range 25\u00b0 to 75\u00b0.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 9B","FIG. 9B"],"b":["40","38"]},"Also, since the duty cycle\/angle of incidence dependence is almost linear, the change of duty cycle can be achieved simply by using different angles of incidence, without the need of any modification of the mold or the imprinted resist profile. Thus the duty cycle can be readily varied or controlled in a production line.","In contrast, in conventional interference lithography, the change of grating duty cycle is typically achieved by using different doses for the exposure of photo-resist, the duty cycle\/dose dependence generally is not linear, the tuning range is small, the process is hard to control and not easily repeatable because line-widths are also affected by factors such as random disturbances and instability of the exposure system.","The present approach also offers the added benefit for improving grating line-width uniformity, as depicted in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 10A.1","FIG. 10A.2","FIG. 10B.1","FIG. 10B.2","FIG. 10C.1","FIG. 10C.2","FIG. 10"],"b":["14","30","30"]},"Good mold release properties are important in fabricating nano-scale features by nanoimprint lithography. Using a triangle shaped grating profile instead of a square greatly facilitates mold release.","There are two contributing factors to this improvement: First, for two molds with the same grating period  and feature depth  but with different profiles (triangle and square) as shown in  and , the contact area with the resist for a triangle profile mold  is only about 65% of the contact area for a square mold . This means a reduction in the total surface energy that needs to be overcome for mold separation. Second, the mold separation processes are different in the two cases. For a square mold , the sidewalls of the protruding features on the mold remain in contact with the resist until the tops of the mold features are moved out of the openings of the recesses in the patterned resist (), which increases resistance to the mold release.  shows the removal of a triangle mold  from the resist , once the mold is raised relative to the substrate, there is no further contact between the mold features and the printed resist. The absence of \u201cstickiness\u201d in this case facilitates separation by reducing the resistance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"The measurement clearly indicates that the triangle profile greatly reduced the total force needed to separate the mold from the resist, compared with a mold with square profile. Easier separation implies more flexibility in designing and choosing the imprint resists, which is very important and valuable for the implementation of large-scale production of nano-gratings by nano-imprint lithography.","III. NIL Using Smooth Walled Molds To Reduce Pattern Edge Roughness","Because line edge roughness in the master mold will also be duplicated in the resist, it is desirable to reduce sidewall roughness of the master mold. This approach to making a nanoscale surface patterned article with smooth pattern edges and sidewalls comprises the steps of 1) providing a mold with a molding surface having a plurality of protruding regions with smooth walls; 2) providing a workpiece with a moldable surface; 3) pressing the molding surface and the moldable surface together to reduce the thickness of the moldable surface under the protruding features to produce reduced thickness regions; and 4) separating the mold from the moldable surface. The workpiece can then be further processed in the patterned regions in accordance with methods well known in the art.","The wet etching technique used in the mold fabrication step illustrated in  provides desirable smooth side walls.

NIL Using Post-Imprinting Treatment To Reduce Roughness","A third approach uses a moldable surface that becomes viscous when heated. The approach comprises the steps of providing a workpiece with a moldable surface of such material, patterning the moldable surface into a nanoscale surface pattern and then, after the patterning, heating the moldable surface material to its viscous state. In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises the steps of 1) providing a mold with a molding surface having a plurality of protruding regions; 2) providing a workpiece with a moldable surface having a glass transition temperature; 3) pressing together the molding surface and the moldable surface to reduce the thickness of the moldable surface under the protruding features to produce reduced thickness regions; 4) separating the mold from the moldable surface; and 5) heating the moldable surface above the glass transition temperature.","This approach can be used to even further smooth moldable surfaces imprinted by the tapered mold process of  or the smooth side-wall molding process of .

It can be applied to other thermoplastic polymers such as PMMA with similar thermal characteristics as well.","Using these NIL-based line edge roughness reduction techniques, we have successfully fabricated nano-scale gratings over large area (4-inch wafer) on various substrates. The smallest grating pitch achievable is around 190 nm, which is determined by the wavelength of the laser (351.1 nm) used in interference lithography.","These nano-scale gratings with smooth sidewalls have many important applications, including subwavelength optics, micro\/nano-fluidic devices and bio-analysis for the manipulation of single biological molecules.","In subwavelength optical applications, because transmission loss increases as the second exponential of roughness' as light propagates inside the gratings, smoothing technologies can be used for the fabrication of highly-efficient subwavelength devices.","Recently we have fabricated and demonstrated a fluidic device consisting of sealed nano-channels so that double-stranded DNA molecules can be stretched and moved along these channels. Fabrication of super smooth gratings is a critical step in this application because of the small dimensions (<100 nm) of the channels, resistance encountered by the molecules as they move in the channels increases drastically as the sidewall roughness increases.","In conclusion, we have developed sidewall smoothing technologies based on nanoimprint lithography. Using these technologies, we have fabricated nano-gratings with extremely smooth sidewalls over large area. Compared with other sidewall smoothing technologies, ours are low-cost, effective and can be applied to a variety of materials and substrates. These smooth gratings have a variety of applications in optics, micro\/nano-fluidic devices and biotechnology.","It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific techniques and materials described herein, and may be implemented in any appropriate forms. For example other types of materials can be used for the mold body. Besides Si02, other materials (e.g. Si3N, metal, and polymer) and processes (e.g. lift-off and electron-beam lithography) can be used to pattern the initial wet-etch mask. Other etching processes and conditions can be used to etch the desired features into the mold. In some embodiments, a dry plasma etching using appropriate gases can be utilized in mold preparation to achieve a similar etching selectivity between different crystal planes, so that a comparable effect as wet chemical etching can be obtained.","It should also be pointed out that although the fabrication of one-dimensional grating structure is used here for the purpose of demonstration. The same principle can be applied to the fabrication of two-dimensional structures as well.","To fabricate a two-dimensional structure, the mask  depicted in  will comprise a two-dimensional array of dots or holes. Using the steps described in , a mold  with pyramidal surface features  (or the reverse of the pyramids, depending on whether the original two-dimensional mask pattern is a dot array or an array of holes) can be formed as shown in .","Pattern transfer using the two-dimensional mold can be carried out in the same spirit as the steps described in  and . The fabricated features can be arrays of dots or holes, depending on the mold and the particular pattern transfer process used. However, the same principle of feature dimension control by using different incident angle  as depicted in  also applies in this case.","It can now be seen that one aspect of the invention is a nanoscale patterned article having on at least one surface a pattern comprising a plurality of protruding features and recessed features, at least one protruding feature having smooth edges, smooth sidewalls and a minimum lateral dimension between the sidewalls, the edges and sidewalls having a maximum surface roughness less than 5 nanometers and the minimum lateral dimension less than 100 nanometers. Typically a plurality of the protruding features protrude from the surface by a distance in the range 5 to 250 nanometers. In a typical embodiment, a plurality of protruding features comprise an array of parallel lines separated by recessed features to form a grating.","Another aspect of the invention is a method of making an article comprising a nanoscale surface pattern having reduced edge and\/or sidewall roughness. The method comprises the steps of: 1) providing a mold with a molding surface having one or more nanoscale protruding regions tapering toward the end distal the surface, the protruding regions arranged complementary to the pattern; 2) providing a workpiece with a moldable surface; 3) pressing together the molding surface and the moldable surface to reduce thickness of the moldable surface under the protruding features; and 4) separating the mold from the moldable surface.","A third aspect of the invention involves the use of very smooth mold sidewalls. Specifically, a method of making an article comprising a nanoscale surface pattern having reduced edge and\/or sidewall roughness comprising the steps of: 1) providing a mold with a molding surface having one or more nanoscale protruding regions having smooth sidewalls with a surface roughness of less than about 5 nanometers, the protruding regions arranged complementary to the pattern; 2) providing a workpiece with a moldable surface and the moldable surface; 3) pressing together the molding surface and the moldable surface to reduce the thickness of the moldable surface under the protruding features; and 4) separating the mold from the moldable surface.","Yet another aspect of the invention involves the use of a moldable surface that becomes viscous upon heating. In a preferred embodiment, it is a method of making an article comprising a nanoscale surface pattern having reduced edge and\/or sidewall roughness comprising the steps of: 1) providing a mold with a molding surface having one or more protruding regions arranged complementary to the pattern; 2) providing a workpiece with a moldable surface of material having a glass transition temperature; 3) pressing together the molding surface and the moldable surface to reduce the thickness of the moldable surface under the protruding features, thereby imprinting the pattern on the moldable surface; 4) separating the mold from the moldable surface; and 5) heating the moldable surface above the glass transition temperature to smooth the edges and sidewalls of the imprinted pattern.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The advantages, nature and various additional features of the invention will appear more fully upon consideration of the illustrative embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings.
