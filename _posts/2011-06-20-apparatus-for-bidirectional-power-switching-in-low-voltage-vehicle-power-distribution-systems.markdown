{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention was made with U.S. Government support under Contract No. W56 HZV-07-C-0095 awarded by U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command (TACOM).","The present invention relates generally to power distribution systems, and more particularly to low voltage high current switching control systems for connecting different DC power sources to one or more loads, particularly as used in vehicle power management systems but not limited thereto.","In known high current low voltage DC power distribution systems, such as those used in military ground and aerial vehicles, for example (but not limited thereto), a combination of electromechanical relays, contactors, circuit breakers and\/or fuses, are employed to selectively distribute power to an associated vehicle's electrical devices or loads. The various electrical components of the vehicle system are protected through use of the fuses and\/or circuit breakers. The power generating devices, and storage batteries employed in such vehicles are selectively switched into connection with the various system components via the use of electromechanical relays and\/or contactors, which in certain systems may provide bi-directional power control. However, such electromechanical switching devices present reliability problems due to mechanical wear, arching between relay contacts, deterioration from vibration, and moisture exposure. Also, the mechanical contacts of electromechanical relays and\/or contactors tend to bounce when activated or deactivated, thereby generating high amplitude electrical noise in the associated system. Also, in systems powering reactive loads that tend to draw high inrush currents when electrically activated, abrupt electrical relay contact closures for providing power to such devices typically results in power surges. In addition, such prior systems typically require a large amount of power to be applied to the electromechanical relays and contactors, in order to insure the maintenance of high mechanical pressure between associated electrical contacts for minimizing contact resistance. Also, the use in the prior systems of manually operated switches and circuit breakers forces a layout, such as in vehicles, that provides easy accessibility to such manually operated components.","There is a present need in the state of art for high current low DC voltage power distribution systems having bi-directional power control capability with improved reliability, and automonous and remote operational capability. The present invention provides a major improvement in enhancing the reliability of high current low DC voltage power distribution systems employing bi-directional power control.","An object of the invention is to provide an improved high current low DC voltage power distribution system.","Another object of the invention is to provide a solid-state high current low DC voltage power distribution system requiring low power operation, and offering high reliability, negligible electrical noise upon switching, bi-directional power control, and the ability to limit the magnitude of inrush currents when applying power to reactive loads.","With these and other objects in mind, the present invention, in one embodiment, includes a plurality of pairs of series connected power MOSFETs modules arranged in a modified symmetrical \u201cphase leg\u201d switching configuration. The MOSFET arrangement is not application specific and in this embodiment has at least three inputs and at least one output to a common bus or load. In application the inputs connect between power sources such as batteries and\/or generators and devices or loads to be powered by the system, whereby individual control signals are selectively provided to the gates of the individual ones of the plurality of pairs of MOSFETs, via programmable control means, for in one mode of operation providing initially reduced current flow to a load through use of forward biased intrinsic diodes of the MOSFETs, followed by turn on of an appropriate one of the MOSFETs associated with the intrinsic diode(s) to provide increased current to an associated load from a selected source of power. In a preferred arrangement, for each successive two of the plurality of pairs of series connected power MOSFETs, an output MOSFET of one pair is connected in parallel to an output MOSFET of the following pair to reduce or minimize power dissipation and current path resistances.","In another embodiment of the invention, in a first mode of operation a plurality of MOSFETs are configured for selective connection of at least one or a combination of a primary battery, secondary battery, and motor driven generator for connection to an internal bus, and therefrom to at least one device or load requiring the selective application of DC power. The control system has means to tie any of the inputs to the MOSFET array together (i.e. primary and secondary batteries busses can be connected together to provide backup capability in the event of a battery failure.) In this mode, a controller means is programmed to sense when the voltage output of the primary battery is higher than that of the secondary battery, for initially turning on a selected first MOSFET of a given series connected pair thereof, for permitting current to flow from the primary battery through the turned on or activated MOSFET, and through the forward biased intrinsic diode of a second MOSFET of another pair thereof, into the secondary battery, and after a delay time, the second MOSFET is turned on for minimizing the resistance in the current path between the primary and secondary batteries to maximize the current flow from the primary battery to the secondary battery. In a second mode of operation, when the controller means senses that the voltage level of the secondary battery is greater than that of the primary battery, the controller means is operable for turning on the second MOSFET for permitting the current to flow from the secondary battery through the intrinsic diode of the first power MOSFET into the primary battery, and after a time delay to turn on the first MOSFET for maximizing the current flow from the secondary battery to the primary battery. In a third mode of operation when the generator is operable for providing DC power, the controller means includes means for sensing such generator operation, and first operating a selected third MOSFET for permitting charging current to flow from the generator through an intrinsic diode of a fourth MOSFET, and into the primary battery, whereby after a time delay the fourth MOSFET is turned on to minimize the resistance in the current path between the generator and primary battery to maximize the charging current flow therebetween. In a fourth mode of operation, the controller means is operable for turning on a fifth MOSFET to permit current to flow from the generator through the intrinsic diode of a sixth MOSFET to provide a flow of current from the generator to the secondary battery, and after a predetermined time delay to turn on the sixth MOSFET transistor for maximizing the charging current flow from the generator to the secondary battery. The purpose of these modes is to provide a smooth power transition by first establishing a current path via closing a first MOSFET switch of a series connected pair whose intrinsic diode opposes current flow to allow the diode of the associated second MOSFET switch to conduct, thus establishing a current path. Once established, the second MOSFET switch is turned on to reduce the connection path power dissipation. The reverse diode of the first MOSFET is required to block current to break the connections in the event one wishes to turn the system OFF or if there is an over current condition.","A relatively low voltage high current power distribution system includes nine pairs of MOSFETs connected between an internal bus and at least a primary battery, secondary battery, and motor driven generator, and between the internal bus and at least one load or component requiring power. Controller means including means for sensing the level of voltage output from the primary and secondary batteries, and from the generator, whereby the controller means is programmed to selectively operate the nine pairs of MOSFETs in a plurality of modes of operation. In the first mode of operation, when the primary battery voltage level is higher than the secondary battery voltage level, a selected first MOSFET having a reverse biased intrinsic diode is turned on for providing a current path from the primary battery through the main current path of the first MOSFET, and through the relatively higher resistance of a forward intrinsic biased diode of a second MOSFET to the secondary battery, whereafter a desired time delay, the second MOSFET is turned on for reducing the resistance in the current path to maximize the flow of current from the primary battery to the secondary battery. In the second mode of operation, when the voltage level of the secondary battery is greater than that of the primary battery, the second MOSFET is turned on to establish a current path from the secondary battery through the intrinsic reverse diode of the first MOSFET through the primary battery, and after a desired time delay the first MOSFET is turned on for minimizing the resistance between the first MOSFET and the primary battery to maximize the current flow from the secondary battery to the primary battery. In a third mode of operation the controller means upon sensing operation of the generator, selectively turns on a third MOSFET for permitting charging current to flow from the generator through the low resistance main current path of the third MOSFET, and the intrinsic reverse diode of a fourth MOSFET to the primary battery, and after a desired time delay the fourth MOSFET is turned on to minimize the resistance in the current path for maximizing the flow of charging current from the generator to the primary battery. In a fourth mode of operation, when the generator operation is sensed, the controller means is selectively operable for turning on a fifth MOSFET to establish a current path from the generator through an intrinsic reverse diode of a sixth MOSFET to the secondary battery for charging thereof, and after a desired time delay, the controller means turns on the sixth MOSFET for minimizing the resistance in the current path to maximize the flow of charging current from the generator to the secondary battery. In a fifth mode of operation, upon the controller means sensing operation of the generator, the controller means is selectively operable for turning on a seventh MOSFET to establish a current path from the generator through the intrinsic diodes of eighth and ninth MOSFETs to the internal bus, whereafter a tenth MOSFET is turned on for connecting a load to the internal bus, causing an initial low magnitude of current to flow from the generator to the load, followed by a time delay period after which the eighth and ninth MOSFETs are turned on for minimizing the resistance in the current path, thereby maximizing the magnitude of current flowing from the generator to the load. In a sixth mode of operation, an eleventh MOSFET is turned on for establishing a current path from the primary battery through the intrinsic diodes of twelfth and thirteenth MOSFET transistors and the main current path of the eleventh MOSFET, whereafter a fourteenth MOSFET is turned on for connecting the internal bus to a second load, to supply a relatively low magnitude of current thereto, and after a predetermined time delay the twelfth and thirteenth MOSFETs are turned on for minimizing the resistance in the current path and maximizing the magnitude of current flow from the primary battery to the second load. In a seventh mode of operation, a controller means is operable for turning on a fifteenth MOSFET to establish a current path from the second battery through the intrinsic diodes of sixteenth and seventeenth MOSFETs and the main current path of the fifteenth MOSFET to the internal bus, whereafter an eighteenth MOSFET is turned on to connect the internal bus to a third load, thereby permitting a relatively low magnitude of current to flow from the secondary battery to the third load. After a predetermined time delay period the sixteenth and seventeenth MOSFETs are turned on for minimizing the resistance in the current path to maximize the magnitude of current flowing from the secondary battery to the third load. In other modes of operation, the controller means is operable for turning on any desired combination of the tenth, fourteenth, and eighteenth MOSFETs, for connecting any combination of the first through third loads to the internal bus. In yet other modes of operation, the controller means is operable for establishing current paths for connecting any combination of the generator, primary battery, and secondary battery to the internal bus for selectively providing power to any combination of the first through third loads, and for selectively connecting the generator to either one or both of the primary and secondary batteries for charging the same, while at the same time utilizing the generator to provide power to the various loads. The MOSFET configuration can be extended within practical limits to include additional batteries, and\/or generators, and to provide power to more than three loads therefrom.","In typical vehicle electrical systems, a generator\/battery set is used for electrical power. With the advent of sophisticated electronic equipment, the need for clean un-interruptible power has become necessary to operate electronics found on many Military ground and air platforms. In such systems requiring \u201cclean\u201d power, it is often required to have a primary electrical system to operate the normal vehicle loads (i.e. vehicle starter, windshield wipers, lights, heaters, etc.) and a secondary battery (as a minimum) or generator\u2014battery set to provide power for momentary power dropouts. A typical prior power distribution system  is shown in , and consists of three DC power sources , ,  that are routed to an internal bus IB, and then to individual outputs , , ,  for load distribution. In this example, three DC power sources are shown (although the concept can be reduced or expanded to any number desired), and include one motor driven DC generator , one primary battery , and one secondary or backup battery . The power system outputs are represented as high current outputs , , , respectively, and a low current output , for providing power to the vehicle system electrical loads.","The prior power distribution system  of  has two possible modes of operation which will now be described. Each operating mode corresponds to typical vehicle power systems. Note that these are the most common applications, and the approach can be adapted to other specific applications.","In Mode 1 operation, the primary battery  provides continuous power to the internal bus IB and corresponding vehicle loads (not shown). Operation of the vehicle engine (not shown) energizes the DC generator  and allows it to provide power to the internal bus IB, and system loads connected to output terminals , , , , respectively, while charging the primary battery . In Mode 1, the secondary battery  serves as a reserve and can be connected if necessary (i.e. primary battery  failure). This type of system is commonly used in large vehicles with two (or more) electrical systems.","Mode 2 operation is indicative of the type of electrical systems found in smaller vehicles, and consists of one generator , a primary battery , and secondary battery . In this system, the generator  operates all vehicle loads and charges both the primary and secondary batteries , . The secondary battery  is switched to the internal bus IB, and keeps it powered when the voltage drops on the primary electrical system during drop outs or outages.","In both mode 1 and mode 2 power system operational modes described above, it is apparent that power must be able to flow from the generator  bi-directionally to each battery , , and to various loads, to facilitate power delivery and charging. The system must also be able to block power to maintain necessary isolation between the power sources, and prevent pull downs of the internal bus IB.","As previously indicated, prior known power distribution systems are for implementing low voltage power architectures similar to those described above, and utilizes a combination of electromechanical relays, contactors, fuses, and switches or circuit breakers, such as shown in .","With further reference to the prior power distribution system  shown in , typical operation of this system will now be described. Whenever power contactor K is closed or energized, the primary battery  is connected to the internal bus IB. Typically, military type vehicles utilize 28 volts DC power systems, although other levels of DC voltage may be used. In this example, assume that with power contactor K energized, and circuit breaker CB closed; the engine of the associated vehicle can then be started, whereafter DC generator  is driven by the motor. After the motor is started, power contactor K is energized utilizing the output power from the generator to both provide necessary power to the vehicle, while at the same time charging the primary battery . Depending upon the vehicle's power requirements at any given time, in this example, power contactor K is energized along with closure of circuit breaker CB to provide power to a load connected to output terminal ; power contactor K is energized along with closure of circuit breaker CB to provide power to a load connected to output terminal ; and power contactor K is energized along with closure of circuit breaker CB to apply power to a load connected to output terminal . If excessive currency is drawn from primary battery , fuse F will open to protect the battery from overload. Similarly, should excess power be drawn from the generator , fuse F will open to protect the generator . In the event of failure of the primary battery , power contact K is energized to insert secondary battery  into the system and onto the internal bus IB. Also, at times that a sensor (not shown) senses that the voltage of the secondary battery  drops below a desired level, the contactor K can be energized to permit the generator  to charge the secondary battery  back up to the desired voltage level, whereafter power contactor K is opened or de-energized.","Although the prior power distribution system  of  provides power control, it has several disadvantages. The operation of power contactors K through K typically require a significant amount of power for operation. This is necessary to maintain high pressure on the conductor contact surfaces to minimize contact resistance. The components are mechanical in nature and are subject to mechanical wear, contaminants, moisture and vibration and electrical arcing. The abrupt switching of the contacts generates noise from contact bounce and from current transients as the sudden current switching excites the cable reactance in the system. The use of high current circuit breakers CB, through CB and fuses F, F, F also require manual intervention in the case of a system fault. Several improvements have been made in the art by replacing the circuit breaker\/contactor output pairs (CB, K) with solid-state relays using power MOSFETS, transistors or IGBTs. While this approach is proven and eliminates some of the problems associated with the electromechanical components, most devices in the present art for low voltage power distribution are unidirectional (i.e. power source to load) and are not capable of handling high currents. Many known components are optimized for high voltage distribution and create too much voltage drop and power dissipation for use in low voltage DC systems.","The inventors conceived a low voltage high current DC power control and distribution system, primarily for vehicle power distribution, that includes a power MOSFET array or matrix for providing high power switching, and bi-directional power control between DC sources of power, along with unidirectional high current control of power outputs to various loads. The DC power sources particularly include batteries, and motor driven generators.  shows a DC power distribution system  that includes a number of embodiments of the present invention that will be described in further detail below. It should be noted that although the DC distribution or power control system  is shown to include as DC power sources a primary battery , a motor driven DC generator , and a secondary battery , each being configured along with the switching network to at different times provide power to three loads connected to output terminals , , and , respectively, it is not meant that the system be so limited, and can be expanded to include additional DC power sources, and accommodate more than three loads or devices requiring DC power. Expansion of the present DC power control system  is limited only by practical considerations within the present state-of-the-art.","With further reference to the DC power control and distribution system  of , in a preferred embodiment for a low voltage high current application the power MOSFET matrix includes a plurality of dual power Trench MOSFET modules , A; , B; , A; , B; , A; , B; , ; , ; and , . However, the invention is not meant to be limited to Trench MOSFET devices, whereby any power MOSFET having an intrinsic source drain body diode that can handle a given application's power requirements can be used for the various embodiments of the invention. Also included is a controller . To facilitate the understanding of the operation of the present system , the intrinsic reverse diodes or source-drain body diodes for each of the MOSFET devices are also shown. These source-drain body diodes include D through D, DA through DA, DB through DB, and D through D. Note that the aforesaid diodes are indicative of the direction of blocking current flow when their associated MOSFET is turned off. As will be further explained, in order to implement a bi-directional switching capability, each power path of the matrix of MOSFETs of system  includes back-to-back diodes. The inventors further recognized in conceiving the present invention that each of the aforesaid power MOSFETs are operable in three modes, the first being a non-conductive mode, a second being a mode where current flows through an associated source-drain body diode, and a third mode responsive to a gate signal for turning on the MOSFET to provide a low resistance connection between the associated source drain connections thereof, shunting the associated body diode. In one application of the present invention, the aforesaid dual power Trench MOSFET modules were provided by VMM 1500-0075X2 modules, manufactured by IXYS Corporation (Milpitas, Calif. 95035). Each such IXYS dual power MOSFET module includes a pair of series connected Trench MOSFETs, each of which is rated at 75 volts, 1500 amps, and each has when conductive a drain-source resistance of 0.38 milliohms. The present inventors chose this component in view of its compatibility with 28 volts vehicle systems, and the requirement that the system  be capable of handling at least 500 amp currents. However, as previously mentioned, this choice of component is not meant to be limiting, for the present invention can be realized using other individual power MOSFETs, and power MOSFET packages having different voltage and current ratings. It should be further noted that this choice of component for the particular requirements of one application for the DC power distribution system  provided an extremely compact switching array having minimal space or volume requirements, providing via each of the associated MOSFET switches a very low voltage drop, low power dissipation, and high current operation. Note further that each of the selected dual power MOSFET modules include three pairs of Trench MOSFETs, each pair of Trench MOSFETs being connected in pairs relative to their channels, whereby only such module is necessary for providing pairs of MOSFETS  through , as shown in , for example. As indicated, the present inventors chose to use time delay switching in the switching matrix having 100 millesecond delays, but such delay is not meant to be limiting. Also, in one embodiment the controller  includes a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) programmed to provide control signals through use of included analog circuitry, logic networks, analog-to-digital converters, and so forth.","Operation of the power distribution and control system  will now be described. Note that in  the gate, source, and drain connections for each of the MOSFETs shown are designated by S, D, and G, respectively. Also the controller  provides control signal lines C through C for connection to the gates of the aforesaid MOSFETs,  through , A, B, A, B, A, B, and  through , respectively. Controller  causes control lines C through C to go high to turn on MOSFETs  through , respectively; C through C to go high to turn on MOSFETs A, B, A, B, and A, B, respectively; and C through C to go high to turn on MOSFETs  through , respectively. The primary battery , secondary battery , and DC generator  are connected to controller , as shown. Note also in this application, reference designations C through C are used to designate either a control signal line, or an associated control signal with the same designation, which when \u201chigh\u201d turns on its associated MOSFET. In a first embodiment of the invention, the primary battery  is initially connected in a relatively high resistance current path via diodes DA, DB of MOSFETs A, B, respectively, to the drain of MOSFET , whereby when controller  provides a gate signal C to the gate of MOSFET , the latter is turned on or energized to provide a relatively low resistance current path for connecting the primary battery to internal bus IB. Note that the forward bias resistance of all of the aforesaid source-drain body diodes of the IXYS MOSFETs is typically dependent on the magnitude of current, and is typically less than 2.5 milliohms for the aforesaid IXYS Trench MOSFETs. After MOSFET switch  is turned on, either simultaneous with such turn on or after predetermined phase-lag or time delay (100 ms, for example), control signals C, and C can be applied to the gates of MOSFET switches A, B, respectively, for connecting their energized channel resistances in parallel to minimize the resistance of the current path from primary battery  to the internal bus IB (the parallel channel resistances will total about 0.19 milliohms when using the aforesaid IXYS Trench MOSFETs). Such action completes a low resistance current path from primary battery  to the internal bus IB, whereby the total resistance of this current path will be the sum of the series channel resistances of MOSFETs A, B and , or about 0.57 milliohms. Note further that if control signal C is present, MOSFET  will be turned on to apply the primary battery  to a load connected to output terminal . Note further that where required, time delay switching can be utilized to first allow current to pass through the intrinsic diode DB, followed by turning on MOSFET B at a predetermined time later, such as 100 milleseconds later, for example, for shunting diode DB with the low resistance channel thereof in an energized state.","The MOSFET switches  through  are configured to act as output switches, for controlling the application of power to loads connected to output terminals , , and , respectively, the DC power being provided from the internal bus IB. The MOSFET switches  through  are configured to be analogous to main circuit breakers, whereby controller  is operative to terminate control signals C, C, and\/or C, in the event of overload current or excessive current flowing through MOSFETs  through , respectively, to the internal bus IB. Such control is provided either individually or in some combination in accordance with the operation of MOSFETs  through , at any given time. Note that when MOSFETs  through  are turned off, their associated intrinsic diodes D through D, respectively, block the flow of current from primary battery , DC generator , and secondary battery , respectively to the internal bus IB. Similarly, when the output MOSFET switches  through  are turned off, their associated intrinsic diodes D, D, and D, respectively, block the flow of current from the internal bus IB to output terminals , , and , respectively.","When system  is employed for providing power to a vehicle, typically the primary battery  with at least MOSFETs A, B, and  turned on, the vehicle engine is started. The engine (not shown) then operates DC generator  for providing DC power to the vehicle systems and recharging the primary and\/or secondary batteries , , respectively, as required, and as will be explained in further detail. Typically, the DC generator  when energized has a higher DC output voltage than batteries , , respectively, whereby if this condition is not true at any given time, a sensing circuit (not shown) will disconnect the generator and switch to battery operation.","Upon operation of the DC generator , the controller  is operative for turning on the aforesaid MOSFET switches in many different combinations, depending upon the vehicle requirements, and sensed operating conditions at any given time. For example, the magnitude of current flowing through any current path to a load can be monitored via a current sensor, such as a Hall-effect sensor (not shown) for programming the controller  to turn off any operative one of MOSFETs  through , in the event of an overload condition, as previously mentioned. With the DC generator  operative, controller  can be programmed to apply control signal C to MOSFET  to turn it on, while initially retaining MOSFETs A and B de-energized, whereby a relatively low magnitude of current can flow from DC generator  through the intrinsic diodes DA and DB, and through the channel or main current path of MOSFET  to the internal bus IB. Controller  can be programmed to after a time delay of 100 milleseconds from the time of turning on MOSFET , for example, to apply control signals C to the gate of MOSFET A, and C to the gate of MOSFET B, to turn them on, for minimizing the current path resistance between the DC generator  and the internal bus IB. With the generator connected to the internal bus IB, controller  can be programmed to apply control signals C through C, to the gates of MOSFET switches  through , respectively, in any desired combination for powering loads connected to output terminals , , and , respectively.","When the DC generator  is operative for providing power to the internal bus IB, as previously indicated, controller  can be programmed to turn on MOSFETs A, B, and  for charging primary battery  from the DC generator  via internal bus IB. Alternatively, for a more direct charging path, MOSFET switches  and  can be turned on, with A and B turned off, for charging primary battery  from DC generator .","Note further that in the switching matrix configuration of system , for one embodiment of invention, MOSFET switches A and B, A and B, and A and B are individually or in any combination respectively turned on together or turned off together, and are thereby operative as individual MOSFET switch pairs, respectively. As described for MOSFET A and B, when each aforesaid pair are turned on their respective channels are connected or parallel thereby minimizing the associated current path resistance.","When controller  senses that the primary battery  has a voltage level below a predetermined operating level, MOSFETs A, B, and  are turned off, and MOSFETs A, B, and  are turned on, for connecting the secondary battery  to the internal bus IB. In operating with the primary battery , time delay switching can be utilized, whereby first MOSFET switch  is turned on with MOSFET switches A and B turned off, whereby a relatively high resistance current path will be established from secondary battery , through the intrinsic diodes DA and DB, and the channel of MOSFET  to the internal bus IB, whereby 100 milleseconds later (in this example), controller  operates to turn on MOSFET switches A and B, for minimizing the resistance of the current path between the secondary battery  and internal bus IB.","The MOSFET switching matrix of system  is operable via a controller  for providing bi-directional current control between primary battery , and secondary battery , as immediately described. As previously mentioned, in the prior art connection between the primary and secondary batteries , , respectively, is typically provided by closure of electromechanical contactors or relay contacts, whereby the direction of current flow is dependent on the level of the battery voltages of the system at the time of contact closure. Such abrupt circuit connection typically results in high inrush currents, and electrical noise produced from the electromechanical contacts. As will be explained, the present invention overcomes these problems by first sensing the relative levels of voltage of the primary battery  and secondary battery  before any connection therebetween, and directly controlling MOSFET switches  and  of system  in a manner that provides for current flow between the batteries to be first minimized by flow-through associated intrinsic diodes, followed by maximizing the current flow through turn on of the MOSFET associated with the forward biased intrinsic diode to minimize the resistance in the current path therebetween. More specifically, in this example, the logic network of  is built into controller  for comparing the voltage levels of primary battery  and secondary battery  at any given time. The logic network  operates by supplying the voltage levels of primary  and secondary battery  via A\/D converters ,, respectively, to individual inputs of a XOR (Exclusive OR) gate . The primary voltage level from A\/D  is also applied to an input of an AND gate , with the secondary voltage level also being applied from A\/D  to an individual input of another AND gate . The output of XOR gate  is applied through a delay logic  to individual inputs of AND gate  and . When the output of AND gate  is high, and that of AND gate  is low on signal lines , , respectively, the secondary voltage level is less than the primary voltage level. When the output of AND gate  is high on signal line , and low signal line , this is indicative of the secondary voltage being greater than the primary voltage level. When the output signals from And gate  and AND gate  are each low, the low signals being applied as inputs to OR gate , the latter operates to apply a high signal on signal line  indicating that the primary voltage level is equal to the secondary voltage level.","The controller  further includes a control logic network  as shown in , for controlling the sequence of turn-on of MOSFETs  and , as will be described. As shown in , the logic network  includes an OR gate  receiving individual digital input signals from sensing circuitry (not shown) indicative of the voltage level of the primary battery  and secondary battery  having at least one at an operational level, with the output from OR gate  being applied to an individual input of an AND gate . An enable EN signal is applied to the other input of AND gate , the output of which goes high upon receiving high input signals. The output of AND gate  is connected to individual inputs of AND gates , , and . AND gate  also has individual inputs connected to the output line  of OR gate , and an override line . And gate  also has individual inputs connected to the output line  from AND gate , and an override signal line . AND gate  also has individual inputs connected to an override line , and to output line  from AND gate  of logic . The output of AND gate  is connected to individual inputs of OR gates  and , respectively. The output of AND gate  is connected directly to an independent input of OR gate , and through a delay  to an independent input of OR gate . AND gate  is connected directly to an independent input of OR gate , and through a delay  to an independent input of OR gate . When the output of OR gate  is high, control line C goes high for turning on MOSFET  of system , and when the output of OR gate  is high, control line C goes high for turning on MOSFET  of system . More specifically, at times that it is necessary to connect primary battery  to secondary battery , when their voltage levels are equal, the logic networks  and  of , respectively, cause MOSFET switches  and  to turn on simultaneously for directly connecting the batteries ,  to one another via a minimum resistance current path. When it is sensed that the level of the voltage for the primary battery  is higher than that of the secondary battery , control signal line C goes high, with control signal line C low, for turning on MOSFET switch , thereby connecting primary battery  through the low resistance channel or main current path of energized MOSFET , and the intrinsic diode D of MOSFET  to secondary battery , thereby initially establishing a relatively high resistance current path therebetween. After a predetermined delay period, 100 milleseconds in this example, control signal line C from the output of OR gate  will go high for turning on MOSFET , for establishing a relatively low resistance path between batteries  and . Yet in another mode of operation, when the level of voltage of the secondary battery  is greater than that of the primary battery , logic networks  and  are operative for causing the output line C of OR gate  to go high for turning on MOSFET switch , for connecting the secondary battery  through the low resistance main current path of MOSFET , and the relatively high resistance of intrinsic diode D of MOSFET , to the primary battery , whereby after a delay period of 100 milleseconds, in this example, the output of OR gate  goes high for causing signal line C to go high to turn on MOSFET switch , for establishing a substantially low resistance current path between batteries  and .
