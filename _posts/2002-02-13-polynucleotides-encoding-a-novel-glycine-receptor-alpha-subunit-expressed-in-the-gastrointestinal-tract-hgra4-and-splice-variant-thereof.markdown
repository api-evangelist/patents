The entire teachings of the referenced application are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention provides novel polynucleotides encoding HGRA4 polypeptides, fragments and homologues thereof. The present invention also provides novel polynucleotides encoding a HGRA4 splice variant, HGRA4sv. Also provided are vectors, host cells, antibodies, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polypeptides. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods for applying these novel HGRA4 and HGRA4sv polypeptides to the diagnosis, treatment, and\/or prevention of various diseases and\/or disorders related to these polypeptides. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention.","Glycine-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission is essential for voluntary motor control, flex responses and sensory signal processing. The receptor for glycine is normally found in the spinal cord and the midbrain where it imparts control on motor and sensory pathways. The receptor shows selective permeability to the anion Cl (Betz, 1991). The receptor is a pentamer of three alpha subunits and two beta subunits for a combined molecular weight of approximately 260 kDa. The channel is opened to ion flow by the binding of glycine to each of the 3 alpha subunits (Young and Snyder, 1974). The glycine receptor is effectively blocked by the compound strychnine. To date four different alpha subunits have been cloned and one beta subunit. Expression of the alpha subunits in oocytes produces a functional receptor suggesting that the alpha subunit forms the pore. The beta subunits may have modulatory roles like mediating the fast potentiation of the receptor by calcium (Fucile et al., 2000). An additional subunit, gephyrin, can associate with the intracellular region of the beta-subunit and link the receptor complex to the cytoskeleton via attachment to tubulin (Rajendra et al., 1997). The alpha subunits that have been described are comprised of approximately 420 residues. Hydropathy analysis predicts an N-terminal extracellular region, four transmembrane domains (TM1\u20134), and a large intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4. There are two disulfide loops on the extracellular portion of the protein that are essential for receptor function.","Mutations in the glycine receptor alpha 1 gene have been shown cause hereditary hyperkplexia and spastic paraparesis (Elmslie et al., 1996; Shiang et al., 1993). Studies on antagonists and partial agonists of the glycine receptor have suggested that the glycine receptor has a role in memory deficits in inhibitory avoidance learning (Viu et al., 2000). Other studies have shown that glycine receptors can modulated neurite outgrowth in developing mouse neurons (Tapia et al., 2000). Recent work in both mouse and hamster sperm have provided evidence for the role of glycine receptors in the acrosome reaction demonstrating that glycine receptors function outside of the nervous system (Llanos et al., 2001; Sato et al., 2000). Agonists and antagonists for these modulating factors could be useful for therapeutic purposes.","Using the above examples, it is clear the availability of a novel cloned glycine receptor alpha subunit provides an opportunity for adjunct or replacement therapy, and are useful for the identification of glycine receptor agonists, or stimulators (which might stimulate and\/or bias glycine receptor function), as well as, in the identification of glycie receptor inhibitors. All of which might be therapeutically useful under different circumstances.","The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors, which include the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, and to host cells containing the recombinant vectors, as well as to methods of making such vectors and host cells, in addition to their use in the production of HGRA4 polypeptides or HGRA4sv polypeptides using recombinant techniques.

The invention also provides a novel splice variant form of the HGRA4 polypeptide, HGRA4sv. Transcripts for HGRA4 are found in the gastrointestinal tissues, to a significant extent in brain, and to a lesser extent, in testis and spinal cord, suggesting that the invention potentially modulates inhibitory neurotransmission function in these tissues. The HGRA4 polynucleotide of the present invention is believed to represent the human ortholog of the partially cloned mouse alpha 4 subunit (Genbank Accession No. gi|817957). Therefore, the polynucleotide of the present invention has been tentatively named HGRA4, for Human Glycine Receptor Alpha 4. All references to \u201cHGRA4\u201d shall be construed to apply to HGRA4, and\/or HGRA4sv unless otherwise specified herein.","In the present invention, \u201cisolated\u201d refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered \u201cby the hand of man\u201d from its natural state. For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be \u201cisolated\u201d because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term \u201cisolated\u201d does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide\/sequences of the present invention.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length. In a further embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention comprise a portion of the coding sequences, as disclosed herein, but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment, the polynucleotides comprising coding sequences do not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to the gene of interest in the genome). In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).","As used herein, a \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, or the cDNA contained within the clone deposited with the ATCC. For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences, the coding region, with or without a signal sequence, the secreted protein coding region, as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a molecule having the translated amino acid sequence generated from the polynucleotide as broadly defined.","In the present invention, the full length sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:3 was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis). A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO:3 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (\u201cATCC\u201d). As shown in Table 1, each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID (Identifier) and the ATCC Deposit Number. The ATCC is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110\u20132209, USA. The ATCC deposit was made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure. The deposited clone is inserted in the pSport1 plasmid (Life Technologies) using the NotI and SalI restriction endonuclease cleavage sites.","Unless otherwise indicated, all nucleotide sequences determined by sequencing a DNA molecule herein were determined using an automated DNA sequnencer (such as the Model 373, preferably a Model 3700, from Applied Biosystems, Inc.), and all amino acid sequences of polypeptides encoded by DNA molecules determined herein were pridcted by translation of a DNA sequence determined above. Therefore, as is known in the art for any DNA seuqnece detemrined by this automated approach, any nucleotide seqence determined herein may contain some errors. Nucleotide sequences determined by automation are typically at least about 90% identical, more typically at least about 95% to at least about 99.9% identical to the actual nucleotide seqnece of the sequenced DNA molecule. The actual sequence can be more precisely determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art, a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence will be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded bt the sequenced DNA molecule, beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.","Using the information provided herein, such as the nucleotide sequence in  (SEQ ID NO:1), a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding the HGRA4 polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures, such as those for cloning cDNAs using mRNA as starting material. Likewise, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding the HGRA4sv polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures, such as those for cloning cDNAs using MRNA as starting material using the information provided herein, such as the nucleotide sequence in  (SEQ ID NO:3). Illustrative of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule described in  (SEQ ID NO:1) was discovered in a cDNA library derived from human brain.","The determined nucleotide sequence of the HGRA4 cDNA in  (SEQ ID NO:1) contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 417 amino acid residues, with a deduced molecular weight of about 47.7 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the predicted HGRA4 polypeptide is shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2).","The determined nucleotide sequence of the HGRA4sv cDNA in  (SEQ ID NO:3) contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 431 amino acid residues, with a deduced molecular weight of about 49 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the predicted HGRA4sv polypeptide is shown in  (SEQ ID NO:4).","A \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:1, the complement thereof, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:2, the complement thereof, or the cDNA within the clone deposited with the ATCC. \u201cStringent hybridization conditions\u201d refers to an overnight incubation at 42 degree C. in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 \u03bcg\/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1\u00d7SSC at about 65 degree C.","Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6\u00d7SSPE (20\u00d7SSPE=3M NaCl; 0.2M NaH2PO4; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 ug\/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1\u00d7SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5\u00d7SSC).","Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and\/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.","Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA+ sequences (such as any 3\u2032 terminal polyA+ tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).","The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. \u201cModified\u201d bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.","The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of the polypeptide, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the polypeptide of the present invention (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the polypeptide of the present invention.)","The term \u201corganism\u201d as referred to herein is meant to encompass any organism referenced herein, though preferably to eukaryotic organsisms, more preferably to mammals, and most preferably to humans.","The present invention encompasses the identification of proteins, nucleic acids, or other molecules, that bind to polypeptides and polynucleotides of the present invention (for example, in a receptor-ligand interaction).

An alignment of the HGRA4 polypeptide with these proteins is provided in .","The HGRA4 polypeptide was determined to share 90.7% identity and 92.5% similarity with the human glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit protein, also known as, strychnine binding subunit (GRA1; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504019; SEQ ID NO:10); to share 90.7% identity and 92.5% similarity with the human glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit protein (GRA3; Genbank Accession No. gi|5729844; SEQ ID NO:11); to share 90.7% identity and 92.5% similarity with the mouse glycine receptor subunit alpha 4 protein (GRA4; Genbank Accession No. gi|817957; SEQ ID NO:12); and to share 90.7% identity and 92.5% similarity with the human glycine receptor alpha-2 subunit protein (GRA2; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504021; SEQ ID NO:13) as shown in .","The human glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit protein, also known as, strychnine binding subunit (GRA1; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504019; SEQ ID NO:10) is a human glycine receptor that has been mapped to chromosome 5q32 and found to be linked to the incidence of the autosomal dominant neurologic disorder hereditary hyperekplexia (also known as familial startle disease (STHE)), which is characterized by marked muscle rigidity of central nervous system origin and an exaggerated startle response to unexpected acoustic or tactile stimuli. The incidence of hereditary hyperekplexia was only associated with mutations in exon 6 which resulted in the presence of Arg271 in the mature protein.","The human glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit protein (GRA3; Genbank Accession No. gi|5729844; SEQ ID NO:11) is also a human glycine receptor that has been mapped to chromosome 4q33. Two primary splice forms of this protein alpha3L, and alpha3K were identified, in particular, one of the variants (alpha3K) coding. One of the variants lacked the coding sequence for 15 amino acids located within the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane spanning region 3 (TM3) and TM4. Functional expression in HEK 293 cells of alpha3L and alpha3K subunits resulted in the formation of glycine-gated chloride channels that differed significantly in desensitization behavior, thus defining the cytoplasmic loop as an important determinant of channel inactivation kinetics.","The HGRA4 polypeptide is believed to represent the human ortholog of the mouse glycine receptor subunit alpha 4 protein based upon its significantly shared percent identity and percent similarity. Based upon the observed homology, the polypeptide of the present invention may share at least some biological activity with glycine receptors, specifically with glycine receptor alpha subunits, more specifically with the mouse glycine receptor subunit alpha 4 protein, in addition to, other glycine receptor alpha subunits referenced elsewhere herein.","The HGRA4 polypeptide described herein possesses critical residues that participate in ligand binding, as well as, cysteines that are required for the formation of important disulfide bonds in the extracellular portion of the protein (see ). Specifically, the ligand binding residues are represented by amino acids from about 193 to about amino acid 195, and from about 235 to about amino acid 239 of SEQ ID NO:2. The conserved cysteine residues are represented by amino acids 172, 186, 233, and 244 of SEQ ID NO:2.","Most of the known glycine receptors possess four transmembrane domains (TM1 thru TM4). However, analysis of the sequences from multiple clones corresponding to HGRA4 polynucleotides has revealed the presence of a stop codon that truncates the protein by 36 residues, whereby eliminating the last conserved transmembrane domain (TM4) present within other members of the glycine receptor family (see ). The effect of eliminating this part of the protein is unknown. However, the majority of the sequence that makes up the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domain TM3 and TM4 has been retained. The truncation of the protein in this region should have no effect on the Cl-pore (which is comprised of the TM2 domain).","The HGRA4 polypeptide has been determined to comprise 3 transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2, and TM3) as shown in FIGS. A\u2013C and A\u2013B. The transmembrane domains are located from about amino acid 255 to about amino acid 281 (TM1), from about amino acid 288 to about amino acid 305 (TM2), and\/or from about 320 to about amino acid 343 (TM3) of SEQ ID NO:2.

Additional, the HGPR4 was also expressed significantly in the brain, dorsal root ganglia, pituitary, ovary and the uterus. These data suggest that HGPR4 would be useful for treating, detecting, and\/or ameliorating disorders or diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system, including various types of syndromes that involve excitotoxic cell death and chronic peripheral neuropathies (neuropathic pain). HGRA4 may also play a role in modulating longitudinal muscle\/myenteric plexus contractions, and hence agonists or antagonists of HGRA4 could be used to treat various types of gastrointestinal disorders.","As described elsewhere herein, glycine receptor alpha subunits have been implicated in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission which is essential for voluntary motor control, flex responses and sensory signal processing. Therefore, HGRA4 polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating inhibitory neurotransmission which is essential for voluntary motor control, flex responses and sensory signal processing.

Current treatments of depression include blockers of neurotransmitter uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter degradation which act to prolong the lifetime of neurotransmitters.","It is believed that certain diseases such as depression, memory disorders and Alzheimer's disease are the result of an impairment in neurotransmitter release.","Glycine receptor antagonists may therefore be utilized as cell excitants which may stimulate release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin and dopamine.

Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the HGRA4 polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known glycine receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed above, might indicate a function in modulating glycine receptor function, for example. In the case of HGRA4, brain, heart, colon, uterus, testis, and\/or spinal cord tissue should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the HGRA4 gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiements. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:1 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the HGRA4, transforming yeast deficient in glycine receptor alpha subunit activity and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the HGRA4 polypeptide has glycine receptor alpha subunit activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the obervation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a brain, heart, colon, uterus, testis, or spinal cord-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of HGRA4 transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal HGRA4 deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-D417, T2-D417, T3-D417, L4-D417, V5-D417, P6-D417, A7-D417, T8-D417, L9-D417, S10-D417, F11-D417, L12-D417, L13-D417, L14-D417, W15-D417, T16-D417, L17-D417, P18-D417, G19-D417, Q20-D417, V21-D417, L22-D417, L23-D417, R24-D417, V25-D417, A26-D417, L27-D417, A28-D417, K29-D417, E30-D417, E31-D417, V32-D417, K33-D417, S34-D417, G35-D417, T36-D417, K37-D417, G38-D417, S39-D417, Q40-D417, P41-D417, M42-D417, S43-D417, P44-D417, S45-D417, D46-D417, F47-D417, L48-D417, D49-D417, K50-D417, L51-D417, M52-D417, G53-D417, R54-D417, T55-D417, S56-D417, G57-D417, Y58-D417, D59-D417, A60-D417, R61-D417, I62-D417, R63-D417, P64-D417, N65-D417, F66-D417, K67-D417, G68-D417, P69-D417, P70-D417, V71-D417, N72-D417, V73-D417, T74-D417, C75-D417, N76-D417, I77-D417, F78-D417, I79-D417, N80-D417, S81-D417, F82-D417, S83-D417, S84-D417, V85-D417, T86-D417, K87-D417, T88-D417, T89-D417, M90-D417, D91-D417, Y92-D417, R93-D417, V94-D417, N95-D417, V96-D417, F97-D417, L98-D417, R99-D417, Q100-D417, Q101-D417, W102-D417, N103-D417, D104-D417, P105-D417, R106-D417, L107-D417, S108-D417, Y109-D417, R110-D417, E111-D417, Y112-D417, P113-D417, D114-D417, D115-D417, S116-D417, L117-D417, D118-D417, L119-D417, D120-D417, P121-D417, S122-D417, M123-D417, L124-D417, D125-D417, S126-D417, I127-D417, W128-D417, K129-D417, P130-D417, D131-D417, L132-D417, F133-D417, F134-D417, A135-D417, N136-D417, E137-D417, K138-D417, G139-D417, A140-D417, N141-D417, F142-D417, H143-D417, E144-D417, V145-D417, T146-D417, T147-D417, D148-D417, N149-D417, K150-D417, L151-D417, L152-D417, R153-D417, I154-D417, F155-D417, K156-D417, N157-D417, G158-D417, N159-D417, V160-D417, L161-D417, Y162-D417, S163-D417, I164-D417, R165-D417, L166-D417, T167-D417, L168-D417, I169-D417, L170-D417, S171-D417, C172-D417, L173-D417, M174-D417, D175-D417, L176-D417, K177-D417, N178-D417, F179-D417, P180-D417, M181-D417, D182-D417, I183-D417, Q184-D417, T185-D417, C186-D417, T187-D417, M188-D417, Q189-D417, L190-D417, E191-D417, S192-D417, F193-D417, G194-D417, Y195-D417, T196-D417, M197-D417, K198-D417, D199-D417, L200-D417, V201-D417, F202-D417, E203-D417, W204-D417, L205-D417, E206-D417, D207-D417, A208-D417, P209-D417, A210-D417, V211-D417, Q212-D417, V213-D417, A214-D417, E215-D417, G216-D417, L217-D417, T218-D417, L219-D417, P220-D417, Q221-D417, F222-D417, I223-D417, L224-D417, R225-D417, D226-D417, E227-D417, K228-D417, D229-D417, L230-D417, G231-D417, C232-D417, C233-D417, T234-D417, K235-D417, H236-D417, Y237-D417, N238-D417, T239-D417, G240-D417, K241-D417, F242-D417, T243-D417, C244-D417, I245-D417, E246-D417, V247-D417, K248-D417, F249-D417, H250-D417, L251-D417, E252-D417, R253-D417, Q254-D417, M255-D417, G256-D417, Y257-D417, Y258-D417, L259-D417, I260-D417, Q261-D417, M262-D417, Y263-D417, I264-D417, P265-D417, S266-D417, L267-D417, L268-D417, I269-D417, V270-D417, I271-D417, L272-D417, S273-D417, W274-D417, V275-D417, S276-D417, F277-D417, W278-D417, I279-D417, N280-D417, M281-D417, D282-D417, A283-D417, A284-D417, P285-D417, A286-D417, R287-D417, V288-D417, G289-D417, L290-D417, G291-D417, I292-D417, T293-D417, T294-D417, V295-D417, L296-D417, T297-D417, M298-D417, T299-D417, T300-D417, Q301-D417, S302-D417, S303-D417, G304-D417, S305-D417, R306-D417, A307-D417, S308-D417, L309-D417, P310-D417, K311-D417, V312-D417, S313-D417, Y314-D417, V315-D417, K316-D417, A317-D417, I318-D417, D319-D417, I320-D417, W321-D417, M322-D417, A323-D417, V324-D417, C325-D417, L326-D417, L327-D417, F328-D417, V329-D417, F330-D417, A331-D417, A332-D417, L333-D417, L334-D417, E335-D417, Y336-D417, A337-D417, A338-D417, I339-D417, N340-D417, F341-D417, V342-D417, S343-D417, R344-D417, Q345-D417, H346-D417, K347-D417, E348-D417, F349-D417, I350-D417, R351-D417, L352-D417, R353-D417, R354-D417, R355-D417, Q356-D417, R357-D417, R358-D417, Q359-D417, R360-D417, L361-D417, E362-D417, E363-D417, D364-D417, I365-D417, I366-D417, Q367-D417, E368-D417, S369-D417, R370-D417, F371-D417, Y372-D417, F373-D417, R374-D417, G375-D417, Y376-D417, G377-D417, L378-D417, G379-D417, H380-D417, C381-D417, L382-D417, Q383-D417, A384-D417, R385-D417, D386-D417, G387-D417, G388-D417, P389-D417, M390-D417, E391-D417, G392-D417, S393-D417, G394-D417, I395-D417, Y396-D417, S397-D417, P398-D417, Q399-D417, P400-D417, P401-D417, A402-D417, P403-D417, L404-D417, L405-D417, R406-D417, E407-D417, G408-D417, E409-D417, T410-D417, and\/or T411-D417 of SEQ ID NO:2.

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also provided. The present invention also encompasses the use of these polypeptides as an immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitope as described elsewhere herein.","The HGRA4 polypeptide of the present invention was determined to comprise a neurotransmitter gated ion channel domain from about amino acid 44 to about amino acid 341 of SEQ ID NO:2 () according to the Pfam domain analysis algorithm (Bateman, A., Birney, E. R., Durbin, S. R., Eddy, S. R., Howe, K. L., and Sonnhammer, E. L. L., Nucleic Acids Research 28, 263\u2013266 (2000)).

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also provided.","Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are transmembrane receptor-ion channel complexes that open transiently upon binding of specific ligands, allowing rapid transmission of signals at chemical synapses.","Of the five families known, four have been shown to form a sequence-related super-family. These are the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A(GABA-A), nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine and the serotonin 5HT3 receptors. The ionotropic glutamate receptors have a distinct primary structure.","However, all these receptors possess a pentameric structure (made up of varying subunits), surrounding a central pore. Each of these subunits contains a large extracellular N-terminal ligand-binding region; 3 hydrophobic transmembrane domains; a large intracellular region; and a fourth hydrophobic domain. Such a domain may also be required for the HGRA4 alpha subunits ability to modulate neurotransmitter transmission.","Preferred polypeptides of the invention comprise the following amino acid sequence:\n\n","The HGRA4 polypeptides of the present invention were determined to comprise several phosphorylation sites based upon the Motif algorithm (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). The phosphorylation of such sites may regulate some biological activity of the HGRA4 polypeptide. For example, phosphorylation at specific sites may be involved in regulating the proteins ability to associate or bind to other molecules (e.g., proteins, ligands, substrates, DNA, etc.). In the present case, phosphorylation may modulate the ability of the HGRA4 polypeptide to associate with other potassium channel alpha subunits, beta subunits, or its ability to modulate potassium channel function.","The HGRA4 polypeptide was predicted to comprise six PKC phosphorylation sites using the Motif algorithm (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). In vivo, protein kinase C exhibits a preference for the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues. The PKC phosphorylation sites have the following consensus pattern: [ST]-x-[RK], where S or T represents the site of phosphorylation and \u2018x\u2019 an intervening amino acid residue. Additional information regarding PKC phosphorylation sites can be found in Woodget J. R., Gould K. L., Hunter T., Eur. J.

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also provided.","The present invention also encompasses immunogenic and\/or antigenic epitopes of the HGRA4 polypeptide.","The HGRA4 polypeptide has been shown to comprise one glycosylation site according to the Motif algorithm (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). As discussed more specifically herein, protein glycosylation is thought to serve a variety of functions including: augmentation of protein folding, inhibition of protein aggregation, regulation of intracellular trafficking to organelles, increasing resistance to proteolysis, modulation of protein antigenicity, and mediation of intercellular adhesion.","Asparagine phosphorylation sites have the following consensus pattern, N-{P}-[ST]-{P}, wherein N represents the glycosylation site. However, it is well known that that potential N-glycosylation sites are specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser\/Thr. However, the presence of the consensus tripeptide is not sufficient to conclude that an asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to the fact that the folding of the protein plays an important role in the regulation of N-glycosylation. It has been shown that the presence of proline between Asn and Ser\/Thr will inhibit N-glycosylation; this has been confirmed by a recent statistical analysis of glycosylation sites, which also shows that about 50% of the sites that have a proline C-terminal to Ser\/Thr are not glycosylated.

Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:1 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence would be cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides consisting of a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 2551 of SEQ ID NO:1, b is an integer between 15 to 2565, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:1, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of the Polypeptide Encoded by Gene No:2","The polypeptide of this gene provided as SEQ ID NO:4 (), encoded by the polynucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO:3 (), and\/or encoded by the polynucleotide contained within the deposited clone, HGPR4, has significant homology at the nucleotide and amino acid level to the human glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit protein, also known as, strychnine binding subunit (GRA1; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504019; SEQ ID NO:30); the human glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit protein (GRA3; Genbank Accession No. gi|5729844; SEQ ID NO:31); the mouse glycine receptor subunit alpha 4 protein (GRA4; Genbank Accession No. gi|817957; SEQ ID NO:32); and the human glycine receptor alpha-2 subunit protein (GRA2; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504021; SEQ ID NO:33). An alignment of the HGRA4sv polypeptide with these proteins is provided in .","The HGRA4sv polypeptide was determined to share 76.8% identity and 82.2% similarity with the human glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit protein, also known as, strychnine binding subunit (GRA1; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504019; SEQ ID NO:30); to share 84.4% identity and 78.7% similarity with the human glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit protein (GRA3; Genbank Accession No. gi|5729844; SEQ ID NO:31); to share 97% identity and 96% similarity with the mouse glycine receptor subunit alpha 4 protein (GRA4; Genbank Accession No. gi|817957; SEQ ID NO:32); and to share 80.6% identity and 86.5% similarity with the human glycine receptor alpha-2 subunit protein (GRA2; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504021; SEQ ID NO:33) as shown in .","The human glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit protein, also known as, strychnine binding subunit (GRA1; Genbank Accession No. gi|4504019; SEQ ID NO:10) is a human glycine receptor that has been mapped to chromosome 5q32 and found to be linked to the incidence of the autosomal dominant neurologic disorder hereditary hyperekplexia (also known as familial startle disease (STHE)), which is characterized by marked muscle rigidity of central nervous system origin and an exaggerated startle response to unexpected acoustic or tactile stimuli. The incidence of hereditary hyperekplexia was only associated with mutations in exon 6 which resulted in the presence of Arg271 in the mature protein.","The human glycine receptor alpha 3 subunit protein (GRA3; Genbank Accession No. gi|5729844; SEQ ID NO:11) is also a human glycine receptor that has been mapped to chromosome 4q33. Two primary splice forms of this protein alpha3L, and alpha3K were identified, in particular, one of the variants (alpha3K) coding. One of the variants lacked the coding sequence for 15 amino acids located within the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane spanning region 3 (TM3) and TM4. Functional expression in HEK 293 cells of alpha3L and alpha3K subunits resulted in the formation of glycine-gated chloride channels that differed significantly in desensitization behavior, thus defining the cytoplasmic loop as an important determinant of channel inactivation kinetics.","The HGRA4sv polypeptide is believed to represent the a novel splice variant of the human ortholog of the mouse glycine receptor subunit alpha 4 protein based upon its significantly shared percent identity and percent similarity. Based upon the observed homology, the polypeptide of the present invention may share at least some biological activity with glycine receptors, specifically with glycine receptor alpha subunits, more specifically with the mouse glycine receptor subunit alpha 4 protein, in addition to, other glycine receptor alpha subunits referenced elsewhere herein.","The HGRA4sv polypeptide described herein possesses critical residues that participate in ligand binding, as well as, cysteines that are required for the formation of important disulfide bonds in the extracellular portion of the protein (see ).

However, analysis of the sequences from multiple clones corresponding to HGRA4sv polynucleotides has revealed the presence of a stop codon that truncates the protein by 36 residues, whereby eliminating the last conserved transmembrane domain (TM4) present within other members of the glycine receptor family (see ). The effect of eliminating this part of the protein is unknown. However, the majority of the sequence that makes up the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domain TM3 and TM4 has been retained. The truncation of the protein in this region should have no effect on the Cl\u2212 pore (which is comprised of the TM2 domain).","The HGRA4sv polypeptide has been determined to comprise 3 transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2, and TM3) as shown in FIGS. A\u2013B and A\u2013B. The transmembrane domains are located from about amino acid 269 to about amino acid 295 (TM1), from about amino acid 302 to about amino acid 319 (TM2), and\/or from about 334 to about amino acid 357 (TM3) of SEQ ID NO:4.

Additional, the HGPR4 was also expressed significantly in the brain, dorsal root ganglia, pituitary, ovary and the uterus. These data suggest that HGPR4 would be useful for treating, detecting, and\/or ameliorating disorders or diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system, including various types of syndromes that involve excitotoxic cell death and chronic peripheral neuropathies (neuropathic pain). HGRA4 may also play a role in modulating longitudinal muscle\/myenteric plexus contractions, and hence agonists or antagonists of HGRA4 could be used to treat various types of gastrointestinal disorders.","As described elsewhere herein, glycine receptor alpha subunits have been implicated in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission which is essential for voluntary motor control, flex responses and sensory signal processing. Therefore, HGRA4sv polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including agonists and\/or fragments thereof, have uses that include, modulating inhibitory neurotransmission which is essential for voluntary motor control, flex responses and sensory signal processing.

Current treatments of depression include blockers of neurotransmitter uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter degradation which act to prolong the lifetime of neurotransmitters.","It is believed that certain diseases such as depression, memory disorders and Alzheimer's disease are the result of an impairment in neurotransmitter release.","Glycine receptor antagonists may therefore be utilized as cell excitants which may stimulate release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin and dopamine.

Briefly, the function of this clone may be determined by applying microarray methodology. Nucleic acids corresponding to the HGRA4sv polynucleotides, in addition to, other clones of the present invention, may be arrayed on microchips for expression profiling. Depending on which polynucleotide probe is used to hybridize to the slides, a change in expression of a specific gene may provide additional insight into the function of this gene based upon the conditions being studied. For example, an observed increase or decrease in expression levels when the polynucleotide probe used comes from tissue that has been treated with known glycine receptor inhibitors, which include, but are not limited to the drugs listed above, might indicate a function in modulating glycine receptor function, for example. In the case of HGRA4sv, brain, heart, colon, uterus, testis, and\/or spinal cord tissue should be used to extract RNA to prepare the probe.","In addition, the function of the protein may be assessed by applying quantitative PCR methodology, for example. Real time quantitative PCR would provide the capability of following the expression of the HGRA4sv gene throughout development, for example. Quantitative PCR methodology requires only a nominal amount of tissue from each developmentally important step is needed to perform such experiements. Therefore, the application of quantitative PCR methodology to refining the biological function of this polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are quantitative PCR probes corresponding to the polynucleotide sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:3 ().","The function of the protein may also be assessed through complementation assays in yeast. For example, in the case of the HGRA4sv, transforming yeast deficient in glycine receptor alpha subunit activity and assessing their ability to grow would provide convincing evidence the HGRA4sv polypeptide has glycine receptor alpha subunit activity. Additional assay conditions and methods that may be used in assessing the function of the polynucletides and polypeptides of the present invention are known in the art, some of which are disclosed elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, the biological function of the encoded polypeptide may be determined by disrupting a homologue of this polypeptide in Mice and\/or rats and observing the resulting phenotype.","Moreover, the biological function of this polypeptide may be determined by the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology and the resulting generation of transgenic mice and\/or rats. Expressing a particular gene in either sense or antisense orientation in a transgenic mouse or rat could lead to respectively higher or lower expression levels of that particular gene. Altering the endogenous expression levels of a gene can lead to the obervation of a particular phenotype that can then be used to derive indications on the function of the gene. The gene can be either over-expressed or under expressed in every cell of the organism at all times using a strong ubiquitous promoter, or it could be expressed in one or more discrete parts of the organism using a well characterized tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a brain, heart, colon, uterus, testis, or spinal cord-specific promoter), or it can be expressed at a specified time of development using an inducible and\/or a developmentally regulated promoter.","In the case of HGRA4sv transgenic mice or rats, if no phenotype is apparent in normal growth conditions, observing the organism under diseased conditions (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, reproductive, neural, or proliferative disorders, etc.) may lead to understanding the function of the gene. Therefore, the application of antisense and\/or sense methodology to the creation of transgenic mice or rats to refine the biological function of the polypeptide is encompassed by the present invention.","In preferred embodiments, the following N-terminal HGRA4sv deletion polypeptides are encompassed by the present invention: M1-D431, T2-D431, T3-D431, L4-D431, V5-D431, P6-D431, A7-D431, T8-D431, L9-D431, S10-D431, F11-D431, L12-D431, L13-D431, L14-D431, W15-D431, T16-D431, L17-D431, P18-D431, G19-D431, Q20-D431, V21-D431, L22-D431, L23-D431, R24-D431, V25-D431, A26-D431, L27-D431, A28-D431, K29-D431, E30-D431, E31-D431, V32-D431, K33-D431, S34-D431, G35-D431, T36-D431, K37-D431, G38-D431, S39-D431, Q40-D431, P41-D431, M42-D431, S43-D431, P44-D431, S45-D431, D46-D431, F47-D431, L48-D431, D49-D431, K50-D431, L51-D431, M52-D431, G53-D431, R54-D431, T55-D431, S56-D431, G57-D431, Y58-D431, D59-D431, A60-D431, R61-D431, I62-D431, R63-D431, P64-D431, N65-D431, F66-D431, K67-D431, G68-D431, P69-D431, P70-D431, V71-D431, N72-D431, V73-D431, T74-D431, C75-D431, N76-D431, I77-D431, F78-D431, I79-D431, N80-D431, S81-D431, F82-D431, S83-D431, S84-D431, V85-D431, T86-D431, K87-D431, T88-D431, T89-D431, M90-D431, D91-D431, Y92-D431, R93-D431, V94-D431, N95-D431, V96-D431, F97-D431, L98-D431, R99-D431, Q100-D431, Q10-D431, W102-D431, N103-D431, D104-D431, P105-D431, R106-D431, L107-D431, S108-D431, Y109-D431, R110-D431, E111-D431, Y112-D431, P113-D431, D114-D431, D115-D431, S116-D431, L117-D431, D118-D431, L119-D431, D120-D431, P121-D431, S122-D431, M123-D431, L124-D431, D125-D431, S126-D431, I27-D431, W128-D431, K129-D431, P130-D431, D131-D431, L132-D431, F133-D431, F134-D431, A135-D431, N136-D431, E137-D431, K138-D431, G139-D431, A140-D431, N141-D431, F142-D431, H143-D431, E144-D431, V145-D431, T146-D431, T147-D431, D148-D431, N149-D431, K150-D431, L151-D431, L152-D431, R153-D431, I154-D431, F155-D431, K156-D431, N157-D431, G158-D431, N159-D431, V160-D431, L161-D431, Y162-D431, S163-D431, I164-D431, R165-D431, L166-D431, T167-D431, L168-D431, I169-D431, L170-D431, S171-D431, C172-D431, L173-D431, M174-D431, D175-D431, L176-D431, K177-D431, N178-D431, F179-D431, P180-D431, M181-D431, D182-D431, I183-D431, Q184-D431, T185-D431, C186-D431, T187-D431, M188-D431, Q189-D431, L190-D431, E191-D431, S192-D431, S193-D431, S194-D431, I195-D431, L196-D431, C197-D431, S198-D431, P199-D431, L200-D431, P201-D431, S202-D431, L203-D431, S204-D431, L205-D431, S206-D431, V207-D431, G208-D431, Y209-D431, T210-D431, M211-D431, K212-D431, D213-D431, L214-D431, V215-D431, F216-D431, E217-D431, W218-D431, L219-D431, E220-D431, D221-D431, A222-D431, P223-D431, A224-D431, V225-D431, Q226-D431, V227-D431, A228-D431, E229-D431, G230-D431, L231-D431, T232-D431, L233-D431, P234-D431, Q235-D431, F236-D431, I237-D431, L238-D431, R239-D431, D240-D431, E241-D431, K242-D431, D243-D431, L244-D431, G245-D431, C246-D431, C247-D431, T248-D431, K249-D431, H250-D431, Y251-D431, N252-D431, T253-D431, G254-D431, K255-D431, F256-D431, T257-D431, C258-D431, I259-D431, E260-D431, V261-D431, K262-D431, F263-D431, H264-D431, L265-D431, E266-D431, R267-D431, Q268-D431, M269-D431, G270-D431, Y271-D431, Y272-D431, L273-D431, I274-D431, Q275-D431, M276-D431, Y277-D431, I278-D431, P279-D431, S280-D431, L281-D431, L282-D431, I283-D431, V284-D431, I285-D431, L286-D431, S287-D431, W288-D431, V289-D431, S290-D431, F291-D431, W292-D431, I293-D431, N294-D431, M295-D431, D296-D431, A297-D431, A298-D431, P299-D431, A300-D431, R301-D431, V302-D431, G303-D431, L304-D431, G305-D431, I306-D431, T307-D431, T308-D431, V309-D431, L310-D431, T311-D431, M312-D431, T313-D431, T314-D431, Q315-D431, S316-D431, S317-D431, G318-D431, S319-D431, R320-D431, A321-D431, S322-D431, L323-D431, P324-D431, K325-D431, V326-D431, S327-D431, Y328-D431, V329-D431, K330-D431, A331-D431, I332-D431, D333-D431, I334-D431, W335-D431, M336-D431, A337-D431, V338-D431, C339-D431, L340-D431, L341-D431, F342-D431, V343-D431, F344-D431, A345-D431, A346-D431, L347-D431, L348-D431, E349-D431, Y350-D431, A351-D431, A352-D431, I353-D431, N354-D431, F355-D431, V356-D431, S357-D431, R358-D431, Q359-D431, H360-D431, K361-D431, E362-D431, F363-D431, I364-D431, R365-D431, L366-D431, R367-D431, R368-D431, R369-D431, Q370-D431, R371-D431, R372-D431, Q373-D431, R374-D431, L375-D431, E376-D431, E377-D431, D378-D431, I379-D431, I380-D431, Q381-D431, E382-D431, S383-D431, R384-D431, F385-D431, Y386-D431, F387-D431, R388-D431, G389-D431, Y390-D431, G391-D431, L392-D431, G393-D431, H394-D431, C395-D431, L396-D431, Q397-D431, A398-D431, R399-D431, D400-D431, G401-D431, G402-D431, P403-D431, M404-D431, E405-D431, G406-D431, S407-D431, G408-D431, I409-D431, Y410-D431, S411-D431, P412-D431, Q413-D431, P414-D431, P415-D431, A416-D431, P417-D431, L418-D431, L419-D431, R420-D431, E421-D431, G422-D431, E423-D431, T424-D431, and\/or T425-D431 of SEQ ID NO:4.

However, it is well known that that potential N-glycosylation sites are specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser\/Thr. However, the presence of the consensus tripeptide is not sufficient to conclude that an asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to the fact that the folding of the protein plays an important role in the regulation of N-glycosylation. It has been shown that the presence of proline between Asn and Ser\/Thr will inhibit N-glycosylation; this has been confirmed by a recent statistical analysis of glycosylation sites, which also shows that about 50% of the sites that have a proline C-terminal to Ser\/Thr are not glycosylated.

In other words, to obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be an entire sequence referenced in Table 1, the ORF (open reading frame), or any fragment specified as described herein.","As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence of the present invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the CLUSTALW computer program (Thompson, J. D., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2(22):4673\u20134680, (1994)), which is based on the algorithm of Higgins, D. G., et al., Computer Applications in the Biosciences (CABIOS), 8(2):189\u2013191, (1992). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U's to T's. However, the CLUSTALW algorithm automatically converts U's to T's when comparing RNA sequences to DNA sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a CLUSTALW alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity via pairwise alignments are: Matrix=IUB, k-tuple=1, Number of Top Diagonals=5, Gap Penalty=3, Gap Open Penalty 10, Gap Extension Penalty=0.1, Scoring Method=Percent, Window Size=5 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. For multiple alignments, the following CLUSTALW parameters are preferred: Gap Opening Penalty=10; Gap Extension Parameter=0.05; Gap Separation Penalty Range=8; End Gap Separation Penalty=Off; % Identity for Alignment Delay=40%; Residue Specific Gaps:Off; Hydrophilic Residue Gap=Off; and Transition Weighting=0. The pairwise and multple alignment parameters provided for CLUSTALW above represent the default parameters as provided with the AlignX software program (Vector NTI suite of programs, version 6.0).","The present invention encompasses the application of a manual correction to the percent identity results, in the instance where the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 deletions, not because of internal deletions. If only the local pairwise percent identity is required, no manual correction is needed. However, a manual correction may be applied to determine the global percent identity from a global polynucleotide alignment. Percent identity calculations based upon global polynucleotide alignments are often preferred since they reflect the percent identity between the polynucleotide molecules as a whole (i.e., including any polynucleotide overhangs, not just overlapping regions), as opposed to, only local matching polynucleotides. Manual corrections for global percent identity determinations are required since the CLUSTALW program does not account for 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the CLUSTALW sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above CLUSTALW program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score may be used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the CLUSTALW alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.","For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5\u2032 end of the subject sequence and therefore, the CLUSTALW alignment does not show a matched\/alignment of the first 10 bases at 5\u2032 end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends not matched\/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the CLUSTALW program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by CLUSTALW is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are required for the purposes of the present invention.","By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 80%, 85%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to, for instance, an amino acid sequence referenced in Table 1 (SEQ ID NO:2) or to the amino acid sequence encoded by cDNA contained in a deposited clone, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the CLUSTALW computer program (Thompson, J.

The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a CLUSTALW alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity via pairwise alignments are: Matrix=BLOSUM, k-tuple=1, Number of Top Diagonals=5, Gap Penalty=3, Gap Open Penalty 10, Gap Extension Penalty=0.1, Scoring Method=Percent, Window Size=5 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. For multiple alignments, the following CLUSTALW parameters are preferred: Gap Opening Penalty=10; Gap Extension Parameter=0.05; Gap Separation Penalty Range=8; End Gap Separation Penalty=Off; % Identity for Alignment Delay=40%; Residue Specific Gaps:Off; Hydrophilic Residue Gap=Off; and Transition Weighting=0. The pairwise and multple alignment parameters provided for CLUSTALW above represent the default parameters as provided with the AlignX software program (Vector NTI suite of programs, version 6.0).","The present invention encompasses the application of a manual correction to the percent identity results, in the instance where the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions. If only the local pairwise percent identity is required, no manual correction is needed. However, a manual correction may be applied to determine the global percent identity from a global polypeptide alignment. Percent identity calculations based upon global polypeptide alignments are often preferred since they reflect the percent identity between the polypeptide molecules as a whole (i.e., including any polypeptide overhangs, not just overlapping regions), as opposed to, only local matching polypeptides. Manual corrections for global percent identity determinations are required since the CLUSTALW program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the CLUSTALW sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above CLUSTALW program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what may be used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence.","For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the CLUSTALW alignment does not show a matching\/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched\/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the CLUSTALW program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence.

Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the CLUSTALW alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequnce are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are required for the purposes of the present invention.","In addition to the above method of aligning two or more polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences to arrive at a percent identity value for the aligned sequences, it may be desirable in some circumstances to use a modified version of the CLUSTALW algorithm which takes into account known structural features of the sequences to be aligned, such as for example, the SWISS-PROT designations for each sequence. The result of such a modifed CLUSTALW algorithm may provide a more accurate value of the percent identity for two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences. Support for such a modified version of CLUSTALW is provided within the CLUSTALW algorithm and would be readily appreciated to one of skill in the art of bioinformatics.","The variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both. Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide variants produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover, variants in which 5\u201310, 1\u20135, or 1\u20132 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as ).","Naturally occurring variants are called \u201callelic variants,\u201d and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985).) These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and\/or polypeptide level and are included in the present invention. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.","Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides of the present invention. For instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the protein without substantial loss of biological function. The authors of Ron et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 2984\u20132988 (1993), reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8\u201310 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199\u2013216 (1988)).","Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (J. Biol. Chem. 268:22105\u201322111 (1993)) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-1a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-1a mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that \u201c[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either [binding or biological activity].\u201d In fact, only 23 unique amino acid sequences, out of more than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein that significantly differed in activity from wild-type.","Furthermore, even if deleting one or more amino acids from the N-terminus or C-terminus of a polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions, other biological activities may still be retained. For example, the ability of a deletion variant to induce and\/or to bind antibodies which recognize the protein will likely be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the protein are removed from the N-terminus or C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N- or C-terminal residues of a protein retains such immunogenic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","Alternatively, such N-terminus or C-terminus deletions of a polypeptide of the present invention may, in fact, result in a significant increase in one or more of the biological activities of the polypeptide(s). For example, biological activity of many polypeptides are governed by the presence of regulatory domains at either one or both termini. Such regulatory domains effectively inhibit the biological activity of such polypeptides in lieu of an activation event (e.g., binding to a cognate ligand or receptor, phosphorylation, proteolytic processing, etc.). Thus, by eliminating the regulatory domain of a polypeptide, the polypeptide may effectively be rendered biologically active in the absence of an activation event.","The invention further includes polypeptide variants that show substantial biological activity. Such variants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. For example, guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie et al., Science 247:1306\u20131310 (1990), wherein the authors indicate that there are two main strategies for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change.","The first strategy exploits the tolerance of amino acid substitutions by natural selection during the process of evolution. By comparing amino acid sequences in different species, conserved amino acids can be identified. These conserved amino acids are likely important for protein function. In contrast, the amino acid positions where substitutions have been tolerated by natural selection indicates that these positions are not critical for protein function. Thus, positions tolerating amino acid substitution could be modified while still maintaining biological activity of the protein.","The second strategy uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene to identify regions critical for protein function. For example, site directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (introduction of single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule) can be used. (Cunningham and Wells, Science 244:1081\u20131085 (1989).) The resulting mutant molecules can then be tested for biological activity.","As the authors state, these two strategies have revealed that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. The authors further indicate which amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at certain amino acid positions in the protein. For example, most buried (within the tertiary structure of the protein) amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains, whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved.","The invention encompasses polypeptides having a lower degree of identity but having sufficient similarity so as to perform one or more of the same functions performed by the polypeptide of the present invention. Similarity is determined by conserved amino acid substitution. Such substitutions are those that substitute a given amino acid in a polypeptide by another amino acid of like characteristics (e.g., chemical properties). According to Cunningham et al above, such conservative substitutions are likely to be phenotypically silent. Additional guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent are found in Bowie et al., Science 247:1306\u20131310 (1990).","Tolerated conservative amino acid substitutions of the present invention involve replacement of the aliphatic or hydrophobic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; replacement of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr; replacement of the acidic residues Asp and Glu; replacement of the amide residues Asn and Gln, replacement of the basic residues Lys, Arg, and His; replacement of the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp, and replacement of the small-sized amino acids Ala, Ser, Thr, Met, and Gly.","In addition, the present invention also encompasses the conservative substitutions provided in Table III below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0257","num":"0257"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE III"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["For Amino",{},{}]},{"entry":["Acid","Code","Replace with any of:"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Alanine","A","D-Ala, Gly, beta-Ala, L-Cys, D-Cys"]},{"entry":["Arginine","R","D-Arg, Lys, D-Lys, homo-Arg, D-homo-Arg,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Met, Ile, D-Met, D-Ile, Orn, D-Orn"]},{"entry":["Asparagine","N","D-Asn, Asp, D-Asp, Glu, D-Glu, Gln, D-Gln"]},{"entry":["Aspartic Acid","D","D-Asp, D-Asn, Asn, Glu, D-Glu, Gln, D-Gln"]},{"entry":["Cysteine","C","D-Cys, S-Me-Cys, Met, D-Met, Thr, D-Thr"]},{"entry":["Glutamine","Q","D-Gln, Asn, D-Asn, Glu, D-Glu, Asp, D-Asp"]},{"entry":["Glutamic","E","D-Glu, D-Asp, Asp, Asn, D-Asn, Gln, D-Gln"]},{"entry":"Acid"},{"entry":["Glycine","G","Ala, D-Ala, Pro, D-Pro, \u03b2-Ala, Acp"]},{"entry":["Isoleucine","I","D-Ile, Val, D-Val, Leu, D-Leu, Met, D-Met"]},{"entry":["Leucine","L","D-Leu, Val, D-Val, Met, D-Met"]},{"entry":["Lysine","K","D-Lys, Arg, D-Arg, homo-Arg, D-homo-Arg,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Met, D-Met, Ile, D-Ile, Orn, D-Orn"]},{"entry":["Methionine","M","D-Met, S-Me-Cys, Ile, D-Ile, Leu, D-Leu, Val,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"D-Val"]},{"entry":["Phenylalanine","F","D-Phe, Tyr, D-Thr, L-Dopa, His, D-His, Trp,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"D-Trp, Trans-3,4, or 5-phenylproline, cis-3,4, or"]},{"entry":[{},{},"5-phenylproline"]},{"entry":["Proline","P","D-Pro, L-1-thioazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, D- or"]},{"entry":[{},{},"L-1-oxazolidine-4-carboxylic acid"]},{"entry":["Serine","S","D-Ser, Thr, D-Thr, allo-Thr, Met, D-Met,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Met(O), D-Met(O), L-Cys, D-Cys"]},{"entry":["Threonine","T","D-Thr, Ser, D-Ser, allo-Thr, Met, D-Met, Met(O),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"D-Met(O), Val, D-Val"]},{"entry":["Tyrosine","Y","D-Tyr, Phe, D-Phe, L-Dopa, His, D-His"]},{"entry":["Valine","V","D-Val, Leu, D-Leu, Ile, D-Ile, Met, D-Met"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Aside from the uses described above, such amino acid substitutions may also increase protein or peptide stability.

Such probabilities are often described in a matrix and are used by some algorithms (e.g., BLAST, CLUSTALW, GAP, etc.) in calculating percent similarity wherein similarity refers to the degree by which one amino acid may substitute for another amino acid without lose of function. An example of such a matrix is the PAM250 or BLOSUM62 matrix.","Aside from the canonical chemically conservative substitutions referenced above, the invention also encompasses substitutions which are typically not classified as conservative, but that may be chemically conservative under certain circumstances. Analysis of enzymatic catalysis for proteases, for example, has shown that certain amino acids within the active site of some enzymes may have highly perturbed pKa's due to the unique microenvironment of the active site. Such perturbed pKa's could enable some amino acids to substitute for other amino acids while conserving enzymatic structure and function. Examples of amino acids that are known to have amino acids with perturbed pKa's are the Glu-35 residue of Lysozyme, the Ile-16 residue of Chymotrypsin, the His-159 residue of Papain, etc. The conservation of function relates to either anomalous protonation or anomalous deprotonation of such amino acids, relative to their canonical, non-perturbed pKa. The pKa perturbation may enable these amino acids to actively participate in general acid-base catalysis due to the unique ionization environment within the enzyme active site. Thus, substituting an amino acid capable of serving as either a general acid or general base within the microenvironment of an enzyme active site or cavity, as may be the case, in the same or similar capacity as the wild-type amino acid, would effectively serve as a conservative amino substitution.","Besides conservative amino acid substitution, variants of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) substitutions with one or more of the non-conserved amino acid residues, where the substituted amino acid residues may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) substitution with one or more of amino acid residues having a substituent group, or (iii) fusion of the mature polypeptide with another compound, such as a compound to increase the stability and\/or solubility of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) fusion of the polypeptide with additional amino acids, such as, for example, an IgG Fc fusion region peptide, or leader or secretory sequence, or a sequence facilitating purification. Such variant polypeptides are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.","For example, polypeptide variants containing amino acid substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids may produce proteins with improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation of pharmaceutical formulations both reduces activity and increases clearance due to the aggregate's immunogenic activity. (Pinckard et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2:331\u2013340 (1967); Robbins et al., Diabetes 36: 838\u2013845 (1987); Cleland et al., Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 10:307\u2013377 (1993).)","Moreover, the invention further includes polypeptide variants created through the application of molecular evolution (\u201cDNA Shuffling\u201d) methodology to the polynucleotide disclosed as SEQ ID NO:X, the sequence of the clone submitted in a deposit, and\/or the cDNA encoding the polypeptide disclosed as SEQ ID NO:Y. Such DNA Shuffling technology is known in the art and more particularly described elsewhere herein (e.g., WPC, Stemmer, PNAS, 91:10747, (1994)), and in the Examples provided herein).","A further embodiment of the invention relates to a polypeptide which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention having an amino acid sequence which contains at least one amino acid substitution, but not more than 50 amino acid substitutions, even more preferably, not more than 40 amino acid substitutions, still more preferably, not more than 30 amino acid substitutions, and still even more preferably, not more than 20 amino acid substitutions. Of course, in order of ever-increasing preference, it is highly preferable for a peptide or polypeptide to have an amino acid sequence which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention, which contains at least one, but not more than 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acid substitutions. In specific embodiments, the number of additions, substitutions, and\/or deletions in the amino acid sequence of the present invention or fragments thereof (e.g., the mature form and\/or other fragments described herein), is 1\u20135, 5\u201310, 5\u201325, 5\u201350, 10\u201350 or 50\u2013150, conservative amino acid substitutions are preferable.","Polynucleotide and Polypeptide Fragments","The present invention is directed to polynucleotide fragments of the polynucleotides of the invention, in addition to polypeptides encoded therein by said polynucleotides and\/or fragments.","In the present invention, a \u201cpolynucleotide fragment\u201d refers to a short polynucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence which: is a portion of that contained in a deposited clone, or encoding the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA in a deposited clone; is a portion of that shown in SEQ ID NO:X or the complementary strand thereto, or is a portion of a polynucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:Y. The nucleotide fragments of the invention are preferably at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt, at least about 50 nt, at least about 75 nt, or at least about 150 nt in length. A fragment \u201cat least 20 nt in length,\u201d for example, is intended to include 20 or more contiguous bases from the cDNA sequence contained in a deposited clone or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:X. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited value, a value larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus, or at both termini. These nucleotide fragments have uses that include, but are not limited to, as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments (e.g., 50, 150, 500, 600, 2000 nucleotides) are preferred.","Moreover, representative examples of polynucleotide fragments of the invention, include, for example, fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a sequence from about nucleotide number 1\u201350, 51\u2013100, 101\u2013150, 151\u2013200, 201\u2013250, 251\u2013300, 301\u2013350, 351\u2013400, 401\u2013450, 451\u2013500, 501\u2013550, 551\u2013600, 651\u2013700, 701\u2013750, 751\u2013800, 800\u2013850, 851\u2013900, 901\u2013950, 951\u20131000, 1001\u20131050, 1051\u20131100, 1101\u20131150, 1151\u20131200, 1201\u20131250, 1251\u20131300, 1301\u20131350, 1351\u20131400, 1401\u20131450, 1451\u20131500, 1501\u20131550, 1551\u20131600, 1601\u20131650, 1651\u20131700, 1701\u20131750, 1751\u20131800, 1801\u20131850, 1851\u20131900, 1901\u20131950, 1951\u20132000, or 2001 to the end of SEQ ID NO:X, or the complementary strand thereto, or the cDNA contained in a deposited clone. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, and ranges larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. Preferably, these fragments encode a polypeptide which has biological activity. More preferably, these polynucleotides can be used as probes or primers as discussed herein. Also encompassed by the present invention are polynucleotides which hybridize to these nucleic acid molecules under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency conditions, as are the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides.","In the present invention, a \u201cpolypeptide fragment\u201d refers to an amino acid sequence which is a portion of that contained in SEQ ID NO:Y or encoded by the cDNA contained in a deposited clone. Protein (polypeptide) fragments may be \u201cfree-standing,\u201d or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region, most preferably as a single continuous region. Representative examples of polypeptide fragments of the invention, include, for example, fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, from about amino acid number 1\u201320, 21\u201340, 41\u201360, 61\u201380, 81\u2013100, 102\u2013120, 121\u2013140, 141\u2013160, or 161 to the end of the coding region. Moreover, polypeptide fragments can be about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, or 150 amino acids in length. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges or values, and ranges or values larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Preferred polypeptide fragments include the full-length protein. Further preferred polypeptide fragments include the full-length protein having a continuous series of deleted residues from the amino or the carboxy terminus, or both. For example, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1\u201360, can be deleted from the amino terminus of the full-length polypeptide. Similarly, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1\u201330, can be deleted from the carboxy terminus of the full-length protein. Furthermore, any combination of the above amino and carboxy terminus deletions are preferred. Similarly, polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also preferred.","Also preferred are polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments characterized by structural or functional domains, such as fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions, beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions, turn and turn-forming regions, coil and coil-forming regions, hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions, substrate binding region, and high antigenic index regions. Polypeptide fragments of SEQ ID NO:Y falling within conserved domains are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Moreover, polynucleotides encoding these domains are also contemplated.","Other preferred polypeptide fragments are biologically active fragments. Biologically active fragments are those exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical, to an activity of the polypeptide of the present invention. The biological activity of the fragments may include an improved desired activity, or a decreased undesirable activity. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also encompassed by the invention.","In a preferred embodiment, the functional activity displayed by a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide fragment of the invention may be one or more biological activities typically associated with the full-length polypeptide of the invention. Illustrative of these biological activities includes the fragments ability to bind to at least one of the same antibodies which bind to the full-length protein, the fragments ability to interact with at lease one of the same proteins which bind to the full-length, the fragments ability to elicit at least one of the same immune responses as the full-length protein (i.e., to cause the immune system to create antibodies specific to the same epitope, etc.), the fragments ability to bind to at least one of the same polynucleotides as the full-length protein, the fragments ability to bind to a receptor of the full-length protein, the fragments ability to bind to a ligand of the full-length protein, and the fragments ability to multimerize with the full-length protein. However, the skilled artisan would appreciate that some fragments may have biological activities which are desirable and directly inapposite to the biological activity of the full-length protein. The functional activity of polypeptides of the invention, including fragments, variants, derivatives, and analogs thereof can be determined by numerous methods available to the skilled artisan, some of which are described elsewhere herein.","The present invention encompasses polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an epitope of the polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:Y, or an epitope of the polypeptide sequence encoded by a polynucleotide sequence contained in ATCC deposit No. Z or encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the complement of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:X or contained in ATCC deposit No. Z under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions as defined supra. The present invention further encompasses polynucleotide sequences encoding an epitope of a polypeptide sequence of the invention (such as, for example, the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO:1), polynucleotide sequences of the complementary strand of a polynucleotide sequence encoding an epitope of the invention, and polynucleotide sequences which hybridize to the complementary strand under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions defined supra.","The term \u201cepitopes,\u201d as used herein, refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably in a human. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising an epitope, as well as the polynucleotide encoding this polypeptide. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art, for example, by the methods for generating antibodies described infra. (See, for example, Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998\u20134002 (1983)). The term \u201cantigenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by the immunoassays described herein. Immunospecific binding excludes non-specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.","Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. (See, e.g., Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5131\u20135135 (1985), further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211).","In the present invention, antigenic epitopes preferably contain a sequence of at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, more preferably at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, and, most preferably, between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 amino acid residues in length, or longer. Additional non-exclusive preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as portions thereof. Antigenic epitopes are useful, for example, to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that specifically bind the epitope. Preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these antigenic epitopes. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. (See, for instance, Wilson et al., Cell 37:767\u2013778 (1984); Sutcliffe et al., Science 219:660\u2013666 (1983)).","Similarly, immunogenic epitopes can be used, for example, to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. (See, for instance, Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra; Chow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:910\u2013914; and Bittle et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66:2347\u20132354 (1985). Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these immunogenic epitopes. The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein, such as an albumin, to an animal system (such as rabbit or mouse), or, if the polypeptide is of sufficient length (at least about 25 amino acids), the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However, immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to, at the very least, linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide (e.g., in Western blotting).","Epitope-bearing polypeptides of the present invention may be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, in vivo immunization, in vitro immunization, and phage display methods. See, e.g., Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra, and Bittle et al., J. Gen. Virol., 66:2347\u20132354 (1985). If in vivo immunization is used, animals may be immunized with free peptide; however, anti-peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier, such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid. For instance, peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits, rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled peptides, for instance, by intraperitoneal and\/or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 \u03bcg of peptide or carrier protein and Freund's adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of anti-peptide antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti-peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti-peptide antibodies, for instance, by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.","As one of skill in the art will appreciate, and as discussed above, the polypeptides of the present invention comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to other polypeptide sequences. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM), or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, or any combination thereof and portions thereof) resulting in chimeric polypeptides. Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half-life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See, e.g., EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature, 331:84\u201386 (1988). Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens (e.g., insulin) conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 96\/22024 and WO 99\/04813). IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion disulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See, e.g., Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem., 270:3958\u20133964 (1995). Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag (e.g., the hemagglutinin (\u201cHA\u201d) tag or flag tag) to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example, a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines (Janknecht et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8972\u2013897). In this system, the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2+ nitriloacetic acid-agarose column and histidine-tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.","Additional fusion proteins of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d). DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention, such methods can be used to generate polypeptides with altered activity, as well as agonists and antagonists of the polypeptides. See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et al., Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8:724\u201333 (1997); Harayama, Trends Biotechnol. 16(2):76\u201382 (1998); Hansson, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 287:265\u201376 (1999); and Lorenzo and Blasco, Biotechniques 24(2):308\u201313 (1998) (each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, alteration of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous or site-specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. In another embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention, or the encoded polypeptides, may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment, one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc., of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","Antibodies","Further polypeptides of the invention relate to antibodies and T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) which immunospecifically bind a polypeptide, polypeptide fragment, or variant of SEQ ID NO:Y, and\/or an epitope, of the present invention (as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antibody-antigen binding). Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, monovalent, bispecific, heteroconjugate, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032) fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. The term \u201cantibody,\u201d as used herein, refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. Moreover, the term \u201cantibody\u201d (Ab) or \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d (Mab) is meant to include intact molecules, as well as, antibody fragments (such as, for example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments) which are capable of specifically binding to protein. Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation of the animal or plant, and may have less non-specific tissue binding than an intact antibody (Wahl et al., J. Nucl. Med. 24:316\u2013325 (1983)). Thus, these fragments are preferred, as well as the products of a FAB or other immunoglobulin expression library. Moreover, antibodies of the present invention include chimeric, single chain, and humanized antibodies.","Most preferably the antibodies are human antigen-binding antibody fragments of the present invention and include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2, Fd, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv) and fragments comprising either a VL or VH domain. Antigen-binding antibody fragments, including single-chain antibodies, may comprise the variable region(s) alone or in combination with the entirety or a portion of the following: hinge region, CH1, CH2, and CH3 domains. Also included in the invention are antigen-binding fragments also comprising any combination of variable region(s) with a hinge region, CH1, CH2, and CH3 domains. The antibodies of the invention may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are human, murine (e.g., mouse and rat), donkey, ship rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken. As used herein, \u201chuman\u201d antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described infra and, for example in, U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598 by Kucherlapati et al.","The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide of the present invention or may be specific for both a polypeptide of the present invention as well as for a heterologous epitope, such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material.

The epitope(s) or polypeptide portion(s) may be specified as described herein, e.g., by N-terminal and C-terminal positions, by size in contiguous amino acid residues, or listed in the Tables and Figures. Antibodies which specifically bind any epitope or polypeptide of the present invention may also be excluded. Therefore, the present invention includes antibodies that specifically bind polypeptides of the present invention, and allows for the exclusion of the same.","Antibodies of the present invention may also be described or specified in terms of their cross-reactivity. Antibodies that do not bind any other analog, ortholog, or homologue of a polypeptide of the present invention are included. Antibodies that bind polypeptides with at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 65%, at least 60%, at least 55%, and at least 50% identity (as calculated using methods known in the art and described herein) to a polypeptide of the present invention are also included in the present invention. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the present invention cross-react with murine, rat and\/or rabbit homologues of human proteins and the corresponding epitopes thereof. Antibodies that do not bind polypeptides with less than 95%, less than 90%, less than 85%, less than 80%, less than 75%, less than 70%, less than 65%, less than 60%, less than 55%, and less than 50% identity (as calculated using methods known in the art and described herein) to a polypeptide of the present invention are also included in the present invention.

Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5\u00d710-2 M, 10-2 M, 5\u00d710-3 M, 10-3 M, 5\u00d710-4 M, 10-4 M, 5\u00d710-5 M, 10-5 M, 5\u00d710-6 M, 10-6M, 5\u00d710-7 M, 107 M, 5\u00d710-8 M, 10-8 M, 5\u00d710-9 M, 10-9 M, 5\u00d710-10 M, 10-10 M, 5\u00d710-11 M, 10-11 M, 5\u00d710-12 M, 10-12 M, 5\u00d710-13 M, 10-13 M, 5\u00d710-14 M, 10-14 M, 5\u00d710-15 M, or 10-15 M.","The invention also provides antibodies that competitively inhibit binding of an antibody to an epitope of the invention as determined by any method known in the art for determining competitive binding, for example, the immunoassays described herein. In preferred embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding to the epitope by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85 %, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50%.","Antibodies of the present invention may act as agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the present invention. For example, the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt the receptor\/ligand interactions with the polypeptides of the invention either partially or fully. Preferably, antibodies of the present invention bind an antigenic epitope disclosed herein, or a portion thereof. The invention features both receptor-specific antibodies and ligand-specific antibodies. The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies which do not prevent ligand binding but prevent receptor activation. Receptor activation (i.e., signaling) may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, receptor activation can be determined by detecting the phosphorylation (e.g., tyrosine or serine\/threonine) of the receptor or its substrate by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis (for example, as described supra). In specific embodiments, antibodies are provided that inhibit ligand activity or receptor activity by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50% of the activity in absence of the antibody.","The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies which both prevent ligand binding and receptor activation as well as antibodies that recognize the receptor-ligand complex, and, preferably, do not specifically recognize the unbound receptor or the unbound ligand. Likewise, included in the invention are neutralizing antibodies which bind the ligand and prevent binding of the ligand to the receptor, as well as antibodies which bind the ligand, thereby preventing receptor activation, but do not prevent the ligand from binding the receptor. Further included in the invention are antibodies which activate the receptor. These antibodies may act as receptor agonists, i.e., potentiate or activate either all or a subset of the biological activities of the ligand-mediated receptor activation, for example, by inducing dimerization of the receptor. The antibodies may be specified as agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists for biological activities comprising the specific biological activities of the peptides of the invention disclosed herein. The above antibody agonists can be made using methods known in the art. See, e.g., PCT publication WO 96\/40281; U.S. Pat.

For example, the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples. See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988) (incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","As discussed in more detail below, the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example, antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides, drugs, radionucleotides, or toxins. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 92\/08495; WO 91\/14438; WO 89\/12624; U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,995; and EP 396,387.","The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from generating an anti-idiotypic response. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.","The antibodies of the present invention may be generated by any suitable method known in the art.","The antibodies of the present invention may comprise polyclonal antibodies. Methods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known to the skilled artisan (Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2ed. (1988), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host animals including, but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. The administration of the polypeptides of the present invention may entail one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and include but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art. For the purposes of the invention, \u201cimmunizing agent\u201d may be defined as a polypeptide of the invention, including fragments, variants, and\/or derivatives thereof, in addition to fusions with heterologous polypeptides and other forms of the polypeptides described herein.","Typically, the immunizing agent and\/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections, though they may also be given intramuscularly, and\/or through IV). The immunizing agent may include polypeptides of the present invention or a fusion protein or variants thereof. Depending upon the nature of the polypeptides (i.e., percent hydrophobicity, percent hydrophilicity, stability, net charge, isoelectric point etc.), it may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Such conjugation includes either chemical conjugation by derivitizing active chemical functional groups to both the polypeptide of the present invention and the immunogenic protein such that a covalent bond is formed, or through fusion-protein based methodology, or other methods known to the skilled artisan. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include, but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Additional examples of adjuvants which may be employed includes the MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate). The immunization protocol may be selected by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.","The antibodies of the present invention may comprise monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110, by Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2ed. (1988), by Hammerling, et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas (Elsevier, N.Y., (1981)), or other methods known to the artisan. Other examples of methods which may be employed for producing monoclonal antibodies includes, but are not limited to, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kosbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4:72; Cole et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:2026\u20132030), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77\u201396). Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAb of this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo. Production of high titers of mAbs in vivo makes this the presently preferred method of production.","In a hybridoma method, a mouse, a humanized mouse, a mouse with a human immune system, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.","The immunizing agent will typically include polypeptides of the present invention or a fusion protein thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes (\u201cPBLs\u201d) are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986), pp. 59\u2013103). Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. As inferred throughout the specification, human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51\u201363).","The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). Such techniques are known in the art and within the skill of the artisan. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollart, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).","After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.","The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-sepharose, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.","The skilled artisan would acknowledge that a variety of methods exist in the art for the production of monoclonal antibodies and thus, the invention is not limited to their sole production in hydridomas. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. In this context, the term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody derived from a single eukaryotic, phage, or prokaryotic clone. The DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies, or such chains from human, humanized, or other sources). The hydridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transformed into host cells such as Simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4, 816, 567; Morrison et al, supra) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.","The antibodies may be monovalent antibodies. Methods for preparing monovalent antibodies are well known in the art. For example, one method involves recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light chain and modified heavy chain. The heavy chain is truncated generally at any point in the Fc region so as to prevent heavy chain crosslinking. Alternatively, the relevant cysteine residues are substituted with another amino acid residue or are deleted so as to prevent crosslinking.","In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly, Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563\u2013681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.","Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art and are discussed in detail in the Examples described herein. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of the invention or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.","Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein, preferably, the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.","Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)2 fragments). F(ab\u2032)2 fragments contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CHI domain of the heavy chain.","For example, the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol.

For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92\/22324; Mullinax et al., BioTechniques 12(6):864\u2013869 (1992); and Sawai et al., AJRI 34:26\u201334 (1995); and Better et al., Science 240:1041\u20131043 (1988) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et al., Methods in Enzymology 203:46\u201388 (1991); Shu et al., PNAS 90:7995\u20137999 (1993); and Skerra et al., Science 240:1038\u20131040 (1988).","For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191\u2013202; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4\/5):489\u2013498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805\u2013814 (1994); Roguska. et al., PNAS 91:969\u2013973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an \u201cimport\u201d variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the methods of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522\u2013525 (1986); Reichmann et al., Nature, 332:323\u2013327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534\u20131536 (1988), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possible some FR residues are substituted from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.","In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522\u2013525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323\u2013329 (1988)1 and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593\u2013596 (1992).","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO 98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The techniques of cole et al., and Boerder et al., are also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Riss, (1985); and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147(l):86\u201395, (1991)).","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65\u201393 (1995). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98\/24893; WO 92\/01047; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Pat.

In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.), Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.), and Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and creation of an antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,106, and in the following scientific publications: Marks et al., Biotechnol., 10:779\u2013783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856\u2013859 (1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnol., 14:845\u201351 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnol., 14:826 (1996); Lonberg and Huszer, Intern. Rev. Immunol., 13:65\u201393 (1995).","Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al., Bio\/technology 12:899\u2013903 (1988)).","Further, antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can, in turn, be utilized to generate anti-idiotype antibodies that \u201cmimic\u201d polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. (See, e.g., Greenspan & Bona, FASEB J. 7(5):437\u2013444; (1989) and Nissinoff, J. Immunol. 147(8):2429\u20132438 (1991)). For example, antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and\/or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti-idiotypes that \u201cmimic\u201d the polypeptide multimerization and\/or binding domain and, as a consequence, bind to and neutralize polypeptide and\/or its ligand. Such neutralizing anti-idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti-idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and\/or to bind its ligands\/receptors, and thereby block its biological activity.","The antibodies of the present invention may be bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present invention, one of the binding specificities may be directed towards a polypeptide of the present invention, the other may be for any other antigen, and preferably for a cell-surface protein, receptor, receptor subunit, tissue-specific antigen, virally derived protein, virally encoded envelope protein, bacterially derived protein, or bacterial surface protein, etc.","Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain\/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305:537\u2013539 (1983). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93\/08829, published May 13, 1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655\u20133659 (1991).","Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transformed into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example Suresh et al., Meth. In Enzym., 121:210 (1986).","Heteroconjugate antibodies are also contemplated by the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for the treatment of HIV infection (WO 91\/00360; WO 92\/20373; and EP03089). It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioester bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.","Polynucleotides Encoding Antibodies","The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions, e.g., as defined supra, to polynucleotides that encode an antibody, preferably, that specifically binds to a polypeptide of the invention, preferably, an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:Y.","The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. For example, if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties ), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the heavy and\/or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) by methods that are well know in the art, e.g., by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques, one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions, e.g., into human framework regions to humanize a non-human antibody, as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 278: 457\u2013479 (1998) for a listing of human framework regions). Preferably, the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, as discussed supra, one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:851\u2013855 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 312:604\u2013608 (1984); Takeda et al., Nature 314:452\u2013454 (1985)) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra, a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., humanized antibodies.","Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, Science 242:423\u201342 (1988); Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879\u20135883 (1988); and Ward et al., Nature 334:544\u201354 (1989)) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used (Skerra et al., Science 242:1038\u20131041 (1988)).","Methods of Producing Antibodies","The antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or preferably, by recombinant expression techniques.","Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, (e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention or a single chain antibody of the invention), requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain), of the invention has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86\/05807; PCT Publication WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.","The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a single chain antibody of the invention, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces, Pichia) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as , and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio\/Technology 8:2 (1990)).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., EMBO J. 2:1791 (1983)), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101\u20133109 (1985); Van Heeke & Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503\u20135509 (1989)); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:355\u2013359 (1984)). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., Methods in Enzymol. 153:51\u2013544 (1987)).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, W138, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1\u20132 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:202 (1992)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., Cell 22:817 (1980)) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:357 (1980); O'Hare et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072 (1981)); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 Clinical Pharmacy 12:488\u2013505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87\u201395 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573\u2013596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926\u2013932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191\u2013217 (1993); May, 1993, TIB TECH 11(5):155\u2013215); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147 (1984)). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 150:1 (1981), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol.3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257 (1983)).","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2197 (1980)). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal, chemically synthesized, or recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art, to facilitate purification.","The present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to a polypeptide (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) of the present invention to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. The antibodies may be specific for antigens other than polypeptides (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) of the present invention. For example, antibodies may be used to target the polypeptides of the present invention to particular cell types, either in vitro or in vivo, by fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies fused or conjugated to the polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g., Harbor et al., supra, and PCT publication WO 93\/21232; EP 439,095; Naramura et al., Immunol. Lett. 39:91\u201399 (1994); U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,981; Gillies et al., PNAS 89:1428\u20131432 (1992); Fell et al., J. Immunol. 146:2446\u20132452(1991), which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region, or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region, hinge region, CH1 domain, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example, Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,336,603; 5,622,929; 5,359,046; 5,349,053; 5,447,851; 5,112,946; EP 307,434; EP 367,166; PCT publications WO 96\/04388; WO 91\/06570; Ashkenazi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10535\u201310539 (1991); Zheng et al., J. Immunol. 154:5590\u20135600 (1995); and Vil et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11337\u201311341(1992) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).","As discussed, supra, the polypeptides corresponding to a polypeptide, polypeptide fragment, or a variant of SEQ ID NO:Y may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to increase the in vivo half life of the polypeptides or for use in immunoassays using methods known in the art. Further, the polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:Y may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. (EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84\u201386 (1988). The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide-linked dimeric structures (due to the IgG) may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules, than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958\u20133964 (1995)). In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP A 232,262). Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, would be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. (See, Bennett et al., J. Molecular Recognition 8:52\u201358 (1995); Johanson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:9459\u20139471 (1995).","Moreover, the antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821\u2013824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag.","The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody (or fragment thereof) or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include 125I, 131I, 111In or 99Tc.","Further, an antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters such as, for example, 213Bi. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologues thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine).","The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, \u03b1-interferon, \u03b2-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, an apoptotic agent, e.g., TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, AIM I (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM II (See, International Publication No. WO 97\/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al., Int. Immunol., 6:1567\u20131574 (1994)), VEGI (See, International Publication No. WO 99\/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), interleukin-2 (\u201cIL-2\u201d), interleukin-6 (\u201cIL-6\u201d), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (\u201cGM-CSF\u201d), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\u201cG-CSF\u201d), or other growth factors.","Antibodies may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.","Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known, see, e.g., Arnon et al., \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy\u201d, in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. (eds.), pp. 243\u201356 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al., \u201cAntibodies For Drug Delivery\u201d, in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp. 623\u201353 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, \u201cAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review\u201d, in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, Pinchera et al.

Rev. 62:119\u201358 (1982).","Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An antibody, with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it, administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor(s) and\/or cytokine(s) can be used as a therapeutic.","The present invention also encompasses the creation of synthetic antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention. One example of synthetic antibodies is described in Radrizzani, M., et al., Medicina, (Aires), 59(6):753\u20138, (1999)). Recently, a new class of synthetic antibodies has been described and are referred to as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) (Semorex, Inc.). Antibodies, peptides, and enzymes are often used as molecular recognition elements in chemical and biological sensors. However, their lack of stability and signal transduction mechanisms limits their use as sensing devices. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are capable of mimicking the function of biological receptors but with less stability constraints. Such polymers provide high sensitivity and selectivity while maintaining excellent thermal and mechanical stability. MIPs have the ability to bind to small molecules and to target molecules such as organics and proteins' with equal or greater potency than that of natural antibodies. These \u201csuper\u201d MIPs have higher affinities for their target and thus require lower concentrations for efficacious binding.","During synthesis, the MIPs are imprinted so as to have complementary size, shape, charge and functional groups of the selected target by using the target molecule itself (such as a polypeptide, antibody, etc.), or a substance having a very similar structure, as its \u201cprint\u201d or \u201ctemplate.\u201d MIPs can be derivitized with the same reagents afforded to antibodies. For example, fluorescent \u2018super\u2019 MIPs can be coated onto beads or wells for use in highly sensitive separations or assays, or for use in high throughput screening of proteins.","Moreover, MIPs based upon the structure of the polypeptide(s) of the present invention may be useful in screening for compounds that bind to the polypeptide(s) of the invention. Such a MIP would serve the role of a synthetic \u201creceptor\u201d by minimicking the native architecture of the polypeptide. In fact, the ability of a MIP to serve the role of a synthetic receptor has already been demonstrated for the estrogen receptor (Ye, L., Yu, Y., Mosbach, K, Analyst., 126(6):760\u20135, (2001); Dickert, F, L., Hayden, O., Halikias, K, P, Analyst., 126(6):766\u201371, (2001)). A synthetic receptor may either be mimicked in its entirety (e.g., as the entire protein), or mimicked as a series of short peptides corresponding to the protein (Rachkov, A., Minoura, N, Biochim, Biophys, Acta., 1544(1-2):255\u201366, (2001)). Such a synthetic receptor MIPs may be employed in any one or more of the screening methods described elsewhere herein.","MIPs have also been shown to be useful in \u201csensing\u201d the presence of its mimicked molecule (Cheng, Z., Wang, E., Yang, X, Biosens, Bioelectron., 16(3):179\u201385, (2001); Jenkins, A, L., Yin, R., Jensen, J. L, Analyst., 126(6):798\u2013802, (2001); Jenkins, A, L., Yin, R., Jensen, J. L, Analyst., 126(6):798\u2013802, (2001)). For example, a MIP designed using a polypeptide of the present invention may be used in assays designed to identify, and potentially quantitate, the level of said polypeptide in a sample. Such a MIP may be used as a substitute for any component described in the assays, or kits, provided herein (e.g., ELISA, etc.).","A number of methods may be employed to create MIPs to a specific receptor, ligand, polypeptide, peptide, or organic molecule. Several preferred methods are described by Esteban et al in J. Anal, Chem., 370(7):795\u2013802, (2001), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in addition to any references cited therein. Additional methods are known in the art and are encompassed by the present invention, such as for example, Hart, B, R., Shea, K, J. J. Am. Chem, Soc., 123(9):2072\u20133, (2001); and Quaglia, M., Chenon, K., Hall, A, J., De, Lorenzi, E., Sellergren, B, J. Am. Chem, Soc., 123(10):2146\u201354, (2001); which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.","Uses for Antibodies Directed Against Pplypeptides of the Invention","The antibodies of the present invention have various utilities. For example, such antibodies may be used in diagnostic assays to detect the presence or quantification of the polypeptides of the invention in a sample. Such a diagnostic assay may be comprised of at least two steps. The first, subjecting a sample with the antibody, wherein the sample is a tissue (e.g., human, animal, etc.), biological fluid (e.g., blood, urine, sputum, semen, amniotic fluid, saliva, etc.), biological extract (e.g., tissue or cellular homogenate, etc.), a protein microchip (e.g., See Arenkov P, et al., Anal Biochem., 278(2):123\u2013131 (2000)), or a chromatography column, etc. And a second step involving the quantification of antibody bound to the substrate. Alternatively, the method may additionally involve a first step of attaching the antibody, either covalently, electrostatically, or reversibly, to a solid support, and a second step of subjecting the bound antibody to the sample, as defined above and elsewhere herein.","Various diagnostic assay techniques are known in the art, such as competitive binding assays, direct or indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogenous phases (Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, CRC Press, Inc., (1987), pp147\u2013158). The antibodies used in the diagnostic assays can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety should be capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as 2H, 14C, 32P, or 125I, a florescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin, or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, green fluorescent protein, or horseradish peroxidase. Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter et al., Nature, 144:945 (1962); David et al., Biochem., 13:1014 (1974); Pain et al., J. Immunol. Metho., 40:219(1981); and Nygren, J. Histochem. And Cytochem., 30:407 (1982).","Antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention are useful for the affinity purification of such polypeptides from recombinant cell culture or natural sources. In this process, the antibodies against a particular polypeptide are immobilized on a suitable support, such as a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody then is contacted with a sample containing the polypeptides to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except for the desired polypeptides, which are bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent that will release the desired polypeptide from the antibody.","Immunophenotyping","The antibodies of the invention may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples. The translation product of the gene of the present invention may be useful as a cell specific marker, or more specifically as a cellular marker that is differentially expressed at various stages of differentiation and\/or maturation of particular cell types. Monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific epitope, or combination of epitopes, will allow for the screening of cellular populations expressing the marker. Various techniques can be utilized using monoclonal antibodies to screen for cellular populations expressing the marker(s), and include magnetic separation using antibody-coated magnetic beads, \u201cpanning\u201d with antibody attached to a solid matrix (i.e., plate), and flow cytometry (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,660; and Morrison et al., Cell, 96:737\u201349 (1999)).","These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells, such as might be found with hernatological malignancies (i.e. minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemic patients) and \u201cnon-self\u201d cells in transplantations to prevent Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Alternatively, these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and\/or differentiation, as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.","Assays For Antibody Binding","The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).","Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1\u20134 hours) at 4\u00b0 C., adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 4\u00b0 C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%\u201320% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., 32P or 125I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.","ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.","The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., 3H or 125I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., 3H or 125I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.","Therapeutic Uses of Antibodies","The present invention is further directed to antibody-based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, patient for treating one or more of the disclosed diseases, disorders, or conditions. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein) and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof and anti-idiotypic antibodies as described herein). The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the diseases, disorders, or conditions described herein. The treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention includes, but is not limited to, alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases, disorders or conditions. Antibodies of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.","A summary of the ways in which the antibodies of the present invention may be used therapeutically includes binding polynucleotides or polypeptides of the present invention locally or systemically in the body or by direct cytotoxicity of the antibody, e.g. as mediated by complement (CDC) or by effector cells (ADCC). Some of these approaches are described in more detail below. Armed with the teachings provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will know how to use the antibodies of the present invention for diagnostic, monitoring or therapeutic purposes without undue experimentation.","The antibodies of this invention may be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, or with lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), for example, which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies.","The antibodies of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy and anti-tumor agents). Generally, administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity (in the case of antibodies) that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, human antibodies, fragments derivatives, analogs, or nucleic acids, are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.","It is preferred to use high affinity and\/or potent in vivo inhibiting and\/or neutralizing antibodies against polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention, fragments or regions thereof, for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of disorders related to polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof, of the present invention. Such antibodies, fragments, or regions, will preferably have an affinity for polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention, including fragments thereof. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5\u00d710-2 M, 10-2 M, 5\u00d710-3 M, 10-3 M, 5\u00d710-4 M, 10-4 M, 5\u00d710-5 M, 10-5 M, 5\u00d710-6 M, 10-6 M, 5\u00d710-7 M, 10-7 M, 5\u00d710-8 M, 10-8 M, 5\u00d710-9 M, 10-9 M, 5\u00d710-10 M, 10-10 M, 5\u00d710-11 M, 10-11 M, 5\u00d710-12 M, 10-12 M, 5\u00d710-13 M, 10-13 M, 5\u00d710-14 M, 10-14 M, 5\u00d710-15 M, and 10-15 M.","Antibodies directed against polypeptides of the present invention are useful for inhibiting allergic reactions in animals. For example, by administering a therapeutically acceptable dose of an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention, or a cocktail of the present antibodies, or in combination with other antibodies of varying sources, the animal may not elicit an allergic response to antigens.","Likewise, one could envision cloning the gene encoding an antibody directed against a polypeptide of the present invention, said polypeptide having the potential to elicit an allergic and\/or immune response in an organism, and transforming the organism with said antibody gene such that it is expressed (e.g., constitutively, inducibly, etc.) in the organism. Thus, the organism would effectively become resistant to an allergic response resulting from the ingestion or presence of such an immune\/allergic reactive polypeptide. Moreover, such a use of the antibodies of the present invention may have particular utility in preventing and\/or ameliorating autoimmune diseases and\/or disorders, as such conditions are typically a result of antibodies being directed against endogenous proteins. For example, in the instance where the polypeptide of the present invention is responsible for modulating the immune response to auto-antigens, transforming the organism and\/or individual with a construct comprising any of the promoters disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art, in addition, to a polynucleotide encoding the antibody directed against the polypeptide of the present invention could effective inhibit the organisms immune system from eliciting an immune response to the auto-antigen(s). Detailed descriptions of therapeutic and\/or gene therapy applications of the present invention are provided elsewhere herein.","Alternatively, antibodies of the present invention could be produced in a plant (e.g., cloning the gene of the antibody directed against a polypeptide of the present invention, and transforming a plant with a suitable vector comprising said gene for constitutive expression of the antibody within the plant), and the plant subsequently ingested by an animal, thereby conferring temporary immunity to the animal for the specific antigen the antibody is directed towards (See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,914,123 and 6,034,298).","In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention, preferably polyclonal antibodies, more preferably monoclonal antibodies, and most preferably single-chain antibodies, can be used as a means of inhibiting gene expression of a particular gene, or genes, in a human, mammal, and\/or other organism. See, for example, International Publication Number WO 00\/05391, published Feb. 3, 2000, to Dow Agrosciences LLC. The application of such methods for the antibodies of the present invention are known in the art, and are more particularly described elsewhere herein.","In yet another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention may be useful for multimerizing the polypeptides of the present invention. For example, certain proteins may confer enhanced biological activity when present in a multimeric state (i.e., such enhanced activity may be due to the increased effective concentration of such proteins whereby more protein is available in a localized location).","Antibody-based Gene Therapy","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding antibodies or functional derivatives thereof, are administered to treat, inhibit or prevent a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention, by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 12:488\u2013505 (1993); Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87\u201395 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573\u2013596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926\u2013932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191\u2013217 (1993); May, TIBTECH 11(5):155\u2013215 (1993). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990).","In a preferred aspect, the compound comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody, said nucleic acid sequences being part of expression vectors that express the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989). In specific embodiments, the expressed antibody molecule is a single chain antibody; alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains, or fragments thereof, of the antibody.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429\u20134432 (1987)) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; W092\/20316; W093\/14188, WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989)).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:581\u2013599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., Biotherapy 6:291\u2013302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:644\u2013651 (1994); Kiem et al., Blood 83:1467\u20131473 (1994); Salmons and Gunzberg, Human Gene Therapy 4:129\u2013141 (1993); and Grossman and Wilson, Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110\u2013114 (1993).","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499\u2013503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., Human Gene Therapy 5:3\u201310 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431\u2013434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143\u2013155 (1992); Mastrangeli et al., J. Clin. Invest. 91:225\u2013234 (1993); PCT Publication W094\/12649; and Wang, et al., Gene Therapy 2:775\u2013783 (1995). In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (Walsh et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289\u2013300 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (see, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, Meth. Enzymol. 217:599\u2013618 (1993); Cohen et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:618\u2013644 (1993); Cline, Pharmac. Ther. 29:69\u201392m (1985) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as Tlymphocytes, Blymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, Cell 71:973\u2013985 (1992); Rheinwald, Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229 (1980); and Pittelkow and Scott, Mayo Clinic Proc. 61:771 (1986)).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription. Demonstration of Therapeutic or Prophylactic Activity","The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays to demonstrate the therapeutic or prophylactic utility of a compound or pharmaceutical composition include, the effect of a compound on a cell line or a patient tissue sample. The effect of the compound or composition on the cell line and\/or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to, rosette formation assays and cell lysis assays. In accordance with the invention, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered a compound, and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed.","Therapeutic\/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions","The invention provides methods of treatment, inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, preferably an antibody of the invention. In a preferred aspect, the compound is substantially purified (e.g., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). The subject is preferably an animal, including but not limited to animals such as cows, pigs, horses, chickens, cats, dogs, etc., and is preferably a mammal, and most preferably human.","Formulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises a nucleic acid or an immunoglobulin are described above; additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a compound of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429\u20134432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compounds or compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a protein, including an antibody, of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527\u20131533 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353\u2013365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317\u2013327; see generally ibid.)","In yet another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Florida (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115\u2013138 (1984)).","Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527\u20131533 (1990)).","In a specific embodiment where the compound of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a protein, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864\u20131868 (1991)), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.","The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.","In a preferred embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight, more preferably 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","Diagnosis and Imaging With Antibodies","Labeled antibodies, and derivatives and analogs thereof, which specifically bind to a polypeptide of interest can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with the aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.","The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.","Antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell . Biol. 105:3087\u20133096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (125I, 121I), carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (1121n), and technetium (99Tc); luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest in an animal, preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment, diagnosis comprises: a) administering (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest; b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the polypeptide is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c) determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled molecule in the subject, such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the polypeptide of interest. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).","Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.","In an embodiment, monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease, for example, one month after initial diagnosis, six months after initial diagnosis, one year after initial diagnosis, etc.","Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography.","In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patent using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Kits","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises an antibody of the invention, preferably a purified antibody, in one or more containers. In a specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. Preferably, the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest. In another specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound, an enzymatic substrate, a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound, or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate).","In another specific embodiment of the present invention, the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against proliferative and\/or cancerous polynucleotides and polypeptides. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti-polypeptide antigen antibody. Further, such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of said antibody to the antigen (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry). In specific embodiments, the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.","In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above-described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non-attached reporter-labeled anti-human antibody. In this embodiment, binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter-labeled antibody.","In an additional embodiment, the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens, and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment, the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second, labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, the detecting means may include a labeled, competing antigen.","In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface-bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing, the reagent is reacted with reporter-labeled anti-human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti-antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody, and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically, the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric, luminescent or colorimetric substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).","The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non-specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein, typically through a free amine group, to a chemically reactive group on the solid support, such as an activated carboxyl, hydroxyl, or aldehyde group. Alternatively, streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen(s).","Thus, the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface-bound recombinant antigens, and a reporter-labeled anti-human antibody for detecting surface-bound anti-antigen antibody.","Fusion Proteins","Any polypeptide of the present invention can be used to generate fusion proteins. For example, the polypeptide of the present invention, when fused to a second protein, can be used as an antigenic tag. Antibodies raised against the polypeptide of the present invention can be used to indirectly detect the second protein by binding to the polypeptide. Moreover, because certain proteins target cellular locations based on trafficking signals, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as targeting molecules once fused to other proteins.","Examples of domains that can be fused to polypeptides of the present invention include not only heterologous signal sequences, but also other heterologous functional regions. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences.","Moreover, fusion proteins may also be engineered to improve characteristics of the polypeptide of the present invention. For instance, a region of additional amino acids, particularly charged amino acids, may be added to the N-terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence during purification from the host cell or subsequent handling and storage. Peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. Similarly, peptide cleavage sites can be introduced in-between such peptide moieties, which could additionally be subjected to protease activity to remove said peptide(s) from the protein of the present invention. The addition of peptide moieties, including peptide cleavage sites, to facilitate handling of polypeptides are familiar and routine techniques in the art.","Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention, including fragments, and specifically epitopes, can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM) or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, and any combination thereof, including both entire domains and portions thereof), resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half-life in vivo. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. (EP A 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84\u201386 (1988).) Fusion proteins having disulfide-linked dimeric structures (due to the IgG) can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules, than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958\u20133964 (1995).)","Similarly, EP-A-O 464 533 (Canadian counterpart 2045869) discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of the constant region of immunoglobulin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP-A 0232 262. ) Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, would be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. (See, D. Bennett et al., J. Molecular Recognition 8:52\u201358 (1995); K. Johanson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:9459\u20139471 (1995).)","Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences (also referred to as \u201ctags\u201d). Due to the availability of antibodies specific to such \u201ctags\u201d, purification of the fused polypeptide of the invention, and\/or its identification is significantly facilitated since antibodies specific to the polypeptides of the invention are not required. Such purification may be in the form of an affinity purification whereby an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix (e.g., anti-tag antibody attached to the matrix of a flow-thru column) that binds to the epitope tag is present. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821\u2013824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Another peptide tag useful for purification, the \u201cHA\u201d tag, corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)).","The skilled artisan would acknowledge the existence of other \u201ctags\u201d which could be readily substituted for the tags referred to supra for purification and\/or identification of polypeptides of the present invention (Jones C., et al., J Chromatogr A. 707(l):3\u201322 (1995)). For example, the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4m B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto (Evan et al., Molecular and Cellular Biology 5:3610\u20133616 (1985)); the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody (Paborsky et al., Protein Engineering, 3(6):547\u2013553 (1990), the Flag-peptide\u2014i.e., the octapeptide sequence DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:36), (Hopp et al., Biotech. 6:1204\u20131210 (1988); the KT3 epitope peptide (Martin et al., Science, 255:192\u2013194 (1992)); a-tubulin epitope peptide (Skinner et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266:15136\u201315166, (1991)); the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag (Lutz-Freyermuth et al., Proc. Natl. Sci. USA, 87:6363\u20136397 (1990)), the FITC epitope (Zymed, Inc.), the GFP epitope (Zymed, Inc.), and the Rhodamine epitope (Zymed, Inc.).","The present invention also encompasses the attachment of up to nine codons encoding a repeating series of up to nine arginine amino acids to the coding region of a polynucleotide of the present invention. The invention also encompasses chemically derivitizing a polypeptide of the present invention with a repeating series of up to nine arginine amino acids. Such a tag, when attached to a polypeptide, has recently been shown to serve as a universal pass, allowing compounds access to the interior of cells without additional derivitization or manipulation (Wender, P., et al., unpublished data).","Protein fusions involving polypeptides of the present invention, including fragments and\/or variants thereof, can be used for the following, non-limiting examples, subcellular localization of proteins, determination of protein-protein interactions via immunoprecipitation, purification of proteins via affinity chromatography, functional and\/or structural characterization of protein. The present invention also encompasses the application of hapten specific antibodies for any of the uses referenced above for epitope fusion proteins. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention could be chemically derivatized to attach hapten molecules (e.g., DNP, (Zymed, Inc.)). Due to the availability of monoclonal antibodies specific to such haptens, the protein could be readily purified using immunoprecipation, for example.","Polypeptides of the present invention, including fragments and\/or variants thereof, in addition to, antibodies directed against such polypeptides, fragments, and\/or variants, may be fused to any of a number of known, and yet to be determined, toxins, such as ricin, saporin (Mashiba H, et al., Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999;886:233\u20135), or HC toxin (Tonukari N J, et al., Plant Cell. 2000 February; 12(2):237\u2013248), for example. Such fusions could be used to deliver the toxins to desired tissues for which a ligand or a protein capable of binding to the polypeptides of the invention exists.","The invention encompasses the fusion of antibodies directed against polypeptides of the present invention, including variants and fragments thereof, to said toxins for delivering the toxin to specific locations in a cell, to specific tissues, and\/or to specific species. Such bifunctional antibodies are known in the art, though a review describing additional advantageous fusions, including citations for methods of production, can be found in P. J. Hudson, Curr. Opp. In. Imm. 11:548\u2013557, (1999); this publication, in addition to the references cited therein, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. In this context, the term \u201ctoxin\u201d may be expanded to include any heterologous protein, a small molecule, radionucleotides, cytotoxic drugs, liposomes, adhesion molecules, glycoproteins, ligands, cell or tissue-specific ligands, enzymes, of bioactive agents, biological response modifiers, anti-fungal agents, hormones, steroids, vitamins, peptides, peptide analogs, anti-allergenic agents, anti-tubercular agents, anti-viral agents, antibiotics, anti-protozoan agents, chelates, radioactive particles, radioactive ions, X-ray contrast agents, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies and genetic material. In view of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art could determine whether any particular \u201ctoxin\u201d could be used in the compounds of the present invention. Examples of suitable \u201ctoxins\u201d listed above are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the \u201ctoxins\u201d that may be used in the present invention.","Thus, any of these above fusions can be engineered using the polynucleotides or the polypeptides of the present invention.","Vectors, Host Cells, and Protein Production","The present invention also relates to vectors containing the polynucleotide of the present invention, host cells, and the production of polypeptides by recombinant techniques. The vector may be, for example, a phage, plasmid, viral, or retroviral vector. Retroviral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case, viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells.","The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus, it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.","The polynucleotide insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the phage lambda PL promoter, the lac, trp, phoA and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs, to name a few. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.","As indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase, G418 or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as and cells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris (ATCC Accession No. 201178)); insect cells such as S2 and Spodoptera Sf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, COS, 293, and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art.","Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria include pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, available from QIAGEN, Inc.; pBluescript vectors, Phagescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, Inc.; and ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 available from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; and pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. Preferred expression vectors for use in yeast systems include, but are not limited to pYES2, pYD1, pTEF1\/Zeo, pYES2\/GS, pPICZ, pGAPZ, pGAPZalph, pPIC9, pPIC3.5, pHIL-D2, pHIL-S1, pPIC3.5K, pPIC9K, and PAO815 (all available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.","Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection, or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al., Basic Methods In Molecular Biology (1986). It is specifically contemplated that the polypeptides of the present invention may in fact be expressed by a host cell lacking a recombinant vector.","A polypeptide of this invention can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably, high performance liquid chromatography (\u201cHPLC\u201d) is employed for purification.","Polypeptides of the present invention, and preferably the secreted form, can also be recovered from: products purified from natural sources, including bodily fluids, tissues and cells, whether directly isolated or cultured; products of chemical synthetic procedures; and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect, and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated. In addition, polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes. Thus, it is well known in the art that the N-terminal methionine encoded by the translation initiation codon generally is removed with high efficiency from any protein after translation in all eukaryotic cells. While the N-terminal methionine on most proteins also is efficiently removed in most prokaryotes, for some proteins, this prokaryotic removal process is inefficient, depending on the nature of the amino acid to which the N-terminal methionine is covalently linked.","In one embodiment, the yeast Pichia pastoris is used to express the polypeptide of the present invention in a eukaryotic system. Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast which can metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source. A main step in the methanol metabolization pathway is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde using O2. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol oxidase. In order to metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source, Pichia pastoris must generate high levels of alcohol oxidase due, in part, to the relatively low affinity of alcohol oxidase for O2. Consequently, in a growth medium depending on methanol as a main carbon source, the promoter region of one of the two alcohol oxidase genes (AOX1) is highly active. In the presence of methanol, alcohol oxidase produced from the AOX1 gene comprises up to approximately 30% of the total soluble protein in Pichia pastoris. See, Ellis, S. B., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:1111\u201321 (1985); Koutz, P. J, et al., Yeast 5:167\u201377 (1989); Tschopp, J. F., et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:3859\u201376 (1987). Thus, a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a polynucleotide of the present invention, under the transcriptional regulation of all or part of the AOX1 regulatory sequence is expressed at exceptionally high levels in Pichia yeast grown in the presence of methanol.","In one example, the plasmid vector pPIC9K is used to express DNA encoding a polypeptide of the invention, as set forth herein, in a Pichea yeast system essentially as described in \u201cPichia Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology,\u201d D. R. Higgins and J. Cregg, eds. The Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 1998. This expression vector allows expression and secretion of a protein of the invention by virtue of the strong AOX1 promoter linked to the Pichia pastoris alkaline phosphatase (PHO) secretory signal peptide (i.e., leader) located upstream of a multiple cloning site.","Many other yeast vectors could be used in place of pPIC9K, such as, pYES2, pYD1, pTEF1\/Zeo, pYES2\/ GS, pPICZ, pGAPZ, pGAPZalpha, pPIC9, pPIC3.5, pHIL-D2, pHIL-S1, pPIC3.5K, and PAO815, as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate, as long as the proposed expression construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription, translation, secretion (if desired), and the like, including an in-frame AUG, as required.","In another embodiment, high-level expression of a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a polynucleotide of the present invention, may be achieved by cloning the heterologous polynucleotide of the invention into an expression vector such as, for example, pGAPZ or pGAPZalpha, and growing the yeast culture in the absence of methanol.","In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein, the invention also encompasses primary, secondary, and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin, particularly mammalian origin, that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material (e.g., coding sequence), and\/or to include genetic material (e.g., heterologous polynucleotide sequences) that is operably associated with the polynucleotides of the invention, and which activates, alters, and\/or amplifies endogenous polynucleotides. For example, techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions (e.g., promoter and\/or enhancer) and endogenous polynucleotide sequences via homologous recombination, resulting in the formation of a new transcription unit (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,761, issued Mar. 31, 1998; International Publication No. WO 96\/29411, published Sep. 26, 1996; International Publication No. WO 94\/12650, published Aug. 4, 1994; Koller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties).","In addition, polypeptides of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Creighton, 1983, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W. H. Freeman & Co., N.Y., and Hunkapiller et al., Nature, 310:105\u2013111 (1984)). For example, a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of a polypeptide sequence of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary).","The invention encompasses polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including but not limited, to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, V8 protease, NaBH4; acetylation, formylation, oxidation, reduction; metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin; etc.","Additional post-translational modifications encompassed by the invention include, for example, e.g., N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, processing of N-terminal or C-terminal ends), attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, chemical modifications of N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, and addition or deletion of an N-terminal methionine residue as a result of prokaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein, the addition of epitope tagged peptide fragments (e.g., FLAG, HA, GST, thioredoxin, maltose binding protein, etc.), attachment of affinity tags such as biotin and\/or streptavidin, the covalent attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, N- or C-terminal processing of the polypeptides ends (e.g., proteolytic processing), deletion of the N-terminal methionine residue, etc.","Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of the polypeptides of the invention which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility, stability and circulating time of the polypeptide, or decreased immunogenicity (see U.S. Pat. No.: 4,179,337). The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol copolymers, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule, or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one, two, three or more attached chemical moieties.","The invention further encompasses chemical derivitization of the polypeptides of the present invention, preferably where the chemical is a hydrophilic polymer residue. Exemplary hydrophilic polymers, including derivatives, may be those that include polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more hydroxy groups (polyhydroxy polymers), including, for example, poly(vinyl alcohol); polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more amino groups (polyamine polymers), including, for example, peptides, polypeptides, proteins and lipoproteins, such as albumin and natural lipoproteins; polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more carboxy groups (polycarboxy polymers), including, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginic acid and salts thereof, such as sodium and calcium alginate, glycosaminoglycans and salts thereof, including salts of hyaluronic acid, phosphorylated and sulfonated derivatives of carbohydrates, genetic material, such as interleukin-2 and interferon, and phosphorothioate oligomers; and polymers in which the repeating units contain one or more saccharide moieties (polysaccharide polymers), including, for example, carbohydrates.","The molecular weight of the hydrophilic polymers may vary, and is generally about 50 to about 5,000,000, with polymers having a molecular weight of about 100 to about 50,000 being preferred. The polymers may be branched or unbranched. More preferred polymers have a molecular weight of about 150 to about 10,000, with molecular weights of 200 to about 8,000 being even more preferred.","For polyethylene glycol, the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight) for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used, depending on the desired therapeutic profile (e.g., the duration of sustained release desired, the effects, if any on biological activity, the ease in handling, the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog).","Additional preferred polymers which may be used to derivatize polypeptides of the invention, include, for example, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(vinylpyrrolidine), polyoxomers, polysorbate and poly(vinyl alcohol), with PEG polymers being particularly preferred. Preferred among the PEG polymers are PEG polymers having a molecular weight of from about 100 to about 10,000. More preferably, the PEG polymers have a molecular weight of from about 200 to about 8,000, with PEG 2,000, PEG 5,000 and PEG 8,000, which have molecular weights of 2,000, 5,000 and 8,000, respectively, being even more preferred. Other suitable hydrophilic polymers, in addition to those exemplified above, will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure. Generally, the polymers used may include polymers that can be attached to the polypeptides of the invention via alkylation or acylation reactions.","The polyethylene glycol molecules (or other chemical moieties) should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, e.g., EP 0 401 384, herein incorporated by reference (coupling PEG to G-CSF), see also Malik et al., Exp. Hematol. 20:1028\u20131035 (1992) (reporting pegylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride). For example, polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group, such as, a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N-terminal amino acid residues; those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C-terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group, such as attachment at the N-terminus or lysine group.","One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition, one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules (by molecular weight, branching, etc.), the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein (polypeptide) molecules in the reaction mix, the type of pegylation reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected N-terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N-terminally pegylated preparation (i.e., separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary) may be by purification of the N-terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the N-terminus) available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N-terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.","As with the various polymers exemplified above, it is contemplated that the polymeric residues may contain functional groups in addition, for example, to those typically involved in linking the polymeric residues to the polypeptides of the present invention. Such functionalities include, for example, carboxyl, amine, hydroxy and thiol groups. These functional groups on the polymeric residues can be further reacted, if desired, with materials that are generally reactive with such functional groups and which can assist in targeting specific tissues in the body including, for example, diseased tissue. Exemplary materials which can be reacted with the additional functional groups include, for example, proteins, including antibodies, carbohydrates, peptides, glycopeptides, glycolipids, lectins, and nucleosides.","In addition to residues of hydrophilic polymers, the chemical used to derivatize the polypeptides of the present invention can be a saccharide residue. Exemplary saccharides which can be derived include, for example, monosaccharides or sugar alcohols, such as erythrose, threose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, fructose, sorbitol, mannitol and sedoheptulose, with preferred monosaccharides being fructose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, mannitol and sorbitol; and disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, maltose and cellobiose. Other saccharides include, for example, inositol and ganglioside head groups. Other suitable saccharides, in addition to those exemplified above, will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art based on the present disclosure. Generally, saccharides which may be used for derivitization include saccharides that can be attached to the polypeptides of the invention via alkylation or acylation reactions.","Moreover, the invention also encompasses derivitization of the polypeptides of the present invention, for example, with lipids (including cationic, anionic, polymerized, charged, synthetic, saturated, unsaturated, and any combination of the above, etc.). stabilizing agents.","The invention encompasses derivitization of the polypeptides of the present invention, for example, with compounds that may serve a stabilizing function (e.g., to increase the polypeptides half-life in solution, to make the polypeptides more water soluble, to increase the polypeptides hydrophilic or hydrophobic character, etc.). Polymers useful as stabilizing materials may be of natural, semi-synthetic (modified natural) or synthetic origin. Exemplary natural polymers include naturally occurring polysaccharides, such as, for example, arabinans, fructans, fucans, galactans, galacturonans, glucans, mannans, xylans (such as, for example, inulin), levan, fucoidan, carrageenan, galatocarolose, pectic acid, pectins, including amylose, pullulan, glycogen, amylopectin, cellulose, dextran, dextrin, dextrose, glucose, polyglucose, polydextrose, pustulan, chitin, agarose, keratin, chondroitin, dermatan, hyaluronic acid, alginic acid, xanthin gum, starch and various other natural homopolymer or heteropolymers, such as those containing one or more of the following aldoses, ketoses, acids or amines: erythose, threose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, allose, altrose, glucose, dextrose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose, erythrulose, ribulose, xylulose, psicose, fructose, sorbose, tagatose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, cellobiose, glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine, histidine, glucuronic acid, gluconic acid, glucaric acid, galacturonic acid, mannuronic acid, glucosamine, galactosamine, and neuraminic acid, and naturally occurring derivatives thereof. Accordingly, suitable polymers include, for example, proteins, such as albumin, polyalginates, and polylactide-coglycolide polymers. Exemplary semi-synthetic polymers include carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, and methoxycellulose. Exemplary synthetic polymers include polyphosphazenes, hydroxyapatites, fluoroapatite polymers, polyethylenes (such as, for example, polyethylene glycol (including for example, the class of compounds referred to as Pluronics.RTM., commercially available from BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), polyoxyethylene, and polyethylene terephthlate), polypropylenes (such as, for example, polypropylene glycol), polymethanes (such as, for example, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylpyrrolidone), polyamides including nylon, polystyrene, polylactic acids, fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers, fluorinated carbon polymers (such as, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene), acrylate, methacrylate, and polymethylmethacrylate, and derivatives thereof. Methods for the preparation of derivatized polypeptides of the invention which employ polymers as stabilizing compounds will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, in view of the present disclosure, when coupled with information known in the art, such as that described and referred to in Unger, U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,290, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Moreover, the invention encompasses additional modifications of the polypeptides of the present invention. Such additional modifications are known in the art, and are specifically provided, in addition to methods of derivitization, etc., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,066, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein.","The polypeptides of the invention may be in monomers or multimers (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher multimers). Accordingly, the present invention relates to monomers and multimers of the polypeptides of the invention, their preparation, and compositions (preferably, Therapeutics) containing them. In specific embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention are monomers, dimers, trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments, the multimers of the invention are at least dimers, at least trimers, or at least tetramers.","Multimers encompassed by the invention may be homomers or heteromers. As used herein, the term homomer, refers to a multimer containing only polypeptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:Y or encoded by the cDNA contained in a deposited clone (including fragments, variants, splice variants, and fusion proteins, corresponding to these polypeptides as described herein). These homomers may contain polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences. In a specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only polypeptides having an identical amino acid sequence. In another specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing polypeptides having different amino acid sequences. In specific embodiments, the multimer of the invention is a homodimer (e.g., containing polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences) or a homotrimer (e.g., containing polypeptides having identical and\/or different amino acid sequences). In additional embodiments, the homomeric multimer of the invention is at least a homodimer, at least a homotrimer, or at least a homotetramer.","As used herein, the term heteromer refers to a multimer containing one or more heterologous polypeptides (i.e., polypeptides of different proteins) in addition to the polypeptides of the invention. In a specific embodiment, the multimer of the invention is a heterodimer, a heterotrimer, or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments, the heteromeric multimer of the invention is at least a heterodimer, at least a heterotrimer, or at least a heterotetramer.","Multimers of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, ionic and\/or covalent associations and\/or may be indirectly linked, by for example, liposome formation. Thus, in one embodiment, multimers of the invention, such as, for example, homodimers or homotrimers, are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact one another in solution. In another embodiment, heteromultimers of the invention, such as, for example, heterotrimers or heterotetramers, are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention (including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention) in solution. In other embodiments, multimers of the invention are formed by covalent associations with and\/or between the polypeptides of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence (e.g., that recited in the sequence listing, or contained in the polypeptide encoded by a deposited clone). In one instance, the covalent associations are cross-linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences which interact in the native (i.e., naturally occurring) polypeptide. In another instance, the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively, such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention.","In one example, covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925). In a specific example, the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in an Fc fusion protein of the invention (as described herein). In another specific example, covalent associations of fusion proteins of the invention are between heterologous polypeptide sequence from another protein that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers, such as for example, osteoprotegerin (see, e.g., International Publication NO:WO 98\/49305, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, two or more polypeptides of the invention are joined through peptide linkers. Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Proteins comprising multiple polypeptides of the invention separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.","Another method for preparing multimer polypeptides of the invention involves use of polypeptides of the invention fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine zipper polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., Science 240:1759, (1988)), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric proteins of the invention are those described in PCT application WO 94\/10308, hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide of the invention fused to a polypeptide sequence that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells, and the resulting soluble multimeric fusion protein is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art.","Trimeric polypeptides of the invention may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties and isoleucine moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD), as described in Hoppe et al. (FEBS Letters 344:191, (1994)) and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/446,922, hereby incorporated by reference. Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric polypeptides of the invention.","In another example, proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between Flag\u00ae polypeptide sequence contained in fusion proteins of the invention containing Flag\u00ae polypeptide sequence. In a further embodiment, associations proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between heterologous polypeptide sequence contained in Flag\u00ae fusion proteins of the invention and anti-Flag\u00ae antibody.","The multimers of the invention may be generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example, polypeptides desired to be contained in the multimers of the invention may be chemically cross-linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, multimers of the invention may be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter-molecule cross-links between the cysteine residues located within the sequence of the polypeptides desired to be contained in the multimer (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Further, polypeptides of the invention may be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N-terminus of the polypeptide and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified polypeptides (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, techniques known in the art may be applied to generate liposomes containing the polypeptide components desired to be contained in the multimer of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","Alternatively, multimers of the invention may be generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, polypeptides contained in multimers of the invention are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In a specific embodiment, polynucleotides coding for a homodimer of the invention are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C-terminus to the N-terminus (lacking the leader sequence) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are applied to generate recombinant polypeptides of the invention which contain a transmembrane domain (or hydrophobic or signal peptide) and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","In addition, the polynucleotide insert of the present invention could be operatively linked to \u201cartificial\u201d or chimeric promoters and transcription factors. Specifically, the artificial promoter could comprise, or alternatively consist, of any combination of cis-acting DNA sequence elements that are recognized by trans-acting transcription factors. Preferably, the cis acting DNA sequence elements and transacting transcription factors are operable in mammals. Further, the transacting transcription factors of such \u201cartificial\u201d promoters could also be \u201cartificial\u201d or chimeric in design themselves and could act as activators or repressors to said \u201cartificial\u201d promoter.","Uses of the Polynucleotides","Each of the polynucleotides identified herein can be used in numerous ways as reagents. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.","The polynucleotides of the present invention are useful for chromosome identification. There exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome markers, since few chromosome marking reagents, based on actual sequence data (repeat polymorphisms), are presently available. Each polynucleotide of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker.","Briefly, sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers (preferably 15\u201325 bp) from the sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:X. Primers can be selected using computer analysis so that primers do not span more than one predicted exon in the genomic DNA. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the SEQ ID NO:X will yield an amplified fragment.","Similarly, somatic hybrids provide a rapid method of PCR mapping the polynucleotides to particular chromosomes. Three or more clones can be assigned per day using a single thermal cycler. Moreover, sublocalization of the polynucleotides can be achieved with panels of specific chromosome fragments. Other gene mapping strategies that can be used include in situ hybridization, prescreening with labeled flow-sorted chromosomes, and preselection by hybridization to construct chromosome specific-cDNA libraries.","Precise chromosomal location of the polynucleotides can also be achieved using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a metaphase chromosomal spread. This technique uses polynucleotides as short as 500 or 600 bases; however, polynucleotides 2,000\u20134,000 bp are preferred. For a review of this technique, see Verma et al., \u201cHuman Chromosomes: a Manual of Basic Techniques,\u201d Pergamon Press, New York (1988).","For chromosome mapping, the polynucleotides can be used individually (to mark a single chromosome or a single site on that chromosome) or in panels (for marking multiple sites and\/or multiple chromosomes). Preferred polynucleotides correspond to the noncoding regions of the cDNAs because the coding sequences are more likely conserved within gene families, thus increasing the chance of cross hybridization during chromosomal mapping.","Once a polynucleotide has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the polynucleotide can be used in linkage analysis. Linkage analysis establishes coinheritance between a chromosomal location and presentation of a particular disease. Disease mapping data are known in the art. Assuming 1 megabase mapping resolution and one gene per 20 kb, a cDNA precisely localized to a chromosomal region associated with the disease could be one of 50\u2013500 potential causative genes.","Thus, once coinheritance is established, differences in the polynucleotide and the corresponding gene between affected and unaffected organisms can be examined. First, visible structural alterations in the chromosomes, such as deletions or translocations, are examined in chromosome spreads or by PCR. If no structural alterations exist, the presence of point mutations are ascertained. Mutations observed in some or all affected organisms, but not in normal organisms, indicates that the mutation may cause the disease. However, complete sequencing of the polypeptide and the corresponding gene from several normal organisms is required to distinguish the mutation from a polymorphism. If a new polymorphism is identified, this polymorphic polypeptide can be used for further linkage analysis.","Furthermore, increased or decreased expression of the gene in affected organisms as compared to unaffected organisms can be assessed using polynucleotides of the present invention. Any of these alterations (altered expression, chromosomal rearrangement, or mutation) can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker.","Thus, the invention also provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a disorder, involving measuring the expression level of polynucleotides of the present invention in cells or body fluid from an organism and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard level of polynucleotide expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of a disorder.","By \u201cmeasuring the expression level of a polynucleotide of the present invention\u201d is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the polypeptide of the present invention or the level of the mRNA encoding the polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample). Preferably, the polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard polypeptide level or mRNA level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of organisms not having a disorder. As will be appreciated in the art, once a standard polypeptide level or MRNA level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.","By \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended any biological sample obtained from an organism, body fluids, cell line, tissue culture, or other source which contains the polypeptide of the present invention or mRNA. As indicated, biological samples include body fluids (such as the following non-limiting examples, sputum, amniotic fluid, urine, saliva, breast milk, secretions, interstitial fluid, blood, serum, spinal fluid, etc.) which contain the polypeptide of the present invention, and other tissue sources found to express the polypeptide of the present invention. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from organisms are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.","The method(s) provided above may preferably be applied in a diagnostic method and\/or kits in which polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides are attached to a solid support. In one exemplary method, the support may be a \u201cgene chip\u201d or a \u201cbiological chip\u201d as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,832, 5,874,219, and 5,856,174. Further, such a gene chip with polynucleotides of the present invention attached may be used to identify polymorphisms between the polynucleotide sequences, with polynucleotides isolated from a test subject. The knowledge of such polymorphisms (i.e. their location, as well as, their existence) would be beneficial in identifying disease loci for many disorders, including proliferative diseases and conditions. Such a method is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,659 and 5,856,104. The U.S. Pat. Nos. referenced supra are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.","The present invention encompasses polynucleotides of the present invention that are chemically synthesized, or reproduced as peptide nucleic acids (PNA), or according to other methods known in the art. The use of PNAs would serve as the preferred form if the polynucleotides are incorporated onto a solid support, or gene chip. For the purposes of the present invention, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a polyamide type of DNA analog and the monomeric units for adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine are available commercially (Perceptive Biosystems). Certain components of DNA, such as phosphorus, phosphorus oxides, or deoxyribose derivatives, are not present in PNAs. As disclosed by P. E. Nielsen, M. Egholm, R. H. Berg and O. Buchardt, Science 254, 1497 (1991); and M. Egholm, O. Buchardt, L. Christensen, C. Behrens, S. M. Freier, D. A. Driver, R. H. Berg, S. K. Kim, B. Norden, and P. E. Nielsen, Nature 365, 666 (1993), PNAs bind specifically and tightly to complementary DNA strands and are not degraded by nucleases. In fact, PNA binds more strongly to DNA than DNA itself does. This is probably because there is no electrostatic repulsion between the two strands, and also the polyamide backbone is more flexible. Because of this, PNA\/DNA duplexes bind under a wider range of stringency conditions than DNA\/DNA duplexes, making it easier to perform multiplex hybridization. Smaller probes can be used than with DNA due to the stronger binding characteristics of PNA:DNA hybrids. In addition, it is more likely that single base mismatches can be determined with PNA\/DNA hybridization because a single mismatch in a PNA\/DNA 15-mer lowers the melting point (T.sub.m) by 8\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 C., vs. 4\u00b0\u201316\u00b0 C. for the DNA\/DNA 15-mer duplex. Also, the absence of charge groups in PNA means that hybridization can be done at low ionic strengths and reduce possible interference by salt during the analysis.","In addition to the foregoing, a polynucleotide can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA. Antisense techniques are discussed, for example, in Okano, J. Neurochem. 56: 560 (1991); \u201cOligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Triple helix formation is discussed in, for instance Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Research 6: 3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241: 456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251: 1360 (1991). Both methods rely on binding of the polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For these techniques, preferred polynucleotides are usually oligonucleotides 20 to 40 bases in length and complementary to either the region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix\u2014see Lee et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241:456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251:1360 (1991)) or to the mRNA itself (antisense\u2014Okano, J. Neurochem. 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxy-nucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988).) Triple helix formation optimally results in a shut-off of RNA transcription from DNA, while antisense RNA hybridization blocks translation of an mRNA molecule into polypeptide. Both techniques are effective in model systems, and the information disclosed herein can be used to design antisense or triple helix polynucleotides in an effort to treat or prevent disease.","The present invention encompasses the addition of a nuclear localization signal, operably linked to the 5\u2032 end, 3\u2032 end, or any location therein, to any of the oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides, triple helix oligonucleotides, ribozymes, PNA oligonucleotides, and\/or polynucleotides, of the present invention. See, for example, G. Cutrona, et al., Nat. Biotech., 18:300\u2013303, (2000); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Polynucleotides of the present invention are also useful in gene therapy. One goal of gene therapy is to insert a normal gene into an organism having a defective gene, in an effort to correct the genetic defect. The polynucleotides disclosed in the present invention offer a means of targeting such genetic defects in a highly accurate manner. Another goal is to insert a new gene that was not present in the host genome, thereby producing a new trait in the host cell. In one example, polynucleotide sequences of the present invention may be used to construct chimeric RNA\/DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequences, specifically designed to induce host cell mismatch repair mechanisms in an organism upon systemic injection, for example (Bartlett, R. J., et al., Nat. Biotech, 18:615\u2013622 (2000), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Such RNA\/DNA oligonucleotides could be designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains, and\/or to introduce desired phenotypes in the host (e.g., introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and\/or prevent a disease symptom and\/or disorder, etc.). Alternatively, the polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be used to construct duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to said sequence, specifically designed to correct genetic defects in certain host strains, and\/or to introduce desired phenotypes into the host (e.g., introduction of a specific polymorphism within an endogenous gene corresponding to a polynucleotide of the present invention that may ameliorate and\/or prevent a disease symptom and\/or disorder, etc). Such methods of using duplex oligonucleotides are known in the art and are encompassed by the present invention (see EP 1007712, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","The polynucleotides are also useful for identifying organisms from minute biological samples. The United States military, for example, is considering the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for identification of its personnel. In this technique, an individual's genomic DNA is digested with one or more restriction enzymes, and probed on a Southern blot to yield unique bands for identifying personnel. This method does not suffer from the current limitations of \u201cDog Tags\u201d which can be lost, switched, or stolen, making positive identification difficult. The polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as additional DNA markers for RFLP.","The polynucleotides of the present invention can also be used as an alternative to RFLP, by determining the actual base-by-base DNA sequence of selected portions of an organisms genome. These sequences can be used to prepare PCR primers for amplifying and isolating such selected DNA, which can then be sequenced. Using this technique, organisms can be identified because each organism will have a unique set of DNA sequences. Once an unique ID database is established for an organism, positive identification of that organism, living or dead, can be made from extremely small tissue samples. Similarly, polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as polymorphic markers, in addition to, the identification of transformed or non-transformed cells and\/or tissues.","There is also a need for reagents capable of identifying the source of a particular tissue. Such need arises, for example, when presented with tissue of unknown origin. Appropriate reagents can comprise, for example, DNA probes or primers specific to particular tissue prepared from the sequences of the present invention. Panels of such reagents can identify tissue by species and\/or by organ type. In a similar fashion, these reagents can be used to screen tissue cultures for contamination. Moreover, as mentioned above, such reagents can be used to screen and\/or identify transformed and non-transformed cells and\/or tissues.","In the very least, the polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on Southern gels, as diagnostic probes for the presence of a specific MRNA in a particular cell type, as a probe to \u201csubtract-out\u201d known sequences in the process of discovering novel polynucleotides, for selecting and making oligomers for attachment to a \u201cgene chip\u201d or other support, to raise anti-DNA antibodies using DNA immunization techniques, and as an antigen to elicit an immune response.","Uses of the Polypeptides","Each of the polypeptides identified herein can be used in numerous ways. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques.","A polypeptide of the present invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using antibody-based techniques. For example, protein expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods. (Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell . Biol. 105:3087\u20133096 (1987).) Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, and radioisotopes, such as iodine (125I, 121I), carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (112In), and technetium (99mTc), and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","In addition to assaying protein levels in a biological sample, proteins can also be detected in vivo by imaging. Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of protein include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR or ESR. For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma.","A protein-specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, 1311, 112In, 99mTc), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) into the mammal. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).)","Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method of a disorder, which involves (a) assaying the expression of a polypeptide of the present invention in cells or body fluid of an individual; (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.","Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose disease. For example, patients can be administered a polypeptide of the present invention in an effort to replace absent or decreased levels of the polypeptide (e.g., insulin), to supplement absent or decreased levels of a different polypeptide (e.g., hemoglobin S for hemoglobin B, SOD, catalase, DNA repair proteins), to inhibit the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., an oncogene or tumor suppressor), to activate the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., by binding to a receptor), to reduce the activity of a membrane bound receptor by competing with it for free ligand (e.g., soluble TNF receptors used in reducing inflammation), or to bring about a desired response (e.g., blood vessel growth inhibition, enhancement of the immune response to proliferative cells or tissues).","Similarly, antibodies directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can also be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose disease. For example, administration of an antibody directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can bind and reduce overproduction of the polypeptide. Similarly, administration of an antibody can activate the polypeptide, such as by binding to a polypeptide bound to a membrane (receptor).","At the very least, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on SDS-PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns using methods well known to those of skill in the art. Polypeptides can also be used to raise antibodies, which in turn are used to measure protein expression from a recombinant cell, as a way of assessing transformation of the host cell. Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to test the following biological activities.","Gene Therapy Methods","Another aspect of the present invention is to gene therapy methods for treating or preventing disorders, diseases and conditions. The gene therapy methods relate to the introduction of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA and antisense DNA or RNA) sequences into an animal to achieve expression of a polypeptide of the present invention. This method requires a polynucleotide which codes for a polypeptide of the invention that operatively linked to a promoter and any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques are known in the art, see, for example, W090\/11092, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Thus, for example, cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide of the invention ex vivo, with the engineered cells then being provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well-known in the art. For example, see Belldegrun et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 85:207\u2013216 (1993); Ferrantini et al., Cancer Research, 53:107\u20131112 (1993); Ferrantini et al., J. Immunology 153: 4604\u20134615 (1994); Kaido, T., et al., Int. J. Cancer 60: 221\u2013229 (1995); Ogura et al., Cancer Research 50: 5102\u20135106 (1990); Santodonato, et al., Human Gene Therapy 7:1\u201310 (1996); Santodonato, et al., Gene Therapy 4:1246\u20131255 (1997); and Zhang, et al., Cancer Gene Therapy 3: 31\u201338 (1996)), which are herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, the cells which are engineered are arterial cells. The arterial cells may be reintroduced into the patient through direct injection to the artery, the tissues surrounding the artery, or through catheter injection.","As discussed in more detail below, the polynucleotide constructs can be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal, such as, injection into the interstitial space of tissues (heart, muscle, skin, lung, liver, and the like). The polynucleotide constructs may be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.","In one embodiment, the polynucleotide of the invention is delivered as a naked polynucleotide. The term \u201cnaked\u201d polynucleotide, DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However, the polynucleotides of the invention can also be delivered in liposome formulations and lipofectin formulations and the like can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference.","The polynucleotide vector constructs of the invention used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Appropriate vectors include pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia; and pEF1\/V5, pcDNA3.1, and pRc\/CMV2 available from Invitrogen. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.","Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of polynucleotide sequence of the invention. Suitable promoters include adenoviral promoters, such as the adenoviral major late promoter; or heterologous promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter; the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) promoter; inducible promoters, such as the MMT promoter, the metallothionein promoter; heat shock promoters; the albumin promoter; the ApoAI promoter; human globin promoters; viral thymidine kinase promoters, such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter; retroviral LTRs; the b-actin promoter; and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter for the polynucleotides of the invention.","Unlike other gene therapy techniques, one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non-replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.","The polynucleotide construct of the invention can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular, fluid, mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues, elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers, collagen fibers of fibrous tissues, or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent, non-dividing cells which are differentiated, although delivery and expression may be achieved in non-differentiated or less completely differentiated cells, such as, for example, stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.","For the naked nucleic acid sequence injection, an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 mg\/kg body weight to about 50 mg\/kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration.","The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However, other parenteral routes may also be used, such as, inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues, throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition, naked DNA constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.","The naked polynucleotides are delivered by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, direct needle injection at the delivery site, intravenous injection, topical administration, catheter infusion, and so-called \u201cgene guns\u201d. These delivery methods are known in the art.","The constructs may also be delivered with delivery vehicles such as viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin, precipitating agents, etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.","In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide constructs of the invention are complexed in a liposome preparation. Liposomal preparations for use in the instant invention include cationic (positively charged), anionic (negatively charged) and neutral preparations. However, cationic liposomes are particularly preferred because a tight charge complex can be formed between the cationic liposome and the polyanionic nucleic acid. Cationic liposomes have been shown to mediate intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:7413\u20137416 (1987), which is herein incorporated by reference); mRNA (Malone et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:6077\u20136081 (1989), which is herein incorporated by reference); and purified transcription factors (Debs et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265:10189\u201310192 (1990), which is herein incorporated by reference), in functional form.","Cationic liposomes are readily available. For example, N[1-2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-triethylammonium (DOTMA) liposomes are particularly useful and are available under the trademark Lipofectin, from GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, N.Y. (See, also, Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 84:7413\u20137416 (1987), which is herein incorporated by reference). Other commercially available liposomes include transfectace (DDAB\/DOPE) and DOTAP\/DOPE (Boehringer).","Other cationic liposomes can be prepared from readily available materials using techniques well known in the art. See, e.g. PCT Publication NO:WO 90\/11092 (which is herein incorporated by reference) for a description of the synthesis of DOTAP (1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio)propane) liposomes. Preparation of DOTMA liposomes is explained in the literature, see, e.g., Feigner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:7413\u20137417, which is herein incorporated by reference. Similar methods can be used to prepare liposomes from other cationic lipid materials.","Similarly, anionic and neutral liposomes are readily available, such as from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, Ala.), or can be easily prepared using readily available materials. Such materials include phosphatidyl, choline, cholesterol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG), dioleoylphoshatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE), among others. These materials can also be mixed with the DOTMA and DOTAP starting materials in appropriate ratios. Methods for making liposomes using these materials are well known in the art.","For example, commercially dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG), and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) can be used in various combinations to make conventional liposomes, with or without the addition of cholesterol. Thus, for example, DOPG\/DOPC vesicles can be prepared by drying 50 mg each of DOPG and DOPC under a stream of nitrogen gas into a sonication vial. The sample is placed under a vacuum pump overnight and is hydrated the following day with deionized water. The sample is then sonicated for 2 hours in a capped vial, using a Heat Systems model 350 sonicator equipped with an inverted cup (bath type) probe at the maximum setting while the bath is circulated at 15EC. Alternatively, negatively charged vesicles can be prepared without sonication to produce multilamellar vesicles or by extrusion through nucleopore membranes to produce unilamellar vesicles of discrete size. Other methods are known and available to those of skill in the art.","The liposomes can comprise multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), or large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), with SUVs being preferred. The various liposome-nucleic acid complexes are prepared using methods well known in the art. See, e.g., Straubinger et al., Methods of Immunology, 101:512\u2013527 (1983), which is herein incorporated by reference. For example, MLVs containing nucleic acid can be prepared by depositing a thin film of phospholipid on the walls of a glass tube and subsequently hydrating with a solution of the material to be encapsulated. SUVs are prepared by extended sonication of MLVs to produce a homogeneous population of unilamellar liposomes. The material to be entrapped is added to a suspension of preformed MLVs and then sonicated. When using liposomes containing cationic lipids, the dried lipid film is resuspended in an appropriate solution such as sterile water or an isotonic buffer solution such as 10 mM Tris\/NaCl, sonicated, and then the preformed liposomes are mixed directly with the DNA. The liposome and DNA form a very stable complex due to binding of the positively charged liposomes to the cationic DNA. SUVs find use with small nucleic acid fragments. LUVs are prepared by a number of methods, well known in the art. Commonly used methods include Ca2+-EDTA chelation (Papahadjopoulos et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 394:483 (1975); Wilson et al., Cell, 17:77 (1979)); ether injection (Deamer et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 443:629 (1976); Ostro et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 76:836 (1977); Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76:3348 (1979)); detergent dialysis (Enoch et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 76:145 (1979)); and reverse-phase evaporation (REV) (Fraley et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255:10431 (1980); Szoka et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 75:145 (1978); Schaefer-Ridder et al., Science, 215:166 (1982)), which are herein incorporated by reference.","Generally, the ratio of DNA to liposomes will be from about 10:1 to about 1:10. Preferably, the ration will be from about 5:1 to about 1:5. More preferably, the ration will be about 3:1 to about 1:3. Still more preferably, the ratio will be about 1:1.","U.S. Pat. No.: 5,676,954 (which is herein incorporated by reference) reports on the injection of genetic material, complexed with cationic liposomes carriers, into mice. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,355, 4,946,787, 5,049,386, 5,459,127, 5,589,466, 5,693,622, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, and international publication NO:WO 94\/9469 (which are herein incorporated by reference) provide cationic lipids for use in transfecting DNA into cells and mammals. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,589,466, 5,693,622, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, and international publication NO:WO 94\/9469 (which are herein incorporated by reference) provide methods for delivering DNA-cationic lipid complexes to mammals.","In certain embodiments, cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, using a retroviral particle containing RNA which comprises a sequence encoding polypeptides of the invention. Retroviruses from which the retroviral plasmid vectors may be derived include, but are not limited to, Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, spleen necrosis virus, Rous sarcoma Virus, Harvey Sarcoma Virus, avian leukosis virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus, and mammary tumor virus.","The retroviral plasmid vector is employed to transduce packaging cell lines to form producer cell lines. Examples of packaging cells which may be transfected include, but are not limited to, the PE501, PA317, R-2, R-AM, PA12, T19-14X, VT-19-17-H2, RCRE, RCRIP, GP+E-86, GP+envAm12, and DAN cell lines as described in Miller, Human Gene Therapy , 1:5\u201314 (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The vector may transduce the packaging cells through any means known in the art. Such means include, but are not limited to, electroporation, the use of liposomes, and CaPO4 precipitation. In one alternative, the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a liposome, or coupled to a lipid, and then administered to a host.","The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector particles which include polynucleotide encoding polypeptides of the invention. Such retroviral vector particles then may be employed, to transduce eukaryotic cells, either in vitro or in vivo. The transduced eukaryotic cells will express polypeptides of the invention.","In certain other embodiments, cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, with polynucleotides of the invention contained in an adenovirus vector. Adenovirus can be manipulated such that it encodes and expresses polypeptides of the invention, and at the same time is inactivated in terms of its ability to replicate in a normal lytic viral life cycle. Adenovirus expression is achieved without integration of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome, thereby alleviating concerns about insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore, adenoviruses have been used as live enteric vaccines for many years with an excellent safety profile (Schwartzet al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 109:233\u2013238 (1974)). Finally, adenovirus mediated gene transfer has been demonstrated in a number of instances including transfer of alpha-1-antitrypsin and CFTR to the lungs of cotton rats (Rosenfeld et al., Science, 252:431\u2013434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell, 68:143\u2013155 (1992)). Furthermore, extensive studies to attempt to establish adenovirus as a causative agent in human cancer were uniformly negative (Green et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76:6606 (1979)).","Suitable adenoviral vectors useful in the present invention are described, for example, in Kozarsky and Wilson, Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel., 3:499\u2013503 (1993); Rosenfeld et al., Cell , 68:143\u2013155 (1992); Engelhardt et al., Human Genet. Ther., 4:759\u2013769 (1993); Yang et al., Nature Genet., 7:362\u2013369 (1994); Wilson et al., Nature, 365:691\u2013692 (1993); and U.S. Pat. No.: 5,652,224, which are herein incorporated by reference. For example, the adenovirus vector Ad2 is useful and can be grown in human 293 cells. These cells contain the E1 region of adenovirus and constitutively express E1a and E1b, which complement the defective adenoviruses by providing the products of the genes deleted from the vector. In addition to Ad2, other varieties of adenovirus (e.g., Ad3, Ad5, and Ad7) are also useful in the present invention.","Preferably, the adenoviruses used in the present invention are replication deficient. Replication deficient adenoviruses require the aid of a helper virus and\/or packaging cell line to form infectious particles. The resulting virus is capable of infecting cells and can express a polynucleotide of interest which is operably linked to a promoter, but cannot replicate in most cells. Replication deficient adenoviruses may be deleted in one or more of all or a portion of the following genes: E1a, E1b, E3, E4, E2a, or L1 through L5.","In certain other embodiments, the cells are engineered, ex vivo or in vivo, using an adeno-associated virus (AAV). AAVs are naturally occurring defective viruses that require helper viruses to produce infectious particles (Muzyczka, Curr. Topics in Microbiol. Immunol., 158:97 (1992)). It is also one of the few viruses that may integrate its DNA into non-dividing cells. Vectors containing as little as 300 base pairs of AAV can be packaged and can integrate, but space for exogenous DNA is limited to about 4.5 kb. Methods for producing and using such AAVs are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,139,941, 5,173,414, 5,354,678, 5,436,146, 5,474,935, 5,478,745, and 5,589,377.","For example, an appropriate AAV vector for use in the present invention will include all the sequences necessary for DNA replication, encapsidation, and host-cell integration. The polynucleotide construct containing polynucleotides of the invention is inserted into the AAV vector using standard cloning methods, such as those found in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1989). The recombinant AAV vector is then transfected into packaging cells which are infected with a helper virus, using any standard technique, including lipofection, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, etc. Appropriate helper viruses include adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses, vaccinia viruses, or herpes viruses. Once the packaging cells are transfected and infected, they will produce infectious AAV viral particles which contain the polynucleotide construct of the invention. These viral particles are then used to transduce eukaryotic cells, either ex vivo or in vivo. The transduced cells will contain the polynucleotide construct integrated into its genome, and will express the desired gene product.","Another method of gene therapy involves operably associating heterologous control regions and endogenous polynucleotide sequences (e.g. encoding the polypeptide sequence of interest) via homologous recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.: 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; International Publication NO:WO 96\/29411, published Sep. 26, 1996; International Publication NO:WO 94\/12650, published Aug. 4, 1994; Koller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., Nature, 342:435\u2013438 (1989). This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells, but which is not normally expressed in the cells, or is expressed at a lower level than desired.","Polynucleotide constructs are made, using standard techniques known in the art, which contain the promoter with targeting sequences flanking the promoter. Suitable promoters are described herein. The targeting sequence is sufficiently complementary to an endogenous sequence to permit homologous recombination of the promoter-targeting sequence with the endogenous sequence. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5\u2032 end of the desired endogenous polynucleotide sequence so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination.","The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably, the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Preferably, the 3\u2032 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5\u2032 end of the amplified promoter and the 5\u2032 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3\u2032 end of the amplified promoter. The amplified promoter and targeting sequences are digested and ligated together.","The promoter-targeting sequence construct is delivered to the cells, either as naked polynucleotide, or in conjunction with transfection-facilitating agents, such as liposomes, viral sequences, viral particles, whole viruses, lipofection, precipitating agents, etc., described in more detail above. The P promoter-targeting sequence can be delivered by any method, included direct needle injection, intravenous injection, topical administration, catheter infusion, particle accelerators, etc. The methods are described in more detail below.","The promoter-targeting sequence construct is taken up by cells. Homologous recombination between the construct and the endogenous sequence takes place, such that an endogenous sequence is placed under the control of the promoter. The promoter then drives the expression of the endogenous sequence.","The polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention may be administered along with other polynucleotides encoding angiogenic proteins. Angiogenic proteins include, but are not limited to, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, VEGF-1, VEGF-2 (VEGF-C), VEGF-3 (VEGF-B), epidermal growth factor alpha and beta, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin like growth factor, colony stimulating factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte\/macrophage colony stimulating factor, and nitric oxide synthase.","Preferably, the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention contains a secretory signal sequence that facilitates secretion of the protein. Typically, the signal sequence is positioned in the coding region of the polynucleotide to be expressed towards or at the 5\u2032 end of the coding region. The signal sequence may be homologous or heterologous to the polynucleotide of interest and may be homologous or heterologous to the cells to be transfected. Additionally, the signal sequence may be chemically synthesized using methods known in the art.","Any mode of administration of any of the above-described polynucleotides constructs can be used so long as the mode results in the expression of one or more molecules in an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect. This includes direct needle injection, systemic injection, catheter infusion, biolistic injectors, particle accelerators (i.e., \u201cgene guns\u201d), gelfoam sponge depots, other commercially available depot materials, osmotic pumps (e.g., Alza minipumps), oral or suppositorial solid (tablet or pill) pharmaceutical formulations, and decanting or topical applications during surgery. For example, direct injection of naked calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid into rat liver and rat spleen or a protein-coated plasmid into the portal vein has resulted in gene expression of the foreign gene in the rat livers. (Kaneda et al., Science, 243:375 (1989)).","A preferred method of local administration is by direct injection. Preferably, a recombinant molecule of the present invention complexed with a delivery vehicle is administered by direct injection into or locally within the area of arteries. Administration of a composition locally within the area of arteries refers to injecting the composition centimeters and preferably, millimeters within arteries.","Another method of local administration is to contact a polynucleotide construct of the present invention in or around a surgical wound. For example, a patient can undergo surgery and the polynucleotide construct can be coated on the surface of tissue inside the wound or the construct can be injected into areas of tissue inside the wound.","Therapeutic compositions useful in systemic administration, include recombinant molecules of the present invention complexed to a targeted delivery vehicle of the present invention. Suitable delivery vehicles for use with systemic administration comprise liposomes comprising ligands for targeting the vehicle to a particular site.","Preferred methods of systemic administration, include intravenous injection, aerosol, oral and percutaneous (topical) delivery. Intravenous injections can be performed using methods standard in the art. Aerosol delivery can also be performed using methods standard in the art (see, for example, Stribling et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 189:11277\u201311281 (1992), which is incorporated herein by reference). Oral delivery can be performed by complexing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention to a carrier capable of withstanding degradation by digestive enzymes in the gut of an animal. Examples of such carriers, include plastic capsules or tablets, such as those known in the art. Topical delivery can be performed by mixing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention with a lipophilic reagent (e.g., DMSO) that is capable of passing into the skin.","Determining an effective amount of substance to be delivered can depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the chemical structure and biological activity of the substance, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, and the route of administration. The frequency of treatments depends upon a number of factors, such as the amount of polynucleotide constructs administered per dose, as well as the health and history of the subject. The precise amount, number of doses, and timing of doses will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian. Therapeutic compositions of the present invention can be administered to any animal, preferably to mammals and birds. Preferred mammals include humans, dogs, cats, mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, cattle, horses and pigs, with humans being particularly preferred.","Biological Activities","The polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. If these polynucleotides and polypeptides do exhibit activity in a particular assay, it is likely that these molecules may be involved in the diseases associated with the biological activity. Thus, the polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists could be used to treat the associated disease.","Cardiovascular Disorders","Polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the invention may be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose cardiovascular diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, including peripheral artery disease, such as limb ischemia.","Cardiovascular diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions include cardiovascular abnormalities, such as arterio-arterial fistula, arteriovenous fistula, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, congenital heart defects, pulmonary atresia, and Scimitar Syndrome.

Moreover, the polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention can be used as an antigen in a vaccine to raise an immune response against infectious disease.","Binding Activity","A polypeptide of the present invention may be used to screen for molecules that bind to the polypeptide or for molecules to which the polypeptide binds. The binding of the polypeptide and the molecule may activate (agonist), increase, inhibit (antagonist), or decrease activity of the polypeptide or the molecule bound. Examples of such molecules include antibodies, oligonucleotides, proteins (e.g., receptors), or small molecules.","Preferably, the molecule is closely related to the natural ligand of the polypeptide, e.g., a fragment of the ligand, or a natural substrate, a ligand, a structural or functional mimetic. (See, Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 1(2):Chapter 5 (1991).) Similarly, the molecule can be closely related to the natural receptor to which the polypeptide binds, or at least, a fragment of the receptor capable of being bound by the polypeptide (e.g., active site). In either case, the molecule can be rationally designed using known techniques.","Preferably, the screening for these molecules involves producing appropriate cells which express the polypeptide, either as a secreted protein or on the cell membrane. Preferred cells include cells from mammals, yeast, , or . Cells expressing the polypeptide (or cell membrane containing the expressed polypeptide) are then preferably contacted with a test compound potentially containing the molecule to observe binding, stimulation, or inhibition of activity of either the polypeptide or the molecule.","The assay may simply test binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide, wherein binding is detected by a label, or in an assay involving competition with a labeled competitor. Further, the assay may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by binding to the polypeptide.","Alternatively, the assay can be carried out using cell-free preparations, polypeptide\/molecule affixed to a solid support, chemical libraries, or natural product mixtures. The assay may also simply comprise the steps of mixing a candidate compound with a solution containing a polypeptide, measuring polypeptide\/molecule activity or binding, and comparing the polypeptide\/molecule activity or binding to a standard.","Preferably, an ELISA assay can measure polypeptide level or activity in a sample (e.g., biological sample) using a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The antibody can measure polypeptide level or activity by either binding, directly or indirectly, to the polypeptide or by competing with the polypeptide for a substrate.","Additionally, the receptor to which a polypeptide of the invention binds can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, ligand panning and FACS sorting (Coligan, et al., Current Protocols in Immun., 1(2), Chapter 5, (1991)). For example, expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the polypeptides, for example, NIH3T3 cells which are known to contain multiple receptors for the FGF family proteins, and SC-3 cells, and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the polypeptides. Transfected cells which are grown on glass slides are exposed to the polypeptide of the present invention, after they have been labeled. The polypeptides can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site-specific protein kinase.","Following fixation and incubation, the slides are subjected to auto-radiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub-pools are prepared and re-transfected using an iterative sub-pooling and re-screening process, eventually yielding a single clones that encodes the putative receptor.","As an alternative approach for receptor identification, the labeled polypeptides can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross-linked material is resolved by PAGE analysis and exposed to X-ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptors of the polypeptides can be excised, resolved into peptide fragments, and subjected to protein microsequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from microsequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the genes encoding the putative receptors.","Moreover, the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d) may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention thereby effectively generating agonists and antagonists of polypeptides of the invention. See generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793, 5,811,238, 5,830,721, 5,834,252, and 5,837,458, and Patten, P. A., et al., Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8:724\u201333 (1997); Harayama, S.

Biotechniques 24(2):308\u201313 (1998) (each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference). In one embodiment, alteration of polynucleotides and corresponding polypeptides of the invention may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments into a desired polynucleotide sequence of the invention molecule by homologous, or site-specific, recombination. In another embodiment, polynucleotides and corresponding polypeptides of the invention may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment, one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc., of the polypeptides of the invention may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules. In preferred embodiments, the heterologous molecules are family members. In further preferred embodiments, the heterologous molecule is a growth factor such as, for example, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), TGF-beta, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, activins A and B, decapentaplegic(dpp), 60A, OP-2, dorsalin, growth differentiation factors (GDFs), nodal, MIS, inhibin-alpha, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TGF-beta5, and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).","Other preferred fragments are biologically active fragments of the polypeptides of the invention. Biologically active fragments are those exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical, to an activity of the polypeptide. The biological activity of the fragments may include an improved desired activity, or a decreased undesirable activity.","Additionally, this invention provides a method of screening compounds to identify those which modulate the action of the polypeptide of the present invention. An example of such an assay comprises combining a mammalian fibroblast cell, a the polypeptide of the present invention, the compound to be screened and 3[H] thymidine under cell culture conditions where the fibroblast cell would normally proliferate. A control assay may be performed in the absence of the compound to be screened and compared to the amount of fibroblast proliferation in the presence of the compound to determine if the compound stimulates proliferation by determining the uptake of 3[H] thymidine in each case. The amount of fibroblast cell proliferation is measured by liquid scintillation chromatography which measures the incorporation of 3[H] thymidine. Both agonist and antagonist compounds may be identified by this procedure.","In another method, a mammalian cell or membrane preparation expressing a receptor for a polypeptide of the present invention is incubated with a labeled polypeptide of the present invention in the presence of the compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured. Alternatively, the response of a known second messenger system following interaction of a compound to be screened and the receptor is measured and the ability of the compound to bind to the receptor and elicit a second messenger response is measured to determine if the compound is a potential agonist or antagonist. Such second messenger systems include but are not limited to, cAMP guanylate cyclase, ion channels or phosphoinositide hydrolysis.","All of these above assays can be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers. The molecules discovered using these assays can be used to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose disease or to bring about a particular result in a patient (e.g., blood vessel growth) by activating or inhibiting the polypeptide\/molecule. Moreover, the assays can discover agents which may inhibit or enhance the production of the polypeptides of the invention from suitably manipulated cells or tissues. Therefore, the invention includes a method of identifying compounds which bind to the polypeptides of the invention comprising the steps of: (a) incubating a candidate binding compound with the polypeptide; and (b) determining if binding has occurred. Moreover, the invention includes a method of identifying agonists\/antagonists comprising the steps of: (a) incubating a candidate compound with the polypeptide, (b) assaying a biological activity, and (b) determining if a biological activity of the polypeptide has been altered.","Also, one could identify molecules bind a polypeptide of the invention experimentally by using the beta-pleated sheet regions contained in the polypeptide sequence of the protein. Accordingly, specific embodiments of the invention are directed to polynucleotides encoding polypeptides which comprise, or alternatively consist of, the amino acid sequence of each beta pleated sheet regions in a disclosed polypeptide sequence. Additional embodiments of the invention are directed to polynucleotides encoding polypeptides which comprise, or alternatively consist of, any combination or all of contained in the polypeptide sequences of the invention. Additional preferred embodiments of the invention are directed to polypeptides which comprise, or alternatively consist of, the amino acid sequence of each of the beta pleated sheet regions in one of the polypeptide sequences of the invention. Additional embodiments of the invention are directed to polypeptides which comprise, or alternatively consist of, any combination or all of the beta pleated sheet regions in one of the polypeptide sequences of the invention.","Targeted Delivery","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of delivering compositions to targeted cells expressing a receptor for a polypeptide of the invention, or cells expressing a cell bound form of a polypeptide of the invention.","As discussed herein, polypeptides or antibodies of the invention may be associated with heterologous polypeptides, heterologous nucleic acids, toxins, or prodrugs via hydrophobic, hydrophilic, ionic and\/or covalent interactions. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific delivery of compositions of the invention to cells by administering polypeptides of the invention (including antibodies) that are associated with heterologous polypeptides or nucleic acids. In one example, the invention provides a method for delivering a therapeutic protein into the targeted cell. In another example, the invention provides a method for delivering a single stranded nucleic acid (e.g., antisense or ribozymes) or double stranded nucleic acid (e.g., DNA that can integrate into the cell's genome or replicate episomally and that can be transcribed) into the targeted cell.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells (e.g., the destruction of tumor cells) by administering polypeptides of the invention (e.g., polypeptides of the invention or antibodies of the invention) in association with toxins or cytotoxic prodrugs.","By \u201ctoxin\u201d is meant compounds that bind and activate endogenous cytotoxic effector systems, radioisotopes, holotoxins, modified toxins, catalytic subunits of toxins, or any molecules or enzymes not normally present in or on the surface of a cell that under defined conditions cause the cell's death. Toxins that may be used according to the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, radioisotopes known in the art, compounds such as, for example, antibodies (or complement fixing containing portions thereof) that bind an inherent or induced endogenous cytotoxic effector system, thymidine kinase, endonuclease, RNAse, alpha toxin, ricin, abrin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, diphtheria toxin, saporin, momordin, gelonin, pokeweed antiviral protein, alpha-sarcin and cholera toxin. By \u201ccytotoxic prodrug\u201d is meant a non-toxic compound that is converted by an enzyme, normally present in the cell, into a cytotoxic compound. Cytotoxic prodrugs that may be used according to the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, glutamyl derivatives of benzoic acid mustard alkylating agent, phosphate derivatives of etoposide or mitomycin C, cytosine arabinoside, daunorubisin, and phenoxyacetamide derivatives of doxorubicin.","Drug Screening","Further contemplated is the use of the polypeptides of the present invention, or the polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides, to screen for molecules which modify the activities of the polypeptides of the present invention. Such a method would include contacting the polypeptide of the present invention with a selected compound(s) suspected of having antagonist or agonist activity, and assaying the activity of these polypeptides following binding.","This invention is particularly useful for screening therapeutic compounds by using the polypeptides of the present invention, or binding fragments thereof, in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The polypeptide or fragment employed in such a test may be affixed to a solid support, expressed on a cell surface, free in solution, or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the polypeptide or fragment. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells in competitive binding assays. One may measure, for example, the formulation of complexes between the agent being tested and a polypeptide of the present invention.","Thus, the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which affect activities mediated by the polypeptides of the present invention. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with a polypeptide of the present invention or a fragment thereof and assaying for the presence of a complex between the agent and the polypeptide or a fragment thereof, by methods well known in the art. In such a competitive binding assay, the agents to screen are typically labeled. Following incubation, free agent is separated from that present in bound form, and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of a particular agent to bind to the polypeptides of the present invention.","Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to the polypeptides of the present invention, and is described in great detail in European Patent Application 84\/03564, published on Sep. 13, 1984, which is incorporated herein by reference herein. Briefly stated, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with polypeptides of the present invention and washed. Bound polypeptides are then detected by methods well known in the art. Purified polypeptides are coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition, non-neutralizing antibodies may be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support.","This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding polypeptides of the present invention specifically compete with a test compound for binding to the polypeptides or fragments thereof. In this manner, the antibodies are used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic epitopes with a polypeptide of the invention.","The human HGPR4 polypeptides and\/or peptides of the present invention, or immunogenic fragments or oligopeptides thereof, can be used for screening therapeutic drugs or compounds in a variety of drug screening techniques. The fragment employed in such a screening assay may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The reduction or abolition of activity of the formation of binding complexes between the ion channel protein and the agent being tested can be measured. Thus, the present invention provides a method for screening or assessing a plurality of compounds for their specific binding affinity with a HGPR4 polypeptide, or a bindable peptide fragment, of this invention, comprising providing a plurality of compounds, combining the HGPR4 polypeptide, or a bindable peptide fragment, with each of a plurality of compounds for a time sufficient to allow binding under suitable conditions and detecting binding of the HGPR4 polypeptide or peptide to each of the plurality of test compounds, thereby identifying the compounds that specifically bind to the HGPR4 polypeptide or peptide.","Methods of identifying compounds that modulate the activity of the novel human HGPR4 polypeptides and\/or peptides are provided by the present invention and comprise combining a potential or candidate compound or drug modulator of glycine receptor biological activity with an HGPR4 polypeptide or peptide, for example, the HGPR4 amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, and measuring an effect of the candidate compound or drug modulator on the biological activity of the HGPR4 polypeptide or peptide. Such measurable effects include, for example, physical binding interaction; the ability to cleave a suitable glycine receptor substrate; effects on native and cloned HGPR4-expressing cell line; and effects of modulators or other glycine receptor-mediated physiological measures.","Another method of identifying compounds that modulate the biological activity of the novel HGPR4 polypeptides of the present invention comprises combining a potential or candidate compound or drug modulator of a glycine receptor biological activity with a host cell that expresses the HGPR4 polypeptide and measuring an effect of the candidate compound or drug modulator on the biological activity of the HGPR4 polypeptide. The host cell can also be capable of being induced to express the HGPR4 polypeptide, e.g., via inducible expression. Physiological effects of a given modulator candidate on the HGPR4 polypeptide can also be measured. Thus, cellular assays for particular glycine receptor modulators may be either direct measurement or quantification of the physical biological activity of the HGPR4 polypeptide, or they may be measurement or quantification of a physiological effect. Such methods preferably employ a HGPR4 polypeptide as described herein, or an overexpressed recombinant HGPR4 polypeptide in suitable host cells containing an expression vector as described herein, wherein the HGPR4 polypeptide is expressed, overexpressed, or undergoes upregulated expression.","Another aspect of the present invention embraces a method of screening for a compound that is capable of modulating the biological activity of a HGPR4 polypeptide, comprising providing a host cell containing an expression vector harboring a nucleic acid sequence encoding a HGPR4 polypeptide, or a functional peptide or portion thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:2); determining the biological activity of the expressed HGPR4 polypeptide in the absence of a modulator compound; contacting the cell with the modulator compound and determining the biological activity of the expressed HGPR4 polypeptide in the presence of the modulator compound. In such a method, a difference between the activity of the HGPR4 polypeptide in the presence of the modulator compound and in the absence of the modulator compound indicates a modulating effect of the compound.","Essentially any chemical compound can be employed as a potential modulator or ligand in the assays according to the present invention. Compounds tested as glycine receptor modulators can be any small chemical compound, or biological entity (e.g., protein, sugar, nucleic acid, lipid). Test compounds will typically be small chemical molecules and peptides. Generally, the compounds used as potential modulators can be dissolved in aqueous or organic (e.g., DMSO-based) solutions. The assays are designed to screen large chemical libraries by automating the assay steps and providing compounds from any convenient source. Assays are typically run in parallel, for example, in microtiter formats on microtiter plates in robotic assays. There are many suppliers of chemical compounds, including Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.), Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), Fluka Chemika-Biochemica Analytika (Buchs, Switzerland), for example. Also, compounds may be synthesized by methods known in the art.","High throughput screening methodologies are particularly envisioned for the detection of modulators of the novel HGPR4 polynucleotides and polypeptides described herein. Such high throughput screening methods typically involve providing a combinatorial chemical or peptide library containing a large number of potential therapeutic compounds (e.g., ligand or modulator compounds). Such combinatorial chemical libraries or ligand libraries are then screened in one or more assays to identify those library members (e.g., particular chemical species or subclasses) that display a desired characteristic activity. The compounds so identified can serve as conventional lead compounds, or can themselves be used as potential or actual therapeutics.","A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated either by chemical synthesis or biological synthesis, by combining a number of chemical building blocks (i.e., reagents such as amino acids). As an example, a linear combinatorial library, e.g., a polypeptide or peptide library, is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks in every possible way for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide or peptide compound). Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks.","The preparation and screening of combinatorial chemical libraries is well known to those having skill in the pertinent art. Combinatorial libraries include, without limitation, peptide libraries (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,175; Furka, 1991, 37:487\u2013493; and Houghton et al., 1991, 354:84\u201388). Other chemistries for generating chemical diversity libraries can also be used. Nonlimiting examples of chemical diversity library chemistries include, peptoids (PCT Publication No. WO 91\/019735), encoded peptides (PCT Publication No. WO 93\/20242), random bio-oligomers (PCT Publication No. WO 92\/00091), benzodiazepines (U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and dipeptides (Hobbs et al., 1993, 90:6909\u20136913), vinylogous polypeptides (Hagihara et al., 1992, 114:6568), nonpeptidal peptidomimetics with glucose scaffolding (Hirschmann et al., 1992, 114:9217\u20139218), analogous organic synthesis of small compound libraries (Chen et al., 1994, 116:2661), oligocarbamates (Cho et al., 1993, 261:1303), and\/or peptidyl phosphonates (Campbell et al., 1994, 59:658), nucleic acid libraries (see Ausubel, Berger and Sambrook, all supra), peptide nucleic acid libraries (U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,083), antibody libraries (e.g., Vaughn et al., 1996, 14(3):309\u2013314) and PCT\/US96\/10287), carbohydrate libraries (e.g., Liang et al., 1996, 274\u20131520\u20131522) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,853), small organic molecule libraries (e.g., benzodiazepines, Baum C&EN, Jan. 18, 1993, page 33; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514; isoprenoids, U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,588; thiazolidinones and metathiazanones, U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,974; pyrrolidines, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,735 and 5,519,134; morpholino compounds, U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,337; and the like).","Devices for the preparation of combinatorial libraries are commercially available (e.g., 357 MPS, 390 MPS, Advanced Chem Tech, Louisville Ky.; Symphony, Rainin, Woburn, Mass.; 433A Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.; 9050 Plus, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). In addition, a large number of combinatorial libraries are commercially available (e.g., ComGenex, Princeton, N.J.; Asinex, Moscow, Russia; Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; ChemStar, Ltd., Moscow, Russia; 3D Pharmaceuticals, Exton, Pa.; Martek Biosciences, Columbia, Md., and the like).","In one embodiment, the invention provides solid phase based in vitro assays in a high throughput format, where the cell or tissue expressing an ion channel is attached to a solid phase substrate. In such high throughput assays, it is possible to screen up to several thousand different modulators or ligands in a single day. In particular, each well of a microtiter plate can be used to perform a separate assay against a selected potential modulator, or, if concentration or incubation time effects are to be observed, every 5\u201310 wells can test a single modulator. Thus, a single standard microtiter plate can assay about 96 modulators. If 1536 well plates are used, then a single plate can easily assay from about 100 to about 1500 different compounds. It is possible to assay several different plates per day; thus, for example, assay screens for up to about 6,000\u201320,000 different compounds are possible using the described integrated systems.","In another of its aspects, the present invention encompasses screening and small molecule (e.g., drug) detection assays which involve the detection or identification of small molecules that can bind to a given protein, i.e., a HGPR4 polypeptide or peptide. Particularly preferred are assays suitable for high throughput screening methodologies.","In such binding-based detection, identification, or screening assays, a functional assay is not typically required. All that is needed is a target protein, preferably substantially purified, and a library or panel of compounds (e.g., ligands, drugs, small molecules) or biological entities to be screened or assayed for binding to the protein target. Preferably, most small molecules that bind to the target protein will modulate activity in some manner, due to preferential, higher affinity binding to functional areas or sites on the protein.","An example of such an assay is the fluorescence based thermal shift assay (3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 3DP, Exton, Pa.) as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,020,141 and 6,036,920 to Pantoliano et al.; see also, J. Zimmerman, 2000, 20(8)). The assay allows the detection of small molecules (e.g., drugs, ligands) that bind to expressed, and preferably purified, ion channel polypeptide based on affinity of binding determinations by analyzing thermal unfolding curves of protein-drug or ligand complexes. The drugs or binding molecules determined by this technique can be further assayed, if desired, by methods, such as those described herein, to determine if the molecules affect or modulate function or activity of the target protein.","To purify a HGPR4 polypeptide or peptide to measure a biological binding or ligand binding activity, the source may be a whole cell lysate that can be prepared by successive freeze-thaw cycles (e.g., one to three) in the presence of standard protease inhibitors. The HGPR4 polypeptide may be partially or completely purified by standard protein purification methods, e.g., affinity chromatography using specific antibody described infra, or by ligands specific for an epitope tag engineered into the recombinant HGPR4 polypeptide molecule, also as described herein. Binding activity can then be measured as described.","Compounds which are identified according to the methods provided herein, and which modulate or regulate the biological activity or physiology of the HGPR4 polypeptides according to the present invention are a preferred embodiment of this invention. It is contemplated that such modulatory compounds may be employed in treatment and therapeutic methods for treating a condition that is mediated by the novel HGPR4 polypeptides by administering to an individual in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of the compound identified by the methods described herein.","In addition, the present invention provides methods for treating an individual in need of such treatment for a disease, disorder, or condition that is mediated by the HGPR4 polypeptides of the invention, comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of the HGPR4-modulating compound identified by a method provided herein.","Antisense And Ribozyme (Antagonists)","In specific embodiments, antagonists according to the present invention are nucleic acids corresponding to the sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X, or the complementary strand thereof, and\/or to nucleotide sequences contained a deposited clone. In one embodiment, antisense sequence is generated internally by the organism, in another embodiment, the antisense sequence is separately administered (see, for example, O'Connor, Neurochem., 56:560 (1991). Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA, or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example, in Okano, Neurochem., 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Triple helix formation is discussed in, for instance, Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science, 241:456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science, 251:1300 (1991). The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA.","For example, the use of c-myc and c-myb antisense RNA constructs to inhibit the growth of the non-lymphocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and other cell lines was previously described. (Wickstrom et al. (1988); Anfossi et al. (1989)). These experiments were performed in vitro by incubating cells with the oligoribonucleotide. A similar procedure for in vivo use is described in WO 91\/15580. Briefly, a pair of oligonucleotides for a given antisense RNA is produced as follows: A sequence complimentary to the first 15 bases of the open reading frame is flanked by an EcoR1 site on the 5 end and a HindIII site on the 3 end. Next, the pair of oligonucleotides is heated at 90\u00b0 C. for one minute and then annealed in 2X ligation buffer (20 mM TRIS HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 MM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.2 mM ATP) and then ligated to the EcoRl\/Hind III site of the retroviral vector PMV7 (WO 91\/15580).","For example, the 5\u2032 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of the receptor. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into receptor polypeptide.","In one embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example, a vector or a portion thereof, is transcribed, producing an antisense nucleic acid (RNA) of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the antisense nucleic acid of the invention. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated, as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid, viral, or others known in the art, used for replication and expression in vertebrate cells. Expression of the sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention, or fragments thereof, can be by any promoter known in the art to act in vertebrate, preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early promoter region (Bernoist and Chambon, Nature, 29:304\u2013310 (1981), the promoter contained in the 3\u2032 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al., Cell, 22:787\u2013797 (1980), the herpes thymidine promoter (Wagner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 78:1441\u20131445 (1981), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster et al., Nature, 296:39\u201342 (1982)), etc.","The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a gene of interest. However, absolute complementarity, although preferred, is not required. A sequence \u201ccomplementary to at least a portion of an RNA,\u201d referred to herein, means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA, forming a stable duplex; in the case of double stranded antisense nucleic acids of the invention, a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested, or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid Generally, the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with a RNA sequence of the invention it may contain and still form a stable duplex (or triplex as the case may be). One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.","Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5\u2032 end of the message, e.g., the 5\u2032 untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon, should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However, sequences complementary to the 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally, Wagner, R., Nature, 372:333\u2013335 (1994). Thus, oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-non-translated, non-coding regions of a polynucleotide sequence of the invention could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous mRNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5\u2032-, 3\u2032- or coding region of mRNA, antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length, and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides, at least 17 nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides.","The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone, for example, to improve stability of the molecule, hybridization, etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:6553\u20136556 (1989); Lemaitre et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 84:648\u2013652 (1987); PCT Publication NO:W088\/09810, published Dec. 15, 1988) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication NO:W089\/10134, published Apr. 25, 1988), hybridization-triggered cleavage agents. (See, e.g., Krol et al., BioTechniques, 6:958\u2013976 (1988)) or intercalating agents. (See, e.g., Zon, Pharm. Res., 5:539\u2013549 (1988)). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, etc.","The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including, but not limited to, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5\u2032-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl) uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine.","The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including, but not limited to, arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, and hexose.","In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including, but not limited to, a phosphorothioate, a phosphorodithioate, a phosphoramidothioate, a phosphoramidate, a phosphordiamidate, a methylphosphonate, an alkyl phosphotriester, and a formacetal or analog thereof.","In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide is an a-anomeric oligonucleotide. An a-anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual b-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gautier et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 15:6625\u20136641 (1987)). The oligonucleotide is a 2-O-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 15:6131\u20136148 (1987)), or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al., FEBS Lett. 215:327\u2013330 (1987)).","Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer (such as are commercially available from Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, etc.). As examples, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. (Nucl. Acids Res., 16:3209 (1988)), methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports (Sarin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 85:7448\u20137451 (1988)), etc.","While antisense nucleotides complementary to the coding region sequence of the invention could be used, those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred.","Potential antagonists according to the invention also include catalytic RNA, or a ribozyme (See, e.g., PCT International Publication WO 90\/11364, published Oct. 4, 1990; Sarver et al, Science, 247:1222\u20131225 (1990). While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy mRNAs corresponding to the polynucleotides of the invention, the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases: 5\u2032-UG-3\u2032. The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach, Nature, 334:585\u2013591 (1988). There are numerous potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites within each nucleotide sequence disclosed in the sequence listing. Preferably, the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA corresponding to the polynucleotides of the invention; i.e., to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non-functional mRNA transcripts.","As in the antisense approach, the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides (e.g. for improved stability, targeting, etc.) and should be delivered to cells which express the polynucleotides of the invention in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct \u201cencoding\u201d the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, such as, for example, pol III or pol II promoter, so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules, are catalytic, a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency.","Antagonist\/agonist compounds may be employed to inhibit the cell growth and proliferation effects of the polypeptides of the present invention on neoplastic cells and tissues, i.e. stimulation of angiogenesis of tumors, and, therefore, retard or prevent abnormal cellular growth and proliferation, for example, in tumor formation or growth.","The antagonist\/agonist may also be employed to prevent hyper-vascular diseases, and prevent the proliferation of epithelial lens cells after extracapsular cataract surgery. Prevention of the mitogenic activity of the polypeptides of the present invention may also be desirous in cases such as restenosis after balloon angioplasty.","The antagonist\/agonist may also be employed to prevent the growth of scar tissue during wound healing.","The antagonist\/agonist may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose the diseases described herein.","Thus, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, including but not limited to the diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions listed throughout this application, associated with overexpression of a polynucleotide of the present invention by administering to a patient (a) an antisense molecule directed to the polynucleotide of the present invention, and\/or (b) a ribozyme directed to the polynucleotide of the present invention.","invention, and\/or (b) a ribozyme directed to the polynucleotide of the present invention.","Biotic Associations","A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability, either directly or indirectly, to initiate and\/or maintain biotic associations with other organisms. Such associations may be symbiotic, nonsymbiotic, endosymbiotic, macrosymbiotic, and\/or microsymbiotic in nature. In general, a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability to form biotic associations with any member of the fungal, bacterial, lichen, mycorrhizal, cyanobacterial, dinoflaggellate, and\/or algal, kingdom, phylums, families, classes, genuses, and\/or species.","The mechanism by which a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the host organisms ability, either directly or indirectly, to initiate and\/or maintain biotic associations is variable, though may include, modulating osmolarity to desirable levels for the symbiont, modulating pH to desirable levels for the symbiont, modulating secretions of organic acids, modulating the secretion of specific proteins, phenolic compounds, nutrients, or the increased expression of a protein required for host-biotic organisms interactions (e.g., a receptor, ligand, etc.). Additional mechanisms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention (see, for example, \u201cMicrobial Signalling and Communication\u201d, eds., R. England, G. Hobbs, N. Bainton, and D. McL. Roberts, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, (1999); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference).","In an alternative embodiment, a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may decrease the host organisms ability to form biotic associations with another organism, either directly or indirectly. The mechanism by which a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may decrease the host organisms ability, either directly or indirectly, to initiate and\/or maintain biotic associations with another organism is variable, though may include, modulating osmolarity to undesirable levels, modulating pH to undesirable levels, modulating secretions of organic acids, modulating the secretion of specific proteins, phenolic compounds, nutrients, or the decreased expression of a protein required for host-biotic organisms interactions (e.g., a receptor, ligand, etc.). Additional mechanisms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention (see, for example, \u201cMicrobial Signalling and Communication\u201d, eds., R. England, G. Hobbs, N. Bainton, and D. McL. Roberts, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, (1999); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference).","The hosts ability to maintain biotic associations with a particular pathogen has significant implications for the overall health and fitness of the host. For example, human hosts have symbiosis with enteric bacteria in their gastrointestinal tracts, particularly in the small and large intestine. In fact, bacteria counts in feces of the distal colon often approach 10per milliliter of feces. Examples of bowel flora in the gastrointestinal tract are members of the Enterobacteriaceae, , in addition to a-hemolytic streptococci, , Bifobacteria, Anaerobic cocci, Eubacteria, Costridia, lactobacilli, and yeasts. Such bacteria, among other things, assist the host in the assimilation of nutrients by breaking down food stuffs not typically broken down by the hosts digestive system, particularly in the hosts bowel. Therefore, increasing the hosts ability to maintain such a biotic association would help assure proper nutrition for the host.","Aberrations in the enteric bacterial population of mammals, particularly humans, has been associated with the following disorders: diarrhea, ileus, chronic inflammatory disease, bowel obstruction, duodenal diverticula, biliary calculous disease, and malnutrition. A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention are useful for treating, detecting, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or ameliorating, either directly or indirectly, and of the above mentioned diseases and\/or disorders associated with aberrant enteric flora population.","The composition of the intestinal flora, for example, is based upon a variety of factors, which include, but are not limited to, the age, race, diet, malnutrition, gastric acidity, bile salt excretion, gut motility, and immune mechanisms. As a result, the polynucleotides and polypeptides, including agonists, antagonists, and fragments thereof, may modulate the ability of a host to form biotic associations by affecting, directly or indirectly, at least one or more of these factors.","Although the predominate intestinal flora comprises anaerobic organisms, an underlying percentage represents aerobes (e.g., ). This is significant as such aerobes rapidly become the predominate organisms in intraabdominal infections\u2014effectively becoming opportunistic early in infection pathogenesis. As a result, there is an intrinsic need to control aerobe populations, particularly for immune compromised individuals.","In a preferred embodiment, a polynucleotides and polypeptides, including agonists, antagonists, and fragments thereof, are useful for inhibiting biotic associations with specific enteric symbiont organisms in an effort to control the population of such organisms.","Biotic associations occur not only in the gastrointestinal tract, but also on an in the integument. As opposed to the gastrointestinal flora, the cutaneous flora is comprised almost equally with aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Examples of cutaneous flora are members of the gram-positive cocci (e.g., , coagulase-negative ), gram-positive bacilli (e.g., species, species, species, ), gram-negative bacilli (e.g., species), and fungi (). The relatively low number of flora associated with the integument is based upon the inability of many organisms to adhere to the skin. The organisms referenced above have acquired this unique ability. Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention may have uses which include modulating the population of the cutaneous flora, either directly or indirectly.","Aberrations in the cutaneous flora are associated with a number of significant diseases and\/or disorders, which include, but are not limited to the following: impetigo, ecthyma, blistering distal dactulitis, pustules, folliculitis, cutaneous abscesses, pitted keratolysis, trichomycosis axcillaris, dermatophytosis complex, axillary odor, erthyrasma, cheesy foot odor, acne, tinea versicolor, seborrheic dermititis, and , to name a few. A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention are useful for treating, detecting, diagnosing, prognosing, and\/or ameliorating, either directly or indirectly, and of the above mentioned diseases and\/or disorders associated with aberrant cutaneous flora population.","Additional biotic associations, including diseases and disorders associated with the aberrant growth of such associations, are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention. See, for example, \u201cInfectious Disease\u201d, Second Edition, Eds., S. L., Gorbach, J. G., Bartlett, and N. R., Blacklow, W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, (1998); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference).","Pheromones","In another embodiment, a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may increase the organisms ability to synthesize, release, and\/or respond to a pheromone, either directly or indirectly. Such a pheromone may, for example, alter the organisms behavior and\/or metabolism.","A polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the present invention may modulate the biosynthesis and\/or release of pheromones, the organisms ability to respond to pheromones (e.g., behaviorally, and\/or metabolically), and\/or the organisms ability to detect pheromones, either directly or indirectly. Preferably, any of the pheromones, and\/or volatiles released from the organism, or induced, by a polynucleotide or polypeptide and\/or agonist or antagonist of the invention have behavioral effects on the organism.","For example, recent studies have shown that administration of picogram quantities of androstadienone, the most prominent androstene present on male human axillary hair and on the male axillary skin, to the female vomeronasal organ resulted in a significant reduction of nervousness, tension and other negative feelings in the female recipients (Grosser-BI, et al., Psychoneuroendocrinology, 25(3): 289\u201399 (2000)).","Other Activities","The polypeptide of the present invention, as a result of the ability to stimulate vascular endothelial cell growth, may be employed in treatment for stimulating re-vascularization of ischemic tissues due to various disease conditions such as thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, and other cardiovascular conditions. These polypeptide may also be employed to stimulate angiogenesis and limb regeneration, as discussed above.","The polypeptide may also be employed for treating wounds due to injuries, bums, post-operative tissue repair, and ulcers since they are mitogenic to various cells of different origins, such as fibroblast cells and skeletal muscle cells, and therefore, facilitate the repair or replacement of damaged or diseased tissue.","The polypeptide of the present invention may also be employed stimulate neuronal growth and to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose neuronal damage which occurs in certain neuronal disorders or neuro-degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and AIDS-related complex. The polypeptide of the invention may have the ability to stimulate chondrocyte growth, therefore, they may be employed to enhance bone and periodontal regeneration and aid in tissue transplants or bone grafts.","The polypeptide of the invention may also be employed to maintain organs before transplantation or for supporting cell culture of primary tissues.","The polypeptide of the present invention may also be employed for inducing tissue of mesodermal origin to differentiate in early embryos.","The polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also increase or decrease the differentiation or proliferation of embryonic stem cells, besides, as discussed above, hematopoietic lineage.","The polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to modulate mammalian characteristics, such as body height, weight, hair color, eye color, skin, percentage of adipose tissue, pigmentation, size, and shape (e.g., cosmetic surgery). Similarly, polypeptides or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may be used to modulate mammalian metabolism affecting catabolism, anabolism, processing, utilization, and storage of energy.","Polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may be used to change a mammal's mental state or physical state by influencing biorhythms, caricadic rhythms, depression (including depressive diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions), tendency for violence, tolerance for pain, reproductive capabilities (preferably by Activin or Inhibin-like activity), hormonal or endocrine levels, appetite, libido, memory, stress, or other cognitive qualities.","Polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to increase the efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition, either directly or indirectly. Such a use may be administered in simultaneous conjunction with said pharmaceutical, or separately through either the same or different route of administration (e.g., intravenous for the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention, and orally for the pharmaceutical, among others described herein.).","Polypeptide or polynucleotides and\/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to prepare individuals for extraterrestrial travel, low gravity environments, prolonged exposure to extraterrestrial radiation levels, low oxygen levels, reduction of metabolic activity, exposure to extraterrestrial pathogens, etc. Such a use may be administered either prior to an extraterrestrial event, during an extraterrestrial event, or both. Moreover, such a use may result in a number of beneficial changes in the recipient, such as, for example, any one of the following, non-limiting, effects: an increased level of hematopoietic cells, particularly red blood cells which would aid the recipient in coping with low oxygen levels;

The search program used was gapped BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). Ion channel specific Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) built in-house or obtained from the public PFAM databases were also used as probes (Bateman et al., 2000). The search program used for HMMs was the Genewise\/Wise2 package (http:\/\/www.sanger.ac.uk\/Software\/Wise2\/ index.shtml). The top genomic exon hits from the results were searched back against the non-redundant protein and patent sequence databases. From this analysis BAC AL049610 was determined to possess a novel ion channel exon based on its homology to the putative human glycine receptor alpha 2 subunit (SEQ ID NO:13). The full length cDNA described herein as HGRA4 (SEQ ID NO:1, ), was isolated using probes designed from the BAC AL049610 exon (SEQ ID NO:5). Based on this analysis, a partial sequence of the novel human glycine receptor related gene, HGRA4, was identified. The full-length clone of this novel glycine receptor gene was experimentally obtained by using the sequence from genomic data.","Upon cloning the full-length HGRA4 polynucleotide, the clone corresponding to the HGRA4sv splice variant was obtained. The full-length sequence of the HGRA4sv polynucleotide is provided in  (SEQ ID NO:3).","Method for Constructing a Size Fractionated Brain cDNA Library","Brain poly A+ RNA was purchased from Clontech and converted into double stranded cDNA using the SuperScript\u2122 Plasmid System for cDNA Synthesis and Plasmid Cloning (Life Technologies) except that no radioisotope was incorporated in either of the cDNA synthesis steps and that the cDNA was fractionated by HPLC. This was accomplished on a TransGenomics HPLC system equipped with a size exclusion column (TosoHass) with dimensions of 7.8 mm\u00d730 cm and a particle size of 10 \u03bcm. Tris buffered saline was used as the mobile phase and the column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 mL\/min.","The resulting chromatograms were analyzed to determine which fractions should be pooled to obtain the largest cDNA's; generally fractions that eluted in the range of 12 to 15 minutes were pooled. The cDNA was precipitated prior to ligation into the SalI\/NotI sites in the pSport vector supplied with the kit. Using a combination of PCR with primers to the ends of the vector and Sal I\/Not I restriction enzyme digestion of mini-prep DNA, it was determined that the average insert size of the library was greater the 3.5 Kb. The overall complexity of the library was greater that 10independent clones. The library was amplified in semi-solid agar for 2 days at 30\u00b0 C. An aliquot (200 microliters) of the amplified library was inoculated into a 200 ml culture for single-stranded DNA isolation by super-infection with a fl helper phage. After overnight growth, the released phage particles with precipitated with PEG and the DNA isolated with proteinase K, SDS and phenol extractions.

The mixture was heated in a thermal cycler to 95\u00b0 C. for 2 mins. Fourteen microliters of 2X hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.04 M NaPO, pH 7.2, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS) was added to the heated probe\/cDNA library mixture and incubated at 42\u00b0 C. for 26 hours. Hybrids between the biotinylated oligo and the circular cDNA were isolated by diluting the hybridization mixture to 220 microliters in a solution containing 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and adding 125 microliters of streptavidin magnetic beads. This solution was incubated at 42\u00b0 C. for 60 mins, mixing every 5 mins to resuspend the beads.

The DNA was resuspend in 12 microliters of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and pH 8.0). The single stranded cDNA was converted into double strands in a thermal cycler by mixing 5 microliters of the captured DNA with 1.5 microliters 10 micromolar standard SP6 primer (homologous to a sequence on the cDNA cloning vector) and 1.5 microliters of 10\u00d7PCR buffer.

The solution was ramped back to 73\u00b0 C. and incubated for 23 mins. The repaired DNA was ethanol precipitate and resuspended in 10 microliters of TE. Two microliters were electroporated in DH12S cells and resulting colonies were screen by PCR, using a primer pair designed from the genomic exonic sequence to identify the proper cDNAs.","Oligos used to identity the cDNA by PCR.\n\n","Those cDNA clones that were positive by PCR had the inserts sized and two clones were chosen for DNA sequencing. The clone E3 (HGRA4) and clone D8 (HGRA4sv) had several differences; 1) different sequences at their 5\u2032 end and the presence of an alternatively spliced exon or unspliced intron that maintained the cDNAs coding potential. Both clones apparently were missing approximately 250 bp from their 5\u2032 ends. The nucleotide sequences for E3 and D8 were used to search all available databases using BLAST. An Incyte clone sequence (Incyte Clone No. G1934909) that overlapped E3 and D8 was identified that extended the 5\u2032 sequence to the putative initiating methionine.","Expression Profiling of Novel Human Potassium Channel Modulatory Beta Subunit HGRA4","The same PCR primer pair (SEQ ID NO:7 and 8) that was used to identify the HGRA4 cDNA clones was used to measure the steady state levels of mRNA by quantitative PCR. Briefly, first strand cDNA was made from commercially available mRNA. The relative amount of cDNA used in each assay was determined by performing a parallel experiment using a primer pair for a gene expressed in equal amounts in all tissues, cyclophilin. The cyclophilin primer pair detected small variations in the amount of cDNA in each sample and these data were used for normalization of the data obtained with the primer pair for HGRA4. The PCR data was converted into a relative assessment of the difference in transcript abundance amongst the tissues tested and the data is presented below. Transcripts corresponding to HGRA4 expressed highly in heart and colon; significantly in uterus, and to a lesser extent, in testis, and spinal cord.","Method Of Assessing The Expression Profile Of The Novel HGPR4 Polypeptides Of The Present Invention Using Expanded MRNA Tissue and Cell Sources","Total RNA from tissues was isolated using the TriZol protocol (Invitrogen) and quantified by determining its absorbance at 260 nM. An assessment of the 18s and 28s ribosomal RNA bands was made by denaturing gel electrophoresis to determine RNA integrity.","The specific sequence to be measured was aligned with related genes found in GenBank to identity regions of significant sequence divergence to maximize primer and probe specificity. Gene-specific primers and probes were designed using the ABI primer express software to amplify small amplicons (150 base pairs or less) to maximize the likelihood that the primers function at 100% efficiency. All primer\/probe sequences were searched against Public Genbank databases to ensure target specificity. Primers and probes were obtained from ABI.","For HGPR4, the primer probe sequences were as follows\n\n","To access the level of contaminating genomic DNA in the RNA, the RNA was divided into 2 aliquots and one half was treated with Rnase-free Dnase (Invitrogen). Samples from both the Dnase-treated and non-treated were then subjected to reverse transcription reactions with (RT+) and without (RT\u2212) the presence of reverse transcriptase. TaqMan assays were carried out with gene-specific primers (see above) and the contribution of genomic DNA to the signal detected was evaluated by comparing the threshold cycles obtained with the RT+\/RT\u2212 non-Dnase treated RNA to that on the RT+\/RT\u2212 Dnase treated RNA. The amount of signal contributed by genomic DNA in the Dnased RT\u2212 RNA must be less that 10% of that obtained with Dnased RT+ RNA. If not the RNA was not used in actual experiments.","Reverse Transcription Reaction and Sequence Detection","100 ng of Dnase-treated total RNA was annealed to 2.5 \u03bcM of the respective gene-specific reverse primer in the presence of 5.5 mM Magnesium Chloride by heating the sample to 72\u00b0 C. for 2 min and then cooling to 55\u00b0 C. for 30 min. 1.25 U\/\u03bcl of MuLv reverse transcriptase and 500 \u03bcM of each dNTP was added to the reaction and the tube was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min.

The PCR reaction was then held at 94\u00b0 C. for 12 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0 C. for 15 sec and 60\u00b0 C. for 30 sec.","Data Handling","The threshold cycle (Ct) of the lowest expressing tissue (the highest Ct value) was used as the baseline of expression and all other tissues were expressed as the relative abundance to that tissue by calculating the difference in Ct value between the baseline and the other tissues and using it as the exponent in 2","The expanded expression profile of the HGRA4 polypeptide, is provided in  and described elsewhere herein.","Assessing Ability of HGRA4 Polypeptides to Function as Neurotransmission Inhibitors","To test for the ability of the newly describe proteins to function as inhibitors of neurotransmission, cDNAs representing full length versions of each of the splice forms (HGRA4 and HGRA4sv) can be transfected into a variety of cultured and primary cells types. For instance, HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant HGRA4 could be treated with glycine and chloride currents measured in both whole cell or single channel recordings. The dose response curve for glycine could be determined and compared to that obtained when HGRA4 is co-expressed with vectors expressing a human glycine receptor beta subunit. A shift in responsiveness would suggest the two proteins were interacting in the classical pentameric 3:2 arrangement. These experiments could be repeated with other known agonists of the glycine receptor, such beta-alanine as well as in the presence of known antagonist such as strychnine. Direct physical interaction between HGRA4 and other known glycine receptor subunits could be performed by using a variety of well known molecular biology techniques such as yeast 2-hybrid screens, and immunoprecipitations.","Method of Assessing Ability of HGRA4 Polypeptides to Associate With Glycine Receptor Subunits Using the Yeast Two-hybrid System","In an effort to determine whether the HGRA4 polypeptides of the present invention are capable of functioning as glycine receptor alpha subunits, it would be important to effectively test the interaction between HGRA4 and various portions of other glycine receptor alpha or beta subunits, in a yeast two-hybrid system. Such a system could be created using methods known in the art (see, for example, S. Fields and O. Song, Nature, 340:245\u2013246 (1989); and Gaston-SM and Loughlin-KR, Urology, 53(4): 835\u201342 (1999); which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, including the articles referenced therein).","Cytoplasmic NH and COOH terminal domains of different glycine receptor alpha- or beta-subunits could be subcloned and expressed as fusion proteins of the GAL4 DNA binding (DB) domain using molecular biology techniques within the skill of the artisan.","Exemplary subunits which could be used in the two-hybrid system to assess HGRA4s ability to associate with other alpha or beta subunits include, but are not limited to, the NH and\/or C-terminal domain of HGRA1, HGRA2, HGRA3, and the mouse GRA4.","Method of Assessing Ability of HGRA4 Polypeptides to Form Oligomeric Complexes With Itself or Other Glycine Receptor Subunits in Solution","Aside from determining whether the HGRA4 polypeptides are capable of interacting with other glycine receptor alpha and\/or beta subunits in a yeast two-hybrid assay, it would be an important next step to assess its ability to form oligomeric complexes with itself, in addition to other alpha or beta subunits in solution. Such a finding would be significant as it would provide convincing evidence that HGRA4 could serve as a glycine receptor alpha subunit and may modulate inhibitory neurotransmission function.","A number of methods could be used to that are known in the art, for example, the method described by Sanguinetti, M. C., et al., Nature, 384:80\u201383 (1996) could be adapted using methods within the skill of the artisan.","Method of Assessing Whether the Formation of HGRA4\/glycine Receptor Alpha Subunits Has Any Effect on Inhibiting Neurotransmission","Once the HGRA4 polypeptides are determined to form oligomeric and\/or heteromultimeric complexes with other alpha or beta subunits, it would be important to determine whether such an interaction is physiologically relevant. Alternatively, this experiment could be performed prior to the oligomerization and yeast-two hybrid experiments described above.","Expression constructs comprising the coding region of the HGRA4 polypeptide under the control of a constitutive or inducible promoter could be created and used to transiently or stably transfect a cell line lacking endogenous glycine receptor alpha expression. Once transfected, the ability of the cells to transduce Cl\u2212 could be assessed using techniques known in the art. Alternatively, any cell line could be transfected with HGRA4 polypeptides and the glycine receptor function of the cell assessed. Alternatively, oocytes from the South African clawed frog X. laevis could be used to assess the ability of expressed HGRA4 polypeptides to modulate endogenous or transfected neurotransmission function (for example, Wagner-CA; Friedrich-B; Setiawan-I; Lang-F; Broer, Cell-Physiol-Biochem., 10(1-2):1\u201312 (2000); which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, including the references cited therein). Additional methods could be applied for assessing the ability of HGRA4 to modulate neurotransmission activity. For example, the method described by McDonald, T. V., et al., Nature, 388:289\u2013292 (1997) could be adapted using methods within the skill of the artisan.","Method of Identifying the Cognate Ligand of the HGRA4 Polypeptide","A number of methods are known in the art for identifying the cognate binding partner of a particular polypeptide. For example, the encoding HGRA4 polynucleotide could be engineered to comprise an epitope tag. The epitope could be any epitope known in the art or disclosed elsewhere herein. Once created, the epitope tagged HGRA4 encoding polynucleotide could be cloned into an expression vector and used to transfect a variety of cell lines representing different tissue origins (e.g., brain, testis, etc.). The transfected cell lines could then be induced to overexpress the HGRA4 polypeptide. Since other electrically silent channels appear to remain in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of their cognate binding partner, evidence for a cell type expressing the proper conducing channel would be the observed cell surface expression of HGRA4. The presence of the HGRA4 polypeptide on the cell surface could be determined by fractionating whole cell lysates into cellular and membrane protein fractions and performing immunoprecipitation using the antibody directed against the epitope engineered into the HGRA4 polypeptide. Monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies directed against the HGRA4 polypeptide could be created and used in place of the antibodies directed against the epitope.","Alternatively, the cell surface proteins could be distinguished from cellular proteins by biotinylating the surface proteins and then performing immunoprecipitations with antibody specific to the HGRA4 protein. After electrophoretic separation, the biotinylated protein could be detected with streptavidin-HRP (using standard methods known to those skilled in the art). Identification of the proteins bound to HGRA4 could be made in those cells by immunoprecipation, followed by one-dimensional electrophoresis, followed by various versions of mass spectrometry. Such mass-spectrometry methods are known in the art, such as for example the methods taught by Ciphergen Biosystems Inc. (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,664; which is hereby incorporated herein by reference).","Isolation of a Specific Clone from the Deposited Sample","The deposited material in the sample assigned the ATCC Deposit Number cited in Table 1 for any given cDNA clone also may contain one or more additional plasmids, each comprising a cDNA clone different from that given clone. Thus, deposits sharing the same ATCC Deposit Number contain at least a plasmid for each cDNA clone identified in Table 1. Typically, each ATCC deposit sample cited in Table 1 comprises a mixture of approximately equal amounts (by weight) of about 1\u201310 plasmid DNAs, each containing a different cDNA clone and\/or partial cDNA clone; but such a deposit sample may include plasmids for more or less than 2 cDNA clones.","Two approaches can be used to isolate a particular clone from the deposited sample of plasmid DNA(s) cited for that clone in Table 1. First, a plasmid is directly isolated by screening the clones using a polynucleotide probe corresponding to SEQ ID NO:1.","Particularly, a specific polynucleotide with 30\u201340 nucleotides is synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer according to the sequence reported. The oligonucleotide is labeled, for instance, with 32P-(-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified according to routine methods. (E.g., Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring, N.Y. (1982).) The plasmid mixture is transformed into a suitable host, as indicated above (such as XL-1 Blue (Stratagene)) using techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as those provided by the vector supplier or in related publications or patents cited above. The transformants are plated on 1.5% agar plates (containing the appropriate selection agent, e.g., ampicillin) to a density of about 150 transformants (colonies) per plate. These plates are screened using Nylon membranes according to routine methods for bacterial colony screening (e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edit., (1989), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pages 1.93 to 1.104), or other techniques known to those of skill in the art.","Alternatively, two primers of 17\u201320 nucleotides derived from both ends of the SEQ ID NO:1 (i.e., within the region of SEQ ID NO:1 bounded by the 5\u2032 NT and the 3\u2032 NT of the clone defined in Table 1) are synthesized and used to amplify the desired cDNA using the deposited cDNA plasmid as a template. The polymerase chain reaction is carried out under routine conditions, for instance, in 25 ul of reaction mixture with 0.5 ug of the above cDNA template. A convenient reaction mixture is 1.5\u20135 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (w\/v) gelatin, 20 uM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 25 pmol of each primer and 0.25 Unit of Taq polymerase. Thirty five cycles of PCR (denaturation at 94 degree C. for 1 min; annealing at 55 degree C. for 1 min; elongation at 72 degree C. for 1 min) are performed with a Perkin-Elmer Cetus automated thermal cycler. The amplified product is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the DNA band with expected molecular weight is excised and purified. The PCR product is verified to be the selected sequence by subcloning and sequencing the DNA product.","The polynucleotide(s) of the present invention, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention, or the polypeptide encoded by the deposited clone may represent partial, or incomplete versions of the complete coding region (i.e., full-length gene). Several methods are known in the art for the identification of the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 non-coding and\/or coding portions of a gene which may not be present in the deposited clone. The methods that follow are exemplary and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. These methods include but are not limited to, filter probing, clone enrichment using specific probes, and protocols similar or identical to 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 \u201cRACE\u201d protocols that are well known in the art. For instance, a method similar to 5\u2032 RACE is available for generating the missing 5\u2032 end of a desired full-length transcript. (Fromont-Racine et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 21(7):1683\u20131684 (1993)).","Briefly, a specific RNA oligonucleotide is ligated to the 5\u2032 ends of a population of RNA presumably containing full-length gene RNA transcripts. A primer set containing a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to a known sequence of the gene of interest is used to PCR amplify the 5\u2032 portion of the desired full-length gene. This amplified product may then be sequenced and used to generate the full-length gene.","This above method starts with total RNA isolated from the desired source, although poly-A+ RNA can be used. The RNA preparation can then be treated with phosphatase if necessary to eliminate 5\u2032 phosphate groups on degraded or damaged RNA that may interfere with the later RNA ligase step. The phosphatase should then be inactivated and the RNA treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase in order to remove the cap structure present at the 5\u2032 ends of messenger RNAs. This reaction leaves a 5\u2032 phosphate group at the 5\u2032 end of the cap cleaved RNA which can then be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase.","This modified RNA preparation is used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene specific oligonucleotide. The first strand synthesis reaction is used as a template for PCR amplification of the desired 5\u2032 end using a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to the known sequence of the gene of interest. The resultant product is then sequenced and analyzed to confirm that the 5\u2032 end sequence belongs to the desired gene. Moreover, it may be advantageous to optimize the RACE protocol to increase the probability of isolating additional 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 coding or non-coding sequences. Various methods of optimizing a RACE protocol are known in the art, though a detailed description summarizing these methods can be found in B. C. Schaefer, Anal. Biochem., 227:255\u2013273, (1995).","An alternative method for carrying out 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 RACE for the identification of coding or non-coding sequences is provided by Frohman, M. A., et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:8998\u20139002 (1988). Briefly, a cDNA clone missing either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end can be reconstructed to include the absent base pairs extending to the translational start or stop codon, respectively. In some cases, cDNAs are missing the start of translation, therefor. The following briefly describes a modification of this original 5\u2032 RACE procedure. Poly A+ or total RNAs reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Gibco\/BRL) and an antisense or I complementary primer specific to the cDNA sequence. The primer is removed from the reaction with a Microcon Concentrator (Amicon). The first-strand cDNA is then tailed with dATP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Gibco\/BRL). Thus, an anchor sequence is produced which is needed for PCR amplification. The second strand is synthesized from the dA-tail in PCR buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus), an oligo-dT primer containing three adjacent restriction sites (XhoIJ Sail and ClaI) at the 5\u2032 end and a primer containing just these restriction sites. This double-stranded cDNA is PCR amplified for 40 cycles with the same primers as well as a nested cDNA-specific antisense primer. The PCR products are size-separated on an ethidium bromide-agarose gel and the region of gel containing cDNA products the predicted size of missing protein-coding DNA is removed. cDNA is purified from the agarose with the Magic PCR Prep kit (Promega), restriction digested with XhoI or SalI, and ligated to a plasmid such as pBluescript SKII (Stratagene) at XhoI and EcoRV sites. This DNA is transformed into bacteria and the plasmid clones sequenced to identify the correct protein-coding inserts. Correct 5\u2032 ends are confirmed by comparing this sequence with the putatively identified homologue and overlap with the partial cDNA clone. Similar methods known in the art and\/or commercial kits are used to amplify and recover 3\u2032 ends.","Several quality-controlled kits are commercially available for purchase. Similar reagents and methods to those above are supplied in kit form from Gibco\/BRL for both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RACE for recovery of full length genes. A second kit is available from Clontech which is a modification of a related technique, SLIC (single-stranded ligation to single-stranded cDNA), developed by Dumas et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 19:5227\u201332(1991). The major differences in procedure are that the RNA is alkaline hydrolyzed after reverse transcription and RNA ligase is used to join a restriction site-containing anchor primer to the first-strand cDNA. This obviates the necessity for the dA-tailing reaction which results in a polyT stretch that is difficult to sequence past.","An alternative to generating 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 cDNA from RNA is to use cDNA library double-stranded DNA. An asymmetric PCR-amplified antisense cDNA strand is synthesized with an antisense cDNA-specific primer and a plasmid-anchored primer. These primers are removed and a symmetric PCR reaction is performed with a nested cDNA-specific antisense primer and the plasmid-anchored primer.","RNA Ligase Protocol For Generating The 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 End Sequences To Obtain Full Length Genes","Once a gene of interest is identified, several methods are available for the identification of the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 portions of the gene which may not be present in the original cDNA plasmid. These methods include, but are not limited to, filter probing, clone enrichment using specific probes and protocols similar and identical to 5\u2032 and 3\u2032RACE. While the full-length gene may be present in the library and can be identified by probing, a useful method for generating the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end is to use the existing sequence information from the original cDNA to generate the missing information. A method similar to 5\u2032RACE is available for generating the missing 5\u2032 end of a desired full-length gene. (This method was published by Fromont-Racine et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21(7): 1683\u20131684 (1993)). Briefly, a specific RNA oligonucleotide is ligated to the 5\u2032 ends of a population of RNA presumably 30 containing full-length gene RNA transcript and a primer set containing a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to a known sequence of the gene of interest, is used to PCR amplify the 5\u2032 portion of the desired full length gene which may then be sequenced and used to generate the full length gene. This method starts with total RNA isolated from the desired source, poly A RNA may be used but is not a prerequisite for this procedure. The RNA preparation may then be treated with phosphatase if necessary to eliminate 5\u2032 phosphate groups on degraded or damaged RNA which may interfere with the later RNA ligase step. The phosphatase if used is then inactivated and the RNA is treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase in order to remove the cap structure present at the 5\u2032 ends of messenger RNAs. This reaction leaves a 5\u2032 phosphate group at the 5\u2032 end of the cap cleaved RNA which can then be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase. This modified RNA preparation can then be used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene specific oligonucleotide. The first strand synthesis reaction can then be used as a template for PCR amplification of the desired 5\u2032 end using a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to the known sequence of the apoptosis related of interest. The resultant product is then sequenced and analyzed to confirm that the 5\u2032 end sequence belongs to the relevant apoptosis related.","Tissue Distribution of Polypeptide","Tissue distribution of mRNA expression of polynucleotides of the present invention is determined using protocols for Northern blot analysis, described by, among others, Sambrook et al. For example, a cDNA probe produced by the method described in Example 11 is labeled with p32 using the rediprimetm DNA labeling system (Amersham Life Science), according to manufacturer's instructions. After labeling, the probe is purified using CHROMA SPINO-100 column (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocol number PT1200-1. The purified labeled probe is then used to examine various tissues for mRNA expression.","Tissue Northern blots containing the bound mRNA of various tissues are examined with the labeled probe using ExpressHybtm hybridization solution (Clonetech according to manufacturers protocol number PT1190-1. Northern blots can be produced using various protocols well known in the art (e.g., Sambrook et al). Following hybridization and washing, the blots are mounted and exposed to film at \u221270C. overnight, and the films developed according to standard procedures.","Chromosomal Mapping of the Polynucleotides","An oligonucleotide primer set is designed according to the sequence at the 5\u2032 end of SEQ ID NO:1. This primer preferably spans about 100 nucleotides. This primer set is then used in a polymerase chain reaction under the following set of conditions: 30 seconds, 95 degree C.; 1 minute, 56 degree C.; 1 minute, 70 degree C. This cycle is repeated 32 times followed by one 5 minute cycle at 70 degree C. Mammalian DNA, preferably human DNA, is used as template in addition to a somatic cell hybrid panel containing individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments (Bios, Inc). The reactions are analyzed on either 8% polyacrylamide gels or 3.5% agarose gels. Chromosome mapping is determined by the presence of an approximately 100 bp PCR fragment in the particular somatic cell hybrid.","Bacterial Expression of a Polypeptide","A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the DNA sequence, as outlined in Example 11, to synthesize insertion fragments. The primers used to amplify the cDNA insert should preferably contain restriction sites, such as BamHI and XbaI, at the 5\u2032 end of the primers in order to clone the amplified product into the expression vector. For example, BamHI and XbaI correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the bacterial expression vector pQE-9. (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, Calif.). This plasmid vector encodes antibiotic resistance (Ampr), a bacterial origin of replication (ori), an IPTG-regulatable promoter\/operator (P\/O), a ribosome binding site (RBS), a 6-histidine tag (6-His), and restriction enzyme cloning sites.","The pQE-9 vector is digested with BamHI and XbaI and the amplified fragment is ligated into the pQE-9 vector maintaining the reading frame initiated at the bacterial RBS. The ligation mixture is then used to transform the strain M15\/ rep4 (Qiagen, Inc.) which contains multiple copies of the plasmid pREP4, that expresses the lacI repressor and also confers kanamycin resistance (Kanr). Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and ampicillin\/kanamycin resistant colonies are selected. Plasmid DNA is isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis.","Clones containing the desired constructs are grown overnight (O\/N) in liquid culture in LB media supplemented with both Amp (100 ug\/ml) and Kan (25 ug\/ml). The O\/N culture is used to inoculate a large culture at a ratio of 1:100 to 1:250. The cells are grown to an optical density 600 (O.D.600) of between 0.4 and 0.6. IPTG (Isopropyl-B-D-thiogalacto pyranoside) is then added to a final concentration of 1 mM. IPTG induces by inactivating the lacI repressor, clearing the P\/O leading to increased gene expression.","Cells are grown for an extra 3 to 4 hours. Cells are then harvested by centrifugation (20 mins at 6000\u00d7g). The cell pellet is solubilized in the chaotropic agent 6 Molar Guanidine HCl by stirring for 3\u20134 hours at 4 degree C. The cell debris is removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the polypeptide is loaded onto a nickel-nitrilo-tri-acetic acid (\u201cNi-NTA\u201d) affinity resin column (available from QIAGEN, Inc., supra). Proteins with a 6\u00d7His tag bind to the Ni-NTA resin with high affinity and can be purified in a simple one-step procedure (for details see: The QIAexpressionist (1995) QIAGEN, Inc., supra).","Briefly, the supernatant is loaded onto the column in 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 8, the column is first washed with 10 volumes of 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 8, then washed with 10 volumes of 6 M guanidine-HCl pH 6, and finally the polypeptide is eluted with 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 5.","The purified protein is then renatured by dialyzing it against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 50 mM Na-acetate, pH 6 buffer plus 200 mM NaCl. Alternatively, the protein can be successfully refolded while immobilized on the Ni-NTA column. The recommended conditions are as follows: renature using a linear 6M-1M urea gradient in 500 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mM Tris\/HCl pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors. The renaturation should be performed over a period of 1.5 hours or more. After renaturation the proteins are eluted by the addition of 250 mM imidazole. Immidazole is removed by a final dialyzing step against PBS or 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6 buffer plus 200 mM NaCl. The purified protein is stored at 4 degree C. or frozen at \u221280 degree C.","Purification of a Polypeptide from an Inclusion Body","The following alternative method can be used to purify a polypeptide expressed in when it is present in the form of inclusion bodies. Unless otherwise specified, all of the following steps are conducted at 4\u201310 degree C.","Upon completion of the production phase of the fermentation, the cell culture is cooled to 4\u201310 degree C. and the cells harvested by continuous centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (Heraeus Sepatech). On the basis of the expected yield of protein per unit weight of cell paste and the amount of purified protein required, an appropriate amount of cell paste, by weight, is suspended in a buffer solution containing 100 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. The cells are dispersed to a homogeneous suspension using a high shear mixer.","The cells are then lysed by passing the solution through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Corp. or APV Gaulin, Inc.) twice at 4000\u20136000 psi. The homogenate is then mixed with NaCl solution to a final concentration of 0.5 M NaCl, followed by centrifugation at 7000\u00d7g for 15 min. The resultant pellet is washed again using 0.5M NaCl, 100 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.4.","The resulting washed inclusion bodies are solubilized with 1.5 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) for 2\u20134 hours. After 7000\u00d7g centrifugation for 15 min., the pellet is discarded and the polypeptide containing supernatant is incubated at 4 degree C. overnight to allow further GuHCl extraction.","Following high speed centrifugation (30,000\u00d7g) to remove insoluble particles, the GuHCl solubilized protein is refolded by quickly mixing the GuHCl extract with 20 volumes of buffer containing 50 mM sodium, pH 4.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA by vigorous stirring. The refolded diluted protein solution is kept at 4 degree C. without mixing for 12 hours prior to further purification steps.","To clarify the refolded polypeptide solution, a previously prepared tangential filtration unit equipped with 0.16 um membrane filter with appropriate surface area (e.g., Filtron), equilibrated with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0 is employed. The filtered sample is loaded onto a cation exchange resin (e.g., Poros HS-50, Perceptive Biosystems). The column is washed with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0 and eluted with 250 mM, 500 mM, 1000 mM, and 1500 mM NaCl in the same buffer, in a stepwise manner. The absorbance at 280 nm of the effluent is continuously monitored. Fractions are collected and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE.","Fractions containing the polypeptide are then pooled and mixed with 4 volumes of water. The diluted sample is then loaded onto a previously prepared set of tandem columns of strong anion (Poros HQ-50, Perceptive Biosystems) and weak anion (Poros CM-20, Perceptive Biosystems) exchange resins. The columns are equilibrated with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0. Both columns are washed with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 200 mM NaCl. The CM-20 column is then eluted using a 10 column volume linear gradient ranging from 0.2 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0 to 1.0 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.5. Fractions are collected under constant A280 monitoring of the effluent. Fractions containing the polypeptide (determined, for instance, by 16% SDS-PAGE) are then pooled.","The resultant polypeptide should exhibit greater than 95% purity after the above refolding and purification steps. No major contaminant bands should be observed from Coomassie blue stained 16% SDS-PAGE gel when 5 ug of purified protein is loaded. The purified protein can also be tested for endotoxin\/LPS contamination, and typically the LPS content is less than 0.1 ng\/ml according to LAL assays.","Cloning and Expression of a Polypeptide in a Baculovirus Expression System","In this example, the plasmid shuttle vector pAc373 is used to insert a polynucleotide into a baculovirus to express a polypeptide. A typical baculovirus expression vector contains the strong polyhedrin promoter of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) followed by convenient restriction sites, which may include, for example Bam-HI, Xba I and Asp718. The polyadenylation site of the simian virus 40 (\u201cSV40\u201d) is often used for efficient polyadenylation. For easy selection of recombinant virus, the plasmid contains the beta-galactosidase gene from under control of a weak promoter in the same orientation, followed by the polyadenylation signal of the polyhedrin gene. The inserted genes are flanked on both sides by viral sequences for cell-mediated homologous recombination with wild-type viral DNA to generate a viable virus that express the cloned polynucleotide.","Many other baculovirus vectors can be used in place of the vector above, such as pVL941 and pAcIM1, as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate, as long as the construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription, translation, secretion and the like, including a signal peptide and an in-frame AUG as required. Such vectors are described, for instance, in Luckow et al., Virology 170:31\u201339 (1989).","A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the DNA sequence, as outlined in Example 11, to synthesize insertion fragments. The primers used to amplify the cDNA insert should preferably contain restriction sites at the 5\u2032 end of the primers in order to clone the amplified product into the expression vector. Specifically, the cDNA sequence contained in the deposited clone, including the AUG initiation codon and the naturally associated leader sequence identified elsewhere herein (if applicable), is amplified using the PCR protocol described in Example 11. If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the protein, the vector used does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively, the vector can be modified to include a baculovirus leader sequence, using the standard methods described in Summers et al., \u201cA Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures,\u201d Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin No. 1555 (1987).","The amplified fragment is isolated from a 1 % agarose gel using a commercially available kit (\u201cGeneclean,\u201d BIO 101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). The fragment then is digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and again purified on a 1% agarose gel.","The plasmid is digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and optionally, can be dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase, using routine procedures known in the art. The DNA is then isolated from a 1% agarose gel using a commercially available kit (\u201cGeneclean\u201d BIO 101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.).","The fragment and the dephosphorylated plasmid are ligated together with T4 DNA ligase. HB101 or other suitable hosts such as XL-1 Blue (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif.) cells are transformed with the ligation mixture and spread on culture plates. Bacteria containing the plasmid are identified by digesting DNA from individual colonies and analyzing the digestion product by gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the cloned fragment is confirmed by DNA sequencing.","Five ug of a plasmid containing the polynucleotide is co-transformed with 1.0 ug of a commercially available linearized baculovirus DNA (\u201cBaculoGoldtm baculovirus DNA\u201d, Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.), using the lipofection method described by Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413\u20137417 (1987). One ug of BaculoGoldtm virus DNA and 5 ug of the plasmid are mixed in a sterile well of a microtiter plate containing 50 ul of serum-free Grace's medium (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Afterwards, 10 ul Lipofectin plus 90 ul Grace's medium are added, mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the transfection mixture is added drop-wise to Sf9 insect cells (ATCC CRL 1711) seeded in a 35 mm tissue culture plate with 1 ml Grace's medium without serum. The plate is then incubated for 5 hours at 27 degrees C. The transfection solution is then removed from the plate and 1 ml of Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum is added. Cultivation is then continued at 27 degrees C. for four days.","After four days the supernatant is collected and a plaque assay is performed, as described by Summers and Smith, supra. An agarose gel with \u201cBlue Gal\u201d (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg) is used to allow easy identification and isolation of gal-expressing clones, which produce blue-stained plaques. (A detailed description of a \u201cplaque assay\u201d of this type can also be found in the user's guide for insect cell culture and baculovirology distributed by Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, page 9-10. ) After appropriate incubation, blue stained plaques are picked with the tip of a micropipettor (e.g., Eppendorf). The agar containing the recombinant viruses is then resuspended in a microcentrifuge tube containing 200 ul of Grace's medium and the suspension containing the recombinant baculovirus is used to infect Sf9 cells seeded in 35 mm dishes. Four days later the supernatants of these culture dishes are harvested and then they are stored at 4 degree C.","To verify the expression of the polypeptide, Sf9 cells are grown in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The cells are infected with the recombinant baculovirus containing the polynucleotide at a multiplicity of infection (\u201cMOI\u201d) of about 2. If radiolabeled proteins are desired, 6 hours later the medium is removed and is replaced with SF900 II medium minus methionine and cysteine (available from Life Technologies Inc., Rockville, Md.). After 42 hours, 5 uCi of 35S-methionine and 5 uCi 35S-cysteine (available from Amersham) are added. The cells are further incubated for 16 hours and then are harvested by centrifugation. The proteins in the supernatant as well as the intracellular proteins are analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (if radiolabeled).","Microsequencing of the amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of purified protein may be used to determine the amino terminal sequence of the produced protein","Expression of a Polypeptide in Mammalian Cells","The polypeptide of the present invention can be expressed in a mammalian cell. A typical mammalian expression vector contains a promoter element, which mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA, a protein coding sequence, and signals required for the termination of transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Additional elements include enhancers, Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription is achieved with the early and late promoters from SV40, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) from Retroviruses, e.g., RSV, HTLVI, HIVI and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, cellular elements can also be used (e.g., the human actin promoter).","Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include, for example, vectors such as pSVL and pMSG (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), pRSVcat (ATCC 37152), pSV2dhfr (ATCC 37146), pBC12MI (ATCC 67109), pCMVSport 2.0, and pCMVSport 3.0. Mammalian host cells that could be used include, human Hela, 293, H9 and Jurkat cells, mouse NIH3T3 and C127 cells, Cos 1, Cos 7 and CV1, quail QC1\u20133 cells, mouse L cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.","Alternatively, the polypeptide can be expressed in stable cell lines containing the polynucleotide integrated into a chromosome. The co-transformation with a selectable marker such as dhfr, gpt, neomycin, hygromycin allows the identification and isolation of the transformed cells.","The transformed gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded protein. The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) marker is useful in developing cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. (See, e.g., Alt, F. W., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 253:1357\u20131370 (1978); Hamlin, J. L. and Ma, C., Biochem. et Biophys. Acta, 1097:107\u2013143 (1990); Page, M. J. and Sydenham, M. A., Biotechnology 9:64\u201368 (1991).) Another useful selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase (GS) (Murphy et al., Biochem J. 227:277\u2013279 (1991); Bebbington et al., Bio\/Technology 10:169\u2013175 (1992). Using these markers, the mammalian cells are grown in selective medium and the cells with the highest resistance are selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene(s) integrated into a chromosome. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and NSO cells are often used for the production of proteins.","A polynucleotide of the present invention is amplified according to the protocol outlined in herein. If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the protein, the vector does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively, if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used, the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. (See, e.g., WO 96\/34891. ) The amplified fragment is isolated from a 1% agarose gel using a commercially available kit (\u201cGeneclean,\u201d BIO 101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). The fragment then is digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and again purified on a 1% agarose gel.","The amplified fragment is then digested with the same restriction enzyme and purified on a 1% agarose gel. The isolated fragment and the dephosphorylated vector are then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. HB101 or XL-1 Blue cells are then transformed and bacteria are identified that contain the fragment inserted into plasmid pC6 using, for instance, restriction enzyme analysis.","Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking an active DHFR gene is used for transformation. Five \u03bcg of an expression plasmid is cotransformed with 0.5 ug of the plasmid pSVneo using lipofectin (Felgner et al., supra). The plasmid pSV2-neo contains a dominant selectable marker, the neo gene from Tn5 encoding an enzyme that confers resistance to a group of antibiotics including G418. The cells are seeded in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 mg\/ml G418. After 2 days, the cells are trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates (Greiner, Germany) in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 10, 25, or 50 ng\/ml of methotrexate plus 1 mg\/ml G418. After about 10\u201314 days single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6-well petri dishes or 10 ml flasks using different concentrations of methotrexate (50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM, 400 nM, 800 nM). Clones growing at the highest concentrations of methotrexate are then transferred to new 6-well plates containing even higher concentrations of methotrexate (1 uM, 2 uM, 5 uM, 10 mM, 20 mM). The same procedure is repeated until clones are obtained which grow at a concentration of 100\u2013200 uM. Expression of the desired gene product is analyzed, for instance, by SDS-PAGE and Western blot or by reversed phase HPLC analysis.","Protein Fusions","The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably fused to other proteins. These fusion proteins can be used for a variety of applications. For example, fusion of the present polypeptides to His-tag, HA-tag, protein A, IgG domains, and maltose binding protein facilitates purification. (See Example described herein; see also EP A 394,827; Traunecker, et al., Nature 331:84\u201386 (1988).) Similarly, fusion to IgG-1, IgG-3, and albumin increases the half-life time in vivo. Nuclear localization signals fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can target the protein to a specific subcellular localization, while covalent heterodimer or homodimers can increase or decrease the activity of a fusion protein. Fusion proteins can also create chimeric molecules having more than one function. Finally, fusion proteins can increase solubility and\/or stability of the fused protein compared to the non-fused protein. All of the types of fusion proteins described above can be made by modifying the following protocol, which outlines the fusion of a polypeptide to an IgG molecule.","Briefly, the human Fc portion of the IgG molecule can be PCR amplified, using primers that span the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the sequence described below. These primers also should have convenient restriction enzyme sites that will facilitate cloning into an expression vector, preferably a mammalian expression vector. Note that the polynucleotide is cloned without a stop codon, otherwise a fusion protein will not be produced.","The naturally occurring signal sequence may be used to produce the protein (if applicable). Alternatively, if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used, the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. (See, e.g., WO 96\/34891 and\/or U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,781, supra.)","Human IgG Fc region:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0792","num":"0808"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003GGGATCCGGAGCCCAAATCTTCTGACAAAACT","(SEQ ID NO:37)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CACACATGCCCACCGTGCCCAGCACCTGAATTCGAG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"GGTGCACCGTCAGTCTTCCTCTTCCCCCCAAAACCC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AAGGACACCCTCATGATCTCCCGGACTCCTGAGGTC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"ACATGCGTGGTGGTGGACGTAAGCCACGAAGACCCT"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"GAGGTCAAGTTCAACTGGTACGTGGACGGCGTGGAG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"GTGCATAATGCCAAGACAAAGCCGCGGGAGGAGCAG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"TACAACAGCACGTACCGTGTGGTCAGCGTCCTCACC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"GTCCTGCACCAGGACTGGCTGAATGGCAAGGAGTAC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AAGTGCAAGGTCTCCAACAAAGCCCTCCCAACCCCC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"ATCGAGAAAACCATCTCCAAAGCCAAAGGGCAGCCC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CGAGAACCACAGGTGTACACCCTGCCCCCATCCCGG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"GATGAGCTGACCAAGAACCAGGTCAGCCTGACCTGC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CTGGTCAAAGGCTTCTATCCAAGCGACATCGCCGTG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"GAGTGGGAGAGCAATGGGCAGCCGGAGAACAACTAC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AAGACCACGCCTCCCGTGCTGGACTCCGACGGCTCC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"TTCTTCCTCTACAGCAAGCTCACCGTGGACAAGAGC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AGGTGGCAGCAGGGGAACGTCTTCTCATGCTCCGTG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"ATGCATGAGGCTCTGCACAACCACTACACGCAGAAG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AGCCTCTCCCTGTCTCCGGGTAAATGAGTGCGACGG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CCGCGACTCTAGAGGAT"}]}}}}},"Production of an Antibody from a Polypeptide","The antibodies of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods. (See, Current Protocols, Chapter 2. ) As one example of such methods, cells expressing a polypeptide of the present invention are administered to an animal to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies. In a preferred method, a preparation of the protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity.","In the most preferred method, the antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies (or protein binding fragments thereof). Such monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma technology. (K\u00f6hler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975); K\u00f6hler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976); K\u00f6hler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292 (1976); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, Elsevier, N.Y., pp. 563\u2013681 (1981).) In general, such procedures involve immunizing an animal (preferably a mouse) with polypeptide or, more preferably, with a polypeptide-expressing cell. Such cells may be cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium; however, it is preferable to culture cells in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated at about 56 degrees C.), and supplemented with about 10 g\/l of nonessential amino acids, about 1,000 U\/ml of penicillin, and about 100 ug\/ml of streptomycin.","The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention; however, it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line (SP2O), available from the ATCC. After fusion, the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium, and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. (Gastroenterology 80:225\u2013232 (1981).) The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the polypeptide.","Alternatively, additional antibodies capable of binding to the polypeptide can be produced in a two-step procedure using anti-idiotypic antibodies. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens, and therefore, it is possible to obtain an antibody that binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method, protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal, preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells, and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones that produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the protein-specific antibody can be blocked by the polypeptide. Such antibodies comprise anti-idiotypic antibodies to the protein-specific antibody and can be used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further protein-specific antibodies.","It will be appreciated that Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 and other fragments of the antibodies of the present invention may be used according to the methods disclosed herein. Such fragments are typically produced by proteolytic cleavage, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)2 fragments). Alternatively, protein-binding fragments can be produced through the application of recombinant DNA technology or through synthetic chemistry.","For in vivo use of antibodies in humans, it may be preferable to use \u201chumanized\u201d chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced using genetic constructs derived from hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibodies described above. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See, for review, Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Taniguchi et al., EP 171496; Morrison et al., EP 173494; Neuberger et al., WO 8601533; Robinson et al., WO 8702671; Boulianne et al., Nature 312:643 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 314:268 (1985).)","Moreover, in another preferred method, the antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention may be produced in plants. Specific methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,959,177, and 6,080,560, which are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein. The methods not only describe methods of expressing antibodies, but also the means of assembling foreign multimeric proteins in plants (i.e., antibodies, etc,), and the subsequent secretion of such antibodies from the plant.","Regulation of Protein Expression Via Controlled Aggregation in the Endoplasmic Reticulum","As described more particularly herein, proteins regulate diverse cellular processes in higher organisms, ranging from rapid metabolic changes to growth and differentiation. Increased production of specific proteins could be used to prevent certain diseases and\/or disease states. Thus, the ability to modulate the expression of specific proteins in an organism would provide significant benefits.","Numerous methods have been developed to date for introducing foreign genes, either under the control of an inducible, constitutively active, or endogenous promoter, into organisms. Of particular interest are the inducible promoters (see, M. Gossen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 89:5547 (1992); Y. Wang, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:8180 (1994), D. No., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93:3346 (1996); and V. M. Rivera, et al., Nature Med, 2:1028 (1996); in addition to additional examples disclosed elsewhere herein). In one example, the gene for erthropoietin (Epo) was transferred into mice and primates under the control of a small molecule inducer for expression (e.g., tetracycline or rapamycin) (see, D. Bohl, et al., Blood, 92:1512, (1998); K. G. Rendahl, et al., Nat. Biotech, 16:757, (1998); V. M. Rivera, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96:8657 (1999); and X.Ye et al., Science, 283:88 (1999). Although such systems enable efficient induction of the gene of interest in the organism upon addition of the inducing agent (i.e., tetracycline, rapamycin, etc.), the levels of expression tend to peak at 24 hours and trail off to background levels after 4 to 14 days. Thus, controlled transient expression is virtually impossible using these systems, though such control would be desirable.","A new alternative method of controlling gene expression levels of a protein from a transgene (i.e., includes stable and transient transformants) has recently been elucidated (V. M. Rivera., et al., Science, 287:826\u2013830, (2000)). This method does not control gene expression at the level of the mRNA like the aforementioned systems. Rather, the system controls the level of protein in an active secreted form. In the absence of the inducing agent, the protein aggregates in the ER and is not secreted. However, addition of the inducing agent results in dis-aggregation of the protein and the subsequent secretion from the ER. Such a system affords low basal secretion, rapid, high level secretion in the presence of the inducing agent, and rapid cessation of secretion upon removal of the inducing agent. In fact, protein secretion reached a maximum level within 30 minutes of induction, and a rapid cessation of secretion within 1 hour of removing the inducing agent. The method is also applicable for controlling the level of production for membrane proteins.","Detailed methods are presented in V. M. Rivera., et al., Science, 287:826\u2013830, (2000)), briefly:","Fusion protein constructs are created using polynucleotide sequences of the present invention with one or more copies (preferably at least 2, 3, 4, or more) of a conditional aggregation domain (CAD) a domain that interacts with itself in a ligand-reversible manner (i.e., in the presence of an inducing agent) using molecular biology methods known in the art and discussed elsewhere herein. The CAD domain may be the mutant domain isolated from the human FKBP12 (Pheto Met) protein (as disclosed in V. M. Rivera., et al., Science, 287:826\u2013830, (2000), or alternatively other proteins having domains with similar ligand-reversible, self-aggregation properties. As a principle of design the fusion protein vector would contain a furin cleavage sequence operably linked between the polynucleotides of the present invention and the CAD domains. Such a cleavage site would enable the proteolytic cleavage of the CAD domains from the polypeptide of the present invention subsequent to secretion from the ER and upon entry into the trans-Golgi (J. B. Denault, et al., FEBS Lett., 379:113, (1996)). Alternatively, the skilled artisan would recognize that any proteolytic cleavage sequence could be substituted for the furin sequence provided the substituted sequence is cleavable either endogenously (e.g., the furin sequence) or exogenously (e.g., post secretion, post purification, post production, etc.). The preferred sequence of each feature of the fusion protein construct, from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction with each feature being operably linked to the other, would be a promoter, signal sequence, \u201cX\u201d number of (CAD)x domains, the furin sequence (or other proteolytic sequence), and the coding sequence of the polypeptide of the present invention. The artisan would appreciate that the promotor and signal sequence, independent from the other, could be either the endogenous promotor or signal sequence of a polypeptide of the present invention, or alternatively, could be a heterologous signal sequence and promotor.","The specific methods described herein for controlling protein secretion levels through controlled ER aggregation are not meant to be limiting are would be generally applicable to any of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including variants, homolognes, orthologs, and fragments therein.","Alteration of Protein Glycosylation Sites to Enhance Characteristics of Polypeptides of the Invention","Many eukaryotic cell surface and proteins are post-translationally processed to incorporate N-linked and 0-linked carbohydrates (Komfeld and Komfeld (1985) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 54:631\u201364; Rademacher et al., (1988) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57:785\u2013838). Protein glycosylation is thought to serve a variety of functions including: augmentation of protein folding, inhibition of protein aggregation, regulation of intracellular trafficking to organelles, increasing resistance to proteolysis, modulation of protein antigenicity, and mediation of intercellular adhesion (Fieldler and Simons (1995) Cell, 81:309\u2013312; Helenius (1994) Mol. Biol. Of the Cell 5:253\u2013265; Olden et al., (1978) Cell, 13:461\u2013473; Caton et al., (1982) Cell, 37:417\u2013427; Alexamnder and Elder (1984), Science, 226:1328\u20131330; and Flack et al., (1994), J. Biol. Chem., 269:14015\u201314020). In higher organisms, the nature and extent of glycosylation can markedly affect the circulating half-life and bio-availability of proteins by mechanisms involving receptor mediated uptake and clearance (Ashwell and Morrell, (1974), Adv. Enzymol., 41:99\u2013128; Ashwell and Harford (1982), Ann. Rev. Biochem., 51:531\u201354). Receptor systems have been identified that are thought to play a major role in the clearance of serum proteins through recognition of various carbohydrate structures on the glycoproteins (Stockert (1995), Physiol. Rev., 75:591\u2013609; Kery et al., (1992), Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 298:49\u201355). Thus, production strategies resulting in incomplete attachment of terminal sialic acid residues might provide a means of shortening the bioavailability and half-life of glycoproteins. Conversely, expression strategies resulting in saturation of terminal sialic acid attachment sites might lengthen protein bioavailability and half-life.","In the development of recombinant glycoproteins for use as pharmaceutical products, for example, it has been speculated that the pharmacodynamics of recombinant proteins can be modulated by the addition or deletion of glycosylation sites from a glycoproteins primary structure (Berman and Lasky (1985a) Trends in Biotechnol., 3:51\u201353). However, studies have reported that the deletion of N-linked glycosylation sites often impairs intracellular transport and results in the intracellular accumulation of glycosylation site variants (Machamer and Rose (1988), J. Biol Chem., 263:5955\u20135960; Gallagher et al., (1992), J. Virology., 66:7136\u20137145; Collier et al., (1993), Biochem., 32:7818\u20137823; Claffey et al., (1995) Biochemica et Biophysica Acta, 1246:1\u20139; Dube et al., (1988), J. Biol. Chem. 263:17516\u201317521). While glycosylation site variants of proteins can be expressed intracellularly, it has proved difficult to recover useful quantities from growth conditioned cell culture medium.","Moreover, it is unclear to what extent a glycosylation site in one species will be recognized by another species glycosylation machinery. Due to the importance of glycosylation in protein metabolism, particularly the secretion and\/or expression of the protein, whether a glycosylation signal is recognized may profoundly determine a proteins ability to be expressed, either endogenously or recombinately, in another organism (i.e., expressing a human protein in , yeast, or viral organisms; or an , yeast, or viral protein in human, etc.). Thus, it may be desirable to add, delete, or modify a glycosylation site, and possibly add a glycosylation site of one species to a protein of another species to improve the proteins functional, bioprocess purification, and\/or structural characteristics (e.g., a polypeptide of the present invention).","A number of methods may be employed to identify the location of glycosylation sites within a protein. One preferred method is to run the translated protein sequence through the PROSITE computer program (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). Once identified, the sites could be systematically deleted, or impaired, at the level of the DNA using mutagenesis methodology known in the art and available to the skilled artisan, preferably using PCR-directed mutagenesis (See Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring, N.Y. (1982)). Similarly, glycosylation sites could be added, or modified at the level of the DNA using similar methods, preferably PCR methods (See, Maniatis, supra). The results of modifying the glycosylation sites for a particular protein (e.g., solubility, secretion potential, activity, aggregation, proteolytic resistance, etc.) could then be analyzed using methods know in the art.","Method of Enhancing the Biological Activity\/Functional Characteristics of Invention Through Molecular Evolution","Although many of the most biologically active proteins known are highly effective for their specified function in an organism, they often possess characteristics that make them undesirable for transgenic, therapeutic, and\/or industrial applications. Among these traits, a short physiological half-life is the most prominent problem, and is present either at the level of the protein, or the level of the proteins mRNA. The ability to extend the half-life, for example, would be particularly important for a proteins use in gene therapy, transgenic animal production, the bioprocess production and purification of the protein, and use of the protein as a chemical modulator among others. Therefore, there is a need to identify novel variants of isolated proteins possessing characteristics which enhance their application as a therapeutic for treating diseases of animal origin, in addition to the proteins applicability to common industrial and pharmaceutical applications.","Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to the ability to enhance specific characteristics of invention through directed molecular evolution. Such an enhancement may, in a non-limiting example, benefit the inventions utility as an essential component in a kit, the inventions physical attributes such as its solubility, structure, or codon optimization, the inventions specific biological activity, including any associated enzymatic activity, the proteins enzyme kinetics, the proteins Ki, Kcat, Km, Vmax, Kd, protein-protein activity, protein-DNA binding activity, antagonist\/inhibitory activity (including direct or indirect interaction), agonist activity (including direct or indirect interaction), the proteins antigenicity (e.g., where it would be desirable to either increase or decrease the antigenic potential of the protein), the immunogenicity of the protein, the ability of the protein to form dimers, trimers, or multimers with either itself or other proteins, the antigenic efficacy of the invention, including its subsequent use a preventative treatment for disease or disease states, or as an effector for targeting diseased genes. Moreover, the ability to enhance specific characteristics of a protein may also be applicable to changing the characterized activity of an enzyme to an activity completely unrelated to its initially characterized activity. Other desirable enhancements of the invention would be specific to each individual protein, and would thus be well known in the art and contemplated by the present invention.","For example, an engineered glycine receptor may be constitutively active upon binding of its cognate ligand. Alternatively, an engineered glycine receptor may be constitutively active in the absence of glycine binding. In yet another example, an engineered glycine receptor may be capable of being activated with less than all of the regulatory factors and\/or conditions typically required for glycine receptor activation (e.g., glycine binding, Cl\u2212 anion permeability, phosphorylation, conformational changes, etc.). In yet another example, an engineered glycine receptor may have altered anion Cl\u2212 permeability, and\/or sensitivity to glycine receptor antagonists, such as strychnine. In yet another example, an engineered glycine receptor may have altered selectivity for its modulatory glycine receptor beta subunit, or cofactors. Such glycine receptors would be useful in screens to identify glycine receptor modulators, among other uses described herein.","Directed evolution is comprised of several steps. The first step is to establish a library of variants for the gene or protein of interest. The most important step is to then select for those variants that entail the activity you wish to identify. The design of the screen is essential since your screen should be selective enough to eliminate non-useful variants, but not so stringent as to eliminate all variants. The last step is then to repeat the above steps using the best variant from the previous screen. Each successive cycle, can then be tailored as necessary, such as increasing the stringency of the screen, for example.","Over the years, there have been a number of methods developed to introduce mutations into macromolecules. Some of these methods include, random mutagenesis, \u201cerror-prone\u201d PCR, chemical mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis, and other methods well known in the art (for a comprehensive listing of current mutagenesis methods, see Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring, N.Y. (1982)). Typically, such methods have been used, for example, as tools for identifying the core functional region(s) of a protein or the function of specific domains of a protein (if a multi-domain protein). However, such methods have more recently been applied to the identification of macromolecule variants with specific or enhanced characteristics.","Random mutagenesis has been the most widely recognized method to date. Typically, this has been carried out either through the use of \u201cerror-prone\u201d PCR (as described in Moore, J., et al, Nature Biotechnology 14:458, (1996), or through the application of randomized synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to specific regions of interest (as described by Derbyshire, K. M. et al, Gene, 46:145\u2013152, (1986), and Hill, D E, et al, Methods Enzymol., 55:559\u2013568, (1987). Both approaches have limits to the level of mutagenesis that can be obtained. However, either approach enables the investigator to effectively control the rate of mutagenesis. This is particularly important considering the fact that mutations beneficial to the activity of the enzyme are fairly rare. In fact, using too high a level of mutagenesis may counter or inhibit the desired benefit of a useful mutation.","While both of the aforementioned methods are effective for creating randomized pools of macromolecule variants, a third method, termed \u201cDNA Shuffling\u201d, or \u201csexual PCR\u201d (WPC, Stemmer, PNAS, 91:10747, (1994)) has recently been elucidated. DNA shuffling has also been referred to as \u201cdirected molecular evolution\u201d, \u201cexon-shuffling\u201d, \u201cdirected enzyme evolution\u201d, \u201cin vitro evolution\u201d, and \u201cartificial evolution\u201d. Such reference terms are known in the art and are encompassed by the invention. This new, preferred, method apparently overcomes the limitations of the previous methods in that it not only propagates positive traits, but simultaneously eliminates negative traits in the resulting progeny.","DNA shuffling accomplishes this task by combining the principal of in vitro recombination, along with the method of \u201cerror-prone\u201d PCR. In effect, you begin with a randomly digested pool of small fragments of your gene, created by Dnase I digestion, and then introduce said random fragments into an \u201cerror-prone\u201d PCR assembly reaction. During the PCR reaction, the randomly sized DNA fragments not only hybridize to their cognate strand, but also may hybridize to other DNA fragments corresponding to different regions of the polynucleotide of interest\u2014regions not typically accessible via hybridization of the entire polynucleotide. Moreover, since the PCR assembly reaction utilizes \u201cerror-prone\u201d PCR reaction conditions, random mutations are introduced during the DNA synthesis step of the PCR reaction for all of the fragments -further diversifying the potential hybridization sites during the annealing step of the reaction.","A variety of reaction conditions could be utilized to carry-out the DNA shuffling reaction. However, specific reaction conditions for DNA shuffling are provided, for example, in PNAS, 91:10747, (1994). Briefly:","Prepare the DNA substrate to be subjected to the DNA shuffling reaction. Preparation may be in the form of simply purifying the DNA from contaminating cellular material, chemicals, buffers, oligonucleotide primers, deoxynucleotides, RNAs, etc., and may entail the use of DNA purification kits as those provided by Qiagen, Inc., or by the Promega, Corp., for example.","Once the DNA substrate has been purified, it would be subjected to Dnase I digestion. About 2\u20134 ug of the DNA substrate(s) would be digested with 0.0015 units of Dnase I (Sigma) per ul in 100 ul of 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4\/1 mM MgCl2 for 10\u201320 min. at room temperature. The resulting fragments of 10\u201350 bp could then be purified by running them through a 2% low-melting point agarose gel by electrophoresis onto DE81 ion-exchange paper (Whatmann) or could be purified using Microcon concentrators (Amicon) of the appropriate molecular weight cutoff, or could use oligonucleotide purification columns (Qiagen), in addition to other methods known in the art. If using DE81 ion-exchange paper, the 10\u201350 bp fragments could be eluted from said paper using 1M NaCl, followed by ethanol precipitation.","The resulting purified fragments would then be subjected to a PCR assembly reaction by re-suspension in a PCR mixture containing: 2 mM of each dNTP, 2.2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris.HCL, pH 9.0, and 0.1% Triton X-100, at a final fragment concentration of 10\u201330 ng\/ul. No primers are added at this point. Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) would be used at 2.5 units per 100 ul of reaction mixture. A PCR program of 94 C for 60s; 94 C for 30s, 50\u201355 C for 30s, and 72 C for 30s using 30\u201345 cycles, followed by 72 C for 5min using an MJ Research (Cambridge, Mass.) PTC-150 thermocycler. After the assembly reaction is completed, a 1:40 dilution of the resulting primerless product would then be introduced into a PCR mixture (using the same buffer mixture used for the assembly reaction) containing 0.8 um of each primer and subjecting this mixture to 15 cycles of PCR (using 94 C for 30s, 50 C for 30s, and 72 C for 30s). The referred primers would be primers corresponding to the nucleic acid sequences of the polynucleotide(s) utilized in the shuffling reaction. Said primers could consist of modified nucleic acid base pairs using methods known in the art and referred to else where herein, or could contain additional sequences (i.e., for adding restriction sites, mutating specific base-pairs, etc.).","The resulting shuffled, assembled, and amplified product can be purified using methods well known in the art (e.g., Qiagen PCR purification kits) and then subsequently cloned using appropriate restriction enzymes.","Although a number of variations of DNA shuffling have been published to date, such variations would be obvious to the skilled artisan and are encompassed by the invention. The DNA shuffling method can also be tailored to the desired level of mutagenesis using the methods described by Zhao, et al. (Nucl Acid Res., 25(6):1307\u20131308, (1997).","As described above, once the randomized pool has been created, it can then be subjected to a specific screen to identify the variant possessing the desired characteristic(s). Once the variant has been identified, DNA corresponding to the variant could then be used as the DNA substrate for initiating another round of DNA shuffling. This cycle of shuffling, selecting the optimized variant of interest, and then re-shuffling, can be repeated until the ultimate variant is obtained. Examples of model screens applied to identify variants created using DNA shuffling technology may be found in the following publications: J. C., Moore, et al., J. Mol. Biol., 272:336\u2013347, (1997), F. R., Cross, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 18:2923\u20132931, (1998), and A. Crameri., et al., Nat. Biotech., 15:436\u2013438, (1997).","DNA shuffling has several advantages. First, it makes use of beneficial mutations. When combined with screening, DNA shuffling allows the discovery of the best mutational combinations and does not assume that the best combination contains all the mutations in a population. Secondly, recombination occurs simultaneously with point mutagenesis. An effect of forcing DNA polymerase to synthesize full-length genes from the small fragment DNA pool is a background mutagenesis rate. In combination with a stringent selection method, enzymatic activity has been evolved up to 16000 fold increase over the wild-type form of the enzyme. In essence, the background mutagenesis yielded the genetic variability on which recombination acted to enhance the activity.","A third feature of recombination is that it can be used to remove deleterious mutations. As discussed above, during the process of the randomization, for every one beneficial mutation, there may be at least one or more neutral or inhibitory mutations. Such mutations can be removed by including in the assembly reaction an excess of the wild-type random-size fragments, in addition to the random-size fragments of the selected mutant from the previous selection. During the next selection, some of the most active variants of the polynucleotide\/polypeptide\/enzyme, should have lost the inhibitory mutations.","Finally, recombination enables parallel processing. This represents a significant advantage since there are likely multiple characteristics that would make a protein more desirable (e.g. solubility, activity, etc.). Since it is increasingly difficult to screen for more than one desirable trait at a time, other methods of molecular evolution tend to be inhibitory. However, using recombination, it would be possible to combine the randomized fragments of the best representative variants for the various traits, and then select for multiple properties at once.","DNA shuffling can also be applied to the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention to decrease their immunogenicity in a specified host. For example, a particular variant of the present invention may be created and isolated using DNA shuffling technology. Such a variant may have all of the desired characteristics, though may be highly immunogenic in a host due to its novel intrinsic structure. Specifically, the desired characteristic may cause the polypeptide to have a non-native structure which could no longer be recognized as a \u201cself\u201d molecule, but rather as a \u201cforeign\u201d, and thus activate a host immune response directed against the novel variant. Such a limitation can be overcome, for example, by including a copy of the gene sequence for a xenobiotic ortholog of the native protein in with the gene sequence of the novel variant gene in one or more cycles of DNA shuffling. The molar ratio of the ortholog and novel variant DNAs could be varied accordingly. Ideally, the resulting hybrid variant identified would contain at least some of the coding sequence which enabled the xenobiotic protein to evade the host immune system, and additionally, the coding sequence of the original novel variant that provided the desired characteristics.","Likewise, the invention encompasses the application of DNA shuffling technology to the evolution of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, wherein one or more cycles of DNA shuffling include, in addition to the gene template DNA, oligonucleotides coding for known allelic sequences, optimized codon sequences, known variant sequences, known polynucleotide polymorphism sequences, known ortholog sequences, known homologue sequences, additional homologous sequences, additional non-homologous sequences, sequences from another species, and any number and combination of the above.","In addition to the described methods above, there are a number of related methods that may also be applicable, or desirable in certain cases. Representative among these are the methods discussed in PCT applications WO 98\/31700, and WO 98\/32845, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Furthermore, related methods can also be applied to the polynucleotide sequences of the present invention in order to evolve invention for creating ideal variants for use in gene therapy, protein engineering, evolution of whole cells containing the variant, or in the evolution of entire enzyme pathways containing polynucleotides of the invention as described in PCT applications WO 98\/13485, WO 98\/13487, WO 98\/27230, WO 98\/31837, and Crameri, A., et al., Nat.

Briefly, RNA is isolated from the cell lines and used as a template for RT-PCR designed to amplify the VH and VL domains of the antibodies expressed by the EBV cell lines. Cells may be lysed using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) and extracted with one fifth volume of chloroform. After addition of chloroform, the solution is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant is collected and RNA is precipitated using an equal volume of isopropanol. Precipitated RNA is pelleted by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C in a tabletop centrifuge.","Following centrifugation, the supernatant is discarded and washed with 75% ethanol. Follwing the wash step, the RNA is centrifuged again at 800 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 C The supernatant is discarded and the pellet allowed to air dry. RNA is the dissolved in DEPC water and heated to 60 C for 10 minutes. Quantities of RNA can be determined using optical density measurements. cDNA may be synthesized, according to methods well-known in the art and\/or described herein, from 1.5\u20132.5 micrograms of RNA using reverse transciptase and random hexamer primers. cDNA is then used as a template for PCR amplification of VH and VL domains.","Primers used to amplify VH and VL genes are shown below.

Sometimes, when the amount of available RNA template is limiting, or for greater efficiency, groups of 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032primers may be used. For example, sometimes all five VH-5\u2032primers and all JH3\u2032primers are used in a single PCR reaction.

agarose gel. DNA bands of the expected sizes (\u2212506 base pairs for VH domains, and 344 base pairs for VL domains) can be cut out of the gel and purified using methods well known in the art and\/or described herein.","Purified PCR products can be ligated into a PCR cloning vector (TA vector from Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.). Individual cloned PCR products can be isolated after transfection of and blue\/white color selection. Cloned PCR products may then be sequenced using methods commonly known in the art and\/or described herein.","The PCR bands containing the VH domain and the VL domains can also be used to create full-length Ig expression vectors. VH and VL domains can be cloned into vectors containing the nucleotide sequences of a heavy (e.g., human IgG1 or human IgG4) or light chain (human kappa or human ambda) constant regions such that a complete heavy or light chain molecule could be expressed from these vectors when transfected into an appropriate host cell. Further, when cloned heavy and light chains are both expressed in one cell line (from either one or two vectors), they can assemble into a complete functional antibody molecule that is secreted into the cell culture medium. Methods using polynucleotides encoding VH and VL antibody domain to generate expression vectors that encode complete antibody molecules are well known within the art.","Method of Determining Alterations in a Gene Corresponding to a Polynucleotide","RNA isolated from entire families or individual patients presenting with a phenotype of interest (such as a disease) is be isolated. cDNA is then generated from these RNA samples using protocols known in the art. (See, Sambrook.) The cDNA is then used as a template for PCR, employing primers surrounding regions of interest in SEQ ID NO:1. Suggested PCR conditions consist of 35 cycles at 95 degrees C. for 30 seconds; 60\u2013120 seconds at 52\u201358 degrees C.; and 60\u2013120 seconds at 70 degrees C., using buffer solutions described in Sidransky et al., Science 252:706 (1991).","PCR products are then sequenced using primers labeled at their 5\u2032 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase, employing SequiTherm Polymerase. (Epicentre Technologies). The intron-exon borders of selected exons is also determined and genomic PCR products analyzed to confirm the results. PCR products harboring suspected mutations is then cloned and sequenced to validate the results of the direct sequencing.","PCR products is cloned into T-tailed vectors as described in Holton et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 19:1156 (1991) and sequenced with T7 polymerase (United States Biochemical). Affected individuals are identified by mutations not present in unaffected individuals.","Genomic rearrangements are also observed as a method of determining alterations in a gene corresponding to a polynucleotide. Genomic clones isolated according to Example 11 are nick-translated with digoxigenindeoxy-uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate (Boehringer Manheim), and FISH performed as described in Johnson et al., Methods Cell Biol. 35:73\u201399 (1991). Hybridization with the labeled probe is carried out using a vast excess of human cot-1 DNA for specific hybridization to the corresponding genomic locus.","Chromosomes are counterstained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylidole and propidium iodide, producing a combination of C- and R-bands. Aligned images for precise mapping are obtained using a triple-band filter set (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, Vt.) in combination with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, Ariz.) and variable excitation wavelength filters. (Johnson et al., Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl., 8:75 (1991).) Image collection, analysis and chromosomal fractional length measurements are performed using the ISee Graphical Program System. (Inovision Corporation, Durham, N.C.) Chromosome alterations of the genomic region hybridized by the probe are identified as insertions, deletions, and translocations. These alterations are used as a diagnostic marker for an associated disease.","Method of Detecting Abnormal Levels of a Polypeptide in a Biological Sample","A polypeptide of the present invention can be detected in a biological sample, and if an increased or decreased level of the polypeptide is detected, this polypeptide is a marker for a particular phenotype. Methods of detection are numerous, and thus, it is understood that one skilled in the art can modify the following assay to fit their particular needs.","For example, antibody-sandwich ELISAs are used to detect polypeptides in a sample, preferably a biological sample. Wells of a microtiter plate are coated with specific antibodies, at a final concentration of 0.2 to 10 ug\/ml. The antibodies are either monoclonal or polyclonal and are produced by the method described elsewhere herein. The wells are blocked so that non-specific binding of the polypeptide to the well is reduced.","The coated wells are then incubated for >2 hours at RT with a sample containing the polypeptide. Preferably, serial dilutions of the sample should be used to validate results. The plates are then washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded polypeptide.","Next, 50 ul of specific antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, at a concentration of 25\u2013400 ng, is added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates are again washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded conjugate.","Add 75 ul of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP) or p-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP) substrate solution to each well and incubate 1 hour at room temperature. Measure the reaction by a microtiter plate reader. Prepare a standard curve, using serial dilutions of a control sample, and plot polypeptide concentration on the X-axis (log scale) and fluorescence or absorbance of the Y-axis (linear scale). Interpolate the concentration of the polypeptide in the sample using the standard curve.","Formulation","The invention also provides methods of treatment and\/or prevention diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions (such as, for example, any one or more of the diseases or disorders disclosed herein) by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a Therapeutic. By therapeutic is meant a polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention (including fragments and variants), agonists or antagonists thereof, and\/or antibodies thereto, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier type (e.g., a sterile carrier).","The Therapeutic will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient (especially the side effects of treatment with the Therapeutic alone), the site of delivery, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The \u201ceffective amount\u201d for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.","As a general proposition, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of the Therapeutic administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 ug\/kg\/day to 10 mg\/kg\/day of patient body weight, although, as noted above, this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably, this dose is at least 0.01 mg\/kg\/day, and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg\/kg\/day for the hormone. If given continuously, the Therapeutic is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 ug\/kg\/hour to about 50 ug\/kg\/hour, either by 1\u20134 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions, for example, using a mini-pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed. The length of treatment needed to observe changes and the interval following treatment for responses to occur appears to vary depending on the desired effect.","Therapeutics can be administered orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, gels, drops or transdermal patch), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. \u201cPharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any.

Suitable examples of sustained-release Therapeutics are administered orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, gels, drops or transdermal patch), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. \u201cPharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The term \u201cparenteral\u201d as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.","Therapeutics of the invention may also be suitably administered by sustained-release systems. Suitable examples of sustained-release Therapeutics include suitable polymeric materials (such as, for example, semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules), suitable hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, and sparingly soluble derivatives (such as, for example, a sparingly soluble salt).","Sustained-release matrices include polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., Biopolymers 22:547\u2013556 (1983)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (Langer et al., J. Biomed.

Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200\u2013800 Angstroms) unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal Therapeutic.","In yet an additional embodiment, the Therapeutics of the invention are delivered by way of a pump (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)).","Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527\u20131533 (1990)).","For parenteral administration, in one embodiment, the Therapeutic is formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity, in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, or emulsion), with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. For example, the formulation preferably does not include oxidizing agents and other compounds that are known to be deleterious to the Therapeutic.","Generally, the formulations are prepared by contacting the Therapeutic uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then, if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier, more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein, as well as liposomes.","The carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetic acid, and other organic acids or their salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine or tripeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids, such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium; and\/or nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates, poloxamers, or PEG.","The Therapeutic will typically be formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg\/ml to 100 mg\/ml, preferably 1\u201310 mg\/ml, at a pH of about 3 to 8. It will be understood that the use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of polypeptide salts.","Any pharmaceutical used for therapeutic administration can be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g., 0.2 micron membranes). Therapeutics generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.","Therapeutics ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules or vials, as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. As an example of a lyophilized formulation, 10-ml vials are filled with 5 ml of sterile-filtered 1% (w\/v) aqueous Therapeutic solution, and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. The infusion solution is prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized Therapeutic using bacteriostatic Water-for-Injection.","The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the Therapeutics of the invention. Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.

While this activity has been particularly pronounced in cancer cells in response to the administration of chemotherapy regimens, a variety of other cell types and the administration of other drug classes have been noted (e.g., T-cells and anti-HIV drugs). In fact, certain mutations in the PGP gene significantly reduces PGP function, making it less able to force drugs out of cells. People who have two versions of the mutated gene\u2014one inherited from each parent\u2014have more than four times less PGP than those with two normal versions of the gene. People may also have one normal gene and one mutated one. Certain ethnic populations have increased incidence of such PGP mutations. Among individuals from Ghana, Kenya, the Sudan, as well as African Americans, frequency of the normal gene ranged from 73% to 84%. In contrast, the frequency was 34% to 59% among British whites, Portuguese, Southwest Asian, Chinese, Filipino and Saudi populations. As a result, certain ethnic populations may require increased administration of PGP antagonist in the formulation of the present invention to arrive at the an efficacious dose of the therapeutic (e.g., those from African descent). Conversely, certain ethnic populations, particularly those having increased frequency of the mutated PGP (e.g., of Caucasian descent, or non-African descent) may require less pharmaceutical compositions in the formulation due to an effective increase in efficacy of such compositions as a result of the increased effective absorption (e.g., less PGP activity) of said composition.","Moreover, in another specific embodiment, formulations of the present invention may further comprise antagonists of OATP2 (also referred to as the multiresistance protein, or MRP2), including antagonists of its encoding polynucleotides (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, zinc-finger proteins, etc.). The invention also further comprises any additional antagonists known to inhibit proteins thought to be attributable to a multidrug resistant phenotype in proliferating cells.","In an additional embodiment, the Therapeutics of the invention are administered in combination with Fibroblast Growth Factors. Fibroblast Growth Factors that may be administered with the Therapeutics of the invention include, but are not limited to, FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-3, FGF-4, FGF-5, FGF-6, FGF-7, FGF-8, FGF-9, FGF-10, FGF-11, FGF-12, FGF-13, FGF-14, and FGF-15.","In additional embodiments, the Therapeutics of the invention are administered in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic regimens, such as, for example, radiation therapy.","Method of Treating Decreased Levels of the Polypeptide","The present invention relates to a method for treating an individual in need of an increased level of a polypeptide of the invention in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an agonist of the invention (including polypeptides of the invention). Moreover, it will be appreciated that conditions caused by a decrease in the standard or normal expression level of a secreted protein in an individual can be treated by administering the polypeptide of the present invention, preferably in the secreted form. Thus, the invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of the polypeptide comprising administering to such an individual a Therapeutic comprising an amount of the polypeptide to increase the activity level of the polypeptide in such an individual.","For example, a patient with decreased levels of a polypeptide receives a daily dose 0.1\u2013100 ug\/kg of the polypeptide for six consecutive days. Preferably, the polypeptide is in the secreted form. The exact details of the dosing scheme, based on administration and formulation, are provided herein.","Method of Treating Increased Levels of the Polypeptide","The present invention also relates to a method of treating an individual in need of a decreased level of a polypeptide of the invention in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an antagonist of the invention (including polypeptides and antibodies of the invention).","In one example, antisense technology is used to inhibit production of a polypeptide of the present invention. This technology is one example of a method of decreasing levels of a polypeptide, preferably a secreted form, due to a variety of etiologies, such as cancer. For example, a patient diagnosed with abnormally increased levels of a polypeptide is administered intravenously antisense polynucleotides at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mg\/kg day for 21 days. This treatment is repeated after a 7-day rest period if the treatment was well tolerated. The formulation of the antisense polynucleotide is provided herein.","Method of Treatment Using Gene Therapy-Ex Vivo","One method of gene therapy transplants fibroblasts, which are capable of expressing a polypeptide, onto a patient. Generally, fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue-culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask, approximately ten pieces are placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down, closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature, the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media (e.g., Ham's F12 media, with 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin) is added. The flasks are then incubated at 37 degree C. for approximately one week.","At this time, fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture, a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks.","pMV-7 (Kirschmeier, P. T. et al., DNA, 7:219\u201325 (1988)), flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus, is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified, using glass beads.","The cDNA encoding a polypeptide of the present invention can be amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end sequences respectively as set forth in Example 11 using primers and having appropriate restriction sites and initiation\/stop codons, if necessary. Preferably, the 5\u2032 primer contains an EcoRi site and the 3\u2032 primer includes a HindIII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRi and HindIII fragment are added together, in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is then used to transform bacteria HB101, which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector has the gene of interest properly inserted.","The amphotropic pA317 or GP+am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum (CS), penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the gene (the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells).","Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells, and subsequently, the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media, containing the infectious viral particles, is filtered through a millipore filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub-confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high, then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low, then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker, such as neo or his. Once the fibroblasts have been efficiently infected, the fibroblasts are analyzed to determine whether protein is produced.","The engineered fibroblasts are then transplanted onto the host, either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads.","Gene Therapy Using Endogenous Genes Corresponding to Polynucleotides of the Invention","Another method of gene therapy according to the present invention involves operably associating the endogenous polynucleotide sequence of the invention with a promoter via homologous recombination as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No.: 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; International Publication NO:WO 96\/29411, published September 26, 1996; International Publication NO:WO 94\/12650, published Aug. 4, 1994; Koller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., Nature, 342:435\u2013438 (1989). This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells, but which is not expressed in the cells, or is expressed at a lower level than desired.","Polynucleotide constructs are made which contain a promoter and targeting sequences, which are homologous to the 5\u2032 non-coding sequence of endogenous polynucleotide sequence, flanking the promoter. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5\u2032 end of the polynucleotide sequence so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination. The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably, the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Preferably, the 3\u2032 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5\u2032 end of the amplified promoter and the 5\u2032 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3\u2032 end of the amplified promoter.","The amplified promoter and the amplified targeting sequences are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The digested promoter and digested targeting sequences are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The construct is size fractionated on an agarose gel then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.","In this Example, the polynucleotide constructs are administered as naked polynucleotides via electroporation. However, the polynucleotide constructs may also be administered with transfection-facilitating agents, such as liposomes, viral sequences, viral particles, precipitating agents, etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.","Once the cells are transfected, homologous recombination will take place which results in the promoter being operably linked to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence. This results in the expression of polynucleotide corresponding to the polynucleotide in the cell. Expression may be detected by immunological staining, or any other method known in the art.","Fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in DMEM+10% fetal calf serum. Exponentially growing or early stationary phase fibroblasts are trypsinized and rinsed from the plastic surface with nutrient medium. An aliquot of the cell suspension is removed for counting, and the remaining cells are subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant is aspirated and the pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of electroporation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2 HPO4, 6 mM dextrose). The cells are recentrifuged, the supernatant aspirated, and the cells resuspended in electroporation buffer containing 1 mg\/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. The final cell suspension contains approximately 3\u00d7106 cells\/ml. Electroporation should be performed immediately following resuspension.","Plasmid DNA is prepared according to standard techniques. For example, to construct a plasmid for targeting to the locus corresponding to the polynucleotide of the invention, plasmid pUC18 (MBI Fermentas, Amherst, N.Y.) is digested with HindIII. The CMV promoter is amplified by PCR with an XbaI site on the 5\u2032 end and a BamHI site on the 3\u2032 end. Two non-coding sequences are amplified via PCR: one non-coding sequence (fragment 1) is amplified with a HindIII site at the 5\u2032 end and an Xba site at the 3\u2032 end; the other non-coding sequence (fragment 2) is amplified with a BamHI site at the 5\u2032 end and a HindIII site at the 3\u2032 end. The CMV promoter and the fragments (1 and 2) are digested with the appropriate enzymes (CMV promoter\u2014XbaI and BamHI; fragment 1\u2014XbaI; fragment 2\u2014BamHI) and ligated together. The resulting ligation product is digested with HindIII, and ligated with the HindIII-digested pUC18 plasmid.","Plasmid DNA is added to a sterile cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad). The final DNA concentration is generally at least 120 \u03bcg\/ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension (containing approximately 1.5.\u00d7106 cells) is then added to the cuvette, and the cell suspension and DNA solutions are gently mixed. Electroporation is performed with a Gene-Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Capacitance and voltage are set at 960 \u03bcF and 250\u2013300 V, respectively. As voltage increases, cell survival decreases, but the percentage of surviving cells that stably incorporate the introduced DNA into their genome increases dramatically. Given these parameters, a pulse time of approximately 14\u201320 mSec should be observed.","Electroporated cells are maintained at room temperature for approximately 5 min, and the contents of the cuvette are then gently removed with a sterile transfer pipette. The cells are added directly to 10 ml of prewarmed nutrient media (DMEM with 15% calf serum) in a 10 cm dish and incubated at 37 degree C. The following day, the media is aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and incubated for a further 16\u201324 hours.","The engineered fibroblasts are then injected into the host, either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads. The fibroblasts now produce the protein product. The fibroblasts can then be introduced into a patient as described above.","Method of Treatment Using Gene Therapy\u2014In Vivo","Another aspect of the present invention is using in vivo gene therapy methods to treat disorders, diseases and conditions. The gene therapy method relates to the introduction of naked nucleic acid (DNA, RNA, and antisense DNA or RNA) sequences into an animal to increase or decrease the expression of the polypeptide. The polynucleotide of the present invention may be operatively linked to a promoter or any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques and methods are known in the art, see, for example, W090\/11092, W098\/11779; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,622, 5,705,151, 5,580,859; Tabata et al., Cardiovasc. Res. 35(3):470\u2013479 (1997); Chao et al., Pharmacol. Res. 35(6):517\u2013522 (1997); Wolff, Neuromuscul. Disord. 7(5):314\u2013318 (1997); Schwartz et al., Gene Ther. 3(5):405\u2013411 (1996); Tsurumi et al., Circulation 94(12):3281\u20133290 (1996) (incorporated herein by reference).","The polynucleotide constructs may be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal, such as, injection into the interstitial space of tissues (heart, muscle, skin, lung, liver, intestine and the like). The polynucleotide constructs can be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.","The term \u201cnaked\u201d polynucleotide, DNA or RNA, refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote, or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However, the polynucleotides of the present invention may also be delivered in liposome formulations (such as those taught in Felgner P. L. et al. (1995) Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 772:126\u2013139 and Abdallah B. et al. (1995) Biol. Cell 85(1):1\u20137) which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.","The polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of DNA. Unlike other gene therapies techniques, one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non-replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.","The polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid, mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues, elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers, collagen fibers of fibrous tissues, or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent, non-dividing cells which are differentiated, although delivery and expression may be achieved in non-differentiated or less completely differentiated cells, such as, for example, stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.","For the naked polynucleotide injection, an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 g\/kg body weight to about 50 mg\/kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration. The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However, other parenteral routes may also be used, such as, inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues, throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition, naked polynucleotide constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.","The dose response effects of injected polynucleotide in muscle in vivo is determined as follows. Suitable template DNA for production of mRNA coding for polypeptide of the present invention is prepared in accordance with a standard recombinant DNA methodology. The template DNA, which may be either circular or linear, is either used as naked DNA or complexed with liposomes. The quadriceps muscles of mice are then injected with various amounts of the template DNA.","Five to six week old female and male Balb\/C mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of 2.5% Avertin. A 1.5 cm incision is made on the anterior thigh, and the quadriceps muscle is directly visualized. The template DNA is injected in 0.1 ml of carrier in a 1 cc syringe through a 27 gauge needle over one minute, approximately 0.5 cm from the distal insertion site of the muscle into the knee and about 0.2 cm deep. A suture is placed over the injection site for future localization, and the skin is closed with stainless steel clips.","After an appropriate incubation time (e.g., 7 days) muscle extracts are prepared by excising the entire quadriceps. Every fifth 15 urn cross-section of the individual quadriceps muscles is histochemically stained for protein expression. A time course for protein expression may be done in a similar fashion except that quadriceps from different mice are harvested at different times. Persistence of DNA in muscle following injection may be determined by Southern blot analysis after preparing total cellular DNA and HIRT supernatants from injected and control mice. The results of the above experimentation in mice can be use to extrapolate proper dosages and other treatment parameters in humans and other animals using naked DNA.","Transgenic Animals","The polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed in transgenic animals. Animals of any species, including, but not limited to, mice, rats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, pigs, micro-pigs, goats, sheep, cows and non-human primates, e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment, techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art, are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans, as part of a gene therapy protocol.","Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene (i.e., polynucleotides of the invention) into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, pronuclear microinjection (Paterson et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 40:691\u2013698 (1994); Carver et al., Biotechnology (NY) 11: 1263\u20131270 (1993); Wright et al., Biotechnology (NY) 9:830\u2013834 (1991); and Hoppe et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 (1989)); retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines (Van der Putten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 82:6148\u20136152 (1985)), blastocysts or embryos; gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (Thompson et al., Cell 56:313\u2013321 (1989)); electroporation of cells or embryos (Lo, 1983, Mol Cell. Biol. 3:1803\u20131814 (1983)); introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun (see, e.g., Ulmer et al., Science 259:1745 (1993); introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pleuripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst; and sperm-mediated gene transfer (Lavitrano et al., Cell 57:717\u2013723 (1989); etc. For a review of such techniques, see Gordon, \u201cTransgenic Animals,\u201d Intl. Rev. Cytol. 115:171\u2013229 (1989), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention, for example, nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic, fetal, or adult cells induced to quiescence (Campell et al., Nature 380:64\u201366 (1996); Wilmut et al., Nature 385:810\u2013813 (1997)).","The present invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells, as well as animals which carry the transgene in some, but not all their cells, i.e., mosaic animals or chimeric. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers, e.g., head-to-head tandems or head-to-tail tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following, for example, the teaching of Lasko et al. (Lasko et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6232\u20136236 (1992)). The regulatory sequences required for such a cell-type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. When it is desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene, gene targeting is preferred. Briefly, when such a technique is to be utilized, vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating, via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences, into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type, thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type, by following, for example, the teaching of Gu et al. (Gu et al., Science 265:103\u2013106 (1994)). The regulatory sequences required for such a cell-type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","Once transgenic animals have been generated, the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include, but are not limited to, Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal, in situ hybridization analysis, and reverse transcriptase-PCR(RT-PCR). Samples of transgenic gene-expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product.","Once the founder animals are produced, they may be bred, inbred, outbred, or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include, but are not limited to: outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines; inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene; crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis; crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines; and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest.","Transgenic animals of the invention have uses which include, but are not limited to, animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of polypeptides of the present invention, studying diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with aberrant expression, and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions.","Knock-Out Animals","Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or \u201cknocking out\u201d the gene and\/or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. (E.g., see Smithies et al., Nature 317:230\u2013234 (1985); Thomas & Capecchi, Cell 51:503\u2013512 (1987); Thompson et al., Cell 5:313\u2013321 (1989); each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). For example, a mutant, non-functional polynucleotide of the invention (or a completely unrelated DNA sequence) flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence (either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene) can be used, with or without a selectable marker and\/or a negative selectable marker, to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment, techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain, but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct, via targeted homologous recombination, results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene (e.g., see Thomas & Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989, supra). However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","In further embodiments of the invention, cells that are genetically engineered to express the polypeptides of the invention, or alternatively, that are genetically engineered not to express the polypeptides of the invention (e.g., knockouts) are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient (i.e., animal, including human) or an MHC compatible donor and can include, but are not limited to fibroblasts, bone marrow cells, blood cells (e.g., lymphocytes), adipocytes, muscle cells, endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells, or alternatively, to disrupt the coding sequence and\/or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention, e.g., by transduction (using viral vectors, and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome) or transfection procedures, including, but not limited to, the use of plasmids, cosmids, YACs, naked DNA, electroporation, liposomes, etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter\/enhancer to achieve expression, and preferably secretion, of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically, e.g., in the circulation, or intraperitoneally.","Alternatively, the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body, e.g., genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft; genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. (See, for example, Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,349; and Mulligan & Wilson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","When the cells to be administered are non-autologous or non-MHC compatible cells, they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example, the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which, while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment, does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.","Transgenic and \u201cknock-out\u201d animals of the invention have uses which include, but are not limited to, animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of polypeptides of the present invention, studying diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions associated with aberrant expression, and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions.","Production of an Antibody","a) Hybridoma Technology","The antibodies of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods. (See, Current Protocols, Chapter 2. ) As one example of such methods, cells expressing HGRA4 are administered to an animal to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies. In a preferred method, a preparation of HGRA4 protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity.","Monoclonal antibodies specific for protein HGRA4 are prepared using hybridoma technology. (Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292 (1976); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, Elsevier, N.Y., pp. 563\u2013681 (1981)). In general, an animal (preferably a mouse) is immunized with HGRA4 polypeptide or, more preferably, with a secreted HGRA4 polypeptide-expressing cell. Such polypeptide-expressing cells are cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium, preferably in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated at about 56\u00b0 C.), and supplemented with about 10 g\/l of nonessential amino acids, about 1,000 U\/ml of penicillin, and about 100 \u03bcg\/ml of streptomycin.","The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention; however, it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line (SP20), available from the ATCC. After fusion, the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium, and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. (Gastroenterology 80:225\u2013232 (1981)). The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the HGRA4 polypeptide.","Alternatively, additional antibodies capable of binding to HGRA4 polypeptide can be produced in a two-step procedure using anti-idiotypic antibodies. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens, and therefore, it is possible to obtain an antibody which binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method, protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal, preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells, and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones which produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the HGRA4 protein-specific antibody can be blocked by HGRA4. Such antibodies comprise anti-idiotypic antibodies to the HGRA4 protein-specific antibody and are used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further HGRA4 protein-specific antibodies.","For in vivo use of antibodies in humans, an antibody is \u201chumanized\u201d. Such antibodies can be produced using genetic constructs derived from hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibodies described above. Methods for producing chimeric and humanized antibodies are known in the art and are discussed herein.

No. 5,885,793 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","Rescue of the Library. A library of scFvs is constructed from the RNA of human PBLs as described in PCT publication WO 92\/01047. To rescue phage displaying antibody fragments, approximately 109 harboring the phagemid are used to inoculate 50 ml of 2xTY containing 1% glucose and 100 \u03bcg\/ml of ampicillin (2xTY-AMP-GLU) and grown to an O.D. of 0.8 with shaking. Five ml of this culture is used to inoculate 50 ml of 2xTY-AMP-GLU, 2\u00d7108 TU of delta gene 3 helper (M13 delta gene III, see PCT publication WO 92\/01047) are added and the culture incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes without shaking and then at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes with shaking. The culture is centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 min. and the pellet resuspended in 2 liters of 2xTY containing 100 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin and 50 ug\/ml kanamycin and grown overnight. Phage are prepared as described in PCT publication WO 92\/01047.","M13 delta gene III is prepared as follows: M13 delta gene III helper phage does not encode gene III protein, hence the phage(mid) displaying antibody fragments have a greater avidity of binding to antigen. Infectious M13 delta gene III particles are made by growing the helper phage in cells harboring a pUC19 derivative supplying the wild type gene III protein during phage morphogenesis. The culture is incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. without shaking and then for a further hour at 37\u00b0 C. with shaking. Cells are spun down (IEC-Centra 8,400 r.p.m. for 10 min), resuspended in 300 ml 2xTY broth containing 100 \u03bcg ampicillin\/ml and 25 \u03bcg kanamycin\/ml (2xTY-AMP-KAN) and grown overnight, shaking at 37\u00b0 C. Phage particles are purified and concentrated from the culture medium by two PEG-precipitations (Sambrook et al., 1990), resuspended in 2 ml PBS and passed through a 0.45 pm filter (Minisart NML; Sartorius) to give a final concentration of approximately 1013 transducing units\/ml (ampicillin-resistant clones).","Panning of the Library. Immunotubes (Nunc) are coated overnight in PBS with 4 ml of either 100 \u03bcg\/ml or 10 \u03bcg\/ml of a polypeptide of the present invention. Tubes are blocked with 2% Marvel-PBS for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and then washed 3 times in PBS. Approximately 1013 TU of phage is applied to the tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature tumbling on an over and under turntable and then left to stand for another 1.5 hours. Tubes are washed 10 times with PBS 0.1% Tween-20 and 10 times with PBS. Phage are eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine and rotating 15 minutes on an under and over turntable after which the solution is immediately neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.0M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Phage are then used to infect 10 ml of mid-log TG1 by incubating eluted phage with bacteria for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The are then plated on TYE plates containing 1% glucose and 100 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin. The resulting bacterial library is then rescued with delta gene 3 helper phage as described above to prepare phage for a subsequent round of selection. This process is then repeated for a total of 4 rounds of affinity purification with tube-washing increased to 20 times with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 and 20 times with PBS for rounds 3 and 4.","Characterization of Binders. Eluted phage from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection are used to infect HB 2151 and soluble scFv is produced (Marks, et al., 1991) from single colonies for assay. ELISAs are performed with microtitre plates coated with either 10 pg\/ml of the polypeptide of the present invention in 50 mM bicarbonate pH 9.6. Clones positive in ELISA are further characterized by PCR fingerprinting (see, e.g., PCT publication WO 92\/01047) and then by sequencing. These ELISA positive clones may also be further characterized by techniques known in the art, such as, for example, epitope mapping, binding affinity, receptor signal transduction, ability to block or competitively inhibit antibody\/antigen binding, and competitive agonistic or antagonistic activity.","Biological Effects of Polypeptides of the Invention","Astrocyte and Neuronal Assays","Recombinant polypeptides of the invention, expressed in and purified as described above, can be tested for activity in promoting the survival, neurite outgrowth, or phenotypic differentiation of cortical neuronal cells and for inducing the proliferation of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunopositive cells, astrocytes. The selection of cortical cells for the bioassay is based on the prevalent expression of FGF-1 and FGF-2 in cortical structures and on the previously reported enhancement of cortical neuronal survival resulting from FGF-2 treatment. A thymidine incorporation assay, for example, can be used to elucidate a polypeptide of the invention's activity on these cells.","Moreover, previous reports describing the biological effects of FGF-2 (basic FGF) on cortical or hippocampal neurons in vitro have demonstrated increases in both neuron survival and neurite outgrowth (Walicke et al., \u201cFibroblast growth factor promotes survival of dissociated hippocampal neurons and enhances neurite extension.\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:3012\u20133016. (1986), assay herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). However, reports from experiments done on PC-12 cells suggest that these two responses are not necessarily synonymous and may depend on not only which FGF is being tested but also on which receptor(s) are expressed on the target cells. Using the primary cortical neuronal culture paradigm, the ability of a polypeptide of the invention to induce neurite outgrowth can be compared to the response achieved with FGF-2 using, for example, a thymidine incorporation assay.","Fibroblast and endothelial cell assays","Human lung fibroblasts are obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, Calif.) and maintained in growth media from Clonetics. Dermal microvascular endothelial cells are obtained from Cell Applications (San Diego, Calif.). For proliferation assays, the human lung fibroblasts and dermal microvascular endothelial cells can be cultured at 5,000 cells\/well in a 96-well plate for one day in growth medium. The cells are then incubated for one day in 0.1% BSA basal medium. After replacing the medium with fresh 0.1% BSA medium, the cells are incubated with the test proteins for 3 days. Alamar Blue (Alamar Biosciences, Sacramento, Calif.) is added to each well to a final concentration of 10%. The cells are incubated for 4 hr. Cell viability is measured by reading in a CytoFluor fluorescence reader. For the PGE2 assays, the human lung fibroblasts are cultured at 5,000 cells\/well in a 96-well plate for one day. After a medium change to 0.1% BSA basal medium, the cells are incubated with FGF-2 or polypeptides of the invention with or without IL-1 (for 24 hours. The supernatants are collected and assayed for PGE2 by EIA kit (Cayman, Ann Arbor, Mich.). For the IL-6 assays, the human lung fibroblasts are cultured at 5,000 cells\/well in a 96-well plate for one day. After a medium change to 0.1% BSA basal medium, the cells are incubated with FGF-2 or with or without polypeptides of the invention IL-1 (for 24 hours. The supernatants are collected and assayed for IL-6 by ELISA kit (Endogen, Cambridge, Mass.).","Human lung fibroblasts are cultured with FGF-2 or polypeptides of the invention for 3 days in basal medium before the addition of Alamar Blue to assess effects on growth of the fibroblasts. FGF-2 should show a stimulation at 10\u20132500 ng\/ml which can be used to compare stimulation with polypeptides of the invention.","Parkinson Models","The loss of motor function in Parkinson's disease is attributed to a deficiency of striatal dopamine resulting from the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection neurons. An animal model for Parkinson's that has been extensively characterized involves the systemic administration of 1-methyl-4 phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). In the CNS, MPTP is taken-up by astrocytes and catabolized by monoamine oxidase B to 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridine (MPP+) and released. Subsequently, MPP+ is actively accumulated in dopaminergic neurons by the high-affinity reuptake transporter for dopamine. MPP+ is then concentrated in mitochondria by the electrochemical gradient and selectively inhibits nicotidamide adenine disphosphate: ubiquinone oxidoreductionase (complex I), thereby interfering with electron transport and eventually generating oxygen radicals.","It has been demonstrated in tissue culture paradigms that FGF-2 (basic FGF) has trophic activity towards nigral dopaminergic neurons (Ferrari et al., Dev. Biol. 1989). Recently, Dr. Unsicker's group has demonstrated that administering FGF-2 in gel foam implants in the striatum results in the near complete protection of nigral dopaminergic neurons from the toxicity associated with MPTP exposure (Otto and Unsicker, J. Neuroscience, 1990).","Based on the data with FGF-2, polypeptides of the invention can be evaluated to determine whether it has an action similar to that of FGF-2 in enhancing dopaminergic neuronal survival in vitro and it can also be tested in vivo for protection of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum from the damage associated with MPTP treatment. The potential effect of a polypeptide of the invention is first examined in vitro in a dopaminergic neuronal cell culture paradigm. The cultures are prepared by dissecting the midbrain floor plate from gestation day 14 Wistar rat embryos. The tissue is dissociated with trypsin and seeded at a density of 200,000 cells\/cm2 on polyorthinine-laminin coated glass coverslips. The cells are maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium and F12 medium containing hormonal supplements (N1). The cultures are fixed with paraformaldehyde after 8 days in vitro and are processed for tyrosine hydroxylase, a specific marker for dopaminergic neurons, immunohistochemical staining. Dissociated cell cultures are prepared from embryonic rats. The culture medium is changed every third day and the factors are also added at that time.","Since the dopaminergic neurons are isolated from animals at gestation day 14, a developmental time which is past the stage when the dopaminergic precursor cells are proliferating, an increase in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons would represent an increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons surviving in vitro. Therefore, if a polypeptide of the invention acts to prolong the survival of dopaminergic neurons, it would suggest that the polypeptide may be involved in Parkinson's Disease.","One skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention.","Inhibition of PDGF-induced Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation Sfimulatory Effect","HAoSMC proliferation can be measured, for example, by BrdUrd incorporation. Briefly, subconfluent, quiescent cells grown on the 4-chamber slides are transfected with CRP or FITC-labeled AT2-3LP. Then, the cells are pulsed with 10% calf serum and 6 mg\/ml BrdUrd. After 24 h, immunocytochemistry is performed by using BrdUrd Staining Kit (Zymed Laboratories). In brief, the cells are incubated with the biotinylated mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody at 4 degrees C. for 2 h after being exposed to denaturing solution and then incubated with the streptavidin-peroxidase and diaminobenzidine. After counterstaining with hematoxylin, the cells are mounted for microscopic examination, and the BrdUrd-positive cells are counted. The BrdUrd index is calculated as a percent of the BrdUrd-positive cells to the total cell number. In addition, the simultaneous detection of the BrdUrd staining (nucleus) and the FITC uptake (cytoplasm) is performed for individual cells by the concomitant use of bright field illumination and dark field-UV fluorescent illumination. See, Hayashida et al., J. Biol. Chem. 6:271(36):21985\u201321992 (1996).","One skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention.","Effect of Polypepides of the Invention on Cord Formation in Angiogenesis","Another step in angiogenesis is cord formation, marked by differentiation of endothelial cells. This bioassay measures the ability of microvascular endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures (hollow structures) when cultured in vitro.","CADMEC (microvascular endothelial cells) are purchased from Cell Applications, Inc. as proliferating (passage 2) cells and are cultured in Cell Applications' CADMEC Growth Medium and used at passage 5. For the in vitro angiogenesis assay, the wells of a 48-well cell culture plate are coated with Cell Applications' Attachment Factor Medium (200 ml\/well) for 30 min. at 37\u00b0 C. CADMEC are seeded onto the coated wells at 7,500 cells\/well and cultured overnight in Growth Medium. The Growth Medium is then replaced with 300 mg Cell Applications' Chord Formation Medium containing control buffer or a polypeptide of the invention (0.1 to 100 ng\/ml) and the cells are cultured for an additional 48 hr. The numbers and lengths of the capillary-like chords are quantitated through use of the Boeckeler VIA-170 video image analyzer. All assays are done in triplicate.","Commercial (R&D) VEGF (50 ng\/ml) is used as a positive control. b-esteradiol (1 ng\/ml) is used as a negative control. The appropriate buffer (without protein) is also utilized as a control.","One skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention.","It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing description and examples.
