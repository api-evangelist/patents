{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/351,946, filed Jan. 12, 2009 entitled \u201cCapacitor for Filtered Feedthrough with Conductive Pad\u201d, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates to electrical feedthroughs for implantable medical devices and, more particularly, an improved capacitor assembly for a filtered feedthrough.","The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent the work is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.","Electrical feedthroughs serve the purpose of providing an electrical circuit path extending from the interior of a hermetically sealed container to an external point outside the container. A conductive path is provided through the feedthrough by a conductor pin which is electrically insulated from the container. Many feedthroughs are known in the art that provide the electrical path and seal the electrical container from its ambient environment. Such feedthroughs typically include a ferrule, the conductor pin or lead and a hermetic glass or ceramic seal which supports the pin within the ferrule. Such feedthroughs are typically used in electrical medical devices such as implantable pulse generators (IPGs). It is known that such electrical devices can, under some circumstances, be susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). At certain frequencies for example, EMI can inhibit pacing in an IPG. This problem has been addressed by incorporating a capacitor structure within the feedthrough ferrule, thus shunting any EMI at the entrance to the IPG for high frequencies. This has been accomplished with the aforementioned capacitor device by combining it with the feedthrough and incorporating it directly into the feedthrough ferrule. Typically, the capacitor electrically contacts the pin lead and the ferrule.","Many different insulator structures and related mounting methods are known in the art for use in medical devices wherein the insulator structure also provides a hermetic seal to prevent entry of body fluids into the housing of the medical device. The feedthrough terminal pins, however, are connected to one or more lead wires which effectively act as an antenna and thus tend to collect stray or electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals for transmission to the interior of the medical device. In some prior art devices, ceramic chip capacitors are added to the internal electronics to filter and thus control the effects of such interference signals. This internal, so-called \u201con-board\u201d filtering technique has potentially serious disadvantages due to intrinsic parasitic resonances of the chip capacitors and EMI radiation entering the interior of the device housing.","In another and normally preferred approach, a filter capacitor is combined directly with a terminal pin assembly to decouple interference signals to the housing of the medical device. In a typical construction, a coaxial feedthrough filter capacitor is connected to a feedthrough assembly to suppress and decouple undesired interference or noise transmission along a terminal pin.","So-called discoidal capacitors having two sets of electrode plates embedded in spaced relation within an insulative substrate or base typically form a ceramic monolith in such capacitors. One set of the electrode plates is electrically connected at an inner diameter surface of the discoidal structure to the conductive terminal pin utilized to pass the desired electrical signal or signals. The other or second set of electrode plates is coupled at an outer diameter surface of the discoidal capacitor to a cylindrical ferrule of conductive material, wherein the ferrule is electrically connected in turn to the conductive housing or case of the electronic instrument.","In operation, the discoidal capacitor permits passage of relatively low frequency electrical signals along the terminal pin, while shunting and shielding undesired interference signals of typically high frequency to the conductive housing. Feedthrough capacitors of this general type are commonly employed in implantable pacemakers, defibrillators and the like, wherein a device housing is constructed from a conductive biocompatible metal such as titanium and is electrically coupled to the feedthrough filter capacitor. The filter capacitor and terminal pin assembly prevent interference signals from entering the interior of the device housing, where such interference signals might otherwise adversely affect a desired function such as pacing or defibrillating.","In the past, feedthrough filter capacitors for heart pacemakers and the like have typically been constructed by preassembly of the discoidal capacitor with a terminal pin subassembly which includes the conductive terminal pin and ferrule. More specifically, the terminal pin subassembly is prefabricated to include one or more conductive terminal pins supported within the conductive ferrule by means of a hermetically sealed insulator ring or bead. See, for example, the terminal pin subassemblies disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,920,888, 4,152,540; 4,421,947; and 4,424,551. The terminal pin subassembly thus defines a small annular space or gap disposed radially between the inner terminal pin and the outer ferrule. A small discoidal capacitor of appropriate size and shape is then installed into this annular space or gap, in conductive relation with the terminal pin and ferrule, e.g., by means of soldering or conductive adhesive. The thus-constructed feedthrough capacitor assembly is then mounted within an opening in the pacemaker housing, with the conductive ferrule in electrical and hermetically sealed relation in respect of the housing, shield or container of the medical device.","Although feedthrough filter capacitor assemblies of the type described above have performed in a generally satisfactory manner, the manufacture and installation of such filter capacitor assemblies has been relatively costly and difficult. For example, installation of the discoidal capacitor into the small annular space between the terminal pin and ferrule can be a difficult and complex multi-step procedure to ensure formation of reliable, high quality electrical connections. Moreover, installation of the capacitor at this location inherently limits the capacitor to a small size and thus also limits the capacitance thereof. Similarly, subsequent attachment of the conductive ferrule to the pacemaker housing, typically by welding or brazing processes or the like, can expose the fragile ceramic discoidal capacitor to temperature variations sufficient to create the risk of capacitor cracking and failure. As described above, a solder, e.g., in the form of a solder preform, may be used to connect the terminal pins with the capacitor. Unfortunately, solder preforms are susceptible to oxidation that may affect the conductivity of the solder and the ability to make a good electrical connection between the pin and the capacitor. Current manufacturing techniques utilize a chemical etching process to remove the formed oxide layers, adding an additional step and expense to the manufacturing process.","There exists, therefore, a significant need for improvements in feedthrough filter capacitor assemblies of the type used, for example, in implantable medical devices such as heart pacemakers and the like, wherein the filter capacitor is designed for relatively simplified and economical, yet highly reliable, installation. In addition, there exists a need for an improved feedthrough assembly that provides reliable and economical electrical connections between the capacitor and feedthrough pins without performing a chemical etching or other process to remove oxide layers from the solder preforms. The present disclosure fulfills these needs and provides further advantages.","In various embodiments of the present disclosure, a filtered feedthrough assembly is disclosed. The assembly includes a capacitor that has a top portion, a bottom portion, an outer diameter portion and an inner diameter portion. The inner diameter portion defines at least one aperture extending from the top portion to the bottom portion. The capacitor further includes a conductive annular member around the at least one aperture. At least one feedthrough pin extends through the at least one aperture and is soldered to the inner diameter portion of the capacitor by application of a solder preform upon the conductive pad of conductive material. Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description, the claims and the drawings. The detailed description and specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.","The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.","With reference to , an implantable medical device (IMD)  can include implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices, neurostimulators, drug pumps or combinations thereof. Exemplary IMDs are commercially available as including one generally known to those skilled in the art, such as the Medtronic CONCERTO\u2122, SENSIA\u2122, VIRTUOSO\u2122, RESTORE\u2122, RESTORE ULTRA\u2122, sold by Medtronic, Inc. of Minnesota. IMD  can include an implantable case, housing or body assembly . Implantable case  can be formed of appropriate materials and include appropriate features, such as a hermetically sealed body wall . Body wall comprises substantially conductive material such as titanium.","Contained within or associated with case  can be a power device  such as one or more batteries and\/or capacitors encased in housing or case body wall , a controller assembly , and a connector body . Controller assembly  can include a circuit board having a processor, memory, transmitter, receiver, and\/or other appropriate portions. Connector body  can extend from or be integrated with case . At its distal end, connector body  can include one or more ports that interconnects with one or more connector terminals of one or more lead assemblies . Exemplary connector bodies  can include IS-1 connectors, IS-4 connectors or other suitable connectors. Lead assemblies generally include respective lead bodies each having a respective tip electrode . For example, the first lead assembly can include an active tip electrode and the second lead assembly can include a passive tip electrode ","At its distal end, connector body  is connected via connectors or set screws  to lead assemblies . Set screws  force lead assemblies in place to form an electrical connection via connector body , which, at its proximal end, is connected to a filtered feedthrough electronic module assembly (FFEMA) , as depicted in . FFEMA  electrically connects circuitry inside a sealed case of the IMD to a connector body , which connects with external components that extend outside of the housing. FFEMA  comprises an electronic module assembly (EMA)  connected to a feedthrough assembly . The EMA  is composed of a non-conductive block, referred to as an electronic module block (EMB) , with a set of conductive strips  or conductive elements connected to the EMB.","Referring now to , an exploded view of a capacitor feedthrough assembly  according to various embodiments of the present disclosure is illustrated. The assembly  comprises a ferrule , a plurality of conductor pins -, a capacitor , a spacer portion , a solder bead  and a plurality of solder preforms -","The assembly  may be manufactured in the following manner. Feedthrough pins -are inserted through ferrule . In one direction, feedthrough pins -extend outside the implanted medical device (not shown), which is hermetically sealed with the bottom portion of the ferrule . In the opposite direction, conductor pins -extend through a spacer portion  and capacitor  and into the internal portion of the medical device. The spacer portion  provides support for the capacitor , and may also inhibit or reduce the flow of solder into the hermetically sealed part of the feedthrough. Once the spacer portion  and capacitor  are positioned within the top portion of the ferrule , electrical connections between the capacitor  and conductor pins -may be formed.","Referring now to , a capacitor  according to various embodiments of the present disclosure is illustrated. The capacitor  includes an outer diameter portion  that may substantially surround the capacitor , a top portion  and bottom portion . A plurality of feedthrough holes -may extend completely through the body of the capacitor  to provide an opening between top portion  and bottom portion . As best illustrated in , inner diameter portion or portions -are present in the capacitor , and, thus, define the plurality of feedthrough holes . The outer diameter portion  and inner diameter portion  are each connected to one of the two sets of electrode plates that comprise the capacitor  and are electrically isolated from one another. In the capacitor feedthrough assembly of , the outer diameter portion  is electrically coupled to the ferrule  by means of solder bead  and the inner diameter portion  is coupled to the conductor pins -by solder preforms -","A reliable electrical connection between the outer diameter portion  and ferrule  may be made by the solder bead . In one method of assembly according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the solder bead  is placed on top of the capacitor  within the top portion of ferrule . A chamfer  may be formed on the top portion  of capacitor . The chamfer  will bias the placement of solder bead  such that proper placement of solder bead  is assured. Solder preforms -may comprise circular or semi-circular rings of solder material, although the use of other shapes (square, rectangular, triangular, etc.) for the solder preforms -are within the scope of this disclosure. Each of the solder preforms -receive one of the conductor pins -such that the solder preform  rests on the top portion  of capacitor . Once the solder beads  and solder preforms  are present on the capacitor , a solder reflow process is performed, which is described more fully below, in which heat is applied to melt the solder bead  and solder preforms  in order to electrically connect the ferrule  with the outer diameter portion  and conductor pins  to the inner diameter portion . Heat can be applied to assembly  by placing assembly  into an oven under vacuum. Alternatively, assembly  can also be heated with a heat gun or laser.","In various embodiments, solder preforms -may comprise fluxless solder. Exemplary fluxless solder can include 90% Indium-10% silver solder alloy. As described above, oxidation may create an oxide layer on the solder preforms, which will inhibit a reliable electrical connection. An oxide layer on the solder preform, and\/or oxide formed on the capacitor , will inhibit the flow of the solder into the holes -and, thus, may lead to inconsistent or imperfect connections between the inner diameter portion and conductor pins -of the capacitor feedthrough assembly . In order to ensure adequate flow of the solder, a washer may be placed on the top portion  of the capacitor  surrounding each of the holes -, as shown in .","The conductive pad may be applied to the top portion  by any means, including, but not limited to, sputtering, manual application, screen printing, ink jet printing, or even application of the capacitor termination material present on the inner diameter portion . The presence of the conductive pad  provides an enhanced flow of solder from the solder preform  into the holes  of the inner diameter portion  surrounding the conductor pins , even if the solder preform has an oxide layer formed on its outside.","Once the capacitor\/feedthrough assembly is assembled and the solder bead  and solder preforms -are present on the capacitor , a solder reflow process is performed. The solder reflow process liquefies the solder bead  and solder preforms  such that solder flows to electrically connect the outer diameter portion  and inner diameter portion  to the ferrule  and conductor pins , respectively. The presence of the conductive pads  enhance the solder flow such that the connection between the conductor pins  and inner diameter portion  of capacitor  is ensured.","Solder bead , in various embodiments of the present disclosure, may be replaced by a different conductive adhesive, e.g., conductive epoxy or brazing. Furthermore, as stated above, the conductive pads may be formed of any conductive material, e.g., gold, silver or silver-palladium. The conductive pads may be formed during the capacitor manufacturing process or may be added to a fully formed capacitor after its manufacture. The solder preforms  may be circular of a washer-shaped construction in which the inner diameter is only slightly larger than the diameter of the conductor pins  such that proper placement of the solder preforms  surrounding the conductor pins  is assured. In various embodiments, a counterbore or countersink may be formed around the holes  of the capacitor  to further assist in the placement of the solder preforms , similar to the chamfer  present on the outer diameter portion  in .","Numerous alternative embodiments exist to bonded pad  for ensuring adequate flow of the solder performs . For example, a preformed washer or annular member , shown in , and A-B, may be placed on the top portion  of the capacitor  surrounding each of the holes -. In particular, a preformed annular member  can be placed over each feedthrough hole -. Annular member  includes an aperture  that is only slightly larger than the diameter of the conductor pins  such that proper placement of the annular member  surrounding the conductor pins  is assured. Annular member  comprises substrate , barrier material , anti-oxidation material . Substrate  can be formed of a metallic material, ceramic material or other suitable material. Exemplary metallic materials used to form substrate  includes aluminum, copper, or stainless steel whereas ceramic material can include alumina. Barrier material  directly contacts a surface of washer . Barrier material  reacts with solder and prevents solder from reacting beyond barrier material . Barrier material  typically comprises nickel to slow a reaction rate of solder during the reflow process. Nickel also ensures that the solder does not react with silver in a silver palladium termination point (not shown) on the capacitor and cause the silver to leach out, which, in turn, could cause the termination point to delaminate from the capacitor  itself. Termination point is the area where silver palladium covers the inner diameter portion  shown .","Plating or sputter coating can be used to introduce or place barrier material  over washer . The barrier material  comprises nickel; however, other suitable material can be used as well. It will be appreciated that if a plating process is used and nickel is used as a base material, another layer of nickel barrier layer is not required to form barrier material . Instead, the base material of nickel serves as the barrier material . In this scenario, gold is plated over the nickel substrate  to form annular member .","An anti-oxidation material  is then placed over or onto barrier material . Anti-oxidation material  can comprise gold, silver, silver-palladium, platinum, platinum-iridium, gold-beryllium, copper, copper-beryllium, nickel, titanium or any combination thereof.","By using annular member  instead of sputter coating conductive pad  onto top portion , a mask design, typically used in sputter coating, is eliminated. Additionally, washer  eliminates engineering time used to design a new mask for each new design of a capacitor. The same annular member  or ring can be used in multiple capacitor designs. Furthermore, over-sputtering of layers of gold or nickel is eliminated.","It will be appreciated that in one or more embodiments, an annular member  can be used with any capacitor for a filtered feedthrough assembly that is formed for an implantable medical device. regardless of whether solder preforms are used. The broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples, the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent upon a study of the drawings, the specification, and the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["The present disclosure will become more fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5"],"b":["7","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
