title: Method and apparatus for processing two or more initially decoded audio signals received or replayed from a bitstream
abstract: In the MPEG-4 standard ISO/IEC 14496:2001 several audio objects that can be coded with different MPEG-4 format coding types can together form a composed audio system representing a single soundtrack from the several audio substreams. In a receiver the multiple audio objects are decoded separately, but not directly played back to a listener. Instead, transmitted instructions for mixdown are used to prepare a single soundtrack. Mixdown conflicts can occur in case the audio signals to be combined have different channel numbers or configurations. According to the invention an additional audio channel configuration node is used that tags the correct channel configuration information items to the decoded audio data streams to be presented. The invention enables the content provider to set the channel configuration in such a way that the presenter at receiver side can produce a correct channel presentation under all circumstances. An escape code value in the channel configuration data facilitates correct handling of not yet defined channel combinations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7365 of International Application PCT\/EP03\/13172, filed Nov. 24, 2003, which was published in accordance with PCT Article 21(2) on Jun. 17, 2004 in English and which claims the benefit of European patent application No. 02026779.5, filed Dec. 2, 2002 and European patent application No. 02026779.5, filed Dec. 2, 2002.","The invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for processing two or more initially decoded audio signals received or replayed from a bitstream, that each have a different number of channels and\/or different channel configurations, and that are combined before being presented in a final channel configuration.","In the MPEG-4 standard ISO\/IEC 14496:2001, in particular in part 3 Audio and in part 1 Systems, several audio objects that can be coded with different MPEG-4 format coding types can together form a composed audio system representing a single soundtrack from the several audio substreams. User interaction, terminal capability, and speaker configuration may be used when determining how to produce a single soundtrack from the component objects. Audio composition means mixing multiple individual audio objects to create a single soundtrack, e.g. a single channel or a single stereo pair. A set of instructions for mixdown is transmitted or transferred in the bitstream. In a receiver the multiple audio objects are decoded separately, but not directly played back to a listener. Instead, the transmitted instructions for mixdown are used to prepare a single soundtrack from the decoded audio objects. This final soundtrack is then played for the listener.","ISO\/IEC 14496:2001 is the second version of the MPEG-4 Audio standard, whereas ISO\/IEC 14496 is the first version. In the above MPEG-4 Audio standard nodes for presenting audio are described. Header streams that contain configuration information, which is necessary for decoding the audio substreams are transported via MPEG-4 Systems. In a simple audio scene the channel configuration of the audio decoder\u2014for example 5.1 multichannel\u2014can be fed inside the Compositor from one node to the following node so that the channel configuration information can reach the presenter, which is responsible for the correct loudspeaker mapping. The presenter represents that final part of the audio chain which is no more under the control of the broadcaster or content provider, e.g. an audio amplifier having volume control and the attached loudspeakers.","\u2018Node\u2019 means a processing step or unit used in the above MPEG-4 standard, e.g. an interface carrying out time synchronisation between a decoder and subsequent processing units, or a corresponding interface between the presenter and an upstream processing unit. In general, in ISO\/IEC 14496-1:2001 the scene description is represented using a parametric approach. The description consists of an encoded hierarchy or tree of nodes with attributes and other information including event sources and targets. Leaf nodes in this tree correspond to elementary audio-visual data, whereas intermediate nodes group this material to form audio-visual objects, and perform e.g. grouping and transformation on such audio-visual objects (scene description nodes).","Audio decoders either have a predetermined channel configuration by definition, or receive e.g. some configuration information items for setting their channel configuration.","Normally, in an audio processing tree the channel configuration of the audio decoders can be used for the loudspeaker mapping occurring after passing the sound node, see ISO\/IEC 14496-3:2001, chapter 1.6.3.4 Channel Configuration. Therefore, as shown in , an MPEG-4 player implementation passes these information items, that are transmitted within a received MPEG-4 bitstream, together with the decoder output or outputs through the audio nodes AudioSource and Sound2D to the presenter. The channel configuration data ChannelConfig is to be used by the presenter to make the correct loudspeaker association, especially in case of multi-channel audio (numchan>1) where the phaseGroup flags in the audio nodes are to be set.","However, when combining or composing audio substreams having different channel assignments, e.g. 5.1 multichannel surround sound and 2.0 stereo, some of the audio nodes (AudioMix, AudioSwitch and AudioFX) defined in the current MPEG-4 standard mentioned above can change the fixed channel assignment that is required for the correct channel representation, i.e. such audio nodes have a channel-variant behaviour leading to conflicts in the channel configuration transmission.","A problem to be solved by the invention is to deal properly with such channel configuration conflicts such that the presenter can replay sound with the correct or the desired channel assignments. This problem is solved by the method disclosed in claim . An apparatus that utilises this method is disclosed in claim .","The invention discloses different but related ways of solving such channel configuration confusion by using channel-variant audio nodes. An additional audio channel configuration node is used, or its functionality is added to the existing audio mixing and\/or switching nodes. This additional audio channel configuration node tags the correct channel configuration information items to the decoded audio data streams that pass through the Sound2D node to the presenter.","Advantageously, the invention enables the content provider or broadcaster to set the channel configuration in such a way that the presenter at receiver side can produce a correct channel presentation under all circumstances. An escape code value in the channel configuration data facilitates correct handling of not yet defined channel combinations even in case signals having different channel configurations are mixed and\/or switched together.","The invention can also be used in any other multi-channel application wherein the received channel data are passed through a post processing unit having the inherent ability to interchange the received channels at reproduction.","In principle, the inventive method is suited for processing two or more initially decoded audio signals received or replayed from a bitstream, that each have a different number of channels and\/or different channel configurations, and that are combined by mixing and\/or switching before being presented in a final channel configuration, wherein to each one of said initially decoded audio signals a corresponding specific channel configuration information is attached, and wherein said mixing and\/or switching is controlled such that in case of non-matching number of channels and\/or types of channel configurations the number and\/or configuration of the channels to be output following said mixing and\/or following said switching is determined by related specific mixing and\/or switching information provided from a content provider or broadcaster,","and wherein to the combined data stream to be presented a correspondingly updated channel configuration information is attached.","In principle the inventive apparatus includes:\n\n","Advantageous additional embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the respective dependent claims.","In  a first decoder  provides a decoded \u20185.1 multichannel\u2019 signal via an AudioSource node or interface  to a first input In of an AudioMix node or mixing stage . A second decoder  provides a decoded \u20182.0 stereo\u2019 signal via an AudioSource node or interface  to a second input In of AudioMix node . The AudioMix node  represents a multichannel switch that allows to connect any input channel or channels to any output channel or channels, whereby the effective amplification factors used thereby can have any value between \u20180\u2019=\u2018off\u2019 and \u20181\u2019=\u2018on\u2019, e.g. \u20180.5\u2019, \u20180.6\u2019 or \u20180.707\u2019. The output signal from AudioMix node  having a \u20185.1 multichannel\u2019 format is fed to a first input of an AudioSwitch node or switcher or mixing stage . A third decoder  provides a decoded \u20181 (centre)\u2019 signal via an AudioSource node or interface  to a second input of AudioSwitch node .","The functionality of this AudioSwitch node  is similar to that of the AudioMix node , except that the \u2018amplification factors\u2019 used therein can have values \u20180\u2019=\u2018off\u2019 or \u20181\u2019=\u2018on\u2019 only. AudioMix node  and Audio switch node  are controlled by a control unit or stage  that retrieves and\/or evaluates from the bitstream received from a content provider or broadcaster e.g. channel configuration data and other data required in the nodes, and feeds these data items to the nodes. Audio switch node  produces or evaluates sequences of switching decisions related to the selection of which input channels are to be passed through as which output audio channels. The corresponding whichChoice data field specifies the corresponding channel selections versus time instants. The audio output signal from AudioSwitch node  having a \u20182.0 stereo\u2019 format is passed via a Sound2D node or interface  to the input of a presenter or reproduction stage .","In  two different conflicts are shown. The first conflict occurs in the mix node , where a mix of a stereo signal into the surround channels in a 5.1 configuration is shown. The question is, for example, whether the resulting audio output signal should have 5.1 channels, or the 5.1 surround channels should become 2.0 stereo format channels. In case of selecting a 5.1 output format the straight-forward solution would be to assign input signal L to the first output channel 1ch and input signal R to the second output channel 2ch. However, there are many other possibilities. The content provider or broadcaster could desire to assign input signal L to output channel 4ch and input signal R to output channel 5ch instead. However, the current version of the above MPEG-4 standard does not allow such feature.","The second conflict occurs in the sequence of whichChoice data field updates in the AudioSwitch node . Within this sequence, channels out of the AudioMix node  output and the single channel output from AudioSource node  are sequentially selected at specified time instants. The time instants in the whichChoice data field can be defined by e.g. every succeeding frame or group of frames, every predetermined time period (for instance 5 minutes), each time the content provider or broadcaster has preset or commanded, or upon each mouse click of a user. In the example given in , at a first time instant input signal C is connected to output channel 1ch and input signal M is connected to output channel 2ch. At a second time instant input signal L is connected to output channel 1ch and input signal R is connected to output channel 2ch. At a third time instant input signal LS is connected to output channel 1ch and input signal RS is connected to output channel 2ch. Within this sequence, channels out of the AudioMix node  output and the single channel output from AudioSource node  are sequentially selected. However, because of the contradictory input information in node , no correct output channel configuration can be determined automatically based on the current version of the above MPEG-4 standard.","Based on the assumption that the content provider or broadcaster is to solve such conflicts, three inventive solutions are feasible that are explained in connection with . A first decoder  provides a decoded \u20185.1 multichannel\u2019 signal via an AudioSource node or interface  to a first input of an AudioMix node or mixing stage . A second decoder  provides a decoded \u20182.0 stereo\u2019 signal via an AudioSource node or interface  to a second input of AudioMix node . The output signal from AudioMix node  having a \u20185.1 multichannel\u2019 format is fed to a first input of an AudioSwitch node or switcher or mixing stage . A third decoder  provides a decoded \u20181 (centre)\u2019 signal via an AudioSource node or interface  to a second input of AudioSwitch node . The decoders may each include at the input an internal or external decoding buffer. The output signal from AudioSwitch node  having a \u20182.0 stereo\u2019 format is passed via a Sound2D node or interface  to the input of a presenter or reproduction stage .","AudioMix node  and Audio switch node  are controlled by a control unit or stage  that retrieves and\/or evaluates from the bitstream received from a content provider or broadcaster e.g. channel configuration data and other data required in the nodes, and feeds these data items to the nodes.","A new audio node, called AudioChannelConfig node  is introduced between AudioSwitch node  and Sound2D node .
