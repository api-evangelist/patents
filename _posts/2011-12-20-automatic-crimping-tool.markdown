{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to ammunition and in particular to apparatus and methods for fixing projectiles in cartridge cases.","One type of ammunition is a round that may include a cartridge case and a projectile. The projectile may be seated in the cartridge case and then the cartridge case may be crimped around the projectile to hold the projectile in place. Known processes for seating a projectile and crimping a cartridge case may have required two separate fixtures and two separate sets of tools. Two separate fixtures and two separate sets of tools may be more expensive and logistically complex than a single fixture and a single set of tools. In addition, handling of the assembled cartridge may have been required prior to the crimping process. Handling an assembled cartridge prior to crimping may be hazardous.","A long-felt and unsolved need exists for an apparatus that can both seat a projectile in a cartridge case and crimp the cartridge case around the projectile, without the need for handling the cartridge between the seating and crimping steps.","It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus that can both seat a projectile in a cartridge case and crimp the cartridge case around the projectile, without the need for handling the cartridge between the seating and crimping steps.","One aspect of the invention is an automatic crimping tool for seating and crimping a projectile in a cartridge case. The automatic crimping tool may include a center sleeve having a blind bore at one end, an outer surface, a spring stop disposed on the outer surface, and at least one opening extending through a wall of the blind bore. The at least one opening may be located axially between the spring stop and an open end of the blind bore.","The automatic crimping tool may include an outer sleeve having a through bore. The center sleeve may be reciprocably disposed in the through bore of the outer sleeve. The through bore may include a counter bore at one end and an enlarged portion located distal from the counter bore. A spring may be disposed between a flat portion of the counter bore and the spring stop. A retainer may bear against the spring stop to limit axial motion of the center sleeve. An inner sleeve may be disposed in the blind bore. The inner sleeve may be selectively translatable with the center sleeve. A second spring may be disposed between a closed end of the blind bore and the inner sleeve.","The center sleeve may include a ram mating portion at another end. The ram mating portion may include an internally threaded bore. The retainer may include a retaining ring disposed in a wall of the counter bore. The inner sleeve may include an opening therein for receiving a projectile. An outer surface of the inner sleeve may include a decreased diameter portion. At least one bearing may be disposed in the at least one opening extending through the wall of the blind bore.","When the at least one bearing is partially disposed in the decreased diameter portion of the outer surface of the inner sleeve, the inner sleeve may translate with the outer sleeve. When the at least one bearing is partially disposed in the enlarged portion of the through bore of the outer sleeve, the inner sleeve may not translate with the outer sleeve. Transition areas from the enlarged portion of the through bore to the through bore may be smooth transitions and not step transitions.","The automatic crimping tool may include a crimper base assembly. The crimper base assembly may include a crimper base and a crimper top disposed on the crimper base. The crimper base and crimper top may include bores for containing the cartridge case. The crimper top may include a center sleeve bore for receiving the center sleeve. The crimper base assembly may include at least one locking block extending from the crimper base to the crimper top. The locking block may be fixed to the crimper base. The crimper base and the crimper top may include slots formed therein for receiving the at least one locking block.","The crimper base assembly may include at least one locking pin for securing the locking block to the crimper top. The locking block may be fixed to the crimper base with fasteners inserted through the locking block and into the crimper base. The locking pin may include projections that extend through the locking block and into the crimper top.","Another aspect of the invention is a method. The method may include providing an automatic crimping tool, seating a projectile in a cartridge case, and crimping the cartridge case to the projectile using the automatic crimping tool. Seating the projectile in the cartridge case and crimping the cartridge case to the projectile may not include removing the cartridge case from the crimper base assembly between the seating and the crimping.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","An automatic crimping tool may be used in conjunction with a press having a ram, such as a hydraulic press. The automatic crimping tool may seat a projectile at an appropriate depth in a cartridge case, and then crimp the cartridge case around the projectile. The crimping tool may be attached to the ram of the hydraulic press. The hydraulic press may be configured to operate in a location that is remote from personnel. In this way, the possibility of injury to personnel that may occur during the seating and\/or crimping process may be eliminated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1D"],"b":["10","1","1","10","200","202","200"]},"Tool  may include a center sleeve  having a blind bore  at one end, an outer surface , a spring stop  disposed on outer surface , and one or more openings  that extend through the wall of blind bore . Openings  may be located axially between spring stop  and an open end  of blind bore . Center sleeve  may include a ram mating portion  at another end for fixing center sleeve  to, for example, a ram of a hydraulic press (not shown). Ram mating portion  may include, for example, an internally threaded bore . One embodiment of center sleeve  is shown in more detail in .","Tool  may include an outer sleeve  having a through bore  (). Center sleeve  may be reciprocably disposed in through bore  of outer sleeve . Through bore  may include a counter bore  at one end and an enlarged portion  located distal from counter bore . A spring  may be disposed between a flat portion  of counter bore  and spring stop . A retainer, for example, a retaining ring , may bear against spring stop  to limit axial motion of center sleeve . Retaining ring  may be disposed in a wall  of counter bore .","An inner sleeve  may be disposed in blind bore . Inner sleeve  may be selectively translatable with center sleeve . A second spring  may be disposed between a closed end  of blind bore  and inner sleeve . Inner sleeve  may include an opening  therein for receiving projectile . An outer surface  of inner sleeve  may include a decreased diameter portion . Decreased diameter portion  may extend completely around inner sleeve . Tool  may include one or more bearings  disposed in respective openings  that extend through wall of blind bore . Bearings  may be, for example, ball bearings.","When bearings  are partially disposed in decreased diameter portion  of outer surface  of inner sleeve , as shown in , inner sleeve  may translate with outer sleeve . When bearings  are partially disposed in enlarged portion  of through bore  of outer sleeve , inner sleeve  may not translate with outer sleeve . Transitions areas  from enlarged portion  of through bore  to the unenlarged portion of through bore  may be, for example, smooth transitions rather than step transitions.","Tool  may include a crimper base assembly  (). Crimper base assembly  may include a crimper base  () and a crimper top  () disposed on crimper base . Crimper base  and crimper top  may include respective bores ,  for holding cartridge case . Crimper top  may include a center sleeve bore  for receiving center sleeve . Crimper base assembly  may include at least one locking block  (). Two locking blocks  are shown in . Locking blocks  may extend from crimper base  to crimper top . Crimper base  and crimper top  may include respective slots ,  formed therein for receiving locking blocks .","Locking blocks  may be fixed to crimper base . For example, locking blocks  may be fixed to crimper base  with fasteners  inserted through locking block  and into crimper base . Crimper base assembly  may include at least one locking pin  () for securing locking blocks  to crimper top . Two locking pins  are shown in . Locking pins  may include projections  that extend through locking blocks  and into crimper top . Projections  may have a snug fit in locking blocks  and crimper top . The snug fit may allow projections  of locking pins  to be easily inserted into and removed from locking blocks  and crimper top . When projections  are inserted into locking blocks  and crimper top , crimper top  may not separate from crimper base  during projectile seating and cartridge case crimping operations.","In operation, crimper base  of tool  may be fixed in a location beneath a press (not shown). Cartridge case  may be inserted in bore  in crimper base . Crimper top  may then be placed on crimper base  and secured with locking pins . A rubber die  () may be inserted in a bottom of bore  and projectile  place on top of rubber die . Ram mating portion  of center sleeve  may be fixed to the press. Center sleeve  may be lowered with outer sleeve  such that open end  of blind bore  enters bore  in crimper top . As center sleeve  is lowered, inner sleeve  may also be lowered due to the position of bearings , as shown in .","When the tip of projectile  reaches an end  of tapered portion  of opening  (), projectile  may be pushed into a top of cartridge case . A bottom surface  of outer sleeve  may then contact an upper surface  of crimper top  (). Then, center sleeve  and inner sleeve  may move further downward to fully seat projectile  as bearings  are pushed into transition areas  and enlarged portion  of through bore . Spring force from spring  on inner sleeve  may facilitate the movement of bearings  into enlarged portion . With bearings  disengaged from inner sleeve , center sleeve  may continue downward such that open end  compresses rubber die  thereby crimping cartridge case  around projectile .","Then, the press may reverse the direction of movement of the ram and pull the center sleeve  upward. As the center sleeve  moves upward, bearings  may move from a position in enlarged portion  and openings  to another position in openings  and decreased diameter portion  of inner sleeve . This change in position of bearings  may translatably lock inner sleeve  to center sleeve . As center sleeve  continues to move upward, spring stop  may contact retaining ring , thereby translatably locking outer sleeve  to center sleeve . When center sleeve  is clear of crimper base assembly , cartridge case  with projectile  seated and crimped therein may be removed from crimper base assembly .","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIGS. 1A-B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2B"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIGS. 1A-B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIGS. 1A-B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4B"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIGS. 5A-B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIGS. 5A-B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A"],"b":["7","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIGS. 5A-B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A-D","FIGS. 5A-B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
