title: System and method for providing learning material
abstract: A system and method provides content or material such as educational, informational, or learning content from existing and/or third party content on a network such as the Internet and disseminates the content via the network to a user by correlating the culled content to a user's learning profile. The system preferably pushes the content to the user after correlation of content to the user's learning profile. The user's learning profile includes data regarding a user's learning proclivities and/or preferences of a user's learning profile. The system scans and/or searches the Internet for the existing content. The system stores data about the scanned content particularly with respect to the content itself and relative to the classifications, categories, and/or categorization of learning proclivities and/or preferences. Particularly, the system stores data regarding the elements and/or characteristics of the content with respect to the learning proclivities and/or preferences. Subject matter content is then provided as per a curriculum and/or learning chain. The learning profile also maintains data regarding learning chain progression with regard to a curriculum. Preferably, but not necessarily, the content data and learning profile are in the form of an object model and, particularly, as metadata.

No. 09\/970,291 filed Oct. 3, 2001 entitled System and Method For Providing Learning Material, now abandoned, which was a continuation of and claimed the benefit of and\/or priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/557,109 filed Apr. 24, 2000 entitled Education System and Implementation, now abandoned.","A computer program listing appendix of an object oriented database of metadata implementing the present invention is submitted herewith on compact disc (CD-R), including a copy thereof, a file named MINDSHARE WORKITEM OBJECT MODEL 9-12-2002.VSD, which was created on Sep. 12, 2003 being 1.034 megabytes, is included, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, each in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to electronic education systems and methods and, more particularly, to a computer network-enabled education system and method.","2. Description of the Related Art","Various methods of teaching have been proposed and\/or implemented over the years. Beginning in the early 1960's an educator, Fred Glancy, Jr. took many of the components in education that were successful, along with research from around the world, and assembled a new program for public education. The program was given local, state and international awards and was named the Glancy Educational Method (GEM). Some of the developments in GEM that started this movement included recognition of varied learning styles, learning disabilities, computerized Individual Learning Plans (ILP), computerized Individualized Educational Plans (IEP), mainstreaming of all special education students into a traditional school system, and the application of a computerized learning template with educational methods to teach according to the learning template.","The philosophy behind GEM is that every human being is comprised of a unique blend of learning\/developmental abilities and limitations. Each person learns, develops and grows differently as each person is a composite of learning abilities drawn from the basic motor, visual, language concepts and auditory characteristics and experiences of their world. A person's learning pattern is made up of a physical, emotional, environmental, sensory, genetic, spiritual and developmental set of interrelated attributes. Each person or student thus has his or her own unique attributes based on the various experiences and characteristics noted above that essentially defines the individual and his or her learning characteristics.","When a student's learning characteristics are understood, a style or manner of instruction that best fits the student's mechanism of learning can be ascertained and applied in any environment. When we know and teach each person as an individual in accordance with the person's learning characteristics, we then begin to shape more efficiently the operations of teaching and administration. The GEM thesis for all education applies this concept to adapt a separate teaching style that reaches each person individually in accordance with that person's learning characteristics. When we can accomplish that goal, it follows that true learning takes place. Some proven advantages to this approach include teacher fulfillment, parent satisfaction, and administrative efficiency.","Under GEM, individualizing the learning process yields a continuing positive educational experience for the student and the teacher. This can occur without special teacher training, without slighting the needs or expectations of any child in the classroom, and without long, extra hours of preparation. The highlights of GEM include: a) teaching each student as an individual and a whole human being; b) labeling no child as retarded, deaf, blind, etc., as each person would be taught through the way they learn; c) screening and individualizing instruction for all students in or out of the regular classroom; d) providing precise information, materials, and systematic recording procedures; e) backing up each teacher with information and resource support necessary for individualizing instruction without significant additional teacher training; and f) doing all of these without demanding excessive preparation time out of the classroom.","The above GEM goals and attributes were met and implemented with technology existing at the time of development, namely hand-written or oral teacher to student teaching and evaluating\/testing with the aid of books, manuals, and other paper-based materials. Since GEM was developed in the 1960's albeit refined in the 1970's, it does not take advantage of present computer technology both as to its enhancement and implementation. With the advances of technology and voluminous addition of information constantly streaming into our lives, and the need for students to understand, assimilate, and\/or learn the vast amount of material, there is a need for an update of GEM in accordance with present technology. Particularly, there is a need to provide learning material utilizing computers.","While not the total implementation of GEM, a learning management system for use by microcomputers was marketed in 1987 by Insight Unlimited, Inc. of West Lafayette, Ind. The Insight Learning Management System (ILMS) was menu-driven or command-driven software that tested a student's learning abilities and created a user profile based thereon to present information from a static database of activities\/lessons, tests and remediations each of which was in a pre-determined and unchangeable format for presentation. A student's progress could be tracked by generated customizable reports. Individualized education and learning plans were formulated by the software. The database\/software also has import and export capabilities.","A learning system that also utilizes computers is U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,863 issued to Sloane, et. al on Sep. 29, 1998 entitled \u201cInteractive Behavior Modification System,\u201d wherein there is described a Multimedia Behavior Modification System (MBMS) that utilizes computers for presenting or teaching the material. The MBMS includes courseware for a particular topic and delivers the courseware over a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the internet. The coursework includes a selectable progression of modules including dynamic introductory modules leading to a combination of education modules. User selectable links to primary learning modules is provided in a menu. A tracking module tracks user decisions and other characteristics and alters the program content accordingly.","Another computer learning system is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,810,605 and 5,904,485 issued to Siefert on Sep. 22, 1998 entitled \u201cComputerized Repositories Applied to Education,\u201d and on May 18, 1999 entitled \u201cAutomated Lesson Selection and Examination in Computer-Assisted Education\u201d respectively. These related patents disclose a system for computer assisted education in which a school curriculum is stored in computer repositories. A learning profile is maintained for every student which indicates the capabilities, preferred learning style, and progress of the student. Based on the profile, the program selects proper lessons, administers examinations, updates the profile, and links the student with a subject matter expert when necessary. The system also establishes a video conference between the student and faculty member or other individual when necessary.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,112,049 issued to Sonnenfeld on Aug. 29, 2000 and entitled \u201cComputer Network Based Testing System\u201d there is disclosed an automated testing system that allows for a hierarchical testing scheme. Independent building blocks (i.e. logical units) contain parameters that determine its functionality and implementation. Each building block also contains information about how it relates to the other building blocks. Each logical unit or section has a set of parameters that define, for example, an interrelation of that section with other sections, grading instructions, adaptive aspects, allowable timing, sequencing and repetition, security and randomization. The tests are provided over the Internet utilizing HTML as a web page format. This allows the system to be provided over the Internet using standard web browsers. Sonnenfeld further teaches that since the system preferably resides on the Internet, the system allows the test designer and test taker to give questions based on the content of another web site.","The above-referenced systems utilize computers that may be networked to meet learning\/educational needs of a user. The two above-identified Siefert patents disclose the use of learning profiles to select computer stored, static lessons for a student based on the student's profile. Both types of systems, however, are deficient in flexibility and\/or dynamic use of current technology. Moreover, while Sonnenfeld teaches the use of the Internet to provide a test to a user and, particularly, is able to test a user about the content of a particular Internet page, Sonnenfeld does not provide content from the Internet that is correlated to the learning proclivities of a user and\/or with respect to a particular topic and\/or location in a learning chain.","What is therefore needed in view of the above, in addition to other non-mentioned particulars, is a system and\/or method that provides correlated educational material to a user that is obtained from existing content gathered from the Internet in a manner to accommodate the learning preferences and\/or proclivities of the user.","The subject invention, in one form, is an Internet-based education, information, and\/or learning system and method that coordinates or matches Internet content with an individual's learning proclivities and\/or preferences compiled into a learning profile for presentation of the Internet content to the user as learning material. The learning material is thus presented in a manner correlating or corresponding to the user's learning profile. Internet content, encompassing educational, informational and other learning content, provides the learning material for many subjects or topics. Subjects or topics may be part of a curriculum, course of study, or with regard to a particular subject. The subject matter or learning material is also presented with regard to a learning chain of knowledge with regard to the particular subject, subject area or topic.","In one form, the Internet is searched for content, typically regarding a particular subject as learning material for the particular subject. The content comprises various elements of web pages or other similar Internet or Network content sources. The subject matter and the characteristics of each element of the content as presented, is tagged, labeled or correlated to metadata in an object model. The material is correlated to a learning profile according to the characteristics of the elements.","The system searches the Internet such as via a spider and\/or bot, usually with regard to a particular subject, subject area and\/or topic, and catalogues and\/or categorizes the content and\/or the content attributes of particular web pages for possible presentation as learning material, depending on whether the categorized\/catalogued content and\/or content attributes correlate to the learning profile. Data regarding the content and\/or content attributes and\/or the cataloging and\/or categorizing of the Internet content (the page data) is compiled and stored. Preferably, but not necessarily, the page data is generated, compiled and\/or stored as metadata.","Particularly, the content and\/or content attributes of the located web pages are compiled into an object corresponding and\/or correlated to the various learning proclivities and\/or particular learning preferences that may make up a user's learning profile. Such cataloguing and\/or categorizing is stored in a database.","The user's profile is stored as metadata regarding the user's proclivities and\/or preferences, preferably, but not necessarily, in accordance with GEM principles. The user's profile includes, but is not limited to, a proclivities and\/or preferences of learning of a user.","A central system in communication with the Internet provides a platform that searches for learning content from existing content on the Internet, filters the gathered content appropriately, classifies the filtered educational content, and provides the filtered content to the user. The central system utilizes object-oriented technology. Particularly, the central system consists of an object model. The various portions of the object model provide parameters for the various functions of the system. The content is preferably stored in an object-oriented manner in accordance and in conjunction with the object model. The object model is utilized to provide the appropriate content to a user in accordance with the user's learning profile and\/or level with a learning chain of a learning plan, along with a user's hardware profile. The object model is preferably accomplished utilizing a metadata structure.","In one form, the above is implemented utilizing the latest computer\/Internet technology coupled with the GEM prototype program. An education plan is developed for each student. The educational plan includes, but is not limited to, a user profile, a hardware profile, and a testing profile. A template or palette will be developed from the various profiles that determine how each user learns and how to present the educational content to the user. Contemporary, multi-tiered, Internet browser technology (e.g. HTML, XML, VRML, HTTP\/IIOP, Visual Basic, Active X, Java-script, etc.) is integrated to a user presentation level using object oriented modeling and standards (e.g. OODBMS, Java, XML, RDF, CORBA, J2EE, OLE, COM, API, etc.) coupled with relational databases (e.g. SQL, Oracle) to reach every web-enabled device (user) on the Internet.","From the individual perspective, a learning template consisting of a user's learning proclivities and\/or preferences will be interactively developed preferably via a proven set of GEM testing and remediations. The learning template will also be continuously and dynamically updated based on factors such as performance (testing) on previous lessons\/educational material. This specialized template is then correlated to a learning style and an appropriate philosophy is used for instruction. The primary hardware tool is the personal computer or Internet capable networked device, which will provide the medium for continued training. The educational content is provided in an appropriate format to the Internet capable device in accordance with the hardware profile. With existing technology and planned future developments, an object-oriented and\/or relational database routs activities to satisfy the educational needs for each template linked to every concept in education, industry, work force, social skills, and the like.","In one form, the educational material is culled or gathered from the vast ocean of information and\/or content already available on the Internet. This Internet information or content would be filtered, evaluated and\/or indexed to become educational material or content, and then linked to template or profile characteristics. The object-oriented fabric of the system then serves to push the educational and\/or informational content in accordance with the learning style to the user based on the template. An intelligent software program serving as a programmable agent may act as a filter and coordinator of information tailored for individual use (i.e. via the template) while GEM program specifics may be used to assemble the information\/data for the user\/student.","The template or palette will be determined by identifying the potential strengths and needs of each individual to produce a total learning template or palette. It is well known that realistic expectations enhance learning; improving interpretation of needs, creating a healthier emotional atmosphere, better parent\/teacher\/student understanding, communication and a stronger educational climate. These are some of the rewards of this essential effort. It is critical to identify \u201cuniqueness\u201d in the individual. The present invention advocates a close, continuous \u201clook\u201d at the student and a curriculum with limitless computer assisted learning activities built upon that resulting template. As well, the present invention captures the picture of the total individual rather than only one aspect of learning. This picture results, in a coordinated, multifaceted interpretation of potential, and is then shared with all those who would be incorporating this interpretation into a developmental template for assisting the person in living in and learning about the and\/or their environment. In this manner resources are brought to the individual, not the other way around.","Proper profiling of learning ability to produce the template or palette is accomplished through examination of motor processing, auditory processing, visual processing, language, and basic concept development, physical, emotional, environmental, sensory, and spiritual cognitive development. Template or palette identification through genetic evaluation and\/or sensing of human neuro-biological indicators (bio-factors) may also be used as input to a profile. By analyzing this developmental set of interrelated attributes, learning strengths and preferences can be identified. The collected data (template composite) serves as a reference for measuring educational growth for each individual. As an example, a template may be compiled through the following steps:","First\u2014Use the GEM testing format to build a template for each student on how he\/she learns and functions. This template will be stored relationally in a database. Most material and testing will be done via the computer. A minimum number of test items will be administered separately and entered manually into the computer. The template will be changing as the student evolves. Most of this material can be taken directly from the existing documentation.","Second\u2014An automated computer retrieval\/database system will provide students and\/or teachers\/parents activities for students to learn a concept based on the developed template. The database of learning activities is compiled from both existing Internet resources and contributed material that will be continuously expanded and\/or updated. Instructional Examples (\u201cIEs\u201d) may be added in the database to those that have already been detected online. Before adding any IE, they will be screened through a selected team of individuals or an individual knowledgeable in each category and subject area of education, or via an automated version by modules of artificial intelligence. The IE's selected for a given concept will be based upon various evaluation criteria preferably according to GEM principles. Each IE will be coded or indexed to certain types of learners according to their template. Some may even be used for all types of learners. The traditional Learning Chain will be evolutionarily enhanced over time.","Parents, students, educators, etc. will also provide IE's and they will be channeled to the right teams. The IE's produced will be used in many ways: for example, virtual reality, for the tactile and kinesthetic learner; voice for the auditory, videos, for demonstration, and printed word for the visual. The IE's will be gathered, developed, coded, stored, added to existing internet IE's and retrieved via the object-oriented database (OODB) management tools for every learning concept in education. Commercial educational software providers can supply programs IE's, etc. that can be certified and templated that may or may not be on a fee basis. The database of IE's will be added to or deleted as better methods are developed. As new concepts are added to education, new IE's for each template will be developed, screened, selected and added. The world's best educational examples will be available to every individual. A level playing field for all people regardless of race, physical impairment, ethnic background, etc. to progress through the Learning Chain.","Third\u2014The majority of the concepts and communication will be accomplished via a web-enabled computing or processing device (WEC). Based upon an individual learning template, and preferences the system will present a concept accordingly through appropriate education content that has been formatted accordingly. Educational content will be selected according to the student's total template, level of development, and position within a learning chain of the educational plan. This is done under supervision of the educator.","Fourth\u2014The home WEC can be used for projects or lessons away from a classroom. Each individual will have a unique identity (i.e. social security number and password), and will work select activities or be provided select educational content according to individual template for learning, and correlated to the concept on which they are working. Parents may also \u201clog on\u201d and bring up activities they can present to the younger student.","Fifth\u2014A complete tracking system will handle all records, achievements, template updates, etc. to gauge the success of the program. This same information is available to the individual to assess achievement.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an overseer is provided with a correlative program of products and services through the Internet and related technology. Parental awareness of the child\/student as a member of the family should correspond with his or her needs and the specific individually prepared program. This process makes it possible for the first time to teach each child at his\/her own intellectual and motivational level, utilizing the most appropriate mode of learning and advancement, in an individual or conventional group setting. The facility of this process promotes teacher compliance and makes it readily usable by parents and students as well.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, work will be performed with individuals of varying degrees of intelligence and ability. It includes all classifications of special education. The unique evolutionary design adjusts automatically to different demographic characteristics and is accessible across all lines of gender, race, national origin, disability, age, etc. It is considered to be culture-blind.","At the heart of this process is the individual learning palette comprised of hundreds of elemental rungs, built from sensory, perceptual, and motor interplay, which are interwoven and then translated into their corresponding behavioral, academic, and coordination states. These areas of physical and cognitive endeavor, in turn embrace another magnitude of evaluative strategies, physical-medical treatments, therapeutic techniques, and educational remediations. The benefits of this implementation cannot be fully fathomed at this point, however; some of the immediate advantages are intuitively obvious:\n\n","In yet another form, the subject invention is a web based, enterprise-wide, knowledge management system, apparatus and method (collectively, \u201capplication\u201d), that uses a semantic engine to mine or gather relevant information from a variety of sources, especially that of the Internet. The application delivers the mined content in a format that users can refine and annotate. Supporting both individual users and communities of interest, the application archives valuable content, such as queries, returned documents, and refined documents, for future access.","The application is built on a semantic engine and a user-editable GUI. The semantic engine supports searches and organizes post-search processing. The subject application enables advances in linguistic processing through a user editable generic English lexicon and other tools that assist in clarifying meaning. Also, the user can augment the lexicon with user-defined concepts.","The semantic engine analyzes an area or areas of interest for key concepts and then presents the user with a range of answers for each concept. The user refines the area of interest by selecting the best answer and weighing each concept's importance in relation to other concepts. The application then translates the interest into a complex Boolean query suitable for a variety of search engines. It enhances the query by supplementing key concepts from the user defined preferences and palette information during the translation process.","Search engines, such as Alta Vista, typically search a document's metadata (document title, source, date, summary sentences, and other fields) to determine if the document matches the search criteria. Mindshare can work with several search engines at the same time to provide enhanced queries. The enhanced queries increase the effectiveness of the search engine's retrieval activity. Once returned, all search engine results are then refined.","Mindshare sets a relevancy threshold for returned documents using a mathematical algorithm. The algorithm, designed to analyze the sequence of thoughts in a document, determines if those thoughts are relevant to the user's palette. The algorithm operates paragraph by paragraph in a document, looking for the paragraph with the most relevant thought and delivery mechanism. Based on the user's input, a combination of concept weighting and desired relevancy score ranks the paragraphs. Periodically users are asked to baseline and test the validity of the palette information. For example, in this mode of operation, users assign one of three weights to each concept: key, regular, or ignore. A key concept weighs twice that of a regular concept. An ignore concept has a weight of zero. Ignore concepts prevent the subject application from spending computation resources on conjunctions, prepositions and other extraneous parts of speech. For example, the user then selects the desired relevancy level (score or percentile range between 0 and 100) that a response must meet to be categorized. To calculate relevancy, the subject application locates the most relevant paragraph in the document and calculates its weight. A 50% relevancy level means that the most relevant paragraph in the document must contain at least 50% of the responses total possible weight. Should the document's most relevant paragraph contain all of the possible concepts, the subject application further analyzes the paragraph by order of concepts in the paragraph versus order of concepts in the interest.","The subject application post-search activity saves users significant time by focusing the user's attention to only those paragraphs in a document or documents that are considered relevant. Duplicate documents and documents with content that did not meet the use-specified relevancy threshold are deleted. The subject application's semantic engine identifies and hyperlinks key concepts in the remaining documents. The user then quickly navigates through selected paragraphs that contain key concepts. A document is then analyzed with all of the user's active interests each time that document is opened, including documents saved to a user or group repository. Thus, the unexpected correlation of different concepts found in the same document gathers new knowledge.","The user can save the original document, not just the relevant paragraphs. Dragging and dropping saves documents metadata (source, date, author, and other user defined fields) within the GUI. The user can annotate any object (documents, folders, and metadata) in the repository with pertinent information that makes the document useful not only the user, but which also updates the palette information for future comparison searches.","Saving and linking exceptionally useful documents and folders to appropriate concepts keeps the palette current with use of discipline-specific vocabulary. It also indexes reference work for use by others via palette mapping to the enterprise. This enterprise memory is a permanent record of lessons learned, accessible to any individual using the system.","Mindshare is a state-of-the-art, J2EE java-based rich client\/server architecture and includes a set of commercially available enterprise applications. Standard Webservers provides an operating environment that is easily deployed in a variety of server\/workstation configurations and across the Internet. Computationally intensive tasks are placed on the distributed servers. The workstation hosts a \u201cthin or rich client\u201d that manages the user interface. Users can connect to the application with Internet accessible workstations that have the application rich client installed to access their repository at work, from home, and during travel. A user's repository opens in the state the user last left it, no matter where or when the user logs into the system. This virtual educator allows users to work on a project at times and places that match their personal schedule. The virtual teacher also keeps users in contact with information that matches their educational level and\/or user information preferences retained as palette characteristics.","The subject system utilizes an enterprise relational database management system (RDBMS) for content storage. A document management system to store non-hypertext markup language formatted content is supported. Additionally, third-party tools can, as necessary, access content for additional analysis and process.","Further, the subject system interoperates in today's enterprise information technology (IT) environments. These environments typically are collections of disparate data sources from personal systems (e.g., Microsoft Access), legacy databases, and current RDBMS. The subject system works with all these sources through application programming interfaces and search engines to access data without disrupting normal operation, and requires minimal IT support. Users manage most of the operational configuration through administrative components. The system identifies the user's client computer capabilities for processing and display and provides data to meet those parameters. It is capable of presentation in the \u201cthinnest\u201d client mode of HTML for inexpensive interaction. Mindshare will also take advantage and recognize fuller function clients for instruction via video, audio, virtual reality sensory\/feedback, etc.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views.","As used herein:","The term GEM stands for Glancy Educational Method. GEM is an existing approach of student evaluation for the purpose of tailoring educational content to an individual's PALETTE or learning profile to maximize cognitive assimilation.","The term PALETTE stands for Psychogenetic and Audiometric Learning Template, Tailored Evolutionarily. The word template is generally synonymous with PALETTE or learning profile.","The term Learning Chain is the typical and\/or known logical progression of skills required to master a given subject or topic (e.g. a student will learn geometry, trigonometry and calculus in a prescribed order).","The term ebot or spider is a software agent\/program that is deployed to perform tasks on the Internet without direct guidance. Ebots perpetually navigate the Internet performing complex tasks such as abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, reusability, concurrency and distributed operations. In the framework of the present Mindshare system, an ebot is used to search, catalogue, classify and\/or categorize Internet content into packets of data according to learning proclivities and\/or preferences. This knowledge agent will automatically gather information and map it into the optimum palette (learning profile) format.","The term educational portal is an interface into a vast amount of information that has been tailored to meet the specific learning style and capability of the student. The user interface is evolutionarily adapted to meet the individual palette.","Referring now to , there is depicted a representation (e.g. block diagram) of an exemplary embodiment, generally designated , incorporating the subject invention in accordance with principles presented herein. A server\/database\/system  as is known in the art represents the Mindshare System\/Program (hereinafter \u201csystem\u201d) being a logical system and database. The system  may be many individual systems networked to one another rather than a single system.","The system  is configured, operative and\/or adapted to obtain and\/or create a learning profile for an individual or user, search the network, Internet or the like for learning material\/content, obtain data regarding the material\/content which may include cataloguing, classifying and\/or categorizing the learning material\/content, correlate the learning material data to a user learning profile for providing the material\/content to the user in accordance with the learning profile, testing the user, redefining the correlation between the learning profile and the material\/content, redefining the learning profile and more as described herein. The educational material consists of still pictures or frames, video clips, audio clips, and\/or any other type of multi-media formatted information\/data culled from the Internet. Such educational material may be formulated into lesson plans, connected learning modules, etc. or any other assemblage of information\/data that is deemed to constitute instructive content (IC).","As well, the educational material includes submitted content  that is forwarded to the system  by third parties who desire for the material to be included. The submitted content  may be forwarded via electronic means as signified by the bolt , or by other means as signified by the arrow . As with all educational material, the submitted IC is evaluated for suitable content, indexed, and linked to the learning profile characteristics, preferences and\/or proclivities. This object-oriented fabric of the system  then serves to push data (provide the material) and learning style to the individual based on the learning profile. A program director (i.e. a group of individuals or a single individual) or a programmable\/automatic agent (i.e. a computer program) acts as a filter and coordinator of educational material\/information tailored for individual use while GEM Mindshare program specifics will be used to assemble the information\/data.","The submitted content  may need to undergo format conversion  before storage in the system . Such format conversion  may be scanning via a scanner (not shown) of a document or documents. Format conversion  may also be conversion from, for example, \u201cJPEG\u201d to \u201cGIF\u201d formats, or similar format conversion.","With submitted content , the originator and\/or supplier could be charged a fee to consider and\/or use the content within the context of the Mindshare Program. An ongoing fee for use of the submitted content (now educational material, assuming the same is approved for use by the program director\/programming agent) could be calculated based on the number of times the educational material is accessed. Of course, other schemes for calculating fees for use may be used.","As well, the system  is connected to the Internet , as signified by the line , in order to obtain resource(s), material(s), and data (collectively \u201ccontent\u201d) available via the Internet . This is represented by the server , the server , and the server  (the servers ,, and  thus representing all or the plurality of the servers or the like of the Internet , while the content , , and  represent all of the material\/content of the Internet ). The server  contains content  that is accessible to the system  via the connection  via the Internet . The server  has content  that is accessible to the system  via the connection  via the Internet . As well, the server  has content  that is accessible to the system  via the connection  via the Internet . The content  may be educational, learning, informational or the like and is obtained from the various servers by the system .","In accordance with an aspect of the subject invention, the system  gathers content or material from the various servers via the Internet . Particularly, the system  looks for specific content from the Internet  based on learning, educational, or informational need of a user. The learning profile of a user may be consulted to seek the particular content. The content is then gathered by the system  and then stored thereon. More particularly, the system  may utilize a semantic engine, ebot, spider, etc. to seek and retrieve content that is appropriate for the particular user. The content\/material may be stored as data regarding the content, elements or characteristics of the content, or both. The user may, according to an aspect of the subject invention, provide various queries for information via a graphical user interface (GUI). In another instance, a specific educational, learning, or information plan may seek and select the appropriate content from the Internet . In both cases, the user's palette is preferably utilized to correlate the gathered content to the specific user.","The learning profile may also provide management of the content sought, gathered or collected, and provided to the user. Since the content from the Internet  is typically in a \u201craw\u201d form, the gathered content may need to be filtered before it can be provided to the user. The content may not be appropriate for a user for various reasons, such as age, learning or chain progress problems, or the like. Filtering may include editing the content so that it is suitable for the user in the various respects noted above, as well as for the information or learning content thereof. Filtering may also include providing only some of the content from an Internet page or site. Further, the content may be evaluated for suitable content, indexed, and linked to template or profile characteristics.

In addition, the GUI  includes a viewing\/working area  in which the various educational\/IC material is presented, tests are taken, scores\/progress is posted, and the like.","The GUI  may also be used to initiate the system  into gathering information or content from the Internet for pushing or providing the content to the user. As such, the GUI  may include a semantic engine to aid the system  in retrieving content from the Internet, filtering the content according to the user's profile and provide the content to the user. As well, the system  may reformat the content as per the user's hardware profile in order that the filtered or edited content gathered from the Internet may be displayed on the user's system.","Referring to , a simplified block diagram of the system  is shown in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. The system  includes a processor  and memory  that stores or contains program instructions to run or operate the subject invention in the manner set forth herein. While not shown, the processor  is in communication with the various components or modules of the system . The system  includes a filter  that receives Internet content . The filter  edits and\/or parses the content according to the user's profile and\/or the user's level within a learning chain of an educational plan (attainment level) or the user's current knowledge with respect to a chosen subject. This becomes the filtered content . The filtered content  may be stored in a content storage device  for later use. Later use may constitute re-presenting the content to the user if necessary, either in the same or different format, typically as a result of test results with respect to the content. Later use may constitute providing the content to another user. Both conditions are represented by the line to the user .","The filtered content  may be directly provided to the user (as represented by the line connecting the filtered content  to the user ) or may be converted into another format for presentation or providing to the user . Format conversion  is operative to take the format of the content and convert it to another form. The converted form content from the format conversion  may be stored in the content storage  or provided directly to the user . The system  also includes a testing module  that is operative to provide testing of the subjects provided to the user. Additionally, the system  includes software  that may be provided to the user to allow the subject invention to operate.","Referring to , there is depicted a flow chart, generally designated , of an exemplary manner of an aspect of operation of the subject invention. Initially, in step , the system  searches the Internet for content. As explained above, content may be selected by the system  in response to an educational plan with regard to a particular subject, or may be selected by the user preferably with the aid of the GUI . In step , content is gathered by the system  according to various criteria such as the user's performance, previous interactive sessions, learning profile and\/or hardware profile and subject matter. Content format may be a criterion. In step , the system  filters the content appropriately with regard to the various criteria. In step , the content is correlated to the profile(s) of the user. In step  the content is formatted accordingly if necessary. Thereafter, in step , the content is provided to the user preferably via the Internet.","Referring to , the enterprise may consist of the client tier, the middle tier, and the EIS (Enterprise Information Systems) tier. The system  may be comprised of the middle tier and the EIS tier. The client tier represents the various users of the system . The EIS tier is the top tier that contains or is operative to provide the various information systems architecture or programming. The EIS tier interfaces with the middle tier that consists of an EJB (Enterprise Java Bean) container, a web container and a JNDI, JMS and Javamail architecture module. The EJB container contains a plurality of enterprise beans that interface with a client, the enterprise information systems, and the web container. The web container includes servlets, JSP pages, HTML, and XML programs\/programming. The clients may interface with the web container if appropriate.","In , an exemplary web container is depicted. The web container may be a J2EE container that includes an application dispatcher module, a view rendering module, a web actions module, a business data module, a view processing module, and an enterprise services module. These modules interact to provide a client with content as provided herein. The J2EE web container also interacts with the EIS, again to provide content to user.","Referring to , there is depicted an exemplary manner of operation (application flow) with respect to the exemplary embodiment of the enterprise\/system  depicted in . In , the system  controller looks into the application map to find an action to invoke for a given URL request from the client. In this case, the application map (application_map.xml) finds the search action handler to invoke. It should be appreciated that the exemplary manner of operation may be extrapolated to a content search and retrieval for a subject. In , the controller, having found the requisite action, invokes the appropriate action handler using information from the application map. In this case, the appropriate action handler is the search action handler.","In , action handler performs the particular action requested, using the enterprise services as necessary. In this case, the enterprise service is the Mindshare system. The enterprise service invokes the Mindshare logic in the enterprise tier as depicted in . The Mindshare information systems utilize profile or palette logic to perform a search, the results of which are returned to the enterprise services, then back to the action handler. In the present instance, the search results are returned to the action handler.","In , the action handler places the data on the request as a \u201cdata bean.\u201d The data bean is then available to all elements as the request is processed. In the present case, the search result set (content) is placed on the request as a data bean. The controller then invokes the page handler as illustrated in . The page handler retrieves display information (usually from a preferences manager) then places the display information in a presentation bean on the request. In the present instance, the columns show the search results are retrieved from the preferences manager. In , the controller invokes the JSP. The JSP then reads the data and presentation beans for the information to generate the HTML (or other format as appropriate for the user). The JSP page may make use of style sheets, JSP tag libraries, and other Ul elements. In this case, the JSP page generates the search results. Lastly, in , generated HTML page is then returned to the browser of the client (user). In the present case, the HTML page is the HTML search results.","Referring now to , there is depicted another exemplary embodiment of a system, generally designated , that is functional to operate in the manner set forth herein with respect to the system  of  and\/or with respect to that described below. Therefore, it should be appreciated that the system  may incorporate the functionality of the system  of  and, preferably, incorporates at least some if not all of the functionality of the system  of .","The system  includes a Mindshare system , a network such as the Internet  having Internet content and\/or material , and a user or users . The Internet  in  is thus representative of any type of network, similar or not. The Internet content\/material (collectively hereinafter, \u201ccontent\u201d)  is thus representative of the many pages or sources of data or information associated with or on the Internet . The system  is in mutual communication with the Internet  and thus in mutual communication with the Internet content\/material  and the users .","The system  includes among other features and\/or functions not shown or described below, a network content search or scan spider, bot or the like , an object model database , processing logic , a query engine  and testing . Each block or module is representative of a feature, function, software and\/or hardware implementation of the named block. Moreover, while not specifically shown, the various blocks of the system  work together as described herein.","The network content search bot  is operative, adapted and\/or configured to search and\/or scan the Internet  for content and\/or material (hereinafter collectively, content). The content may be regarding any topic, subject or the like or may be a specific topic. The content may be different levels of a topic, subject or the like. The content search bot  may look only for specific content (i.e. content regarding a particular subject), a particular level of a specific topic, or any topic and\/or level thereof. The content search bot  is operative to search or scan the Internet  \u201con the fly\u201d (when specifically requested to find material regarding a particular topic of subject) or regularly to mine content. By example, the content search bot  looks at content stored on the Internet  and gathers data regarding the content. The content data is classified and tagged with metadata descriptors that correlate to palette criteria. The Internet Content Metadata (ICMD) is then processed by the object (processing) logic and\/or stored as refined data by the object model database . The network content\/search bot , either by itself or in conjunction with processing logic , gathers, assembles and\/or compiles data regarding the content and\/or attributes, characteristics and\/or the like of the content. This ICMD (content data) is stored in the object model database .","The content  resides on or is a part of an Internet page, site, area, location or the like (i.e. one or more files on a computer, file server or the like, and collectively \u201cInternet page\u201d). The content  may be considered as and typically is the assemblage of data and\/or information contained on an Internet page. Each Internet page contains one or more types of content. For example, Internet page \u201cA\u201d may contain text only. While Internet page A contains only one type of content, which is text, the form (e.g. letters) of the text itself has attributes or characteristics such as style, font and size. The text also has attributes such as subject matter, format, reading level and the like. Thus, each type of content has attributes that can be classified, catalogued and\/or categorized. As a further example, Internet page \u201cB\u201d may contain pictures, text, graphics, active components and the like. Internet page B thus contains many forms of content each one of which has attributes and\/or characteristics. It is these attributes, characteristics and\/or the like that are utilized, at least in part, to create the ICMD Mindshare database (i.e. to create and\/or store content data as object model data such as metadata).","The content search bot  reads the coding or code of a site in order to ascertain code or coding data such as metadata in the existing code of the site. When coding is XML, for example, tagging of items may be utilized. With XML, content may be coded or considered as metadata. This may be used directly by the system  or may be processed accordingly. XML sets forth the features, \u201cwhat is what\u201d and attributes regarding the content. The XML (as well as other coding but not necessarily to the same degree) may be directly used to provide content metadata (data) for the object model database . Of course, other coding or code may be read and analyzed, in addition to other particulars, characteristics, attributes of the content data.","The content search bot  updates its content data by revisiting Internet pages and, of course, continuing to search or scan the Internet for content. When a site is revisited, the system may compare new data with old data to determine whether the new data needs to be saved. Alternatively, new content data is saved automatically via it's associated ICMD. The object model database  also stores information regarding the location of the content data.","Particular content is provided to a user  by pushing the content to the user. In pushing the content to the user, the system  obtains the content via a connection path or channel to the particular site, then essentially passes the content to the user via another connection path or channel. The system  may process, filter, reformat or otherwise process the content before providing it to the user via a providing channel or connection, but preferably just passes through the content. The content has been correlated to the particular user utilizing the user's profile via the object model database (i.e. the structure, function and\/or features of the data in the object model database , the processing logic  and the system  in general). Therefore, the system  provides the learning material (assembled content data) to the user .","The query engine  of the system  is operative, configured and\/or adapted to allow a user and\/or the system  to generate a query for \u201con the fly\u201d content searching\/scanning. This may be utilized for many reasons. The query engine also handles all requests by the system for data and\/or information, in the context of providing content to a user, testing, and with regard to the system itself. In one form, the query engine may bring back real-time content whose content data has been processed and correlated appropriately as provided herein. Mindshare  may provide real-time data in the normal course of providing learning material rather than in response to a query. The real-time content may be provided in addition to or separate from other content.","The processing logic block  of the system  is representative of logic and\/or circuitry that may be software, hardware, firmware or the like and\/or any combination thereof, is operative, configured and\/or adapted to process data in the manner described herein and\/or provide the functionality and\/or features of the system  as described herein.","The testing block  is representative of the ability of the system  to provide tests to a user in order to assess the progress of a user and the need to update a user's learning profile or palette. The tests may be automatically generated, be manually generated or be a combination thereof. Results of testing are used to modify a user's profile and\/or modify the correlation between a user's profile and the content. Tests increase statistical correlation of information provided as compared to comprehension level.","The testing and user profile\/correlation modification is preferably an evolutionary endless loop of subject and subject level presentation (until the user either accomplishes each level of each subject, topic or goal, or until the user quits the learning process). Testing may occur at any time or be scheduled at the end of various learning sections. Testing may be utilized to update a user's profile if necessary. Moreover, testing may be utilized to create and\/or update a correlation object that functions to correlate the data in a user's learning profile with the content data.","In , an exemplary model of the object model database  is shown. The object model database  may be considered as having or may be implemented as or in metadata. A metadata file for implementing an object model database  or the like is provided on the above-identified CD-R filed with the present application and which is incorporated herein by reference. The object model database  may be considered as having a learning profile object model module , an Internet content\/material object model module , a correlation object model module  and a curriculum\/learning chain object model module . The object model database  may, and preferably does, contain other modules not specifically shown for fulfilling the functionality provided herein.","The learning profile object model  stores from one to any number of learning profiles, typically one learning profile per user. The learning profile is obtained as provided herein and is stored as object model or metadata in the object model database . Particularly, the learning proclivities, preferences, attributes, characteristics and the like (e.g. grade level, reading level, color blindness, etc.) of the user are stored as learning profile data. In a basic sense, the learning profile data indicates how a user learns. The learning profile object model  is also preferably dynamic. The Internet content\/material object model  stores the content data. The content data is preferably, but not necessarily, stored as metadata. The content object model is also preferably dynamic.","The correlation object model  provides correlation between the content object model  and the learning profile object model . The correlation object model  is definable by the system  and\/or a manager of the system . As such, the correlation object model may be changed for various purposes. Various degrees and instances of correlation between a user profile and content is modifiable. In one form, the correlation object model  acts as a filter in order to match content to a user based on the user's profile. The user is thereby provided content that correlates in one or more manners in order to tailor the content to the user's abilities. Correlation may change during a curriculum,","The curriculum\/learning chain object model  is shown in  as separate from the other models. It should be appreciated that the curriculum\/learning chain model  may be incorporated or resolved into one or more of the other models. The curriculum\/learning chain object model  represents and implements the ability of the system  to provide a course of study with respect to myriad of subjects. As long as content exists, or is provided to the system  such as supplementary submission of content, the subject matter may be provided as a curriculum, course or object of study. The course of study may consist of many levels of understanding. Moreover, the curriculum\/learning chain object model  provides learning chain establishment, monitoring, and assessment in order to assure command, mastery or even a basic understanding of the course of study at any particular level or point along the learning chain.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a flow chart, generally designated , setting forth an exemplary manner of providing learning material in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. It should, at the outset, be appreciated that the exemplary manner of providing learning material described below is a detailed manner of providing learning material. As such, a manner of providing learning material that is less detailed and derived from the detailed manner  may more than set forth the subject invention. In other words, a subset of steps of the manner  can implement the subject invention. Moreover, it should be appreciated that the manner  and any and all subsets thereof do not necessarily need to follow the order set forth herein.","In step , a user logs onto the system. As indicated above, the user utilizes the Internet or other network to establish communication with the system. Once the user has established communication with the system, in step , the system recognizes the user. Recognition of the user may take many forms and\/or involve one or more interim steps. By way of example, once a user logs onto the system, the system needs to determine whether the user has a learning profile. If the user does have a learning profile, the learning profile (or learning profile data) is retrieved. If the user does not have a learning profile, the system establishes a learning profile through interaction with the user.","In step , the system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) or similar manner of providing information and allowing a user to interact and\/or make selections or choices. The GUI may be as that presented above. In any case, the GUI provides the user with several selections or choices regarding many facets of the system, the user's account, and the providing of learning material the GUI may offer on the fly queries for subject matter in addition to providing a curriculum of subject matter. The user may access options via the GUI. Other features and\/or functions may be provided by the GUI.","Assuming that the user selects to begin the learning mode, in step  the system provides learning content to the user. The system correlates content with the user's profile and pushes the content to the user. Particularly, the system correlates the learning proclivities and\/or preferences with content of the particular subject matter and correlated to the learning proclivities and\/or preferences.","In step , the system assesses the degree of user understanding of the content. This may be done by testing or other means. The assessment may be provided at various levels along the learning chain for the particular content or subject matter. The assessment outcome is utilized to modify the user's learning profile and\/or the user's correlation model and, in step , the learning profile, correlation model and\/or other data\/information is adjusted or modified accordingly. Subsequent content is provided according to the modified learning profile and\/or correlation model. This process may be an endless loop of subject and subject level presentation or up to a particular level or goal.","While this invention has been described as having preferred designs, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
