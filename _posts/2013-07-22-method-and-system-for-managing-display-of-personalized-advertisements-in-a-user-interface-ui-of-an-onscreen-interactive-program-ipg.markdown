Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to an on-screen interactive program guide (IPG), and more particularly, to managing display of personalized advertisements (PADs) in a user interface (UI) of an onscreen IPG.","2. Description of the Related Art","In general, television (TV) advertising outnumbers press and online advertising based on revenue earnings. As a result, nowadays TV advertisers are bound to advertise the same advertisements on multiple channels, i.e. inter-channel advertising, and also repeat the same advertisements multiple times on each of the channels, i.e. intra-channel advertising, to attract and gather maximum attention and eyeballs of the viewers. However, TV advertisers both strive and tend to spend money in an efficient manner to reach targeted audience belonging to a specific group of viewers so as to maximize the recall rate. In so doing, TV advertisers are, to some extent, capable of converting economically targeted advertisements into increased sales revenues and brand value.","One problem is that if conventional advertisement models are not customized and enhanced, TV advertisers may fail to attract and engage viewers to see advertisements relevant to the viewers. Another problem is that if money spent by TV advertisers fails to follow the eyeballs of viewers\/customers, the TV advertisers may waste a lot of money and may eventually lose out in business.","Still another problem transpires if multiple system operators (MSOs)\/local cable operators (LCOs), who in general merely aggregate and distribute AV contents, do not own any channel or contents. In the event that MSOs\/LCOs do not own any channel or contents, MSOs\/LCOs fail to get direct revenue from advertisements. Typically, a license agreement between MSOs\/LCOs and channel\/content owners is required if advertisements are displayed on full screen videos. In the event that the MSOs\/LCOs do not own any channel or contents then entering into a license agreement to do advertisements with third (or 3) party content\/channel owners is not an easy task for the MSOs\/LCOs, since the content\/channel owners prefer or ensure not to lose control over advertisement revenues, which drive the business of the content\/channel owners.","Normally, it takes several years for MSOs\/LCOs after launching a product, such as set top box (STB) or digital TV, to reach break-even because of the high infrastructure and CapEx costs of the head-end equipments, satellite transponders, modulators and the rest. Furthermore, only the subscription fee from subscribers\/viewers is not sufficient to meet the costs or to make profits.","The overall number of viewers\/users recording TV programs or interested in using various types of user interfaces (UIs) for navigating through the contents (or recorded and stored programs) using digital video recorders (DVRs) has been doubling year-on-year. The two-fold increase is because the viewers\/users want to view\/record and store programs anytime, as per the viewers\/users convenience, schedule and availability therein.","Advertisers face additional risk as most users of DVRs fast-forward and skip the advertisements because the advertisements are interruptive in nature and are disliked by viewers, as it disturbs user's continuous viewing experience. Skipping advertisements by DVR viewers\/users increase the wasteful spends of advertisers and further reduces the return on investment (ROI).","Therefore, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus for managing dynamic insertion and display of personalized advertisements in a user interface (UI) of an on-screen interactive program guide (IPG) with enhanced targeting, personalization and interactivity.","Embodiments of the invention generally relate to a method and system for managing display of personalized advertisements in a user interface (UI) of an on-screen interactive program guide (IPG) comprising determining whether a user group of a current primary user matches with at least one of targeted user groups, selectively adding advertisement asset images corresponding to the matched user group into an advertisement bouquet, calculating a number of impressions of each of the advertisement asset images to display to the current primary user on a given day, calculating an advertisement sequence for each of the advertisement asset images to display to the current primary user on the given day, optimizing performance for delivery and display of the advertisement asset images and displaying the advertisement asset images during at least one of organizing, navigating, gifting, downloading and buffering at least one of AV and multimedia contents.","While the method and system is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that method and system for managing display of personalized advertisements in a user interface (UI) of an on-screen interactive program guide (IPG) is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described.

However, in the context of the specification both the terms imply or refer to at least one of image advertisements of at least one of a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) type, videos, animations, multimedia, for example, a combination of still images, animations and videos, shown as at least one of advertisement folder icons (or ad-folder icons), advertisement companions (or ad-companions) and gift wrapper advertisements (or gift wrapper ads).","The term \u201cadvertisement impression (or impression)\u201d refers to display of an advertisement image (or advertisement image asset) for the complete planned duration to a targeted user.","As shown in , the caching module  is part of the PAPI layer . The caching module  accesses and traverses an advertisement sequence to find out the number of targeted impressions and the ranking index for each advertisement asset image in the advertisement sequence. The caching module  fetches (or retrieves) and stores (or caches) at least a first set of plurality of advertisement asset images based on the present positions (or ranking indices) of the advertisement asset images in the advertisement sequence, for example first three (3) advertisement asset images, during booting up of a client device, for example the client device , of . Each of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images of the advertisement sequence is displayed. In some scenarios, upon displaying each of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images in the advertisement sequence, at least one of next three (3) advertisement asset images in the advertisement sequence is found different from each of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images. Consequently, at least one of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images of the advertisement sequence with the lowest targeted impression and ranking index is displayed. Further, a new advertisement asset image is fetched from an advertisement asset server, for example the advertisement asset server , of . Still further, the at least one of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images in the advertisement sequence with the lowest targeted impression and ranking index is replaced with the newly fetched advertisement asset image. The aforementioned steps of fetching and storing the first three (3) advertisement asset images in the advertisement sequence, displaying each of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images, finding whether or not at least one of next three (3) advertisement asset images in the advertisement sequence is different from each of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images, displaying at least one of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images of the advertisement sequence with a lowest targeted impression and ranking index, fetching a new advertisement asset image from the advertisement asset server , replacing the at least one of the cached first three (3) advertisement asset images of the advertisement sequence with the lowest targeted impression and ranking index with the newly fetched advertisement asset image are repeated till at least one of the validity date and the targeted impressions for the day are completed.","In some embodiments, the latency to access and retrieve an advertisement asset image from the persistent memory of the client device  to a random access memory (RAM) is high. As a result, the caching module  may be customized to pre-fetch a next advertisement asset image, to be displayed, in the RAM to improve the performance. An advertisement sequence prepared by the PAD server  as part of the first tier daily-based wakeup tasks (not explicitly shown and described hereat), as performed by the routine wakeup tasks performance module  of the performance optimization component , of , ensures that advertisement asset images in an advertisement bouquet are from active campaigns only.","The term \u201cadvertisement bouquet (or ad bouquet)\u201d refers to a set of advertisement image assets for a user group, competing for the same UI screen space and the same advertisement time slot.","The data from a statistical engine (or the statistical engine data), for example the data from the statistical engine  in the client device , of , is required to derive a user group from the viewing history and viewing habits of a user. The statistical engine data comprises the viewing history and viewing habits of a user (or users) collected by the statistical engine  in the client device . In some embodiments, the statistical engine  periodically sends user information to the PAD server , of . For example, the user information comprising the viewing history and habits of a user is sent every 1 hour to the PAD server . In some embodiments, the periodicity of transmission of the user viewing information to the PAD server  is configurable. In some embodiments, the user information comprises a subscriber and user identifier (ID), watch start time, watch end time, event genre and audio language. The terms \u201csubscriber\u201d and \u201cuser ID\u201d refer to a subscriber and a user identifier of a primary user, who is controlling the client device  through a smart remote control, and watching programs\/events on the client device . The term \u201cwatch start time or start time\u201d refers to a start time of watching an event by a user in at least one of a given and configurable time period, for example 1 hour. The term \u201cwatch end time or end time\u201d refers to an end time of watching an event by a user in at least one of a given and configurable time period, for example 1 hour. The term \u201cevent genre\u201d refers to genres of events, for example news, fashion, comedy, and the rest, watched by a user in at least one of a given and configurable time period, for instance 1 hour. In some embodiments, if event genre is not available, the channel genre, such as sports, news and the rest, watched by a user in at least one of a given and configurable time period, for instance 1 hour. The term \u201caudio language\u201d refers to language of an event watched, for English, Chinese, Malay and so forth, by a user in at least one of a given and configurable time period, for example 1 hour.","The statistical engine  in the client device  uses details of viewed events and channels provided by a state machine module, for example the state machine module  in the client device , of . The stored statistical engine data in the RAM of the client device  is sent to the PAD server  and the previously stored statistical engine data is flushed from the RAM of the client device . The statistical engine  manages the details of viewed events and channels by creating and maintaining a statistical engine table. For example, the statistical engine table B (not explicitly shown and described hereat), of the MYSQL DB server , comprising the details of viewed events and channels along with the respective timestamps is stored in the RAM of the client device  for a certain time period, for example 1 hour.","In some embodiments, the difference between hourly start and end times of watching for or over a configurable period of time, for example 3-6 months, is aggregated to calculate the average watched duration per day for each user (or per user), for a specific subscriber ID for a household. The genres watched by a user are ranked based on the average watched duration per day. One or more parameters are used for profiling a user and to identify a user group to which the profiled user belongs to. For example, one or more top ranked genres, for example topmost three (3) genres, the average watched duration per day for each user (or per user) and days of watching of a user, and so on, are used for profiling the user and to identify the user group to which the user belongs to. Based on the days a user watches, for example at least one of weekdays and weekends, and duration of watching of the user, one or more attributes, such as gender, age, employment status and marital status, of the user are derived.","The server communication module  is responsible for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) communication between a client device and a PAD server, for example the client device  and PAD server , of . For example, the HTTP communication facilitates exchange of XML messages, advertisement asset images, videos, and the like, between the client device  and PAD server . The server communication module  is capable of handling communication errors and performing appropriate corrective actions.","An XML utility, for example the XML utility  in the client device , of , parses XML responses, i.e. XML response messages, received from the PAD server . The XML utility  generates XML requests, i.e. XML request messages, from the client device . The XML request and response messages are communicated between the PAD server  and client device  through HTTP.","A storage utility, for example the storage utility  in the client device , of , provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for storing advertisement sequence, images, videos, uniform resource locators (URLs) data into the persistent storage of a client device, for example the client device . The initialization module , PAPI layer , caching module  and statistical engine  in the middleware layer  use the storage utility  to read\/write from, or to, a persistent storage, for example a hard disk or flash memory. The storage utility  accesses the middleware layer  through a combined personalized advertisements (PADs) glue and interface layer, for example the combined personalized advertisements (PADs) glue and interface layer , of .","The state machine module  monitors one or more states of the client devices , and changes thereof, corresponding to at least one of user actions, such as a channel change, event change, UI application change, user change, audio language change, and so on. In some scenarios, upon a change in a given state of the client device , the state machine module  notifies the components of the PAP component , i.e. the PAD rendering module , PAPI layer , initialization module , caching module , statistical engine , server communication module , XML utility , storage utility , state machine module  and personalized advertisements (PADs) glue interface layer , about the change along with the data, such as an event genre, a channel name, an UI ID, an audio language.","For example, in some use case scenarios, a user changes from one channel, for instance SKY\u00ae, to another channel, for instance FOX\u00ae. Upon change from one to another channel by a user, the state machine module  notifies the statistical engine  that a channel change has occurred along with a new event name, new event genre and new channel name, for example FOX.","The PADs glue interface layer  abstracts APIs of the middleware layer . The APIs of the middleware layer  are used by the PAP component , so that the same PAP component  may be used across different types of client devices, for example one or more of the client device . In some embodiments, if the middleware layer  changes from one client device  to another, then only the implementation of the PADs glue interface layer  needs to be changed to ensure that the PAP component  is not changed.","In some embodiments, the middleware layer  comprises one or more interfaces . The interfaces  are required for the middleware layer  in the client device . For example, the interfaces  include a channel and an event change information , an event genre and a channel genre information , a user ID information , a UI screen ID information , an event name and a channel name , an event synopsis , an Event Information Table (EIT) information, i.e. schedule and EIT Present\/Following (P\/F) , a client device ID and a device model number , a Random Access Memory (RAM), persistent memory i.e. a Hard Disk Drive (HDD)\/flash memory available for PADs  and storage APIs, display APIs, HTTP communication APIs, XML library support , as depicted in .","In some embodiments, each of the client devices  comprises a storage memory  (not shown here explicitly). In some embodiments, the storage memory  is external to each of the client devices . For example, recorded contents are stored in a cloud storage memory  of a cloud server or a networked DVR hard disk or Video\/Video-on-Demand (VoD) servers.","In some embodiments, the PAD rendering module  displays personalized advertisements in at least one of the favorite channel list application , personalized recorded content organizer application , AV\/multimedia buffer\/download OSD UI application , gift message OSD UI application  and watch TV application , all of the foregoing of , using the PAPI layer , of . For each of the host UI applications , the PAD rendering module  is implemented to display personalized advertisements and corresponding advertisement companion assets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The server subsystem  includes the PAD server , database (DB) server , advertisement asset server , web server  and billing server , all of the foregoing of .","As shown in , the PAD server  includes an advertisement selection module (ASM) , a target impression calculation module , an advertisement sequence calculation module  and a XML communication module .","The advertisement selection module  selects an advertisement bouquet and advertisement sequence based on a user group to which a user currently watching a client device , of , belongs to, and a target user group based on target audience input provided by an advertiser, as depicted in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In some embodiments, during at least one of first time and subsequent installation of a client device, for example the client device  of , a user logs in and voluntarily registers his\/her profile details with a PAD server, for example the PAD server , of , using the pop-up OSD UI . In some embodiments, an incentive in the form of discounted subscription fee is offered in the event that the user agrees to voluntarily register his\/her profile details with the PAD server .","The term \u201cprimary user\u201d refers to a user in a household controlling TV programs through a smart remote control. The term \u201csecondary user(s)\u201d refers to all other users in a group of users, comprising the primary user, watching the TV programs controlled by the primary user.","In some embodiments, at least one of fingerprint recognition (or authentication) on at least one of the frequently used keys in an advanced smart remote control facilitates identification of a primary user watching the AV content or TV program. As used in information security, the term \u201cpersonally identifiable information (or PII)\u201d refers to information that can be used solo or with other information to at least one of identify, contact, locate a single person and to identify an individual in context. The primary user information is sent to a statistical engine, for example the statistical engine  in the client device , of . In some embodiments, during user registration along with his\/her profile details, the user also provides at least one of a fingerprint so that the user profile details along with his\/her fingerprint is stored for subsequent reference and comparison in the client device . However, from the standpoint of information security, the fingerprint details of a primary user are considered as PII, and thus not sent to the PAD server . The fingerprint details of the primary user are only used locally in the client device  to identify user ID of the primary user controlling the client device . Upon identification of the primary user, the user ID of the primary user who is watching the client device  is sent to the PAD server .

At step , the method  comprises facilitating determining whether a user group of a current primary user matches with at least one of targeted user groups. In order to determine whether the user group of the current primary user matches with at least one of the targeted user groups, the method  facilitates identification of the current primary user and the user group for the current primary user. The method  implements a PAD server, for example the PAD server , of . The PAD server  identifies the current primary user and the user group for the current primary user. Further, in order to identify the current primary user and the user group for the current primary user, the method  facilitates scanning an input fingerprint of each user on each one of frequently used control keys of a remote control. In some embodiments, a client device, for example the client device , of , is adapted to implement fingerprint scanning using fingerprint scanners. The fingerprint scanning is only implemented on each one of the frequently used control keys of the remote control, for example channel up\/down and select. In general, there are two types of fingerprint scanners, namely the optical scanner and capacitance scanner. The basic function of the two types of scanners is to get an image of the fingerprint of a user and find a match for the fingerprint of the user. Upon scanning the input fingerprint of each user on each one of the frequently used control keys of the remote control device, the method  facilitates comparing the input fingerprint of each user with a reference fingerprint of the current primary user. For example, the fingerprint scanner in the client device  matches the input fingerprint of each user with the reference fingerprint of the current primary user. Still further, the method  facilitates deriving user identifier information of the current primary user based on the comparison.","The PAD server  implements a set of rules, for example the RULES 1-8, derived from a survey database, for example the survey database . The RULES 1-8 are applied on the data from a statistical engine, for example the statistical engine  of the client device , of , obtained from users, based on the viewing patterns of the users, to identify a user group.","The PAD server  facilitates determining whether a user group of a current primary user using a client device matches with a targeted user group. For example, if a user group of a current primary user using the client device , of , in the Table 2, and a targeted user group in the Table 3, matches, a corresponding advertisement image selected from the advertisement sequence for the matched user group, calculated for a given day is delivered to the client device . The method  proceeds to step .","At step , the method  comprises facilitating selectively adding advertisement asset images corresponding to the matched user group into an advertisement bouquet. The method  implements an advertisement selection module, for example the advertisement selection module  of the PAD server , as shown in . The advertisement selection module  selects an advertisement bouquet based on the user group to which the current primary user belongs to. The user group to which the current primary user belongs to is in turn based on target audience input provided by an advertiser and a user group to which a user currently watching a client device  belongs to. The method  proceeds to step .","At step , the method  comprises facilitating calculating a number of impressions of each of the advertisement asset images to display to the current primary user on a given day. The method  implements a target impression calculation module, for example the target impression calculation module  of the PAD server , as shown in . The target impression calculation module  derives the number of impressions of an advertisement asset images to be displayed (or to display) per user per day, namely ((NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS)\/(DAY*USER)) or NI), in UI screens of the client device , based on one or more parameters.","The method  facilitates deriving the number of impressions of advertisement asset images to display to the current primary user on the given day based on the total number of impressions of an advertisement asset image for a product specified by an advertiser under an advertisement campaign, the duration of the advertisement campaign in days specified by the advertiser and the number of users in a targeted user group to which the advertisement asset image for the product is to be served. Specifically, the target impression calculation module  derives the NI based on a first parameter, namely NI_TOTAL, second parameter, namely CAMPAIGN_DAYS, and third parameter, namely NU. The first parameter NI_TOTAL refers to the total number of impressions of an advertisement image asset, as specified by an advertiser as part of an advertisement campaign. The second parameter CAMPAIGN_DAYS refers to the duration of the advertisement campaign in days, as specified by an advertiser. The third parameter NU refers to the number of users in a targeted user group to which the advertisement image asset can be served or delivered.","The method  facilitates calculation of the number of impressions of advertisement asset images to display for the current primary user for the given day for all active advertisement asset images, as part of a first tier daily-based wakeup tasks, since the remaining duration in days of the advertisement campaign and the total number of remaining impressions for all active advertisement asset images change every day. For example, the first tier daily-based wakeup tasks (not explicitly shown and described hereat), is performed during graveyard slot by a routine wakeup tasks performance module, for example the routine wakeup tasks performance module , of a performance optimization component, for example the performance optimization component , of .","The method  facilitates updating the number of impressions for an advertisement asset image displayed to all users on a preceding day in an actual impression tracker table, for example the actual impression tracker table G (not explicitly shown and described hereat) of a MYSQL DB server, for example the MYSQL DB server , of , as part of the first tier daily-based wakeup tasks for the given day.","For example, the number of impressions displayed on a previous day for all users for a given, selected advertisement asset image, namely NI_ACTUAL_PREVDAY, is updated in an actual impression tracker table, for example the actual impression tracker table G (not explicitly shown and described hereat) in the MYSQL DB server , of , as part of the first tier daily-based wakeup tasks (not explicitly shown and described hereat), as performed by the routine wakeup tasks performance module  of the performance optimization component , for a current day.","In order to the update the number of impressions for the advertisement asset image displayed to all the users on the preceding day in the actual impression tracker table G, the method  facilitates determining the achievement of the target number of impressions for the advertisement asset image for the current day. For example, if the target number of impressions for the given, selected advertisement asset image for the current day, namely NI_TODAY, is not met. Stated differently, if the total actual impressions displayed is less than NI_TODAY for the given, selected advertisement asset image, then the backlog is added to the total remaining impressions, namely NI_REM.","Upon determining failure in the achievement of the target number of impressions for the advertisement asset image for the current day, the method  facilitates adding a backlog number of impressions to the total remaining impressions upon failure to achieve the target number of impressions for the advertisement asset image for the current day.","Upon adding the backlog number of impressions, the method  facilitates computing the total remaining impressions as a difference the total remaining impressions on a start day of the advertisement campaign and the number of impressions displayed on the preceding day for all users for an advertisement asset image. The method  proceeds to step .","At step , the method  comprises facilitating calculating an advertisement sequence for each of the advertisement asset images to display to the current primary user on a given day.","The method  implements an advertisement sequence calculation module, for example the advertisement sequence calculation module  of the PAD server , as shown in . The advertisement sequence calculation module  determines a sequence for display of a set of advertisement images from an advertisement bouquet for a user group, for example the user group of the current primary user.","In some embodiments, the sequence in which a given, selected advertisement asset image is displayed for a specific user profile depends on one or more factors, such as a priority of advertisement asset images, revenue expected, brand value, and so forth, a loyalty index of an advertiser, and remaining advertisement impressions.","In some embodiments, an advertisement sequence for each cycle of opportunity is concatenated and stored in the MYSQL DB server , of , for a user group, till the targeted impressions and ranking indices of all advertisement assets in an advertisement bouquet for the user group for a given day becomes zero.","At step , the method  further comprises retaining or maintaining a position of an advertisement asset to be displayed next, to be precise the last displayed advertisement asset position+1, in an advertisement sequence for each user. Upon display of each advertisement asset as per a stored advertisement sequence, the position of next advertisement asset to be displayed for each user is updated in the MYSQL database of the MYSQL DB server .","At step , the method  further comprises facilitating calculating the loyalty index [LI] of an advertiser is calculated by an MSO based on one or more factors. For example, the loyalty index [LI] of an advertiser is calculated based on 1) the advertiser is at least one of a first time or repeat customer of the MSO; 2) number of times the advertiser has advertised with the MSO before, if the advertiser is a repeat customer; 3) advertisement revenue from repeat business from the advertiser with the MSO, in last one year including the current one; 4) timely payment behavior and history of the advertiser; and 5) early termination or cancellation history or behavior of the advertiser in any and all advertisement campaigns before the minimum campaign duration. Each of the five factors for calculation of LI of an advertiser carries a weightage, for example a numerical value of 1, and the sum is the LI, which can vary from a minimum weightage, for example a numerical value of 1, to a maximum weightage, for example a numerical value of 5.","At step , the method  further comprises facilitating calculating the priority [P] of an advertiser by an MSO based on based on one or more factors. For example, the priority [P] of an advertiser is calculated based on 1) campaign duration, for instance duration above (>) six (6) months is considered HIGH, duration between three (3) to six (6) months, i.e. 3 months<= and <=6 months is considered MEDIUM, whereas duration below (<) three (3) months is considered LOW priority; 2) total advertisement revenue expected from the advertiser, for instance the revenue in RANGE1 is considered HIGH, in RANGE2 is considered MEDIUM, whereas in RANGE3 is considered LOW, wherein the RANGE1>=2*RANGE2; and wherein RANGE2>=2*RANGE3. In some scenarios, advertisers give better revenue to MSO after bidding, for high demand and frequently used screen spaces in UIs.","At step , the method  further comprises designing and implementing a rule in order to arrive at an advertisement sequence in an activity under the first tier daily-based wakeup tasks as performed by the daily routine wakeup tasks performance module  of the performance optimization component , of . For example, if the total number of advertisement assets in the advertisement bouquet are greater than (>) 3, and if the top \u2153ranked advertisement assets based on ranking indices (or \u2153of the ranks of the top three (3) ranked assets) is greater than and equal to (>=) 3, then the number of advertisement assets to be displayed in an advertisement sequence is equal to the top \u2153ranked assets of the advertisement bouquet, rounded off to a higher integer. Else if, the top \u2153ranked assets is less than (<) 3, then number of advertisement assets to be displayed in the decreasing order of ranking indices, is equal to top 3 ranked assets. Else if, the total number of assets in the advertisement bouquet is less than (<) 3, then the number of assets to be displayed in the decreasing order of ranking indices is all the assets in the advertisement bouquet.","In some scenarios, if the ranking indices for two or more assets are same, then an asset not displayed yet is picked up first. In some embodiments, the minimum of the top three (3) ranked assets are set to be displayed in the decreasing order of ranking indices, to reduce boredom and to increase engagement level of a user.
