title: Adaptive mesh resolution in electric circuit simulation and analysis
abstract: An adaptive mesh of virtual nodes is provided to analyze the performance of a power/ground plane pair having an irregular shape. Plane transmission line characteristics and regional modal resonances can be modeled accurately, and with a significant decrease in simulation time as compared to traditional methods. A variable-sized cell structure is constructed with smaller cells in irregular regions and with larger cells in uniform regions. Grid nodes may thus stay aligned along length and width to allow parameters of equivalent circuit models to be scaled appropriate to the cell size.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from Chinese application number 200910006283.X, filed Feb. 11, 2009, entitled \u201cAdaptive Mesh Resolution in Electric Circuit Simulation and Analysis.\u201d","The present general inventive concept is directed toward adaptive spatial resolution of mesh nodes in simulating electric circuits during the design phase thereof. The present general inventive concept finds application in simulating the electrical behavior of split plane electrical circuits through a mesh of linked nodes, the spatial resolution of which is adapted in accordance with the shape of the planes forming the electrical circuit.","Split plane power distribution is a common circuit configuration to distribute electrical power to functional components of a broader electrical circuit design. As illustrated in , split plane power distribution is generally implemented by a power plane  and a ground plane , the combination of which will be referred to herein as a power\/ground plane pair (PGPP) . Typically, the power plane  and the ground plane  are spaced apart in planar parallel alignment, and are separated by a dielectric medium.","Typically, split-plane power distribution networks must accommodate extremely rapid switching times of current across its domain. As these switching times are ever increasing from one generation of circuits to another, power integrity (PI) analysis has become a focus of circuit designers, whereby the power distribution network can be simulated and modified in the design phase. Due to the geometry of the PGPP and the switching times involved, transmission line modeling is typically employed to analyze the frequency dependent characteristics of the PGPP during the design stage so that prudent design measures can be taken. For example, as illustrated in , a PGPP model  includes a plurality of transmission line segment models  each contained within a cell . When the PGPP model  is executed, a frequency response of the PGPP can be analyzed. Accordingly, when resonance is apparent in the impedance profile at some frequency, for example, the designer may add capacitive elements at certain points in the PGPP to favorably alter the resonant frequency components of the power distribution network. Since, through PI analysis, such modification can be achieved at the design phase and prior to the fabrication of an actual circuit, the time to market of a product using the circuit can be decreased considerably.","Whereas, it is not difficult to model a simple plane pair transmission line, the abstract shapes of typical PGPPs result in complex boundaries some of which may be internal to the exterior boundary of the PGPP. For example, as illustrated in , many PGPP models, such as PGPP model , are implemented in a uniform mesh of cells  so that complex shapes can be accommodated. Consequently, an extremely large number of cells  may be needed to populate the entirety of the PGPP model . While several algorithms can be used to model the complex shapes of a PGPP, the computational overhead for these algorithms are prohibitive, especially where such PI analysis tools must share computational resources with other design tools.","There is an apparent need for PI analysis tools of PGPPs and similar structures that reduce the computational overhead thereof.","The present general inventive concept provides apparatus and methods to form an adaptive mesh of virtual nodes to analyze the performance of a power\/ground plane pair having an irregular shape. Plane transmission line characteristics and regional modal resonances can be modeled accurately, and with a significant decrease in simulation time as compared to traditional methods.","A variable-sized cell structure may be constructed, with smaller cells in irregular regions and with larger cells in uniform regions. The variable-sized cell structures may be meshed together horizontally and vertically, along virtual grid nodes. The alignment of the nodes of the variable-sized cells may allow the parameters of equivalent circuit models to be scaled appropriate to the cell size.","Additional aspects and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.","Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present general inventive concept, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present general inventive concept by referring to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2C","b":"200"},"As illustrated in , the PGPP  includes a ground plane  of thickness tand a power plane  of thickness tparallel to and separated from the ground plane  by a distance d. Although the ground plane  is illustrated in  as a continuous rectangle, i.e., without a void within its boundary, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto as will be appreciated by the skilled artisan upon review of this disclosure. As illustrated in , the region between the power plane  and the ground plane  may be occupied by a material  having an electrical permittivity \u2208. For purposes of description and not limitation, it is to be assumed that the PGPP is aligned in a coordinate system, such as the Cartesian coordinates system illustrated in , and that the coordinate system is compatible with an addressing scheme of a machine performing simulations and analyses of the PGPP .","As illustrated in , the general shape of the power plane  is defined as a peripheral boundary, such as indicated at peripheral boundary . The peripheral boundary  may include different protrusions, cutouts, linear and curved segments, and other such features. For example, as illustrated in , the boundary  may include a vertical boundary segment , where the term vertical refers to a linear segment aligned parallel with the y-axis, a horizontal boundary segment , where the term horizontal refers to a linear segment aligned parallel with the x-axis, linear boundary segment , and arcuate boundary segment . It is to be understood that the peripheral boundary  may include segments of shapes other than those illustrated herein without deviating from the spirit and intended scope of the present general inventive concept.","As illustrated in , the power plane  may include one or more voids, such as illustrated at void , that lie within the area bound by the peripheral boundary . Although the void  is illustrated as being defined by a rectangular void boundary  in the power plane , voids in the power plane  and the ground plane  may exist and may be defined by a boundary of any shape without deviating from the spirit and intended scope of the present general inventive concept.","A region of interest (ROI) , illustrated, for example, in , is formed by the geometrical intersection of the area of the power plane  and that of the ground plane . In the example of , the ROI  includes the area that is bound by the peripheral boundary , minus the area bound by the void boundary . In other words, the ROI  includes the area of power plane , but does not include the area of void . It is to be understood that the ROI  being equivalent to the area of the power plane  is a consequence of the continuous area of the ground plane  and, thus, the ROI  would be smaller than the area of the power plane  if the ground plane had voids therein, or did not extend beyond the boundary  of the power plane .","In certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept, the ROI  is the region in which a chosen analysis technique is valid, regardless of the particular geometries of the individual components forming an actual circuit. For example, if the chosen analysis technique employs an equivalent circuit model such as a transmission line equivalent circuit, then the ROI would include the regions in which the geometry of the system (the parallel planes of the ground plane  and the power plane  in the example of ) is such that the transmission line equivalent circuit is valid and provides a reasonable approximation of the true behavior of the system. Of course, in certain embodiments of the present general inventive concepts, adjustments or additional models may be incorporated to provide greater accuracy, such as to treat edge effects. However, in applications such as power integrity (PI) analysis, the present general inventive concept provides sufficient accuracy without such treatment.","As illustrated in  and in accordance with embodiments of the present general inventive concept, virtual nodes, such as is representatively illustrated at virtual node , are placed in the ROI . As used herein, a virtual node is a location on a conductor as opposed to a physical node that forms a connection between conductive elements, such as a terminal of a physically realizable circuit element or a junction of conductive elements. A virtual node may be physically remote from connection with a physical circuit element, but may act as a physical node with regard to certain analysis techniques, such as forming interconnections of mesh of equivalent circuit models, as is described in exemplary embodiments below. A virtual node may also define a point at which mathematical operations are evaluated in a numerical modeling process. For example, in addition to the equivalent circuit modeling described below, a configuration of virtual nodes constructed in accordance with the present general inventive concept may be used to evaluate the power distribution circuit  by such numerical analysis techniques as finite-difference time domain modeling, the finite element method, and the method of moments.","In accordance with embodiments of the present general inventive concept, any number of the virtual nodes  are placed to conform to any arbitrary shape in a manner that reduces the number of mesh points required by conventional techniques. For example, as illustrated in , in areas of the ROI  in which complex boundaries are located, such as indicated by the region , the spacing of virtual nodes  may be small, while in areas of the ROI  in which such complex boundaries are absent, such as indicated by the region , the spacing between virtual nodes  may be increased. The spacing may also be smaller in one direction than in another to accommodate boundaries aligned in a single direction, such as illustrated by the region . Accordingly, the entire ROI  may be adaptively populated with virtual nodes  to decrease the number of points at which the circuit is to be analyzed. The adaptive mesh embodied in accordance with the present general inventive concept decreases the amount of storage capacity, and also decreases the number of computations to analyze the power distribution circuit . In certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept, the virtual nodes  are aligned in accordance with a coordinate system, such as the Cartesian system illustrated in , as illustrated by the alignment lines . For example, the may allow the grid nodes to stay aligned along a length and width to allow parameters of equivalent circuit modes to be scaled appropriately to the cell size.","In certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept, the virtual nodes  are contained in an area defining a cell around each node, such as the cell . As used herein, a cell is a definition of a region that can be divided into other cells and\/or joined with adjacent cells to form a single cell. The cell is neither limited to the size nor the shape of the cell  illustrated in , and may be any suitable shape. The cell  may be aligned and sized in accordance with embodiments of the present general inventive concept so that electrical parameters of a model of the region  can be defined by only by the dimensions of the cell and the physical construction of the PGPP , which may be constant across all cells. When such a model is constructed based on the virtual nodes  populating ROI , analysis of the electrical characteristics of the entire ROI  of PGPP  can be performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["300","320","300","325","300","310","300","310","310"]},"A storage unit  may be utilized to store data and processing instructions on behalf of the exemplary data processing apparatus  of . The storage unit  may include multiple segments, such as a code memory  to maintain processor instructions to be executed by the processor , and data memory  to store data, such as data structures on which the processor  performs data manipulation operations. The storage unit  may include memory that is distributed across components, to include, among others, a cache memory and a pipeline memory.","The data processing apparatus  may include a persistent storage system  to store data and processing instructions across processing sessions. The persistent storage system  may be implemented in a single persistent memory device, such as a hard disk drive, or may be implemented in multiple persistent memory devices, which may be interconnected by a communication network.","It is to be understood that although the functional compartmentalization of the exemplary embodiment of  facilitates an understanding of the present general inventive concept through descriptions thereof, such configuration is not essential to practice the present general inventive concept. Elements other than those illustrated and described may be used in place thereof, functionality portrayed as being carried out in multiple elements may be combined to be carried out in a single component, and elements described as discrete may be distributed across multiple components. Indeed, numerous variations, alternatives and modifications will become apparent to the skilled artisan upon review of this disclosure and the present general inventive concept is intended to encompass such alternative configurations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["310","350","300","350","350"]},"The PIAS  may include a process controller  to coordinate and control the interoperations of the functional components of the PIAS  so as to achieve a fully operational data processing system. For example, the process controller  may receive data corresponding to user manipulations of the user interface , may format the data into a command and\/or data location in memory, and may convey such information to the applicable functional module of the PIAS . The process controller  may subsequently receive processed data from the applicable functional module and forward the data to another functional module, as well as to indicate such processing on the user interface . The process controller  will perform other coordination and control operations according to the implementation of the PIAS , and such other operations, as well as the implementation of such, can be embodied by a wide range of well-known process control methods and devices. The present general inventive concept is intended to encompass all such alternatives of the process controller , including multi-threaded and distributed process control methodologies.","As indicated above, the PIAS  may include a user interface  through which the PIAS  interacts with a user thereof, typically a circuit designer. The peripheral devices  may include a display unit and one or more input devices such as a mouse, a track ball, a stylus, a touch screen, and\/or a touchpad, among others. The combination of hardware devices and suitably programmed processing instructions executed by the processor  form the user interface . The user interface  is used in certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept to present data to the user in a meaningful form on a display, such as through images of circuit schematics, circuit layout diagrams, circuit test bench interfaces, data management interfaces such as file directories, and other images recognized by the user.","The user interface  may also interpret user manipulations of any input device into messages and instructions that can be recognized by the process controller . The user interface  may include a plurality of user controls to afford the user interactivity with and control over the PIAS . The user controls may include the input devices described above, and may also include software implemented controls on the display, such as buttons, menus of commands, text command entry blocks, and other suitable software controls. The foregoing description of the user interface  may be met by a suitably configured graphical user interface (GUI), the implementation details of such will be omitted for the sake of providing a concise description of the general inventive concept.","The PIAS  may include a database  of circuit objects that maintain all the data necessary to design, analyze, modify, and fabricate a circuit per the specifications of the designer. As used herein, a circuit object is a data structure that can be stored in a memory device to contain data of a circuit element so that the circuit element can be viewed, modified, interconnected with other circuit elements, and analyzed in one or more circuit design contexts selected by a user. Such may be achieved by a suitable data abstraction technique so that a particular circuit element may be, for example, presented as a schematic symbol in a schematic entry design context, presented as a footprint in a layout design context, presented as a routing component in a circuit routing design context, and provided as a component model in a circuit analysis and design verification context. A circuit object may also be hierarchical, whereby a circuit object contains other circuit objects of circuit elements interconnected to form a component that has a schematic symbol, layout footprint, and a terminal characteristics model used as a single element in a circuit. An example of such a circuit object is that of an operational amplifier. Similarly, an analysis object is a data structure that can be stored in a memory device to contain data of a non-circuit element, such as cell data, so that the non-circuit element can be viewed, modified, interconnected with other non-circuit elements, and analyzed in one or more circuit design contexts selected by a user. It is to be understood that in the descriptions below, unless otherwise made clear to the contrary, operations described below as being performed on a circuit element or a non-circuit element implies the operation being performed on the containing circuit object or analysis object, respectively, by the components of the PIAS .","It is to be understood that interconnection and power distribution components, such as terminal pads, wires, conductive traces and segments thereof, inter-layer vias, power planes, and ground planes, among others, are considered circuit elements per the definition given above, and may be contained in a corresponding circuit object in memory. Virtual nodes may also be stored in circuit objects, as well as any equivalent circuit model connected between virtual nodes. Moreover, circuit-bearing media are also circuit components that may be contained in a circuit object. Accordingly, a circuit designer may construct a power distribution circuit on a circuit-bearing medium of, for example, silicon, which has a known electric permittivity that may be stored in the circuit object of the circuit-bearing medium. Such physical constants and circuit component dimensions can be obtained from the circuit objects of the components forming a power distribution circuit to construct equivalent circuit models described below.","Circuit storage area  is a work space in memory, such as in data memory , in which to store circuit instances. As used herein, a circuit instance is a data structure in memory containing all of the circuit objects necessary to view, modify, analyze, and evaluate a circuit or sub-circuit. It is to be understood that although only a single circuit storage area is illustrated in , any number of such storage areas may be used to provide the intended purposes as described herein without deviating from the spirit and intended scope of the present general inventive concept. Additionally, the circuit storage area may be defined as a static memory structure, or may be dynamically allocated. The present general inventive concept is not limited to particular implementations of the circuit storage area.","As illustrated in , PIAS  may include a mesh data processor  to execute the operations necessary to place in memory, such as in circuit storage area , a plurality of virtual nodes at selected locations on a power distribution path. When the virtual nodes are linked, such as through an equivalent circuit model, the mesh data processor  may construct a netlist to define a structure of the interconnected mesh components, such as transmission line segment equivalent circuit models and resistive equivalent circuit models. The present general inventive concept is not limited by a particular implementation of any of the data processing functions of the mesh data processor , and any suitable function may be used with the present general inventive concept without deviating from spirit and intended scope thereof. The data processing functions to carry out the present general inventive concept will be described below as applicable; otherwise the implementation details thereof will be omitted for the sake of providing a concise description of the general inventive concept.","The exemplary PIAS  includes an analyzer  that produces analytical data obtained from simulations of the interconnected mesh components generated by the mesh data processor . The analyzer  may implement various analytical functions including, but not limited to, power integrity analysis. The present general inventive concept is not limited to a particular implementation of any of the analysis functions of the analyzer , and any suitable function that performs the intended purpose as described herein may be used with the present general inventive concept without deviating from spirit and intended scope thereof. Certain features of the analyzer  and the analysis functions to carry out the present general inventive concept will be described below as applicable; otherwise the implementation details thereof will be omitted for the sake of providing a concise description of the general inventive concept.","Portions of the PIAS  may be implemented by a suitable Electronic Design Automation (EDA) system having similar features as those described above. The present general inventive concept may be practiced by an existing EDA system having the novel features as described and incorporated herein. Such incorporation may be carried out by altering the flow of the EDA system, or may be incorporated as a functional module to interact with an existing EDA system through, for example, an Application Programming Interface (API), or other such mechanism.","In the paragraphs that follow, the present general inventive concept will be further described and explained through specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It is to be understood that although operations below are described as though graphic manipulations are occurring, such as constructing cells in a region of interest, such is for description purposes, and the underlying operations that are performed by coordinated processes of the PIAS  are implied, as would be appreciated by the ordinarily skilled artisan. Additionally, it is to be understood that while various processes are described by way of graphical depictions of intermediate operations, certain processes may be executed without a corresponding visual depiction on a display device.","In , there is illustrated a flow diagram of an exemplary process  to tessellate the ROI by a mesh of cells according to an embodiment of the present general inventive concept. The exemplary tessellation process  illustrated in  assumes a Cartesian coordinate system. However, the skilled artisan will recognize that the process is readily extendable to other geometries and coordinate systems thereof. It is to be understood, also, that the process  illustrated in  conveys general procedures for purposes of explanation that may be accomplished by suitable machine operations, such as programmed instructions executed on a computer platform like that illustrated in . The general inventive concept may be carried out by operations other than those illustrated in  and\/or in an order other than that illustrated in , as will be appreciated by the skilled artisan.","Upon entry, and after generation of a circuit design at operation , the exemplary tessellation process  transitions to operation , whereby variables GridX and GridY are initialized to establish the number of major cells in the x and y directions, respectively. These values may be chosen by a circuit designer to provide a desired resolution at a desired accuracy in the analysis results. Additionally, in operation , the variable Level is initialized to establish the number of minor cells that can be divided from a major cell. The variable Level may also be used in the calculation of the size of the base cell, as discussed in further detail below. For example, if the GridX is 8 and the Level is 2, then the size of the base cell is 1\/16 of the width of the outline.","As used herein, a major cell is the largest allowable subdivision of the ROI, and the minor cell is the smallest allowable subdivision in the ROI, and is alternatively referred to herein as a base cell. Accordingly, upon completion of the tessellation process , a cell can be no larger than a major cell and no smaller than a minor cell, but may be of any size therebetween.","In operation , the number of minor cells in the x and y directions is determined, such as by dividing Level into GridX and GridY. The exemplary process  then transitions to operation , whereby the boundaries of the ROI, e.g., the outer peripheral boundary and any interior peripheral boundaries are determined. For example, in , regions A, B, C, D, E, and F are illustrated, where the regions may include voids, slots, or other features. Operation  may determine the interior and exterior boundaries (e.g., illustrated as boundary \u201cG\u201d in ) of the ROI. As stated above, the ROI is the geometrical intersection of the power plane and the ground plane, which may be acquired by suitable intersection determination technique. The outer peripheral boundary is then acquired from coordinates of the outer edges of the resultant shape of the ROI. The ROI may be stored in a circuit object to include the dimensions thereof, which can be used to obtain the coordinates of the boundaries in the coordinate system.","In operation , the maximum and minimum mesh spacing is determined. The minimum spacing may be determined by computing the number of base cells that will completely populate the ROI in the x and y directions. Similarly, the maximum mesh spacing may be determined from the number of major cells that will populate the ROI. The mesh spacing determines the placement of cells within the ROI, as will be described below.","As is illustrated in , the exemplary process  transitions to operation , whereby a mesh of base cells is defined in the ROI. The present general inventive concept is not limited by the construction of the base cell mesh, however, for purposes of illustration, an exemplary process for operation  is illustrated in .","Referring to , the exemplary process  corresponding to operation  in , transitions to operation , whereby the vertices and other transitions in the boundary shape of the ROI, all of which will be referred to herein as vertices, are determined. For example, as illustrated in , a horizontal linear boundary may be formed between vertex A and vertex B. From one vertex to another vertex of the ROI, the base cells in a row define the peripheral horizontal boundary line AB if the line intersects a cell. The vertices may be determined from placement data in the layout of the power distribution circuit. The vertices may be used to demark segments of the boundary, and may be stored in a circuit object, such as a circuit object created to store data associated with the ROI, so as to be retrieved as necessary. With the vertices defined in operation , any cell in line with a vertex that defines an endpoint of a horizontal line may be considered to define the boundary.","In operation , the inclusion status of base cells on arcuate boundary segments of the outer peripheral boundary are set according to whether the cell is on the peripheral boundary per predetermined inclusion criteria. An exemplary determination of whether a cell is within the peripheral boundary at arcuate segments thereof is illustrated in . As illustrated in the figure, an arcuate boundary segment  defines an arc of radius R as measured from arc center point C. The center point C and the radius R of the boundary segment may be obtained from a circuit object containing the fabrication data for the PGPP component of which the arcuate boundary segment  is a part. Base cells, representatively illustrated at base cell , are positioned at the boundary  according to the mesh spacing determined in operation . A base cell  may be considered to be on the arcuate boundary segment  if all four corner points -of the base cell  are within the region of the arcuate boundary  defined by the radius R and the distance from all corner points of the base cell  to the center of the arcuate segment is neither greater than nor less than the radius R. For example, the base cell  is not on the arcuate boundary  since it is not in the region thereof as the cell  is on a linear segment demarked by the transition point P. The base cell  is not on the arcuate boundary segment  since the distance from all four corner points to the center C is less than the radius R, and the base cell  is not on the arcuate boundary segment  since the distance from all four corner points thereof to the center C is greater than the radius R. Base cell , however, is considered to be on the arcuate boundary since the distance from the corner , as determined by, for example, a vector magnitude of the vector U, is less than the radius R and the distance from at least one other corner point to the center of the arcuate segment , as determined by, for example, the vector magnitude of the vector V, is greater than the radius R. In the case of base cell , the distances from the center point C to all three remaining corner points -are greater than the radius R.","In operation , the inclusion status of base cells on the horizontal and vertical linear boundaries of the ROI is set according to whether a base cell lies on the boundary to define the boundary in cells. From one vertex to another vertex of the ROI, the base cells in a row for horizontal boundaries, and in a column for vertical boundaries, define the peripheral boundary if the line intersects a cell. For example, with the location of the vertices determined in operation , any cell in line with a vertex that defines an endpoint of a horizontal or vertical boundary segment is considered to define the boundary. Moreover, if the edge corresponding to a horizontal or vertical boundary segment is intersected by one cell then all of the cells in the row\/column, from vertex to vertex, define the horizontal or vertical boundary segment.","In operation , the inclusion status of base cells on other linear boundary segments, such as those that are aligned parallel to neither the horizontal or vertical axes, are set to define the boundary segment in base cells. Such condition is illustrated in , where a diagonal peripheral boundary segment is illustrated at boundary segment . In certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept, whether a base cell lies on the diagonal boundary may be determined by formation of suitable vectors and the computation of a vector cross-product. For example, in , a predetermined point on the boundary line  is selected, which is illustrated at point . One of the vertices defining the endpoints of the boundary segment  may be used as the predetermined point. A vector E may be aligned to the boundary segment  and four vectors A-D may be formed that each begin at the point P and are directed through respective corners of the base cell . If a base cell is on the boundary segment , such as is illustrated in , the vector cross-product of the vector E with each of the vectors A-D will produce at least one result having a direction that is opposite to other cross-product results. For example, in , the cross-products of the vector E with the vectors A and B produce resultant vectors in the positive z direction, whereas the cross-products of the vector E with the vectors C and D produce resultant vectors in the negative z direction. In contrast, when a base cell  illustrated in  is removed from the boundary segment , the cross-products of E with the vectors F-J produce respective resultant vectors that are all in the same direction. Since the determination of whether a base cell lies on the peripheral boundary  can be made from evaluating the direction of the resulting vector of the cross-product of the vector E with vectors passing through corner points of the base cell, certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept determine only the sign of the result as opposed to computing the complete cross-product.","Depending on the size, mesh placement, and general shape of the base cells, as well as the position of the boundary segment, additional cells may have to be placed and evaluated so that the entire boundary segment is defined in base cells. For example, as illustrated in , diagonally oriented base cells may not correspond to the orientation of the peripheral boundary segment  due to the mesh placement and shape of the base cells. Thus, additional base cells may be placed, such as illustrated at cells A and B in , and evaluated, such as by the cross-product computation described above, to determine whether the placed base cells are on the boundary segment . In , the cells marked A will be determined to be remote from the boundary segment , whereas the cell marked B will be determined to be on the boundary segment . Cells may be placed and evaluated, such as by a suitable loop of processor instructions, until the boundary segment  is defined by base cells, such as is illustrated in . Once a cell has been established as a boundary cell, an analysis object containing the cell information can set a data field indicating the status of the cell being a boundary cell.","Referring again to , in operation , whereby internal boundaries defining, for example, voids in one or both of the power plane and the ground plane, are defined in base cells. The defining of internal boundary segments may be accomplished in a manner similar to that of external peripheral boundary segments, and a description thereof will be omitted for conciseness of the description of the present general inventive concept.","A peripheral boundary  as defined by base cells  for an ROI  is illustrated in . In the illustrated example, the ROI  is defined by the shape of the power plane , which when intersected with the ground plane  retains its shape. As is illustrated in , the boundaries of voids -have been defined in base cells as well. The ROI  illustrated in  completely defined in base cells is illustrated in . It is to be understood that other techniques to establish the periphery of the ROI in base cells may be used with the present general inventive concept without deviating from the spirit and intended scope thereof.","In operation , the inclusion status of the cells interior to the ROI are set. An exemplary technique to set the inclusion status is illustrated in .","As illustrated in , the boundary cells (i.e., the cells of effective boundary ) of the exemplary ROI  may be placed by the process described above, for example, and an indication that the cells are boundary cells may be contained in analysis objects of the cells. A rectangular box  may be established that surrounds the ROI  to be analyzed, and the mesh operation illustrated in  and described above may be performed. State values for the base cells in the ROI  may be initially set to a state value of \u201c0\u201d as illustrated in . Arrowed lines indicate the loop direction around the effective boundary  of the ROI , starting at, for example, a lower-left effective boundary cell which may be referred to as the start cell (\u201cSC\u201d). Although the lower-left boundary cell is used as the starting point of the loop, any other suitable cell location along the effective boundary  may be selected as the SC.","The \u201cloop\u201d may be based, at least in part, on the position of the boundary cells. The \u201cvertical position\u201d of a boundary cell which is part of the effective boundary  may be moved in the y (i.e., vertical \u201cup\u201d) or y\u2032 (i.e., vertical \u201cdown\u201d) direction. For example, as illustrated in , a temporary state of \u201c+1\u201d may be assigned to each cell which is located to the left of a boundary cell along the effective boundary .","In an example using Cells A, B and C illustrated in , Cell A may be greater in height in the vertical y direction than Cell B, and Cells B and C may have the same vertical height in the y direction. In moving along the arrowed loop (starting from the SC), if the former cell has the same height in the vertical y direction, the cell may not be used as an effective boundary cell. In this example, Cell A and Cell B may be used as the effective boundary cell, and Cell C may not be used as an effective boundary cell because its former boundary cell (i.e., Cell B) has the same height as Cell C. As illustrated in , starting from the SC in the vertical y direction, the temporary states of cells which are to the left of the determined boundary cells are indicated with a temporary state value of +1.","Cell D, Cell E, Cell F, and Cell G are illustrated in . In this illustrated example, Cell D may be greater in vertical height than Cell E, with Cell E being equal in height when compared to Cell F, and Cell F may be greater in vertical height than Cell G. Similar to as described above, if the former cell has the same height in the vertical y\u2032 direction (vertical down), the cell may not be used as an effective boundary cell. In this example, Cell F may not be used as an effective boundary cell, as Cell F is the same size as the cell which proceeds it (i.e., Cell E) in the loop direction. As Cell D, Cell E, and Cell G have different vertical heights from the cells which preceded them, they may be used as effective boundary cells. As illustrated in , the value of the temporary state for all cells on the left side of the effective boundary cells is set to \u22121.","The same process may be used as described above in comparing the cells along the effective boundary  with one another. As illustrated in , after comparing the cells along the effective boundary , the state of each cell may be obtained from it temporary state. When the temporary state is a non-zero value, the state of the cell may be reset as +1. Otherwise, it may be kept as a zero value.","It may be determined whether a base cell is \u201cIN\u201d or \u201cOUT\u201d of the boundary, and set accordingly. Turning to , the state of all the cells within (and including) the boundary may be set as +1, and these cells may be set as \u201cIN.\u201d The status of cells outside the boundary cells may have a zero value, and may be set as \u201cOUT.\u201d","Although this setting may be performed in both horizontal and vertical directions, at least the vertical direction may be utilized in the setting of the \u201cIN\u201d or \u201cOUT\u201d status. If the shape has voids, manufacturing anomalies, slots, or other features, a similar process may be used to determine which cells are \u201cIN\u201d or \u201cOUT\u201d of the void areas. For example, the cells on the inside of the void may have a temporary state as a non-zero value, and their status may be set as \u201cOUT.\u201d The cells positioned outside the void may have a temporary state of 0 (zero), with the status of such cells set to \u201cIN.\u201d","Once the ROI has been defined in base cells and the inclusion status of these cells has been set, process  of  transitions to operation , whereby patterns of cells are determined by the placement of the cells within and on the boundary of the ROI.","An exemplary process to determine the cell pattern within the ROI is illustrated in . An exemplary row of cells that may be in the ROI is illustrated in , where the cells in the x direction in the cell row have the same width value h. As illustrated in , the cells in the exemplary column of cells that may be in the ROI may have the same value for the width w in the y direction. , which is discussed in detail below, illustrates the structure of the cell rows and columns together.","Turning to , a portion of an exemplary ROI  having rows and columns of cells, as well as other features, is illustrated. The ROI  is defined by a complex peripheral boundary , which includes cutouts, representatively illustrated at cutout , and a linear boundary segment  that is parallel to neither axis of the exemplary coordinate system illustrated in . The ROI  is also defined by a circular void .","It is to be assumed that the ROI  has been defined in base cells, such as by the exemplary process described above in connection with . However, to avoid congesting the figure, the scales  and  are provided exterior to the ROI  to indicate the placement of base cells therein in the horizontal and vertical directions.","In accordance with certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept, the cells of the ROI  are merged to form super cells, which may be larger than the maximum allowed sized cell, but may not be smaller than a base cell. In certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept, the patterns of cells in the ROI  define the largest possible super cells such that the width h in the x direction as illustrated in , of all cells in a row of cells is constant, and the width w in the y direction of all cells in a column of cells is constant, where the columns and rows of cells each terminates at respective ends thereof on a boundary of the ROI , either on an inner boundary defining a void , or on the outer peripheral boundary .","A suitable pattern recognition process may select, for example, a boundary cell and determine the extent of the row and column in which that cell resides. Indications of the row and column may be stored in the analysis object of the cell, and a next boundary cell may be selected to determine the extent of the row and column in which that cell resides. When all of the boundary cells have been processed, patterns may be determined from common row\/column structure of the cells. For example, the cells in region  of ROI  are in rows that terminate on the left at boundary segment  and on the right at boundary segment  of the cutout . Similarly, the cells in region  are in columns that terminate on the same upper and lower boundaries of the ROI. The cells in region  are in columns terminating at one end thereof at circular void . In certain embodiments of the present general inventive concept, cells in the ROI  in common rows and columns, i.e., rows and columns respectively terminating at common boundaries of the ROI  in both x and y directions, may be merged into a single super cell. The regions of commonality form a pattern which is illustrated in  by the grid of dashed lines.","Referring to , the process  transitions to operation , whereby the cells of the ROI are merged to form the super cells according to patterns determined in operation . A broader example is illustrated in , wherein the ROI  illustrated in  is defined in super cells. Additionally, an example of super cells defined in an ROI  with an arcuate boundary  is illustrated in .","In operation , the super cells that are greater than the maximum size are divided into cells that are no greater than the maximum size limit of the cells. Upon completion of operation , the adaptive mesh of cells is complete. The ROI  described above is illustrated in  as tessellated in cells that are no greater in size than a major cell and no smaller in size than a base cell.
