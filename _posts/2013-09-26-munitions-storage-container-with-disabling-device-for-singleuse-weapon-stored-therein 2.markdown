title: Munitions storage container with disabling device for single-use weapon stored therein
abstract: A munitions disabling device is disposed in a storage container proximate the muzzle of a single-use weapon. A projectile having a fused warhead is loaded in the weapon prior to storing the weapon. If an unplanned stimulus launches the projectile while the weapon is in the storage container, the projectile will impact or strike the disabling device. The disabling device prevents detonation or explosion of the warhead.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the United States Government.","The invention relates in general to munitions, and in particular to compliance with Insensitive Munitions (IM) standards.","IM standards require that, to the extent practicable, munitions are safe when subjected to unplanned stimuli. Shoulder-launched single-use weapons are problematic because the weapon is packaged and stored with the projectile (and warhead) already loaded in the weapon. When exposed to unplanned external stimuli, single-use shoulder-launched munitions may fail IM requirements. For example, an unplanned stimulus may ignite the propellant in the single-use shoulder-launched weapon, thereby launching the projectile and activating the arming sequence of the warhead. If the warhead arms, it may detonate on impact (IM Type I detonation reaction). An IM Type V burning reaction is required to pass most IM requirements, but can be very difficult to achieve. Thus, an improvement from a Type I detonation to a Type IV deflagration reaction is desirable if it may be easily achieved.","Known munition cans or containers have several forms, including boxes and tubes. Some of these cans have IM features that: 1) provide for the venting of gases; 2) provide ballistic protection; or 3) provide insulation to delay the reaction time so other IM features may be utilized. Ballistic protection against fragment impact is often costly in terms of both packaging cost and logistical cost (weight, volume). Venting and insulation alone are often not sufficient, and additional IM features must be built into the weapon. The additional IM features may not be feasible due to cost and technical difficulty. While there are known methods to contain exploding ammunition, none of the known methods can contain a projectile with an exploding warhead after it is launched from a weapon.","A need exists for an apparatus and method for achieving at least a Type IV deflagration reaction when a projectile is launched from a weapon by unplanned stimuli. The solution must be relatively low in cost and have minimal logistical impact.","One aspect of the invention is an apparatus including a single-use weapon having a barrel, a muzzle, and a projectile with a fused warhead loaded in the weapon. The barrel defines a bore with a central longitudinal axis and a bore cross-sectional area. The apparatus includes a storage container of a size for storing no more than one of the single-use weapon. The storage container has a central longitudinal axis. The single-use weapon is disposed in the storage container with the central longitudinal axis of the bore of the weapon generally parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the storage container.","The storage container includes first and second closed ends joined by a closed body. A projectile disabling device is disposed inside the storage container proximate the first closed end and proximate the muzzle of the weapon such that the projectile strikes the disabling device when the projectile is launched from the weapon.","In one embodiment, the disabling device is a metal plate having a planar surface that is angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the bore and that faces the muzzle. In another embodiment, the disabling device is a curved pipe with a bore. The disabling device may also be a metal plate positioned parallel to the bore axis of the weapon such that the metal plate intersects a projection of the bore cross-sectional area along the bore axis. In a further embodiment, the disabling device is a metal spike positioned generally parallel to the bore axis and transversely offset from the bore axis.","The disabling device may be a pivoting frame. The pivoting frame includes a pair of parallel sides spaced apart a width greater than a width of the projectile, a striking panel that connects the pair of sides at one end of the pivoting frame, and a rear panel that connects the pair of sides at the other end of the pivoting frame.","Another aspect of the invention is a method of disabling a projectile launched from a single-use weapon. The projectile includes a fused warhead. The method includes launching the projectile from the single-use weapon while the single-use weapon is in a storage container. Then, the fused warhead is disabled using a disabling device disposed in the storage container proximate a muzzle of the single-use weapon. Disabling the warhead may produce a Type IV Insensitive Munitions reaction.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","12","14","10","12","18","18","12","10"]},"Projectile  includes a warhead  containing an explosive composition . A fuze  is used to ignite or detonate explosive composition . Explosive composition  may fill only a portion of the interior of projectile  or substantially all of the interior of projectile . Warhead  may be, for example, in the form of a shaped charge with a liner  and a void or empty space  forward of liner . Fuse  may be located behind explosive composition . In some embodiments of projectile , fuse  may be located at the nose  of projectile  or at some other location. Projectile  may include a fin assembly  enclosed in a rear portion  of the external casing of projectile . Fuse  will not arm warhead  until sufficient time has elapsed for projectile  to travel a safe distance from weapon  and the weapon user. Prior to arming warhead , it is possible to disable warhead  and\/or fuse .","Weapon  is stored in a storage container , shown schematically in . Projectile  with warhead  is loaded in weapon  prior to storage in container . Container  stores only a single weapon  and is sized for only a single weapon . Container  has a central longitudinal axis B. Weapon  is disposed in container  with bore axis A of weapon  generally parallel to axis B of container . Storage container  includes first and second closed ends ,  joined by a closed body . Container  may be made of, for example, metal or wood. If wood is used, metal framing for container  may be required. The metal frame may be required to enable container  to maintain enough structural integrity during the fast cook-off test. Container  with loaded weapon  disposed therein is stored in a horizontal position, that is, bore axis A and container axis B are horizontal in the stored position. Multiple containers  with respective loaded weapons  therein may be stacked or palletized with axes A and B horizontal.","If an unplanned stimulus ignites the propellant (not shown in the Figures) in weapon , projectile  may be launched from weapon , even though weapon  is stored in container . The kinetic energy of the launched projectile  may be used to disable warhead  and\/or fuse . A disabling device  may be stored in container  in front of muzzle  of weapon . When an unplanned launch of projectile  occurs, projectile  will impact or strike disabling device  in container . Disabling device  may be embodied in several forms.","Disabling device  may be a mass that damages projectile  or any of its components, for example, fuse  and\/or warhead . The mass may simply cause damage by impact with projectile  thereby damaging fuse  and\/or warhead . The mass may deflect or bend projectile  thereby deflecting, bending, shearing, or otherwise damaging fuze  or warhead . The mass may cut apart projectile  thereby damaging fuse  or warhead . The mass may puncture projectile , thereby damaging fuse  and\/or warhead . The disabling device  may, in addition to other methods, use the force of impact to move, pivot or bend projectile  in a manner to damage fuse  located behind warhead , or to damage warhead , or to damage another fuse located behind a precursor warhead.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["34","10","34","42","34","36","14","10","42","42","18","42","18","10"]},"Plate  may be made of metal, for example, low carbon steel. Plate  includes a planar surface  that forms an angle C () with respect to axis A of bore  and that faces muzzle . Angle C may be, for example, in the range of 15 to 75 degrees, and, preferably, in the range of 40 to 50 degrees. Plate  may have a thickness E () in the range of about \u215b inch to about 1.5 inches. The area of planar surface  is at least as large as the area H of the projection of the cross-sectional area of bore  () onto a plane parallel to planar surface .","As shown in , which is a view from above container , container  and weapon  are horizontal and plate  is preferably vertical. The preferred storage position is with container  and weapon  horizontal and with plate  vertical. In this position, components of deflected projectile  will travel in the general direction of arrow F and the deflected plate  will travel in the general direction of arrow G. Lateral deflection of projectile  and plate  is preferred rather than upward deflection of either projectile  or plate .","Plate  must be positioned in container  securely enough to prevent movement of plate  during routine shipping and handling of container . Of course, plate  will move after impact with projectile . Various methods may be used to position plate  in container . In one method, foam inserts may be disposed around plate  to maintain its position. If container  or a portion of container  is made of metal, another method of preventing unwanted movement of plate  is spot welding plate  at a few points to container  or its metal frame. There are numerous other methods to secure plate  in container  to prevent movement during routine shipping and handling.","Computer modeling and simulation tests were performed for a high energy projectile  fired from an M136 AT4 recoilless rifle and striking a one-half inch metal plate  at forty-five degrees. The simulation showed that the yield strength in the fuse and booster regions of projectile  was exceeded.","Actual tests were performed with a high energy projectile  striking low carbon steel plates with widths of \u215b, \u00bc, \u215c, \u00bd, and one inch, respectively. When using either the one inch thick plate or the \u00bd inch thick plate: 1) fuse  separated from warhead ; 2) the nose cone and half of shaped charge liner  shattered into 1 centimeter fragments; 3) shaped charge liner  was flattened; 4) explosive charge  pulverized into dust; and 5) fuse  did not arm. When using steel plates with \u215b, \u00bc, and \u215c inch thicknesses, all plates successfully removed fuse  from warhead . The \u00bc and \u215c inch thick plates also opened the warhead . Damage to projectile  far exceeded expectations. The thickness of plate  needed to successfully de-arm projectile  was unexpectedly small.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["18","44","42","24","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["46","48","50","52","46","34","42","18","52","46","18","42","46","34","42","18","52","46","24","20","46","18","46"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIG. 12"],"b":["34","54","34","54","54","54","18","54","18","58","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 14","FIG. 15","FIG. 13","FIG. 3","FIG. 13"],"b":["34","60","60","60","60","60","62","64","62","64","18","66","62","64","60","68","62","64","60","68","70","60","68","18"]},"In the storage position of container  shown in , axis A of bore  and axis B of container  are horizontal and the pair of parallel sides ,  of pivoting frame  are in vertical planes.
