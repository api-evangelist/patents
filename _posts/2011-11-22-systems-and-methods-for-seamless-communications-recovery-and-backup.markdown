title: Systems and methods for seamless communications recovery and backup
abstract: A recovery network may provide communication recovery and backup services to a carrier having a service area. The recovery network may be configured to communicatively couple the carrier to the public communication network (PCN) using one or more alternative communication paths, such as a satellite network. The alternative communication paths may couple the recovery network to the carrier independently of the PCN. When the carrier detects a failure in its uplink to the PCN, it may failover to the recovery network, which may service the communication requests using the alternative communication path(s). Similarly, the recovery network may be used to service inbound communication requests directed to the carrier or other organization, such as a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). When used with a PSAP, the recovery network may be configured to access and/or provide metadata related to inbound communication requests.

No. 12\/715,364, filed Mar. 1, 2010, and entitled, \u201cSystem and Methods for Seamless Communications Recovery and Backup,\u201d which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/156,349, filed Feb. 27, 2009, and entitled, \u201cSystems and Methods for Seamless Communications Recovery and Backup,\u201d each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This disclosure relates to communication systems and, in particular, to systems and methods for providing seamless communications recovery and backup services.","Communication systems are critical for many organizations. However, it may be difficult to regain control of incoming and outgoing communications during emergency or other conditions, such as equipment failure, cabling failure, power system anomalies, disaster conditions (e.g., fire, earthquake, etc.), and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110","112","110","120","120"]},"The communication system  of the organization  includes a private branch exchange (PBX)  to couple the communications devices  of the organization  to the PCN  via a communications line . In addition, various computing devices  may be coupled to a network via the PBX  and\/or PCN . Although organization  is shown as connected to the PCN  via a PBX , any connection method and\/or connection device could be used under the teachings of this disclosure, such as an internet router, integrated access device, etc.","The communications line  may include a fiber-optic line (e.g., a T1 line) and\/or any other data communications medium known in the art (e.g., copper cabling, wireless transmission, or the like). The communications devices  of the organization  may include, but are not limited to: telephones, fax machines, computing devices (e.g., personal computers), automated calling systems, voicemail systems, voice conferencing systems, group-messaging systems, radio systems, and the like.","The connection  between the organization  and the PCN  may allow the organization  to communicate with other entities . The entities  may communicate with the organization  using various communications devices and according to various communications protocols including, but not limited to: fax , cellular telephone , land-line telephone , satellite phone , computing device  (e.g., over the Internet), and the like.","Communications between the entities  and the organization  can be disrupted by a fault condition occurring within the PCN  and\/or between the PCN  and the organization  (e.g., on the communication line ), and\/or within the organization  itself (e.g., the PBX ). As used herein, a fault condition may refer to any condition wherein services provided to the organization  by the PCN  are disrupted or degraded.","For example, portions of the PCN  may experience equipment failure, power loss, or the like. These faults may disrupt the connection between the PCN  and the organization  (e.g., PBX ). Alternatively, or in addition, a fault not directly related to the PCN's  connection to the organization  may cause loss of services for the organization . For example, due to faults in other portions of the PCN , the PCN  may allocate resources normally used to service the organization  to servicing other customers (not shown), which may degrade the services available to the organization . Similarly, faults may occur on the communications line  connecting the organization  to the PCN , such as a line cut, or other physical damage.","A fault condition may additionally encompass any condition within the organization  that would preclude normal operation of the communication system  (e.g., a robbery within a banking organization , a fire, chemical spill, hardware and\/or software failure of the PBX, power failure, or the like). Therefore, although selected fault types and fault scenarios are discussed herein, one skilled in the art would recognize that there are virtually unlimited different ways in which the services between the PCN  and the organization  could be disrupted. Each of these possible fault types and\/or scenarios falls within the scope of this disclosure. Therefore, this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular fault type or fault scenario.","A recovery network  may provide communication recovery services to the organization . The recovery services may be activated during a fault condition or other disruption of service between the organization  and the PCN . As used herein, recovery services may include a full replacement of the communications services provided by the PCN , replacement of a different or alternative set of communications services, and\/or supplemental replacement of the services provided by the PCN  (e.g., the recovery network  may provide communications services in parallel with the PCN ). The nature of the recovery services provided to the organization  may be defined by configuration information maintained by the organization . As will be discussed below, the configuration information may include one or more recovery rules to specify how particular communications are to be processed by the recovery network .","The recovery network  may provide an alternative communication path by which communication between the entities  and the organization  may be maintained during a disruption of service in the PCN  or elsewhere. For example, in some embodiments, the recovery network  may configure the PCN  to divert incoming communication requests directed to the organization  (e.g., incoming calls, faxes, email messages, etc.) to the recovery network . The recovery network  may service the communication requests using an alternative communication path, such as a satellite network , as shown in .","As will be discussed below, when active, the recovery network  may selectively service communication requests directed to the organization  using one or more alternative communications paths, by routing the requests to alternative addresses (e.g., phone numbers) within the PCN , by providing equivalent services (e.g., providing a phone tree, directory, etc.), and\/or by backing up the communication requests. The determination of which requests should be handled in which manner (as opposed to handling the requests using other recovery mechanisms) may be specified in configuration information maintained within the recovery network . For instance, the configuration information for the organization  may include a \u201crecovery rule\u201d to specify that requests directed to a particular number within the organization (e.g., premier customer hotline) be routed directly to the organization  via the satellite network . Other recovery rules may specify how the recovery network  is to process other communication requests. For instance, a recovery rule may specify that calls to a general customer information telephone number be routed to an automated phone tree, or to another destination in the PCN , such as a cellular telephone or landline (e.g., to save bandwidth on the satellite network  for more important communications).","As shown in , the alternative communication path, satellite network , may provide a communication link between the recovery network  and organization  that is independent of the PCN . Therefore, the recovery network  may be capable of providing communications services for the organization  regardless of (e.g., independently of) the organization's  connectivity to the PCN .","Although the alternative communication path  is shown in  as a satellite network , any alternative communication path known in the art could be used. Examples of alternative communication paths include, but are not limited to: one or more wireless networks (e.g., a wireless point-to-point network), one or more radio frequency (RF) network, a dedicated, wired network, an IP network, a cellular network, a combination of networks, or the like. Therefore, this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular type of alternative communication path.","The organization  may be communicatively coupled to the satellite network  using appropriate communications equipment. In the  example, the organization  is coupled to the satellite network  via a satellite interface . The satellite interface  and\/or satellite network  may be capable of supporting the equivalent of one of more T1 connections (e.g., such as the connection  to the PCN ), which can be used for both voice and data communications. The communications bandwidth available through the satellite network  and\/or interface  may be further expanded by compressing the data transmitted thereon (discussed below).","The satellite interface  includes appropriate power and other equipment (e.g., satellite dish) for reception and transmission of data over the satellite network . In some embodiments, the satellite interface  may further include a backup power source (not shown) to power the satellite interface  and\/or the other communications components of the organization  (e.g., components , , and ) in the event of a power outage or other power supply anomalies, such as power spikes, brown-outs, or the like.","The satellite interface  may include a gateway  to integrate the communication system  with the satellite network . As will be discussed in additional detail below, the gateway  may be configured to process incoming and outgoing communications on the satellite network . The inbound data processing may include, but is not limited to decompressing, decrypting, authenticating, formatting, and de-multiplexing data received on the satellite network . The outbound data processing may include, but is not limited to compressing, encrypting, authenticating, formatting, and multiplexing data for transmission on the satellite network .","The gateway  receives data over the satellite network  (e.g., via the satellite interface ). The data may be encrypted (e.g., scrambled) using a particular encryption algorithm. The gateway  may be configured to decrypt the data using a shared key, a negotiated key, a secret key, or other data security mechanism (e.g., Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or the like).","The data transmitted on the satellite network  may be compressed using a particular compression algorithm or technique (e.g., the data may be compressed at a 16:1 compression ratio). The gateway  may decompress the incoming data to allow the data to be used by the communication system  (e.g., used by the PBX  and\/or computing devices ).","The gateway  may be further configured to de-multiplex the incoming data to determine the routing of the data within the communication system . The data transmitted over the satellite network  may include a plurality of multiplexed data streams (e.g., voice call streams, fax streams, IP data streams, and so on). The gateway  may be configured to identify and de-multiplex the various data streams within the incoming data (e.g., identify and de-multiplex voice data, fax data, IP network data, and so on). The gateway  may then process (e.g., format) and\/or route the de-multiplexed data to the appropriate receiver within the communication system  (e.g., route voice\/fax data to the PBX , route IP network data to the computing devices , and so on).","The gateway  may be further configured to format data received via the satellite network . For instance, voice\/fax data may be converted from a format used to transmit the data on the satellite network  into a format that can be processed by the PBX . For example, the PBX  may be configured to receive voice communications data in Primary Rate Interface\/Integrated Services Digital Network (PRI\/ISDN) format. However, voice communication data may be transmitted from the recovery network  in a different format (e.g., the recovery network  may packetize the data for transmission over the satellite network , an IP network, or other network). The gateway  may convert the voice\/fax data from the transmission format (e.g., IP packets) into the format used by the PBX  (e.g., PRI\/ISDN format). The nature of the conversion at the gateway  may be adapted according to the configuration and capabilities of the communication system  (e.g., PBX ). For example, in some embodiments, the PBX  may be configured to consume data in the Basic Rate Interface (BRI\/ISDN) format or other format. The gateway  may be configured to convert data accordingly (e.g., into the format used by the PBX ). Therefore, this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular data formats and\/or to any particular conversions therebetween.","The gateway  may be simultaneously coupled to an IP network of the organization  (e.g., comprising one or more computing devices ) to provide IP networking services thereto. As such, the gateway  may be configured to de-multiplex and\/or format inbound IP data received via the satellite network  from a format used on the satellite network  into a format that is usable by the computing devices  (e.g., formatted into IP packets, etc.). The IP network data processing may include de-multiplexing, decompressing, decrypting, and\/or authenticating the data, as described above.","The gateway  may process outbound voice and data for transmission on the satellite network . As discussed above, the outbound data processing may include formatting, multiplexing, compressing, encrypting, and\/or authenticating (e.g., digitally signing) the data for transmission on the satellite network . The gateway  may multiplex various types of data generated within the communication system  into one or more data streams (e.g., voice data, fax data, IP data, and so on). The gateway  may compress the outbound data according to a compression algorithm\/technique for transmission over the satellite network  (e.g., compressed at 16:1 ratio). In addition, the gateway  may format the data into format used by and\/or compatible with the satellite network  (e.g., packetize the data). The formatting may further include encrypting and\/or authenticating (e.g., digitally signing) the data as described above. The nature of the multiplexing, compression, encryption, and\/or authentication may be adapted according to the configuration and\/or capabilities of the satellite network  and\/or the satellite interface .","In this way, the gateway  may couple the communication system  to the satellite network  to allow communications data to be received and\/or transmitted thereby. Accordingly, a switch-over from communications services provided by the PCN  to communications services provided via the satellite network  may be seamless (e.g., may not cause disruption within the organization  and\/or may allow for continued use of the organization's  communication system , including the organization's  existing communication system  and\/or computing devices ).","In other embodiments, the gateway  may not be required. For example, the PBX  may be a VoIP PBX capable of processing data in the format used on the satellite network . In this case, the PBX  may be communicatively coupled directly to the satellite interface . In other embodiments, the communication system  may include a hardware\/software VoIP client (not shown). The hardware\/software VoIP client may be capable of processing data in the format used on the satellite network  and may, therefore, be coupled directly to the satellite interface .","The satellite interface  and\/or gateway  may be interchangeable. For example, the organization may have several interfaces  and\/or gateways  deployed at different locations (e.g., in different buildings, regions, and the like). Therefore, if one or more of the interfaces \/gateways  is damaged, the recovery network  may be configured to use another interface \/gateway . Similarly, the satellite interface  and gateway  devices may be mobile. This may allow the organization to move from one location to another with minimal disruption to its communications services or to provide service to additional locations. In some embodiments, the gateway  and\/or satellite interface  may be mounted on or inside a vehicle (e.g., truck or trailer) and parked outside another location to deliver service where needed. Additionally, the gateway  device may be capable of dynamically restoring communication with the recovery network  using another network connection (e.g., in the event the satellite network  becomes unavailable, goes down, is overloaded, etc.). The gateway  may be decoupled from the satellite interface  and plugged into another high-speed network connection (e.g., a high-speed Internet connection, wireless IP, cellular, etc.) at any location worldwide. The gateway  may provide the same compression\/decompression, encryption\/decryption, format conversions and other processes at the new location using the new network connection. For example, the gateway  device may be decoupled from the satellite interface  and connected directly into the organization's  still-functional high-speed Internet connection. The recovery network  may immediately communicate with and identify the gateway  at the new location (e.g., IP address), and resume incoming and outgoing communications with the organization  utilizing the new pathway. In some embodiments, the gateway  device may utilize the high-speed internet connection by default, and may only switch over to the satellite interface  when necessary (e.g., upon detecting a failure and\/or degradation of service in the Internet connection).","In some embodiments, the recovery network  may be configured to reroute some or all communication requests intended for the organization  to one or more other addresses within the PCN  (as opposed to routing the communication request to the organization  via the alternative communication path ). The recovery network  may include configuration information for the organization  (discussed below) whereby the organization  may designate processing to be performed on particular communication requests. For example, the recovery rules, discussed above, may specify different processing for different types of communication requests (e.g., call requests directed to one or more telephone numbers, one or more fax numbers, to particular IP addresses, to particular email addresses, and the like). One or more of these recovery rules may specify that requests made to a particular address within the organization  be rerouted to an alternative address within the PCN . For example, during a failure condition of the PCN , the recovery network  may route calls made to a line dedicated to providing customer information to a recording and\/or phone tree, which may provide responses to frequently asked questions. In this way, the organization  may free up bandwidth on the alternative communication path (satellite network ) for communication requests deemed to be more important.","Alternatively, calls deemed to be particularly important may be routed to a direct response line , such as a cellular telephone or satellite phone. For instance, the organization  may be cut-off from normal interaction with the PCN  due an interruption of service (e.g., equipment failure, cable cut, power anomaly, fire, robbery, etc.). During the emergency condition, the recovery network  may be configured to route certain communication requests to the rapid response line  to allow the organization  to continue servicing customers and\/or provide information to concerned parties (e.g., family members of the employees of the organization ).","The recovery network  may provide additional interfaces by which external entities  (e.g., callers) may communicate with the organization . For example, the communication system  of the organization  may include a phone tree, dial-by-name directory, dial-by-extension directory, automated attendants, music while on hold, and the like. When the organization  is cut off from the PCN , however, these services may become unavailable. The recovery network  may be configured to provide these services such that, when the recovery network  is active, entities  may communicate with the organization  through the recovery network  much as they would with the organization  through the PCN , providing an important \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d layer of transparency for callers. For example, the recovery network  may include a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) interface, a text-to-speech service, or other services, by which the organization's services may be made available to the entities  (e.g., the organization's dial-by-directory service, one or more automated attendants, and other services). The organization  may provide configuration information (e.g., recovery rules, phone tree information, directory information, and the like), which may configure the recovery network  to emulate the operation of the organization's  communication system  (e.g., provide the same dial-by-name directory, extension directory, music on hold, and so on). The organization  may provide the recovery network  with voice recordings and other assets to allow the recovery network  to closely emulate the organization  (e.g., provide callers with the organization's  employee directory, prompts, music, branding, message, and the like).","In another embodiment, the recovery network  may re-route communications to an alternative communications network (e.g., to a network other than those in the PCN ). Rerouting the communications to an alternative network may comprise converting communications data to\/from one or more alternative formats. In one example, the recovery network  may communicatively couple the organization  to an emergency services network , which may comprise one or more radio frequency (RF) networks (e.g., dedicated RF channels, frequencies, and so on). The recovery network  may receive voice communications originating at the organization  (via an alternative communication path, such as the satellite network ), and may forward the communication on the emergency services network . The forwarding may comprise forwarding the communication (which may have originally been voice telephone data, VoIP data, or the like), as an RF transmission. Data originating in the emergency services network  and directed to the organization  may be converted into an appropriate format and forwarded to the organization  via the satellite network . In this way, the organization  may communicate with an alternative communications network (e.g., an emergency services network ) using its existing communications infrastructure .","As will be discussed below, the operation of the recovery network  may be controlled via a configuration interface (not shown). Personnel of the organization  may access the configuration interface to update the configuration information of the organization  in real time (e.g., activate\/deactivate the recovery network , change communication routing settings, change alternative communication path settings, change caller-selectable options, record greetings and prompts, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","240","241","241"]},"Although  depicts only a single computing device , the recovery network  may be implemented using plurality of computing devices in a clustered configuration (not shown). The clustered configuration may allow the recovery network  to provide concurrent recovery services for a plurality of different organizations (not shown). For example, the clustered configuration may allow the recovery network  to scale as required by the conditions at the organizations. Moreover, the clustered configuration may be spread over various different geographical regions such that, if one or more of the geographical regions of the recovery network  experiences a failure (e.g., power loss, communications failures, etc.), other portions of the recovery network  may continue to provide recovery services. Therefore, the clustered configuration of the recovery network  may include redundancy, such that the recovery network  may continue to provide services regardless of the loss of portions of the cluster. The cluster may further provide for fail-over and\/or load balancing between cluster members.","Various components (discussed below) of the recovery network , such as the data store , the alternative path interface , the PCN interface , the alternative network interface , and\/or the backup module  may comprise redundant components. For example, the PCN interface  may be configured to interface with the PCN  using a plurality of different connection media, using various different communication protocols, and so on (e.g., via multiple T1 lines, fiber lines, wireless links, network connections, multiple service providers, and so on). Therefore, if one or more of the interfaces is down, other interfaces may be used to maintain communication with the PCN . The alternative path interface  may include similar redundant connections to each of the one or more alternative communication paths  (satellite communication path),  (wireless\/radio communications path), and\/or  (fiber optic communication path).","Although not shown in , the recovery network  may include and\/or be communicatively coupled to other types of alternative communication paths. For example, the alternative communication paths - may include, but are not limited to: an IP network, such as the Internet; a point-to-point wireless network (such as the radio network ), a virtual private network (VPN), a MultiProtocol Label Switching network MPLS, a mesh network, a WiMax network (e.g., IEEE 802.16 network), or the like. Therefore, this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular set of alternative communication paths -.","In some embodiments, the functional modules (e.g., modules , , , , , and ) may be implemented (in whole or in part) as respective, distinct software modules embodied on a computer-readable storage medium and operable on one or more of the clustered computing devices  of the recovery network . Moreover, one or more of the modules may be tied to particular hardware components of the one or more computing devices. For example, the data store  may be tied to one or more data storage medium devices (not shown) capable of storing the data structures used by the data store . Similarly, the alternative path interface , the PCN interface , and\/or the alternative networks interface  may be tied to one or more communications interfaces used to interact with the alternative communication paths -, alternative networks , and\/or the PCN , respectively.","The configuration interface  provides an interface whereby an organization may modify and\/or control the operation of the recovery network . Each organization (not shown) to which the recovery network  provides recovery services may have respective configuration information associated therewith. The configuration information may be created and edited via the configuration interface . The recovery network  may change its operation in real-time according to changes to the configuration information made through the configuration interface .","The configuration information of the one or more organizations is stored in a data store . The data store  is depicted in  as comprising configuration information  of a particular organization (not shown). The data store  may comprise and\/or be communicatively coupled to data storage media, such as, but not limited to: fixed discs, optical media, distributed data storage media, a storage area network (SAN), a redundant array of inexpensive discs (RAID), Flash memory, a database, a directory service, a combination of data storage types, or the like. The data store  may be implemented using distributed and\/or redundant data storage media to reduce the risk of data loss due to hardware\/software faults.","The configuration interface  may be accessible via the PCN  (e.g., may be accessible via a network, such as the Internet, a phone connection, or the like). The configuration interface  may provide for activation\/deactivation of the recovery network  for a particular organization. As will be discussed below, when the recovery network  is activated, communication requests directed to the organization may be processed by the recovery network . The processing may include, but is not limited to: servicing the communication request using an alternative communication path (e.g., a satellite network ); routing the communication request to an alternative location (phone number) within the PCN ; backing up the communication request; servicing the communication request (e.g., using a phone tree, directory, or other system provided by the recovery network ); or the like.","A soft switch or functionally similar module  is configured to process communication requests according to the configuration information  of a particular organization. The term \u201csoft switch\u201d is used to illustrate that the communications pathways connected and\/or processing applied by the soft switch  may be dynamically set according to configuration information of an organization  (e.g., data within the data store ), which may be updated in real-time. Therefore, the operation of the soft switch module  may be modified in real-time according to the contents of the data store .","The soft switch module  is communicatively coupled to the data store  and to the PCN interface . The PCN interface  (discussed below) is adapted to configure, monitor, and\/or interact with the PCN . Accordingly, and as discussed above, the PCN interface  may include one or more communications interfaces to the PCN , such as one or more wireless network connections, PSTN connections, T1 lines, and so on.","When activated, the PCN  may be configured to divert (e.g., forward) communication requests intended for the organization to the recovery network . As discussed above, this may be done using a number of different mechanisms including, but not limited to:","carrier forwarding by one or more local carriers  and\/or VoIP providers  (local\/toll telephone-based communication) within the PCN;","porting one or more phone numbers of the organization to an alternative Local Routing Number (LRN) (e.g., a Central Office (CO)) using a standard number port operation (e.g., via a Local Number Portability (LNP) operation), to configure the PCN  (e.g., the local carrier , routing database , long distance carrier , or the like) to forward\/divert communication requests to the recovery network ;\n\nrerouting of communication requests to an alternative LRN by utilizing a secondary routing database  within the PCN  that sends and monitors communication requests to a number portability service (e.g., the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC)) to effect a routing change in a database within the PCN  (e.g., an LNP database or the like), which then forwards\/diverts communication requests to the recovery network ;\n\nredirecting VoIP traffic intended for the organization into the recovery network ;\n\nconfiguring one or more long distance carriers  and\/or VoIP providers  to divert communication requests to the recovery network ;\n\nusing a third-party Responsible Organization (RespOrg) (not shown) to configure the national SMS\/800 database  to direct incoming toll-free communication requests to the recovery network  (e.g., modify one or more carrier assignments within the SMS\/800 database  to direct requests to a carrier that is configured to direct incoming calls\/faxes to the recovery network );\n\ndirectly configuring the national SMS\/800 database to direct toll-free communication requests to the recovery network  (e.g., directly modify one or more carrier assignments within the national SMS\/800 database  to direct requests to a carrier that is configured to direct incoming calls\/faxes to the recovery network );\n\nreceiving directly dialed communication requests via a local or toll-free line (e.g., the recovery network  may publish one or more access numbers for the organization, which may be accessed via the PCN );\n\nrerouting IP communication by modifying host and\/or host table information in an IP routing provider ;\n\nrerouting IP communication at the Domain Name Service (DNS) level by configuring one or more DNS provider(s)  to direct IP traffic to the recovery network ; and the like.\n","In some embodiments, the reconfiguration\/diversion operations described above may be activated manually or automatically using pre-existing capabilities within the PCN . In the case of manual activation, personnel of the organization and\/or of the recovery network  may interact with the PCN  to reconfigure the PCN  accordingly. In the case of automatic activation, monitoring tools within the PCN  may detect a fault condition in the connection between the organization and the PCN , which may automatically trigger the diversion of communication requests to a pre-determined destination (e.g., the recovery network). Alternatively, or in addition, one or more of the reconfiguration operations described above may be performed programmatically (e.g., using one or more Application Programming Interfaces (API) available within the PCN ). For instance, in some embodiments, the soft switch  (or other component of the recovery network ) may be configured to access one or more APIs available through the PCN  to perform one or more of the reconfiguration operations described above. In addition, the recovery network  may include an automated caller system configured to autonomously interact with manual reconfiguration capabilities provided by the PCN  (e.g., an automated calling system of the recovery network  (not shown) may call into various PCN  reconfiguration systems to thereby reconfigure the PCN , as described above).","The PCN interface  of the recovery network  may be further configured to monitor communications within the PCN  to detect communication requests intended for the organization and to automatically, dynamically, or autonomously interact with the manual reconfiguration capabilities provided by the PCN  (as described above) to divert communication requests to the recovery network  for processing.","The recovery network  may receive forwarded\/diverted communication requests via multiple paths, including, but not limited to:","by one or more local carrier connections (e.g., from one or more local carriers );","by one or more long distance carrier connections (e.g., from one or more long distance carriers );","by one or more IP connections (e.g., from one or more SIP providers );","via IP traffic redirected using the one or more routing providers  and\/or DNS providers ; and the like.","Therefore, the PCN interface  may include a service request gateway (not shown), such as a SIP gateway, which may receive VoIP communication requests redirected\/forwarded from the PCN . The PCN interface  may process VoIP requests received via the service request gateway (e.g., SIP gateway) using a media server (not shown) and\/or VoIP gateway device (not shown). Alternatively, or in addition, the PCN interface  may process VoIP communication requests directly using the media server and VoIP gateway (e.g., bypassing the SIP gateway).","The alternative network interface  may communicatively couple the recovery network  to one or more alternative networks , such as emergency services networks, dispatch service networks, citizen networks, or the like. The alternative networks  may include one or more RF networks (e.g., Citizen Band (CB) radio, ham radio, emergency dispatch radio, and the like), dedicated wireless networks, dedicated telephone networks, or any other communication infrastructure known in the art. Communication traffic received from an organization (e.g., organization  of ) via one or more of the alternative communication paths , , and\/or  may be forwarded to an alternative network  using the alternative network interface . Accordingly, the alternative network interface  may be configured to convert communication traffic into an appropriate format for one or more of the alternative networks . Similarly, the alternative network interface  may receive communications directed to the organization from an alternative network , convert the communication into an appropriate format, and forward the communication to the organization using one or more alternative communication paths , , and\/or . The alternative network interface  may include one or more RF transponders, radios, or the like, which may be configured to communicate with the alternative networks .","As discussed above, the recovery network  may process communication requests forwarded from and\/or detected within the PCN  and\/or alternative networks  in a number of different ways. The processing applied by the recovery network  may be specified in the configuration information  of the organization. In some embodiments, the configuration information may include a set of \u201crecovery rules,\u201d which may specify how particular communication requests are to be processed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["300","310","320","300","311","321","312","312","322","313","323"]},"The recovery rules may also define handling of IP data. For example, a recovery rule may specify that IP traffic directed to a particular address or range of addresses  (168.34.23.*) be serviced on an alternative communication path . Similarly, email messages directed to address ranges or particular addresses  may be redirected to other locations within a PCN (e.g., to an alternative email address  or server).","Other recovery rules may specify conversion of a communication request from a first format to a second format. For example, the recovery rule  specifies that voice communication received on a particular phone number (801-555-1225) be sent to an email address . The rule  may cause the recovery network to convert the voice call into audio and\/or text for delivery to the specified email address . Similarly, rules may be specified to deliver voicemail, faxes, and other communication alerts over email or other network communication types (e.g., as SMS text messages, instant message, IP data, or the like).","A recovery rule may further specify that particular communications be backed-up for processing at a later time. As will be discussed below, the recovery network (such as recovery network ) may include a backup service configured to receive and\/or record communications data. The rule  may specify that communication data (voice, fax, or the like) received on a particular range of numbers (801-555-188*) be backed up  by the recovery network. Therefore, as communications data is received on the specified numbers , the communication data may not be rerouted to the organization, but may be processed and stored by a backup module within the recovery network. The backed-up communication data may be processed by the organization at a later time (e.g., after normal communications services have been restored). In some embodiments, as soon as communication is backed-up, a notification (such as an email, text message, or the like) may be sent to an entity within the PCN  (or other network), indicating that backed-up communications are available for retrieval.","As discussed above, some communication requests may be handled using services provided by the recovery network (recovery network ). These services may be configured to emulate the operation of the organization's own communication system. For example, the recovery network may provide a dial-by-extension directory service, a dial-by-name directory service, an automated phone tree, uniform call distribution (UCD), automatic call distribution (ACD), hunting, overflow between locations, a recorded messaging system, or the like. One or more recovery rules  may specify particular communication requests to be serviced using one or more of these services (provided by the recovery network). For example, the recovery rule  specifies that communication requests received on a set of numbers (calls received on 801-555-199*) be processed using an automated calling system  (e.g., automated calling system (org, 1)). The automated calling system  may be organization-specific, such that the system  may be configured to mimic a calling system of the organization (e.g., may use the same prompts, interface, provide the same options, and so on). The automated calling system  may be one of several different automated services provided for the organization. For example, in the processing rule , the automated calling system is specified as \u201c(org, 1)\u201d, which may specify one of several different automated calling systems provided by the recovery network and configured for the organization (e.g., an organization-specific technical support calling system, information calling system, or the like). Additional recovery rules  may be provided (not shown) to specify the use of other types of organization-specific services (e.g., dial-by-name directory services, phone tree services, and so on).","The recovery rules  may reference one or more alternative networks. In the  example, the recovery rule  specifies that communication requests directed to an emergency number (e.g., 911) are to be forwarded on an alternative network (an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatch network) . The EMS dispatch network may be an RF network comprising RF communication at a particular frequency and\/or channel. Voice communication originating at the organization may be converted into an RF transmission on the EMS dispatch network (at the appropriate frequency and\/or channel), and inbound EMS dispatch network traffic may be converted into an appropriate format (e.g., voice telephone) and forwarded to the organization. In this way, the organization may be communicatively coupled to the alternative network (EMS dispatch) using its own communications infrastructure.","In some embodiments, recovery rules may specify multiple, different processing directives for the same types of communication requests. For instance, the recovery rules may provide for servicing an incoming telephone call using the PCN, Internet, an alternative communication path, and so on. The recovery rules may be applied in order, which may be defined by a relative priority assigned thereto. For instance, when a communication request is received, it may be processed according to the highest priority recovery rule and, if the processing is unsuccessful, the communication request may be processed according to the next highest priority recovery rule, and so on. For example, the first, highest priority recovery rule may specify that the communication request be routed directly to the organization via the PCN. If the processing is unsuccessful (e.g., if the PCN is unavailable and\/or no one is available to handle the request at the organization), then the second, next highest priority recovery rule may be applied (e.g., the communication request may be routed to the organization over an alternative communication path and\/or the Internet). If the second processing is unsuccessful, a third recovery rule may be applied (e.g., that specifies that the communication request is to be forwarded to another entity within the PCN ), and so on. Some embodiments may include a default recovery rule, which may be used in the event that none of the other recovery rules is capable of successfully processing the request. The default recovery rule may backup the communication request, provide a phone tree, provide a recorded message, or the like.","Although  shows an exemplary set of recovery rules  in a particular data format, one skilled in the art would recognize that the teachings of this disclosure could be applied to any set of processing directives (recovery rules), stored in any format (e.g., as one or more database tables, directory entries, XML data, flat files, etc.). Moreover, the recovery rules  may be adapted for use according to the nature of the communication services provided by the recovery network. In some embodiments, the recovery rules may include rules specifying particular processes for handling VoIP communication data, voicemail systems, automated phone systems, automated directory systems, and so on. Therefore, this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular set of recovery rules in any particular recovery rule format.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["330","331","332","333","334","335","330","331","332","335","336"]},"According to the  recovery rules, a communication request directed to 801-555-1223 will first be processed according to the first priority recovery rule  (e.g., by attempting to service the request using an alternative communication path, such as the Internet). If the communication request cannot be serviced using the Internet (e.g., if the organization's connection to the Internet is unavailable, overly congested, or the like), the second priority recovery rule  may be applied. According to the second priority recovery rule , the communication request may be serviced using a satellite network (e.g., satellite network  of ). If the second priority recovery rule  is unsuccessful, the third recovery rule  may be applied, which may comprise forwarding the request to another address within the PCN (e.g., to 345-555-1349). If the recovery rule  is unsuccessful, the request may be backed-up (according to the fourth priority recovery rule ), and, if backup is unsuccessful, the default recovery rule  may direct the request to an automated calling system for the organization as described above.","In some embodiments, one or more of the recovery rules , , , , and\/or  may further include retry and\/or timeout values. A retry value may specify how many times a particular type of processing may be retried before moving on to the next, lower priority recovery rule. For instance, the recovery rule  may attempt to connect a communication request via the Internet three times with a pre-determined delay between each attempt before failing over to the next recovery rule (recovery rule ). By the same token, when the recovery network has detected and\/or been informed of a failure in a particular communication path, recovery rules specifying the path may be skipped until the path has been restored. For example, if the Internet connection to the organization is known to be unavailable, the recovery rule  may not attempt to service communication requests directed to the organization using the Internet (using recovery rule ) until the Internet connection is available again.","Although the recovery rules  in  are depicted with respective priority values (e.g., [1] through [4]), the disclosure is not limited in this regard. In some embodiments, particular recovery rules  and\/or processing directives may be automatically assigned a relative priority. For instance, recovery rules providing for immediate servicing of an incoming communication request (e.g., using an alternative communication path) may be preferred over other types of recovery rules. For example, recovery rules that provide for immediate servicing of a communication request by an organization using the organization's communication infrastructure (e.g., by servicing the communication request using an alternative communication path) may have a higher priority that other types of recovery rules. Recovery rules that forward communication requests to other addresses within the PCN may be given the next highest priority (since these rules provide for immediate servicing of the request), and other rules, such as backup, automated phone tree, voice mail, etc., may be given a lower priority, and so on.","Referring back to , the soft switch  may be configured to process communication requests forwarded from and\/or detected within the PCN  according to the configuration data  of the organization. Therefore, to determine the appropriate processing (e.g., which recovery rule applies to the communication), the soft switch  identifies the organization and\/or addresses within the organization to which the communication request was originally directed. This identifying may be performed in a number of different ways. For example, each organization serviced by the recovery network  may be assigned one or more recovery network -specific addresses (e.g., access numbers). Therefore, for incoming calls\/faxes forwarded to the recovery network  by a carrier \/, the soft switch  identifies the organization by the access number on which the calls\/faxes were received (e.g., the caller dials (801) 555-1212, which is forwarded by a local carrier  to a number (800) 666-7890, which is a recovery network  access number assigned to the particular organization). The organization associated with incoming calls\/faxes directed to the recovery network  by a toll-free carrier  may be similarly identified (e.g., identified based on the access number assigned to the organization within the recovery network ) or by pre-loading the organization's toll-free number(s) into the recovery network and associating them with the organization, then identifying the toll-free number dialed by the caller as the call is received by the recovery network . Alternatively, or in addition, different organizations may share the same access number within the recovery network  and may be distinguished using an extension or other qualifier appended thereto during forwarding by the local carrier , long distance carrier , or the like.","The organization associated with IP traffic may be identified according to routing and\/or naming information available within the communication request. The routing information may be appended to an IP header on IP packets or other message types. Alternatively, or in addition, the recovery network  may include plural, different access addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to which IP traffic may be forwarded\/redirected. As such, the soft switch  may identify the organization associated with IP data based upon the address within the recovery network  on which the data was received. Similarly, where IP data is routed to the recovery network  due to a modification of an address mapping in a DNS provider , the organization may be identified based upon the naming information within the data (e.g., domain host name within the IP data, such as www.organization.com, person@organization.com, or the like).","After determining the organization associated with the communication request, the recovery network  may be further configured to identify the original destination address (e.g., particular phone number) within the organization. As discussed above, an organization may provide plural different access addresses (e.g., phone numbers) through which entities may contact the organization. For example, the organization may have addresses (phone numbers) dedicated to providing different types of services, such as customer support, new sales, providing critical technical support, providing warranty information, providing general information about the organization, and so on. When active, the recovery network  may configure the PCN  to forward communication requests directed to each of these addresses to a single number assigned to the organization within the recovery network . However, the recovery network  may require the organization-specific number associated with forwarded\/redirected communication requests to handle the requests accordingly (according to the configuration information  of the organization). For instance, the organization's configuration information may specify that requests directed to a \u201cgeneral information\u201d number be forwarded to a recorded message and\/or an automated phone tree, whereas requests directed to a critical technical support number may be routed to the organization using an alternative communication path - and\/or to another location within the PCN  (e.g., a cellular telephone, a phone system at another location of the organization, or the like).","The recovery network  may be configured to identify an organization-specific address in a number of different ways, including, but not limited to:","configuring the PCN  (e.g., the local carriers , long-distance carriers , VoIP providers , and the like) to provide Originally Called Number (OCN) information with the forwarded\/diverted requests, the OCN information may identify the organization-specific address of the communication request;\n\nconfiguring the PCN  (e.g., the local carriers , long-distance carriers , VoIP providers , and the like) to provide Re-directed Number Identification Service (RDNIS) information with the forwarded\/diverted requests, the RDNIS information may identify the organization-specific address of the communication request;\n\nprompting the caller to use DTMF tones to input the address (phone number) they originally dialed;\n\nconfiguring the VoIP providers  to include diversion headers (e.g., Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) diversion headers) within forwarded\/diverted requests, the diversion header (e.g., SIP diversion header) may identify the organization-specific address of the communication request;\n\nexamining IP header and\/or IP addressing data within network data (e.g., HTTP requests, email messages, and so on); and the like.\n","Upon identifying an organization and\/or organization-specific address of the communication request, the soft switch  may process the request according to the configuration information  (e.g., recovery rules) of the organization. As described above, the recovery rules established by an organization may be configured to mimic the organization's existing communication system. Therefore, even during an outage condition, the organization may seamlessly communicate with its customers. In addition, the recovery rules may be reconfigured (via the configuration interface ) in real-time, to allow the organization to adapt to changing conditions. Furthermore, the configuration information  may include predefined and\/or sets of predefined recovery plans, each of which may be readily available for activation as needed. This may allow the organization to respond quickly to outage conditions to thereby reduce or even eliminate communications service interruptions.","As discussed above, a recovery rule may specify that one or more communication requests be redirected to alternative addresses within the PCN . The soft switch  may be configured to redirect communication requests in a number of different locations\/devices within the PCN  including, but not limited to: an alternative provider, such as a provider , , , or the like, a landline, a mobile phone, an IP phone, a hand-held satellite phone, a radio system, a voicemail system, a phone tree, an IP address, a network server (e.g., email server), a directory service, or the like. The redirection may be performed using any other data routing mechanism and\/or technique available within the PCN  (e.g., available via the local carrier , long-distance carrier , SMS\/800 provider , VoIP provider , IP routing provider , DNS provider , or the like).","As discussed above, the configuration information  may also define other communication interfaces (phone trees, directories, and the like) to allow the recovery network  to emulate the operation of the organization's communication system. For example, the organization may include a phone tree, dial-by-name directory, dial-by-extension directory, one or more automated attendants, music while on hold, and the like. The recovery network  may be configured provide these services in a way that emulates the operation of the organization's communication system. For example, the recovery network  may include a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) interface, a text-to-speech interface, or other interface by which various services may be made available (e.g., a dial-by-directory service, an automated attendant, and other services). The organization may provide configuration information  (e.g., via the configuration interface ), which may configure the recovery network  to emulate the operation of the organization's services (e.g., provide the same dial-by-name directory, extension directory, music on hold, and so on). Recovery rules may be defined to process user selections within the various dial-by-name, phone tree, and\/or automated calling system interfaces. In addition, the configuration information  may include voice recordings and other messages provided by the organization to allow the recovery network  to closely emulate organization's communication system (e.g., provide callers with same voice prompts used by the organization, the same music, and so on).","The configuration data  of the organization may specify that particular communication requests be serviced by one or more alternative communication paths -. As shown in , in some embodiments, the recovery network  may include and\/or be communicatively coupled to a plurality of different alternative communication paths -. For instance, the recovery network  is coupled to a satellite network  (similar to the satellite network  shown and described in ), a radio transmission communication path , and a fiber optic communication path . The alternative communication path module  is configured to interact with each of the alternative communication paths - to allow the soft switch  to redirect and\/or service communications using one or more of the paths - as required. In alternative embodiments, such as system  of , the recovery network  may include a single alternative communication path (e.g., satellite network ), or other alternative communication paths, in addition to those depicted in . One or more of the alternative communication paths - may be dedicated to servicing a particular organization. Alternatively, or in addition, other alternative communication paths - may be shared between a set of organizations and\/or all of the organizations serviced by the recovery network .","For example, during a PCN  outage, the configuration information  of the organization may specify that certain communications (e.g., calls to particular telephone numbers, network traffic directed to particular addresses, etc.) be serviced using the satellite network  when the PCN  is not available.","Referring back to , the organization  may have installed a satellite interface  adapted to receive and\/or transmit communication requests over a satellite network . The satellite interface  may couple the organization's communication system  to the satellite network using a gateway (e.g., gateway ). The gateway  may perform various data routing and conversion tasks. For instance, the gateway  may decompress, decrypt, and\/or format communication data (e.g., voice, IP, and the like) for use by the organization's communication system (e.g., PBX ). Similarly, the gateway  may identify and process IP traffic for use by the computing devices , which may include a web server, email server, personal computing devices, and the like. Therefore, the satellite network  may allow the recovery network  to seamlessly provide communications services to the organization  using the organization's  existing communication system .","The alternative path interface  may include similar components. For example, the alternative path interface may include a gateway\/multiplexer (not shown) to perform data conversions so that incoming communication requests in a first format (e.g., TDM) may be transmitted in a second format (e.g., SIP) over the satellite network  and then converted back into the first or another format for use by the organization's communication system . In addition, gateway and\/or other hardware components (e.g., a VoIP gateway (not shown)) may compress\/decompress communications data as required to traverse the satellite network  or alternative communications paths. Direct VoIP (e.g., SIP and\/or H.323) communication requests may be sent and received directly by a properly configured communication system  of the organization (e.g., PBX ). If the organization's communication system  is unable to process direct VoIP, the organization may include a VoIP client to process the communication requests.","In addition, one or more computing devices (not shown) may be provided for converting between VoIP (e.g., SIP) and TDM (e.g., PRI\/ISDN) formatted communications. For instance, communication data in PRI\/ISDN format may be converted to SIP for processing by the recovery network  (e.g., by the soft switch  and the like) and into PRI\/ISDN for use by\/within the PCN .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["251","251","112","240","246","220","251","253","250","253"]},"The soft switch  may provide redundant communications services for an organization. As discussed above, an organization may provide various different interfaces by which external entities (callers) may interact with the organization. For example, the organization may provide a phone tree, dial-by-name directory, dial-by-extension directory, one or more automated attendants, call distribution queues, hold music, fax services, and the like. The recovery network  may provide an equivalent set of services for the organization via the soft switch . The configuration data  of the organization may configure the soft switch  to emulate the operation of the organization's services (e.g., provide an equivalent dial-by-name directory, provide the same set of prompts and\/or information in a phone tree, and so on). As will be discussed below, one or more recovery rules of the organization (stored in the configuration data ) may specify that particular types of communication requests (e.g., calls to particular numbers) be handled using one or more of the services provided by the soft switch  (e.g., may specify that all calls received on a particular number be serviced by the soft switch , which may be configured to provide the caller with a dial-by-name directory service configured to emulate the organization's directory, and so on).","The recovery network  may further include a backup module , which may include and\/or be communicatively coupled to a data storage media (e.g., data storage media ), and the PCN interface . When active, the backup module  may store (e.g., backup) communication requests (e.g., calls and faxes) directed to the organization. As discussed above, one or more recovery rules of an organization may route certain types of communication requests directly to backup and\/or attempt multiple alternative communication paths before handling by the backup module . Backed-up communication requests may be converted into a data\/text format for later delivery. In addition, the backup module  may be used to backup communication requests directed to an organization until one or more alternative communication paths - become available.","For example, in certain outage conditions, an organization may be cut off from the alternative communication paths - and\/or alternative addresses within the PCN  for some time (e.g., while a connection is being established\/negotiated, while the alternative addresses (satellite phones) are initialized, and so on). While alternative communication paths are intermittently or completely unavailable, communication requests directed to the organization may be handled directly by the backup module , or by first attempting multiple alternative communication paths (according to the recovery rules) before handling by the backup module , which may backup communication data for delivery to the organization at a later time. Therefore, the backup module  may include means for receiving and storing communication data including, but not limited to: a data storage media, a voice call recording system, a voicemail system (e.g., to receive voice communications), a phone tree, an automated call receiving system, a fax receiver, an email server, an IP proxy, an IP cache, or the like.","As the organization's alternative communication paths - and\/or alternative addresses within the PCN  are available, the communication data may be delivered thereto. In some embodiments the backup module  may be configured to automatically transmit backed up communications data to the organization when alternative communication means become available (e.g., push the backed-up data to the organization). Alternatively, or in addition, the recovery network  may issue an alert to the organization indicating that backed up communication data is available. The organization may access the backed-up data as it desires (e.g., pull backed-up data from the recovery network ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","400","400"]},"At step , the method may receive configuration information from an organization (e.g., from personnel of the organization). The configuration information may be received via a configuration interface, such as the configuration interface  discussed above. The configuration interface may be accessible via the PCN as a phone tree, a website, a human assistant, or other interface. Alternatively, or in addition, the configuration interface may be accessible via one or more alternative communication paths of the recovery network (e.g., a satellite network, a radio network, or the like).","The configuration information received at step  may include one or more recovery rules to specify how particular types of communication data are to be processed when recovery services are activated. For example, the recovery rules may specify that voice calls received on a particular set of access numbers (e.g., phone numbers) be routed to other phone numbers within the PCN. Alternatively, or in addition, the configuration information may specify that calls to specified access numbers should be routed directly to the organization using a selected alternative communication path (e.g., a satellite network).","As discussed above, the configuration information (and recovery rules) may include one or more predefined recovery plans, each of which may be created, modified, and\/or activated in real-time. Accordingly, changes to the configuration information may modify the behavior of the method  as they are applied and\/or activated. Therefore, although  shows receiving configuration information as a single step , the method  may receive configuration information at any time throughout the operation of the method . This real-time modification may allow an organization to respond quickly to various outage and\/or emergency conditions to thereby reduce or eliminate disruptions to the organization's communication systems.","Although method  discusses real-time changes to configuration information, other embodiments in which changes are not applied until approved (e.g., by administrators of the method , other personnel authorized by the organization, or the like) could be used under the teachings of this disclosure.","At step , the method  may await a signal to provide recovery services for an organization. The activation signal may be received via an update to the configuration information of the organization and\/or may be received via another source, such as an alternative communication path, an alarm, a call to the method , manual entry, or the like. Alternatively, or in addition, step  may further comprise monitoring the status of the organization's connection to the PCN. The monitoring of step  may include, but is not limited to: periodically pinging the organization to determine whether the communication systems of the organization are operating properly (e.g., dialing into one or more phone numbers of the organization, transmitting IP traffic to the organization, and so on); receiving periodic pings from the organization (e.g., receiving incoming calls, IP traffic, and the like from within the organization); directly monitoring the organization's communication equipment (e.g., via an IP connection, a secure IP connection, a VPN, connection, or the like); or the like. Upon detecting an interruption in the organization's communication system, the method  may automatically activate recovery services. Similarly, the method  may monitor emergency services within the area of the organization. If particular emergency services are activated (e.g., power recovery, fire, alarm, etc.), the method  may be configured to activate one or more portions of the recovery services for the organization (e.g., activate hotline forwarding, a redundant alternative communication path, or the like). In embodiments where the organization's configuration information includes a plurality of different recovery plans, the activation signal of step  may specify a particular recovery plan to activate.","In other embodiments, the method  may not require an activation signal. For example, the recovery services provided via the method  may be \u201calways on\u201d and available to processing communication requests routed from the PCN. Therefore, the \u201cactivation\u201d of the method  may consist in configuring the PCN to automatically divert communication requests to the method  (as discussed below at step ) upon the detection of a fault condition or by manual diversion using various mechanisms available within the PCN.","At step , recovery services may be activated. The activation of step  may include configuring the PCN to redirect\/forward communication requests directed to the organization to the recovery network (method ). The addresses to redirect\/forward (phone, fax, IP, etc.) as well as respective destination locations (within the recovery network or PCN) may be specified in the configuration information. As discussed above, the redirection of step  may be performed using various different mechanisms. The activation of step  may include the activation examples discussed above in conjunction with . These mechanisms may include, but are not limited to:","carrier forwarding by one or more local carriers and\/or VoIP providers (local\/toll telephone-based communication) within the PCN;","porting one or more phone numbers of the organization to an alternative LRN (e.g., a CO) using a standard number port operation (e.g . . . , via a LNP operation), to configure the PCN (e.g., local carrier, long distance carrier, and so on) to forward\/divert communication requests to the method ;\n\nrerouting of communication requests to an alternative LRN by utilizing a secondary routing database within the PCN that sends and monitors communication requests to a portability service (e.g., the NPAC) to effect a routing change in an LNP database or the like within the PCN, which then forwards\/diverts communication requests to the recovery network;\n\nredirecting VoIP traffic intended for the organization into the method ;\n\nconfiguring one or more long distance carriers and\/or VoIP providers to divert communication requests to the method ;\n\nusing a third-party Responsible Organization (RespOrg) to configure the national SMS\/800 database to direct incoming toll-free communication requests to the method  (e.g., modify one or more carrier assignments within the SMS\/800 database to direct requests to a carrier that is configured to direct incoming calls\/faxes to the method );\n\ndirectly configuring the SMS\/800 database to direct toll-free communication requests to the method  (e.g., directly modify one or more carrier assignments within the SMS\/800 database to direct requests to a carrier that is configured to direct incoming calls\/faxes to the method );\n\nreceiving directly dialed communication requests on a local or toll-free line (e.g., the method  may publish one or more access numbers for the organization, which may be accessed via the PCN);\n\nrerouting IP communication by modifying host and\/or host table information in an IP routing database;\n\nrerouting IP communication at the Domain Name Service (DNS) level by configuring one or more DNS providers to direct IP traffic to the method ; and the like.\n","As discussed above, PCN configuration of step  may be performed manually (e.g., by one or more human operators) and\/or may be performed substantially autonomously using interfaces exposed by the PCN (e.g., using automated calling systems, APIs exposed by the PCN, or the like).","The activation of step  may further include monitoring communication requests directed to the organization within the PCN. As discussed above, the monitoring of step  may include, but is not limited to: monitoring the PCN for incoming calls and\/or faxes originating from a local phone carrier and\/or long distance carrier directed to the organization; monitoring the PCN for VoIP communication requests (e.g., requests transmitted by a SIP provider\/carrier); monitoring IP traffic on the PCN for network data directed to the organization (e.g., HTTP requests, email messages, instant messaging, voice data, and so on); and the like.","At step , a communication request may be detected and\/or forwarded to the method  from the PCN. Responsive to receiving the communication request, the method  may access a recovery rule associated with the communication request in the organization's configuration information. At step , an organization-specific address of the communication may be detected (e.g., using OCN\/RDNIS information, a diversion header (e.g., SIP diversion header), IP routing information, host name information, or the like).","Upon determining the organization and\/or organization-specific address of the request, the method  may process the communication request according to an active recovery rule associated with the request in the organization's configuration information, and\/or determine the appropriate recovery rule based upon one or more caller selections.

For example, if an organization has exceeded an alternative communication bandwidth cap, a communication request, which normally would be serviced using an alternative communication path, may be routed to a backup service. Similarly, if an organization has exceeded its backup storage limit, communication requests, which would normally be backed up, may be routed to an automated processing system (e.g., a pre-recorded message).","If at step , it is determined that the communication request is to be redirected to an alternative address within the PCN, the flow may continue at step . If it is determined that the communication request is to be backed up, the flow may continue at step . If it is determined that the communication request is to be transmitted to the organization using an alternative communication path, the flow may continue at step ; otherwise, if is determined that the communication request should not be processed, the flow may continue at step .","At step , the communication request may be redirected to another address within the PCN, as indicated by the recovery rule associated therewith. The communication request may be routed to any address\/device coupled to the PCN including, but not limited to: a landline phone, a mobile phone, an IP based phone, a satellite phone, a voicemail system, a phone tree, an automated phone system, a fax machine, a call center, or the like. After redirecting the communication request, the flow may continue at step .","At step , the communication request may be directed to a backup service (e.g., such as the backup module  of ). The backup of step  may include receiving and\/or converting the communication request into a format capable of being stored in a data storage media and subsequently delivered to the organization via an alternate communications path, such as email. For example, a voice call may be converted into an audio message, received by a voicemail system, directed to an automated calling system for backup, or the like. A copy of the audio message may then be immediately sent to the organization via an alternate communications path, such as an email with the message attached. Fax data may be similarly received, stored, and optionally delivered over an alternate path. IP data, such as email message, instant message, and the like, may be backed up using an IP proxy, caching device, or the like.","Alternatively, or in addition, the backup of step  may include playing back a recorded message (or other data). The playback of step  may not allow a caller to leave a message for the organization. Therefore, the playback mechanism may be used where a storage limit for the organization has been reached. The playback message may be provided by the organization and\/or may include information provided by the method . Following the backup of step , the flow may continue to step .","At step , an alternative communication path for the communication request may be determined. In some embodiments, the organization's configuration information may specify one of more alternative communication paths supported by the organization (e.g., may indicate that the organization is coupled to the method  via a satellite network, a radio network, and so on). Alternatively, or in addition, the recovery rules associated with the communication may specify a particular alternative communication path to use to service some or all communication requests.","In some embodiments, the method  may monitor the status of one or more of the alternative communication paths. The status information may include a load level of the alternative communication path, a link status of particular organizations on the communication path, and the like. The path selection of step  may use the status information in dynamically selecting an appropriate alternative communication path (e.g., may select a path to which the organization is connected, has an acceptable load level, and the like), or step  may attempt communication via multiple alternative communication paths while callers wait in queue, or the like.","At step , the communication request may be serviced on the selected alternative communication path. As discussed above, the communication system of the organization may be communicatively coupled to the alternative communication path, such that the communication request may be serviced seamlessly over the alternative path (e.g., communications may be received and handled at the organization as if the communication request were being serviced by the PCN). In addition, the method  may include and\/or be communicatively coupled to integration components (e.g., the alternative path interface  or  and\/or the satellite interface  and gateway  of ) that allow the method  to seamlessly transmit PCN data over the alternative communication path. After establishing the connection and\/or servicing the request using the identified alternative communication path, the flow may continue at step .","Although not shown in , the processing determined at step  may additionally include converting the communication request from a first format into a second format (e.g., as discussed above in conjunction with rule  of ). For example, voice call data may be converted into an audio file for backup at step , for transmission within the PCN as an email message at step , or the like. Similarly, communications may be converted for transmission on an alternative network, such as an EMS radio dispatch network, or the like. Various examples of recovery rules specifying various conversions and\/or processing directives are provided above in conjunction with  (e.g., recovery rules  and  of ).","At step , the method  may determine whether recovery services (e.g., the method ) should continue. The determining of step  may include inspecting the configuration data of the organization to determine whether recovery services have been deactivated, whether a deactivation signal has been received, whether the configuration data has been changed, and so on. If recovery services are to continue, the flow may return to step , where a next communication request may be processed; otherwise, the flow may continue at step . At step , the method  may reconfigure the PCN to route communication requests directly to the organization (e.g., undo portions of the PCN configuration applied at step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500"]},"At steps -, the method  may be initialized, receive configuration information from the organization, receive an activation signal, and configure a PCN to divert\/forward communications to the method , as described above.","At step , a communication request may be received and a recovery rule (processing directive) associated therewith may be identified as described above. The processing of the communication request may be determined by accessing a recovery rule of the organization. As discussed above, a communication request may be processed in a number of different ways including, but not limited to: rerouting the communication request to a specified address within the PCN (step ), backing up the communication request (step ), servicing the communication request using an alternative communication path (step ), allowing the PCN to route the communication request, and so on.","At step , the method  may determine whether the processing determined for the communication request is available. The determining of step  may depend upon the nature of the processing identified at step . For example, if alternative routing within the PCN is to be performed (e.g., at step ), the determining at step  may include determining whether the alternative address is available (e.g., whether a forwarding phone number to which the request would be routed is active), whether the method  is capable of reaching the specified address through the PCN, or the like. If the communication request is to be serviced using an alternative communication path, the determining may include determining whether one or more acceptable alternative communication paths are available (e.g., whether the organization is currently linked to the method  using one or more of the alternative communication paths). In addition, the determining may include evaluating one or more service limits (e.g., bandwidth caps, storage thresholds, etc.) of the organization. If the requested processing type is available, the flow may continue as specified at step  (e.g., to the reroute step of , the alternative communication path of step , and so on). If the requested processing type is not available, the flow may continue at step .","At step , the communication request may be backed up. As discussed above, backing up a communication request may include receiving and\/or converting the communication request from a first format into a second, storage format (e.g., convert a voice call into an audio file, a text document, or the like). The backed up communication request may be made available to the organization upon establishing an acceptable alternative communication path and\/or reestablishing service with the PCN. Alternatively, or in addition, the backup of step  may include prompting a caller to provide a callback number. The callback number may be automatically called by the method  (e.g., by the recovery network  and\/or  discussed above) when the communications services are restored, and the caller may be connected live to the organization via a concurrent or sequential call to the organization via any available communications path (e.g., the satellite network, PCN, etc.).","Following the backup of step  (or the processing at step , ), the flow continues at step .

The recovery rules may each specify how the communication request is to be processed and may include different, relative priorities. High priority recovery rules may be implemented before low priority rules (e.g., a lower priority recovery rule may only be implemented if the communication request cannot be successfully serviced using higher priority recovery rules).","At step , one of the plurality of recovery rules may be selected. The selection may be based upon the relative priority of the recovery rules. (A rule having a higher priority may be selected before a rule having a lower priority.)
