No. 09\/108,999, filed on Jul. 1, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,233,592, which is a continuation of International Application No. PCT\/AU1998\/000050, filed Jan. 30, 1998, which designated the United States and was published in English, and which claimed priority to Australian Application No. P04892, filed on Jan. 31, 1997. These applications are incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to an electronic publishing system, and in particular to an electronic publishing system for the delivery of information which is not limited as to storage space and is not governed by predetermined pathways.","The present invention relates generally to an electronic publishing system and, in particular, to aids for navigating in an electronic publishing system and a method of organising data in an electronic publishing system.","Conventionally, information is published in document form as a printed publication, or in electronic form but again using the document or book metaphor. In the past, the concept of a \u201cmultidimensional space\u201d in electronic publishing has been intuitively understood (that is, instinctively desired). However, a comprehensive display, discussion or treatment has been rejected by publishers and information providers as too difficult to develop and manage. Instead, publishers and information providers have managed large amounts of data:","(1) by limiting the size or coverage of the information space; and","(2) by setting or predetermining the path through that information space.","The effect of this is clearest when the dimension of time is considered. The conventional approach to information storage and publishing is centred on the notion that information is either \u201ccurrent information\u201d (ie, present day) or \u201chistorical information\u201d (ie, the day before the present day and all days prior to that). Thus, information is traditionally retained (stored) and\/or published (sold) as either current or historical information.","The effect of this has been to leave the end user with a collection of non-integrated repositories and many additional tasks to do before the information is useful to them. For example, the end user is required to:","(1) make most of their own connections between related pieces of information;","(2) do their own analysis of the type and subject of information they require or are seeking; and","(3) find information appropriate to the point in, or period of, time with which they are concerned.","To illustrate the disadvantages of conventional publishing systems, an example of using such conventional techniques and publishing systems to research information is provided. If a person were interested in information regarding the powers of the Secretary under Australian legislation with respect to couples in a family relationship, when and how the Secretary is restricted, and what did the relevant legislation provide prior to that, the person would refer to relevant legal information, which is the Social Security legislation of the Commonwealth of Australia. The relevant provisions are set forth in Appendix A under the heading \u201cExample Research\u201d. This would be determined by the end user's own knowledge of the broad subject and\/or reference to secondary material.","The relevant legislative provision is Section 4, which in conventional electronic legal publishing systems might be found by looking for words or phrases such as \u201cfamily\u201d, \u201cfamily relationships\u201d, and \u201cfamily relationships\u201d AND \u201csocial security\u201d, where AND is a logical operator.","Once the above is established, it can be seen from the information found that Section 4 of the Social Security Act, as at Sep. 8, 1996, has been amended ten times (see Appendix A: A1. AMENDMENTS TO SECTION AT Sep. 08, 1996).","There is however nothing in the current Commonwealth Government Reprint, in either the electronic or print versions (see heading EXAMPLE RESEARCH of Appendix A), that allows the end user to see the text of those amendments or what part(s) of Section 4 were changed by them.","Thus, unless the end user is prepared to refer to many statute books, reading each piece of text against another, the end user is not able to see easily or reliably what section 4 looked like before it was amended by any one of a number of prior amending Acts. However, if the end user has a library complete enough to provide access to the prior amending Acts, the person would eventually determine that Act No 105 of 1995 is the relevant amending Act.","Further, it should be noted that, while the Commonwealth Government Reprint indicates that the Social Security Act was amended by Act No 105 of 1995, it does not indicate what section or schedule in Act No 105 of 1995 actually amended Section 4. This again requires the end user to have access to the amending Acts themselves and renders the information provided by the Reprint as to commencement (see Appendix A: B. COMMENCEMENT INFORMATION FOR ACT NO 105 OF 1995 CONTAINED IN REPRINT) of little utility without a copy of the amending Act No 105 of 1995 from which it can be established that Section 14 of Act No 105 amended Section 4 of the Social Security Act with respect to powers of the Commissioner (see Appendix A: D. AMENDING ACT 1995 NO 105 AMENDING SECTION 14).","Eventually, the required information can be found but several pieces of information need to be searched by the end user. This is an arduous, time consuming, tedious and complex task that must be manually repeated for each research topic and if the same search is to be carried out again.","Conventional publishing systems, including electronic publishing systems that typically are speeded-up, paper-based publishing systems, are based on a book-metaphor. The smallest piece of information used by such conventional publishing systems is either (I) an Act or Regulation (in the case of reprints, a whole Act or Regulation is printed again), or (II) a word. Typically, conventional publishing systems choose a word as the smallest piece when legislation is amended. To track such amendments, a lawyer or their assistant may actually use scissors to cut and paste pieces of legislation or the publisher cuts and pastes each word electronically. If a whole Act or Regulation is tracked as in (I) above, it is necessary to store each new version of an Act or Regulation in its entirety.","This has a number of consequences, including:","a) only a few versions of each Act or Regulation are stored;","b) the end user rarely searches more than one reprint at a time;","c) it is very difficult to know which particular section or schedule has changed, to track how that particular section or schedule has changed, to find the relevant section of the Amending Act or Regulation that effected the section or schedule as shown in the reprint;","d) if multiple changes have occurred on a particular section or schedule between reprints, the latest version of the section or schedule can only be seen in the reprint;","e) issues like commencement of the latest version of a particular section or schedule and so-called \u201cApplication, Saving or Transitional Provisions\u201d are difficult to recreate; and","f) it is difficult to come to a full understanding of the legislation by means of the reprints.","If every single word is tracked, as in (II) above, a level of complexity results that is difficult to administer and maintain without a large number of errors. For example, some legislative sections and schedules are amended several times annually.","Table 1 provides an example where Section 6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been amended 70 times:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["S. 6","am.

Trying to track all changes on such a detailed level leads to unmanageable complexity.","Largely, the split between historical and present information has come about because of the publishing and information industry's own development, and not because such is the desired or best way to manage information. Thus, a need clearly exists for an electronic publishing system that can overcome one or more of the disadvantages of conventional techniques and systems.","International Publication No. WO 98\/34179 (PCT\/AU98\/00050), corresponding to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/108,999, is incorporated herein by cross reference and discloses an electronic publishing system that provides a sparse multidimensional matrix of data using a set of flat file records. In particular, the computer-implemented system publishes an electronic publication using text-based data. Predefined portions of the text-based data are stored and used for the publication. At least one of the predefined portions is modified, and the modified version is stored as well. The predefined portion is typically a block of text, greater in size than a single word, but less than an entire document. Thus, for example, in the case of legislation, the predefined portion may be a section of the Act. Each predefined portion and the modified portion(s) are marked up with one or more links using a markup language, preferably SGML or XML. The system also has attributes, each being a point on an axis of a multidimensional space for organising the predefined portions and the modified portion(s) of the text-based data. This system is simply referred to as the Multi Access Layer Technology or \u201cMALT\u201d system hereinafter.","Existing methods of navigating electronic publications have been derived from traditional methods used to navigate printed publications. Typical of these methods is the use of a bookmark, which is merely an indicator which identifies a page or section of interest. Bookmarks are typically limited in the information provided to users. Bookmarks follow a single axis, perhaps indicating the current page, chapter and title of the publication. However, bookmarks do not necessarily provide the user with adequate context pertaining to how the user arrived at the current page. If a user knows the exact publication desired and then navigates through the same publication, a bookmark is probably adequate for the user's needs. In the event that the user has conducted a number of searches and trawled through various versions of different documents to arrive at the current page of a publication, it is impossible for a bookmark to capture all the relevant information and provide the user with an adequate reading context. The book metaphor fails to address the abilities and complexities of electronic publications.","Existing methods of navigating compact disc based publications and Internet sites are typically ill-suited to displaying the complex data provided by MALT. Known web solutions, for example, typically handle two axes, sequential and hierarchical, using either embedded links such as Previous, Next and Contents, or expandable content frames, as provided in Windows Explorer. Further axes may be handled by incorporating embedded links in the body of the text. Such embedded links are point to point, and provide limited navigational value to the user.","Object databases are capable of providing the required functionality, but search queries employed by these databases are too complicated for untrained users, both in terms of the complexity and amount of information required.","Thus, a need clearly exists for a detailed context to be provided to users of electronic publishing, overcoming one or more disadvantages of existing systems.","In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a system for publishing electronic information, comprising:","a plurality of predefined portions of data with each predefined portion being encoded with at least one linking means, and, for each predefined portion, the each predefined portion is stored and, where such predefined portion has been modified, each such modified predefined portion is stored; and","a plurality of attributes, each attribute being a point on an axis of a multidimensional space for organising the data.","In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a recording medium for publishing electronic information, comprising:","a plurality of predefined portions of data with each predefined portion being encoded with at least one linking means, and, for each predefirmed portion, the each predefined portion is stored and, where such predefined portion has been modified, each such modified predefined portion is stored; and","a plurality of attributes, each attribute being a point on an axis of a multidimensional space for organising the data.","In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for publishing electronic information, comprising:","providing a plurality of predefined portions of data with each predefined portion being encoded with at least one linking means, and, for each predefined portion, the each predefined portion is stored and, where such predefined portion has been modified, each such modified predefined portion is stored; and","providing a plurality of attributes, each attribute being a point on an axis of a multidimensional space for organising the data.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of navigating in a multidimensional space having three or more dimensions. The method includes the steps of:","displaying in a first display region a selected predefined portion of an electronic publication formed from predefined portions of text-based data encoded using a markup language, each predefined portion having at least one attribute being a coordinate of an axis of the multidimensional space, wherein logical connections among the predefined portions, and any logical connections between the predefined portions and predefined portions of any further electronic publication data in the multidimensional space, correspond to one or more axes of the multidimensional space;","displaying a point on a primary axis of the multidimensional space dependent upon an attribute of the displayed predefined portion;","displaying a second point on a second, viewing axis orthogonal to the first axis, the second point being derived from the first point dependent upon a logical connection between the displayed predefined portion and a predefined portion associated with the second point; and","displaying information regarding the second point of the second axis in a second display region, the first and second points being displayed in two display regions.","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of navigating in a multidimensional space having three or more dimensions, the multidimensional space containing an electronic publication formed from predefined portions of text-based data encoded using a markup language. The method includes the steps of:","providing a view comprising at least two anchor sets;","displaying at least one base point and at least a first axis depending from the base point;","displaying at least one of a further point and an axis derived from the base point;","navigating a multidimensional space formed by the points and axes;","returning to the base point when required; and","adjusting the view so a current view point becomes a new base point.","According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for navigating in a multidimensional space having three or more dimensions.

The present invention reduces, if not eliminates, end user problems with conventional information publishing including:\n\n","The embodiments of the invention provide an entirely new way of delivering, storing and publishing information. The embodiments allow publishers to add an arbitrary number of logical connections to a set of data, and even permit the publisher to display the precise evolution of that data set over time. This can be done without getting bogged down in the complexity of the logical connections and without limit as to storage space.","Frequently, people desire to have more \u201cinformation\u201d available. However, with the advent of the Internet and new technology, many people suffer from information overload. The embodiments of the invention provide an easy and effective way to navigate large complex volumes of information.","Conventionally, information may only contain very rudimentary (i.e., haphazard hyperlinks) or non existent logical connections. Thus, conventional techniques of investigating how a set of data has evolved and changed over time can only be done for small data sets and are very expensive.","However, with the embodiments of the invention, it is possible to list all logical connections within a data set no matter how complex those connections may be. The embodiments of the invention and the principles of those embodiments described hereinafter can be applied to many different types of information such as medical, scientific, pharmaceutical, etc. For ease of description, however, the embodiments are set forth in relation to legal information.","Conventionally, legislation is often purchased in two ways: (1) The individual Numbered Acts and Regulations that give each piece of legislation as it is passed; and (2) Consolidated legislation that provides the latest consolidated version.","In the embodiments of the invention, legislation is stored using every version of each Act or Regulation. The end user can search every version of any section, schedule, or provision. For example, the required version of a section is immediately available as is the opportunity to view every preceeding and subsequent version of the same section. Also, links are available to any relevant amending legislation commencing that change, as well as the one that repealed it. Relevant Application, Saving or Transitional Provisions can also be easily accessed.","In this manner, it is possible to come to a full understanding of the legislation just by looking at the data provided through the embodiments of the invention. In contrast, using conventional techniques, it would have been impossible or very hard, expensive and time consuming to do so.","Using conventional means, a person wishing to view a particular section of a particular Act (e.g., the Income Tax Assessment Act) as of a particular date (e.g., 30th Jun. 1996), a significant amount of work would be required to do so. The end user would need to track all Amendments since the last reprint of the legislation, which may take a long time and involve referring to many volumes. This may even possibly involve using scissors and paste to actually cut and replace words. Even to figure out which Acts amended a particular section and to trace those commencement dates can be difficult, time consuming and trying. However, a piece of research that may have taken an experienced researcher days or even weeks can be accomplished in minutes using the embodiments of the invention.","The ability to move through information in time is outlined above. The embodiments of the invention also give additional flexibility and SCOPE to the end user. Further dimensions and interconnections may include: type, jurisdiction, subject, depth.","Some examples are:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["1 Doing research on the subject evidence at depth confession for types Acts and Case for time period 12 months.","2. Doing research on type cases within jurisdictions NSW and Queensland subject murder and depth statutes dealing with subject."]}}}},"The ability to associate the relevance and interconnection contained within the information is highly advantageous to the end user.","A key aspect of the embodiments of the invention in successfully providing a multi-dimensional repository of information has been in deciding the \u201coptimum storage unit\u201d. In the past publishers have chosen to either store new versions of the entire Act (too big) or new versions of each and every change, in a method similar to red lining (too complex). The first aspect of the invention was to analysis the data and choose to store every version of every section or provision level of legislation.","Structured Generalised Markup Language (SGML) is a recognised way to mark up data. SGML allows logical structure to be added to a document (unlike HTML and word processors which only allow the addition of visual content). SGML alone is not enough to deal with text-based data that contains a highly complex logical structure. The complexity increases exponentially until the complexity cannot be managed any more. Large legal publishers have stored their data in SGML, but those legal publishers that are successful in dealing with their SGML-based data have purposely kept their markup as simple as possible. When such publishers have tried to encode a complex structure on text-based data their costs of creating the data set and maintaining the data set simply went through the roof, and it became impossible to maintain the integrity of the data set.","In contrast, the embodiments of the invention allow SGML data to be encoded with a much more complex structure whilst remaining manageable. Alternatively, Extensible Markup Language (XML) may be used. For example, with SGML it is possible to encode all 71 versions of Section 6 of the Australian Federal Income Tax Assessment Act in a single file (that Act has about 6,000 sections) but this would be utterly unmanageable when applied to the 6,000 other sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It becomes even more unmanageable if anybody would try to use the above method on all the sections within all other Acts and Regulations of the Commonwealth. A significant problem with using SGML, even well executed SGML, is that it is possible to quickly get bogged down in unmanageable levels of complexity. The embodiments of the invention have overcome these problems.","Another key aspect of the invention is the use of database technologies in the management of the SGML encoded techniques. Database technology provides a large number of ready tools to deal with complex structured data. The embodiments combine these technologies (SGML, XML and database technologies) in an advantageous manner.","In the past, traditional publishers have been limited by the size and speed of available storage systems. Only a limited amount can be reproduced in paper and until recently hard disk costs prohibited the storing of multiple gigabytes of data, for both publishers and clients alike.","The embodiments of the invention have the ability to look at situations from a new and up-to-date view point and therefore come up with innovative conclusions that can be radically different to processes employed in the past.","Thus, the embodiments of the invention provide a new computer publishing system that changes the availability of electronic information from being merely \u201cspeeded up paper\u201d to being electronic information taking advantage of new electronic media by providing users with enhanced functionality of data retrieval and manipulation. The information included in the electronic format is of a publishable standard, meets cost constraints and is able to be accessed under any combination of dimensions from the multi-dimensional space (Acts, cases, time, jurisdiction, subject). The publishing system facilitates-continual updates to the data contained in the databases, without any adverse effects on the operating capabilities that make the publishing system unique. Due to the extra functionality, the publishing system is also designed in such a way that it can still be made available in as many different electronic media as possible, and all search functions are able to operate in a time-efficient manner.","The embodiments of the invention organize, process and present information in a way that is significantly different than conventional structures, processes and presentation. They provide an information storage and publishing system, and in particular, an information storage and publishing system that stores and manages large and comprehensive amounts of information (eg, legal information).","Publication data, being preferably legal information, is encoded using Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) or Extensible Markup Language (XML) which adds codes to the publication data and provides functionality to the data. The publication data is processed as a plurality of predefined portions, which in the case of legislation is preferably at the section, schedule level, or provision level. A hierarchy of divisions of the legislation may be implemented. For each of the predefined portions, the system stores a copy of the predefined portion and a modified predefined portion in the first database whenever it is changed. A second (relational) database is preferably provided that comprises plural attributes for managing the information of the first database, with each attribute being a point on an axis of a multidimensional space for organising the data for publication. Alternatively, a single repository of information may be practised as described with reference to the second embodiment.","The system enables the first database to be searched for one of the predefined portions of the publication data using attributes of the second database by following one or more pathways through the multidimensional space. The plurality of attributes are connected to by the plurality of links. Once the desired predefined portion is located, the predefined portions can be retrieved using the attributes to define a point in the multidimensional space.","Preferably, the system implements, inter alia, time-based legislation in which sections of legislation that have been amended are not discarded and replaced with the current provision only as of the publication date. Instead, each version of an amended section is retained in the first database. Thus, the systems according to the embodiments of the invention are particularly advantageous in that legal information is published so that a user can obtain such sections or provisions at a particular time point.","The embodiments advantageously divide information into \u201csuitably\u201d small pieces (or blocks) of text, each of which is a predefined portion of data, and add to each piece of text, either expressly or implicitly, a number of attributes (characteristics or descriptors). The suitability as to size of text pieces is determined by an analysis of the information and its naturally occurring structure based on knowledge of how the information is used and consumed by the end user.","This makes it possible to locate each piece or block of text at a particular point in a \u201cmultidimensional space\u201d using as coordinates the attributes added to the piece or block of text. Multidimensional space refers to an area not having boundaries and that is capable of, or involves, more than three dimensions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0143"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Referring to , the ability to locate (assign) or map each node  (or key intersection point of the various axes or pathways) is a significant functional aspect of the embodiments of the invention. This mapping is explained further hereinafter. With such coordinates 102 known (located or mapped), it is possible to move easily between points in the multidimensional space .","The effect of mapping nodes as shown in  is that a course  through the information represented in the three-dimensional space  can be easily plotted. The user begins the course  at node  and progresses vertically downward to the fourth node . Further, the plotted course  is flexible to the extent of the relationships a user chooses to follow or seek out.","A first embodiment of the invention provides information management in the multidimensional space and allows movement along different axes or \u201cpathways\u201d:","location of the information (its address);","type of information (its genesis);","jurisdiction (its class);","subject (its content description);","depth (extent of content); and","time (the point in time at which the information is viewed).","In the first embodiment, coding of information or data for publication is based on SGML or XML and one or more specifically developed Document Type Definitions (DTD), which preferably is specifically designed for legal information. Alternatively, in the case of XML, a Style Sheet Mechanism (SSM) may be used. This coding can then be related back to information retained in a specifically developed database that enables the code information to be managed and updated. For a detailed description of this aspect of the invention, reference is made to Appendix C. The DTDs according to the first embodiment are set forth in detail in Appendix B. A DTD is used to define the structure of publication data, preferably being legislation, down to a comprehensive level. This is done by using information coded in conjunction with any one of a number of off-the-shelf, free-text retrieval software packages (eg, Folio Views or Dynatext) to deliver the information to the end user.","A DTD describes the markup for the SGML publication data, or \u201crepository\u201d, which may contain legislation, case law, journal articles and other types of material that are stored in computer files. The files contain publication data in text form and the markup, which is extra information about the text included with the text. An example of a markup is \u2018<BD+>\u2019 which indicates that \u201cthe data from this point on is bold\u201d. A further example is","\u2018<SECTION ID=\u201cCWACT-19950104-SEC-1\u201d LBL=\u201c1\u201d>\u2019. This markup indicates that: the data from this point on is part of a section of legislation; the section has an identifier of CWACT-19950104-SEC-1; and the section has a label of \u201c1\u201d.","There are a number of different ways to add markup to data. The first embodiment adds markup to data using SGML. Alternatively, XML may be used. Still further, in the case of XML being used, an SSM may be used. Even within SGML, there are many ways to add markup to text. Each particular way of adding markup within SGML is described by using a DTD. In the first embodiment, the data for publication is marked up using a number of different DTDs. In particular, the DTDs are used to mark up the logical structure of the legislation, case law or journal articles. Significant amounts of information about the data for publication is stored in the markup. For example, the markup \u2018<SECTION ID=\u201cCWACT-19950104-SEC-1\u201d LBL=\u201c1\u201d>\u2019 provides the following information: the data is a piece of Commonwealth of Australia legislation (indicated by \u2018CW\u2019 at the beginning of the string); the section is part of an Act (\u2018ACT\u2019 after \u2018CW\u2019) and not a regulation; the act is Act No. 104 of 1995 (\u201819950104\u2019 in the middle of the string), the data is a Section (\u2018SEC\u2019) within the Act; and it is Section 1 (\u20181\u2019 at the end).","The preparation of such DTDs necessitates that the author has a sound knowledge of the data that will be marked up using the DTD. It is especially important that the underlying structure of the data to be marked up using the DTD be understood. The process of becoming acquainted with the structure of the data to be marked up is referred to hereinafter as \u201ccontent analysis\u201d.","In particular, the section-level or schedule-level portion of legislation is used in the first embodiment. That is, the section-level portion is preferably the predefined portion of the publication data, which is the smallest piece of information to be tracked. This is unlike conventional publishing systems. For example, with reference to Table 1, the first embodiment stores every version of Section 6. In this manner, complexity (tracking every word) is reduced by increasing storage. However, unlike example (I) of conventional publishing systems, the first embodiment does not lose any pertinent information:\n\n","A further advantage of tracking every version of each section or schedule is that it is possible to store some of the information, not in the markup, but in a database, as noted hereinbefore. This simplifier the updating process.","While SGML is a powerful way of storing information, it is not a retrieval medium. Therefore, the stored information needs to be converted into a format that the end user of the information can access. The first embodiment uses an electronic format for retrieval. For this electronic retrieval, a software application called \u2018high-end text retrieval software\u2019 is used. Examples of high-end, text-retrieval software applications include Folio Views and Dynatext. In the first embodiment, Folio Views is used.","Folio Views has its own proprietary markup language, which is not part of the SGML family. A complete guide to the Folio Views markup language is provided in the text Folio Views Infobase Production Kit Utilities Manual, Version 3.1, Provo, Utah: Folio Corporation (1 Jun. 1994). Storing the data for publication in SGML allows other retrieval software applications besides Folio Views to be used.","In the first embodiment, a process is implemented to convert the SGML marked-up data into the format used by the retrieval software application. The example given for Folio Views hereinafter is but one example of the process involved. The conversion program basically maps the SGML markup to Folio Views markup. For example, for the SGML markup \u2018<SECTION ID=\u201cCWACT-19950104-SEC-1\u201d LBL=\u201c1\u201d>\u2019, the conversion process marks all ID's substantively unchanged as Jump Destinations (JD's): \u2018<JD:=\u201cCWACT-19950104-SEC-1\u201d>\u2019.","A Keying Guide for Australian Legislation Documents with instructions for the conversion process to Folio Views added is provided in Appendix D.","Movement through legal information can be as follows (the flexibility and scope is largely up to the end user):\n\n","The application of legal information to mapped nodes is shown in . However, this is only one of numerous possible applications. Information from medical, technical and scientific areas are all open to the application of this invention. This diagram substitutes the technical terminology of  with legal terms to show the way information appears according to the first embodiment. Further,  provides an example of how legal information is navigated by an end user. The user may be seeking information on the following matters:\n\n","Some general assumptions are made about legal information for the purposes of this example. Broadly, legal information has two main primary sources: statute law (including subordinate legislation), and case law. There is also secondary information such as commentary which can be added to aid interpretation. Each of these sources is interconnected and relevant to the other in terms of both past and present information. This may also apply to future information in terms of bills or other forms of uncommenced legislation. It is the association of this relevance and interconnection that is advantageous to the end user.","In , the X-, Y-, and Z-axes indicate time (Time), the legislative provision (location), and type (eg, legislation=L, cases=C, and journal articles=J). To simplify the diagram, only three axes are illustrated, however, other axes may be included dependent upon the number of dimensions of the space. In the first embodiment, the multidimensional space also includes another three axes: jurisdiction=U, subject-V, and depth=W. Thus, the space according to the first embodiment has six dimensions. In the six-dimensional case, it is possible to move along each axis and at the points of intersection change direction, as well as find and\/or follow new or additional information.","The end user begins at legislation (L) along the Z-axis, where the Fences 10 and Boundaries Act is located and then selects Section 1 of legislation (indicated by L allowing the Z-axis) at node , as of 1 Jan. 1996. The user then follows a path in the legislation through nodes ,  and  for Sections 2, 3 and 4, respectively, as of that same date (ie, the Y-axis), to find a definition of the term \u201cfences\u201d. Node  contains Section 4 at 1 Jan. 1996 which contains the current definition of \u201cfences\u201d. This would provide information in response to above query (1).","The user then selects Section 4 of the legislation as of 1 Jan. 1995, which in this case is an earlier version of the section prior to amendment, by moving to node  (along the X-axis). This provides information about the prior law for above query (2). The user can then move to other information on Section 4 as of 1 Jan. 1995 by going to nodes  and  for case and journal article information, respectively, along the Z-axis. For example, a case on the earlier Section 4 might be identified at node  and articles on interpretation of Section 4 at node . The foregoing is only one possible route through the multidimensional space of information. Other more complicated and interrelated pathways involving axes U, V and W are possible. For example, the user can move to axis U (jurisdiction) and compare the definition in Section 4 of New South Wales with that in another jurisdiction (eg, Victoria).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0183"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["602","604","606","602","608","610","612","610","612","610","608","614","616","602","616"]},"A data management database  is provided to step .

It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the second embodiment may be readily implemented in view of the foregoing description of the first embodiment, which is not repeated here for the purpose of brevity, and in view of the accompanying DTD set out in Appendix E.","The foregoing only describes a small number of embodiments of the invention, and modifications and changes apparent to those skilled in the art can be made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, the embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to SGML. The embodiments may alternatively be practiced with the extensible markup language (XML) as well. Also, the embodiments may alternatively be practiced with a Style Sheet Mechanism (SSM) instead of, or in addition to, one or more DTDs.","A method, apparatus and computer program product for navigating in a multidimensional space containing an electronic publication formed from predefined portions of text-based data encoded using a markup language are disclosed. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this disclosure that changes may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In other instances, well known features have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention. Whilst the invention may be preferably practised on flat files, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the invention may also be practised on databases. A database may be constructed from sets of flat file records. A relational database is a collection of related tables, each table being a set of flat files having the same structure. The method includes the step of: displaying a selected one of the predefined portions in a first display region. The display region preferably takes the form of an area of real estate on a computer screen (henceforth referred to as the \u201ccontent frame\u201d). The method also includes the step of displaying a view into a primary axis of the multidimensional space in which the displayed preferred portion is clearly marked. This second area of the computer screen shall be referred to as the \u201creference frame\u201d. Each frame has an associated \u201canchor\u201d, which is a title bar clearly indicating the nature of the view currently displayed in the frame. The reference anchor also contains tools for navigating the displayed axis. The method also includes the step of displaying a point on a primary axis of the multidimensional space for the displayed predefined portion.","The method may be enhanced by displaying a second point on a second axis which relates to the first axis at the first point. The second axis represents time-based versions of the selected one of the predefined portions. Alternatively, the second axis represents amending legislation that was applied to the selected one of the predefined portions. In another example, the second axis represents case law that applied the selected one of the predefined portions. In further example, the second axis represents annotations to the selected one of the redefined portions. In a yet further example, the second axis represents entries of a subject index that are covered in the selected one of the predefined portions.","The embodiment of the present invention allows for a primary axis (the combined hierarchical\/sequential or normal axis). A \u201cbase node\u201d may be selected by navigating the primary axis. The method then allows for one of a number of potential axes (associated with the base node) to be selected and subsequently navigated. The selection is accomplished by means of activating \u201clinks\u201d in the displayed base node. The reference frame is redrawn to give a view of the members of the selected axis and one member of that axis is displayed. At any point it is possible to return to the primary axis and select a new base node. Alternatively, the currently displayed base node may be chosen as a new base node from which subsequent axes are derived. In this manner, any number of axes may be displayed and navigated without increasing the complexity of the screen view (i.e. only two frames are ever required). It is this quality which allows a complex dataset to be navigated by a non-specialist end user.","By way of example, a user may select a first node, corresponding to a provision, in the multidimensional space. The first node's locator is displayed in a first anchor to provide the user with a first point of reference. If the user is interested in different versions of the provision, the user may then move to second node on an orthogonal axis, being the Versions axis. The first anchor is updated and displays the locator of the second node. A second anchor displays the locator of the first node. The second anchor also displays the relationship between the first node and the second node. The user is provided with information which indicates the original provision that was being studied, the provision currently being studied and the current provision's relationship to the original provision. Thus, the first and second anchors and the information provided therein enable the user to navigate the multidimensional space.","Where reference is made in any one or more of the accompanying drawings to steps and\/or features, which have the same reference numerals, those steps and\/or features have for the purposes of this description the same function(s) or operation(s), unless the contrary intention appears.","The principles of the preferred method described herein have general applicability to electronic publishing. However, for ease of explanation, the steps of the preferred method are described with reference to navigating in a MALT publication. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to the described method. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a publication could include a document or a database. The invention may apply to any hierarchical XML data where any of the nodes may change independently of other nodes in the hierarchy. Typical examples might include manuals and newspapers. For example, the invention may have application to the production and display of aircraft manuals. In this case, each node would be a set of maintenance instructions for a part or assembly. The axes might be part number; category (electrical, structural, etc.); location (Boeing 737, wing, wingtip assembly, eddy baffle, securing flange AX-703); airline (United, QANTAS); language (English, French). Since each commercial aircraft is in effect a one-off construct, the basic information needs to be reconfigured for each plane, each airline, etc.","Before proceeding with a description of the embodiments, a brief review of terminology is discussed hereinafter. A dataset refers to the complete set of data that is to be navigated. A dataset has a complete set of discrete objects called nodes. The dataset may be viewed as a sparse multidimensional matrix, as is produced using the MALT publishing method. In the example of this specification, the dataset preferably refers to a body of legislation designed for point in time searching.","A node preferably corresponds to a particular legislative provision at a particular date. A base node is a particular node from which one or more viewing axes may be derived.","A viewing axis is an ordered set of nodes derived from a single base node. The base node itself may or may not constitute part of the axis. For example, given a particular provision in time, three possible viewing axes are: the set of all provisions in force on the same date as the base node; the set of versions of the base provision in time; and the set of amending provisions most recently applied to the base provision. Further viewing axes may be practised, and may include case law that applied the provision, annotations to the provision and entries of a subject index that are covered in the provision.","A provision, for the purposes of this system, is a unit of legislation having a heading and\/or content, but not including text belonging to any sub-provision that is a predefined portion of text. A provision may be an Act, a schedule, a chapter, a section or other legislative unit. A provision has a scope in time, such that when a provision is amended, a new provision is created. A provision corresponds to a set of nodes, each node corresponding to a range of dates in the scope of the provision.","Scope refers to a period of time during which a provision is in force. Thus, a given scope is usually expressed as start and end dates. A provision's scope is determined by the dates on which the provision commenced, was amended and\/or was repealed.","A locator is an identifier that is used to locate a particular node. For example, a locator may be a date, or a position such as the name of an Act and a section number.","Multi-axis Viewing Interface","Using the publication of legislation as an example, a provision is defined as being an amendable unit of legislation. At any given moment, the body of active legislation can be divided into provisions. Provisions also have a scope in time, so that when a provision is amended, the current provision goes out of scope and a new provision is created. The nodes of the dataset in this example are provisions with an associated date. Two locators are required to specify a particular node uniquely: a position (such as act and section number) and a date.","There are a number of viewing axes associated with each node. As indicated in the explanation of terminology above, a viewing axis is defined as an ordered set of nodes that can be derived from the current node. When XML data is converted to a series of flat files, viewing axes are derived from the current node as a result of an intersection between two flat files. Two flat files intersect if common entries are contained in the fields of the respective flat files. For example, a legislation flat file may contain a field \u201cidentifiers of cases that apply this provision\u201d. The legislation flat file shares a common entry with a case law flat file. Alternatively, the legislation flat file may contain a field \u201csubjects covered in the provision\u201d. In this example, the legislation flat file shares a common entry with a subject index flat file. Alternatively, an amending legislation flat file may have a field \u201cIdentifiers of provisions amended by this provision\u201d and share a common entry with the legislation flat file.","In a preferred example, seven such viewing axes are:\n\n","Having utilised MALT to construct a set of data encapsulating the above relationships, the problem is how to access this data in a meaningful way. To provide an untrained user with full multi-axis access to MALT type data whilst maintaining a consistent look and feel throughout, a view consisting of a two frame screen is provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0205","num":"0228"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"b":["1800","1810","1810","1989","1805","1810"]},"Situated above the content anchor  is a reference frame , which contains a set of links  corresponding to the members of a viewing axis associated with the current base node. Reference markers  indicate which of the links  is currently selected. In the Normal view, the content node shown in the content frame is always the same as the base node for the reference frame. In the Version view, the content node and base node are initially the same, but deviate when a different version is selected. In the Source view, the base node is being amended and the content node is one of the amending provisions.","The reference frame  has a corresponding reference anchor , which describes the current viewing axis and provides buttons ,  for navigating the sequential axis and button  for accessing higher levels of the hierarchy. These levels can also be accessed via the links  in the reference frame. In the example, the reference anchor  indicates that the user is being shown a normal view of s59, as in force on 20 Jul. 2000. This view also shows the search mode, in which the text \u201cexercise of jurisdiction\u201d has been located. The buttons ,  allow access to the next or previous occurrence of this text, whilst button  cancels the search. The \u201chits\u201d links  in the reference frame allow rapid access to occurrences of the search text in other parts of the document. In this respect, the search mode acts very much like a separate viewing axis. The highlighting  indicates the selected text. Finally, the links ,  allow access to the other viewing axes (in this case, Versions and Amendments).","Where appropriate, the reference anchor  may indicate the base node of the viewing axis. The base node is the node from which the viewing axis is derived. For example, the reference anchor  of , which shows a Source axis view of the same provision depicted in , displays the following information:","This indicates that the Source axis being viewed by the user is derived from the base provision: Corporations Act, s59 [16 Oct. 1995 onwards]. The content anchor  details the amending provision, which in this example is Corporations Legislation Amdt Act 1994 (Cth):Sch 1.","The relationship of the base node and the content node depends on the view. In the Normal axis view, consisting of the sequential and hierarchical axes, the base node and the content node are always the same. In the Versions axis view, the base node and the content node may or may not be the same.","A view is, therefore, defined as the display of a particular content node in relation to a specified axis. Each view may be uniquely identified from the following: the current content node, the current viewing axis, and the base node of the viewing axis. To further help the user in distinguishing the different viewing axes, the reference frame links may optionally vary in colour, content and indenting style among the views.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0212","num":"0235"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 18","FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"b":["1900","1905","1910","1810","1910","1910"]},"The reference frame  of  indicates that there are two versions of the provision, a first version with a scope of 1 Jan. 1994 to 15 Oct. 1995 and a second version with a scope of 16 Oct. 1995 to 31 Dec. 2001.

Anchors uniquely identify the content node by position and date, and the viewing axis by base node and axis type. Furthermore, the reference frame is capable of displaying multiple viewing axes for a given base node, as illustrated in .","Higher Level Scoping","The MALT concept encapsulates the ability to store the contents of a sparse multidimensional matrix in a set of flat file records. As previously defined, the scope of a provision is a time period during which the given provision is in force. A problem arises relating to scoping a record which encompasses a number of lower level records.","Consider as an example legislation marked up for point in time searching. The body of the legislation consists of provisions (or nodes), where each provision is an amendable unit of legislation. For the purposes of this example, each provision possesses the following four properties:\n\n","The scope of a terminal node is the period of time between the terminal node's start date and end date, inclusive. The root node is deemed to be always in scope. The scope of a node which is neither a terminal node nor a root node is problematic.","For example, a chapter may encompass many sections, but the chapter's actual content, viewed in isolation as a record, is simply the chapter's title, including locator if present, and any notes or other attachments that apply to the chapter as a whole. All other content is contained indirectly via the chapter's descendant provisions, such as parts, sections and the like.","Difficulty arises in determining the scope of the chapter node. In one sense, the scope of the chapter node is the sum of the scopes of the chapter node's descendants. A question then arises if, for example, the chapter's title is altered. The same applies to the case in which the abovementioned notes or other attachments are altered.","One solution is to create a duplicate chapter with the altered title. While effective, this method has some major drawbacks. Firstly, it involves a great deal of unnecessary duplication of material. Since each child provision can have only one parent; new copies of every sub-level have to be made. The scope of both the original and duplicate sublevels then have to be split at the date of the chapter's title change. This in turn requires each sub-level to behave as though amended, even though the amendment only applies to the title of an ancestor level.","A better solution is to create a new terminal sub-level of the chapter which contains just the title and associated text. This sub-level can then be scoped independently of the main level, and other sub-levels are unaffected. The sub-levels retain the same parent as the chapter level itself was not affected by the amendment.","However, this still leaves open the question of what to do with the scope of the chapter level. Clearly a chapter, like any other provision, can be created or repealed. Thus, an amendment such as \u201crepeal Chapter 2A\u201d should end the scope of the chapter level as well as all of the chapter's descendants.","The editors, however, may wish to leave a stub entry to mark the place of the former chapter thus:","The scope of the stub clearly lies outside the scope of the chapter. There are three possible solutions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0225","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0015","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0015-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0016","list-style":"none"},"li":["allow the [repealed] entry (which stands in place of a normal title) to live inside the chapter, even though the entry is out of the chapter's scope;","extend the scope of the chapter to encompass the scope of the stub; or","create a new chapter level containing just the stub.\n\nThe first option creates significant inefficiencies in the design, since the scope of a sub-level cannot be assumed to lie within the scope of the sub-level's parent. The other two options give rise to potential conflicts between the stub and possible replacement chapters.\n"]}}}},"Having delegated the title and other general notes to their own sublevels, all content has effectively been removed from the chapter. However, a chapter level is still required, as removing higher levels makes all terminal nodes direct children of the root. This in turn severely impacts on the usefulness of the data when mapped to a hierarchical form, such as XML.","In addition, a higher level does contain one property, namely one or more locators (\u201cChapter 2A\u201d in the example). While this property can theoretically be delegated to yet another sub-level, the practical implications are significant. In particular, the locator reflects the ordering of the chapter amongst its siblings. If, for example, an amendment renumbers chapter 2A to chapter 4, this gives rise to the issue of whether the chapter comes before or after chapter 3 in either a flat file or in XML. For this reason, the locator is the sole property preserved by a higher level node throughout the higher level node's scope. If the position is changed, then a new level (and sub-levels) is created.","This still leaves the problem of the scope of a higher level. For example, if Chapter 2A is repealed and a new, unrelated chapter 2A immediately takes the place of the repealed Chapter 2A, a problem is potentially presented as to two overlapping scopes for the same provision. The scope of the original node has to be terminated, otherwise there are two Chapter 2As in scope contemporaneously. The co-existence of two Chapter 2As poses a detrimental impact on the ability to navigate and search the legislation under consideration. In the situation in which the original Chapter 2A has a repeal stub, the original Chapter 2A's scope may overlap the new Chapter 2A, since the stub may continue indefinitely in time. Among many possibilities, a repeal stub may be provided while Chapter 2A does not exist.","Other problems include: repeal or substitution of a higher level node; renumbering\/relocation of a higher level node; renaming (without renumbering\/relocation) of a higher level node; elevation or demotion of a higher level node within the hierarchy, e.g. changing a part to a chapter or a division to a subdivision; and insertion\/removal of an intermediate level heading node, requiring that nodes which follow and are\/were, according to their type, inferior to that heading node become\/cease to be children of that node.","In order to resolve these problems, the following design rule is applied: Higher level nodes may have neither scope nor content. In other words, a non-terminal node must be a container only. A non-terminal node's only properties are a parent indicator, a position within the parent, and (optionally) a locator. Any content notionally belonging to such a node, such as a chapter title, is assigned to a new (terminal) child node. A (terminal) child node may contain a label, which is preferably a title, but can be or include other data related to the parent node. The new child node preserves the scope of the title, so (for example) a single chapter may possess a number of (temporally disjoint) title nodes.","Higher level scoping has a number of surprising but useful consequences. In particular, a higher level provision is, in itself, not subject to amendment. Thus, an instruction such as \u201cRepeal Chapter 2A\u201d actually terminates the scope of all of Chapter 2A's constituent terminal nodes. The chapter node, having no scope of its own, is unaffected.","Additionally, the previously described problem pertaining to the overlapping scope of the 2A repeal stub disappears. Embodiments of the invention utilise the following approaches. When Chapter 2A is repealed, the associated scope of all terminal nodes within Chapter 2A is terminated. In a first embodiment, a new Chapter 2A is enacted immediately after the original chapter is terminated. The new Chapter 2A has an associated scope commencing on the day after which the original Chapter 2A was repealed. In a second embodiment, a repeal stub is introduced. A repeal stub in the preferred embodiment is a title with an attribute marking this title as being of the type \u201crepeal stub\u201d. The repeal stub has an associated scope with a start date corresponding to the date after which Chapter 2A was repealed. The repeal stub has the Chapter 2A node as a parent. If a new Chapter 2A is later enacted, the scope of the repeal stub is terminated and the scope of the terminal nodes of the new Chapter 2A will begin on the day after the end date of the repeal stub's scope.","Thus, a request \u201cfor Chapter 2A on date X\u201d returns a description of Chapter 2A that was valid on that date. In the event that the request is for a date on which the chapter is repealed, the fact that the chapter is not in force, having been repealed on or before that date, will be returned.","A portion of Document Type Definition (DTD) code which is used to enable higher level scoping appears in Tables 2 to 8 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0235","num":"0267"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<!\u2212\u2212"},{"entry":"#########################################################"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"ENTITY:","hlev-id"]},{"entry":[{},"PURPOSE:","Concatenation of the elements that make the"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Identification of a higher level element.
