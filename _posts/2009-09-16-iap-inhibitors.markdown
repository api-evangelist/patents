Field of the Invention","The present invention describes compounds that are inhibitors of IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis proteins), processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in therapy. The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases and other disorders.","2. Description of Related Art","Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a central role in the development and homeostasis of all multi-cellular organisms. Apoptosis can be initiated within a cell from an external factor such as a chemokine (an extrinsic pathway) or via an intracellular event such a DNA damage (an intrinsic pathway). Alterations in apoptotic pathways have been implicated in many types of human pathologies, including developmental disorders, cancer, autoimmune diseases, as well as neurodegenerative disorders. One mode of action of chemotherapeutic drugs is cell death via apoptosis.","Apoptosis is conserved across species and executed primarily by activated caspases, a family of cysteine proteases with aspartate specificity in their substrates. These cysteine containing aspartate specific proteases (\u201ccaspases\u201d) are produced in cells as catalytically inactive zymogens and are proteolytically processed to become active proteases during apoptosis. Once activated, effector caspases are responsible for proteolytic cleavage of a broad spectrum of cellular targets that ultimately lead to cell death. In normal surviving cells that have not received an apoptotic stimulus, most caspases remain inactive. If caspases are aberrantly activated, their proteolytic activity can be inhibited by a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins called IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis proteins).","The IAP family of proteins suppresses apoptosis by preventing the activation of procaspases and inhibiting the enzymatic activity of mature caspases. Several distinct mammalian IAPs including XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, ML-IAP, NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibiting protein), Bruce, and survivin, have been identified, and they all exhibit anti-apoptotic activity in cell culture. IAPs were originally discovered in baculovirus by their functional ability to substitute for P35 protein, an anti-apoptotic gene. IAPs have been described in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human, and are known to be overexpressed in many human cancers. Generally speaking, IAPs comprise one to three Baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains, and most of them also possess a carboxyl-terminal RING finger motif. The BIR domain itself is a zinc binding domain of about 70 residues comprising 4 alpha-helices and 3 beta strands, with cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate the zinc ion. It is the BIR domain that is believed to cause the anti-apoptotic effect by inhibiting the caspases and thus inhibiting apoptosis. XIAP is expressed ubiquitously in most adult and fetal tissues. Overexpression of XIAP in tumor cells has been demonstrated to confer protection against a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli and promotes resistance to chemotherapy. Consistent with this, a strong correlation between XIAP protein levels and survival has been demonstrated for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Down-regulation of XIAP expression by antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to death induced by a wide range of pro-apoptotic agents, both in vitro and in vivo","In normal cells signaled to undergo apoptosis, however, the IAP-mediated inhibitory effect must be removed, a process at least in part performed by a mitochondrial protein named Smac (second mitochondrial activator of caspases). Smac (or, DIABLO), is synthesized as a precursor molecule of 239 amino acids; the N-terminal 55 residues serve as the mitochondria targeting sequence that is removed after import. The mature form of Smac contains 184 amino acids and behaves as an oligomer in solution. Smac and various fragments thereof have been proposed for use as targets for identification of therapeutic agents.","Smac is synthesized in the cytoplasm with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is proteolytically removed during maturation to the mature polypeptide and is then targeted to the inter-membrane space of mitochondria. At the time of apoptosis induction, Smac is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, together with cytochrome c, where it binds to IAPs, and enables caspase activation, therein eliminating the inhibitory effect of IAPs on apoptosis. Whereas cytochrome c induces multimerization of Apaf-1 to activate procaspase-9 and -3, Smac eliminates the inhibitory effect of multiple IAPs. Smac interacts with essentially all IAPs that have been examined to date including XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, ML-IAP, and survivin. Thus, Smac appears to be a master regulator of apoptosis in mammals.","It has been shown that Smac promotes not only the proteolytic activation of procaspases, but also the enzymatic activity of mature caspase, both of which depend upon its ability to interact physically with IAPs. X-ray crystallography has shown that the first four amino acids (AVPI) of mature Smac bind to a portion of IAPs. This N-terminal sequence is essential for binding IAPs and blocking their anti-apoptotic effects.","Currently, there are drug discovery efforts aimed at identifying compounds that interfere with the role played by IAPs in disease states where a defect in apoptosis is implicated, such as in cancers and autoimmune diseases. Indeed, a number of IAP inhibitors that mimic the interactions of the Smac tetrapeptide are now known and possess pro-apoptotic activity in vitro and in vivo. Some IAP inhibitors demonstrate potent single-agent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, but unfortunately present an elevated risk of unwanted effects when administered in vivo (e.g., reduced cardiac output and elevated intestinal epithelial apoptosis). Thus, the art continues to look for additional compounds that may function as IAP inhibitors.","The present invention provides IAP inhibitors and therapeutic methods of using these inhibitors to modulate apoptosis.","In one embodiment, which can be practiced either separately, or in combination with the other embodiments disclosed below, the present invention provides compounds of Formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"33.53mm","wi":"64.94mm","file":"US08399683-20130319-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{}]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"17.36mm","wi":"52.83mm","file":"US08399683-20130319-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["wherein R8 is selected from H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl;","and R9 is selected from H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heterocycloalkyl, substituted heterocycloalkyl, heteroaryl, or substituted heteroaryl;

In addition, in the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent however, to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the invention may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, well known methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the invention.","\u201cAlkyl\u201d (monovalent) and \u201calkylene\u201d (divalent) when alone or as part of another term (e.g., alkoxy) mean branched or unbranched, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group, having up to 12 carbon atoms unless otherwise specified. Examples of particular alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, n-hexyl, 2-methylpentyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, n-heptyl, 3-heptyl, 2-methylhexyl, and the like. The term, \u201clower,\u201d when used to modify alkyl, alkenyl, etc., means 1 to 4 carbon atoms, branched or linear so that, e.g., the terms \u201clower alkyl\u201d, \u201cC-Calkyl\u201d and \u201calkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms\u201d are synonymous and used interchangeably to mean methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, 1-butyl, sec-butyl or t-butyl. Examples of alkylene groups include, but are not limited to, methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, n-butylene and 2-methyl-butylene.","The term substituted alkyl refers to alkyl moieties having substituents replacing one or more hydrogens on one or more (often no more than four) carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon backbone. Such substituents are independently selected from the group consisting of: a halogen (e.g., I, Br, Cl, or F), hydroxy, amino, cyano, mercapto, alkoxy (such as a C-Calkoxy, e.g., methoxy or ethoxy to yield an alkoxyalkyl), aryloxy (such as phenoxy to yield an aryloxyalkyl), nitro, oxo (e.g., carbonyl), carboxyl (which is the combination of an oxo and hydroxy substituent on a single carbon atom), carbamoyl (an aminocarbonyl such as NHC(O)\u2014), cycloalkyl (e.g., a cycloalkylalkyl), aryl (resulting for example in aralkyls such as benzyl or phenylethyl), heterocyclylalkyl (e.g., heterocycloalkylalkyl), heteroaryl (e.g., heteroarylalkyl), alkylsulfonyl (including lower alkylsulfonyl such as methylsulfonyl), arylsulfonyl (such as phenylsulfonyl), and \u2014OCF(which is a halogen substituted alkoxy). The invention further contemplates that several of these alkyl substituents, including specifically alkoxy, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyalkyl and heteroaryl, are optionally further substituted as defined in connection with each of their respective definitions provided below. In addition, certain alkyl substituent moieties result from a combination of such substitutions on a single carbon atom. For example, an ester moiety, e.g., an alkoxycarbonyl such as tert-butoxycarbonyl or Boc is a substituted alkyl that results from the substitution on a methyl group (\u2014CH) of both an oxo (\u2550O) and an unsubstituted alkoxy, e.g., a tert-butoxy (\u2014(CH)C\u2014O\u2014), replacing the three hydrogens. Similarly, an amide moiety, e.g., an alkylaminocarbonyl such as dimethlyaminocarbonyl is a substituted alkyl that results from the substitution on a methyl group (\u2014CH) of both an oxo (\u2550O) and a di-unsubstitutedalkylamino, e.g., dimethylamino (\u2014N\u2014(CH)), replacing the three hydrogens.

Particular substituted alkyls are substituted methyl groups. Examples of substituted methyl group include groups such as hydroxymethyl, protected hydroxymethyl (e.g., tetrahydropyranyl-oxymethyl), acetoxymethyl, carbamoyloxymethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, carboxymethyl, carboxyl (where the three hydrogen atoms on the methyl are replaced, two of the hydrogens are replaced by an oxo (\u2550O) and the other hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxy (\u2014OH)), tert-butoxycarbonyl (where the three hydrogen atoms on the methyl are replaced, two of the hydrogens are replaced by an oxo (\u2550O) and the other hydrogen is replaced by a tert-butoxy (\u2014O\u2014C(CH)), bromomethyl and iodomethyl.","The term substituted alkylene refers to alkylene moieties having substituents replacing one or more hydrogens on one or more (often no more than four) carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon backbone where the alkylene is similarly substituted with groups as set forth above for alkyl.","Alkoxy is \u2014O-alkyl.

encompass compounds that are synthesized in vitro using laboratory techniques, such as those well known to synthetic chemists; or synthesized using in vivo techniques, such as through metabolism, fermentation, digestion, and the like. It is also contemplated that the compounds of the present invention may be synthesized using a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques.","The present invention also includes isotopically-labelled compounds, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, F, and Cl.","Compounds of the present invention that contain the aforementioned isotopes and\/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detection. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of this invention can generally be prepared by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.","The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. The compounds of the present invention (e.g., compounds of Formula I, IS, IR, II, IIS, IIR, III, IIIS and IIIR) also are capable of forming both pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including but not limited to acid addition and\/or base addition salts. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may exist in various solid states including an amorphous form (noncrystalline form), and in the form of clathrates, prodrugs, polymorphs, bio-hydrolyzable esters, racemic mixtures, non-racemic mixtures, or as purified stereoisomers including, but not limited to, optically pure enantiomers and diastereomers. In general, all of these forms can be used as an alternative form to the free base or free acid forms of the compounds, as described above and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.","A \u201cpolymorph\u201d refers to solid crystalline forms of a compound. Different polymorphs of the same compound can exhibit different physical, chemical and\/or spectroscopic properties. Different physical properties include, but are not limited to stability (e.g., to heat or light), compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), and dissolution rates (which can affect bioavailability). Different physical properties of polymorphs can affect their processing.","A \u201cclathrate\u201d means a compound or a salt thereof in the form of a crystal lattice that contains spaces (e.g., channels) that have a guest molecule (e.g., a solvent or water) trapped within.","As noted above, the compounds of the present invention can be administered, inter alia, as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, amides or prodrugs. The term \u201csalts\u201d refers to inorganic and organic salts of compounds of the present invention. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of a compound, or by separately reacting a purified compound in its free base or acid form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, palmitiate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts, and the like. The salts may include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like, as well as non-toxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations including, but not limited to, ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethylamine, and the like. See, for example, S. M. Berge, et al., \u201cPharmaceutical Salts,\u201d J Pharm Sci, 66: 1-19 (1977).","Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the compounds of the present invention include C-Calkyl esters. Acceptable esters also include C-Ccycloalkyl esters, as well as arylalkyl esters such as benzyl. C-Calkyl esters are commonly used. Esters of compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to methods that are well known in the art.","Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable amides of the compounds of the present invention include amides derived from ammonia, primary C-Calkyl amines, and secondary C-Cdialkyl amines. In the case of secondary amines, the amine may also be in the form of a 5 or 6 membered heterocycloalkyl group containing at least one nitrogen atom. Amides derived from ammonia, C-Cprimary alkyl amines and C-Cdialkyl secondary amines are commonly used. Amides of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to methods well known to those skilled in the art.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formulae, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d Vol 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","To illustrate, if the compound of the invention contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as (C-Calkyl, (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylamino(C-C)alkyl (such as \u03b2-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C-C)alkyl, N,N-di(C-C)alkylcarbamoyl-(C-C)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C-C)alkyl.","Similarly, if a compound of the present invention comprises an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C-C)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N\u2014(C-C)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C-C)alkanoyl, \u03b1-amino(C-C)alkanoyl, arylacyl and \u03b1-aminoacyl, or \u03b1-aminoacyl-\u03b1-aminoacyl, where each \u03b1-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, \u2014P(O)(OH), \u2014P(O)(O(C-C)alkyl)or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).","Compounds and salts of the present invention may also exist in tautomeric forms, such as an enol and an imine form, and the corresponding keto and enamine forms and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though only one tautomer may be described by the formulae above, the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds.","The compounds of the present invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is contemplated that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention contemplates all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if the compound contains a double bond, both the cis and trans forms (designated as Z and E, respectively), as well as mixtures, are contemplated.","Mixture of stereoisomers, such as diastereomeric mixtures, can be separated into their individual stereochemical components on the basis of their physical chemical differences by known methods such as chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can also be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diasteromeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., an alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some compounds may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls).","The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The present invention contemplates and encompasses both the solvated and unsolvated forms.","The compounds of the present invention can be administered to a patient either alone or a part of a pharmaceutical composition in a therapeutically effective amount. A variety of non-limiting methods for administering the compounds and related compositions to patients include orally, rectally, parenterally (intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously), intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, intravesically, locally (powders, ointments, or drops), or as a buccal or nasal spray. In addition, the substance or compositions containing the active substances can be administered all at once, as for example, by a bolus injection, multiple times, such as by a series of tablets, or delivered substantially uniformly over a period of time, as for example, using transdermal delivery. It is also noted that the dose of the substances can be varied over time.","The compounds and related compositions of the present invention can be administered alone, or in combination with other pharmaceutically active substances. The other pharmaceutically active substances can be intended to treat the same disease or condition as the substances of the present invention or a different disease or condition. If the patient is to receive, or is receiving multiple pharmaceutically active substances, the substances can be administered simultaneously, or sequentially. For example, in the case of tablets, the active substances may be found in one tablet or in separate tablets, which can be administered at once or sequentially in any order. In addition, it should be recognized that the compositions may be different forms. For example, one or more substance may be delivered via a tablet, while another is administered via injection or orally as a syrup. All combinations, delivery methods and administration sequences are contemplated.","Pharmaceutical compositions to be used comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as described above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other form thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The phrase \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use. It should be appreciated that the determinations of proper dosage forms, dosage amounts, and routes of administration for a particular patient are within the level of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical and medical arts.","Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of a compound or composition of the invention, which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. This aqueous preparation may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents. Various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, and sorbic acid also may be included. The sterile injectable preparation also may be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectables. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Carrier formulation suitable for subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, etc. administrations can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto.","Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable excipient such as (a) fillers or extenders, as for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, (b) binders, as for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia, (c) humectants, as for example, glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents, as for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates, and sodium carbonate, (e) solution retarders, as for example paraffin, (f) absorption accelerators, as for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, as for example, cetyl alcohol, and glycerol monostearate, (h) adsorbents, as for example, kaolin and bentonite, and (i) lubricants, as for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, or mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Solid dosage forms such as tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules also can be prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and others well known in the art. The solid dosage form also may contain opacifying agents, and can also be of such composition that they release the active compound or compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients. Such solid dosage forms may generally contain from 1% to 95% (w\/w) of the active compound. In certain embodiments, the active compound ranges from 5% to 70% (w\/w).","Since one aspect of the present invention contemplates the treatment of the disease\/conditions with a combination of pharmaceutically active agents that may be administered separately, the invention further relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions: a substance of the present invention, and a second pharmaceutical substance. The kit comprises a container for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Additional examples of containers include syringes, boxes and bags. Typically, the kit comprises directions for the use of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician or veterinarian.","An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.","It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows \u201cFirst Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . etc. . . . Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . \u201d etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A \u201cdaily dose\u201d can be a single tablet or capsule or several pills or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of a substance of the present invention can consist of one tablet or capsule, while a daily dose of the second substance can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this and aid in correct administration of the active agents.","In another specific embodiment of the invention, a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and\/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.","Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the compound or composition, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, as for example, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol, 1,3-butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide, oils, in particular, cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil and sesame oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethyleneglycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan or mixtures of these substances. Besides such inert diluents, the composition can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.","Compositions for rectal administrations are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing compounds of the present invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethyleneglycol or a low-melting, suppository wax, which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at body temperature and therefore, melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.","Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, powders, sprays, and inhalants. The active compound is admixed under sterile conditions with a physiologically acceptable carrier and any preservatives, buffers, or propellants as may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.","The compounds and compositions of the present invention also may benefit from a variety of delivery systems, including time-released, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such option may be particularly beneficial when the compounds and composition are used in conjunction with other treatment protocals as described in more detail below.","Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono-di- and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; sylastic systems; peptide based systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which the active compound is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,775, 4,667,014, 4,748,034 and 5,239,660 and (b) diffusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,832,253, and 3,854,480. In addition, pump-based hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation.","Use of a long-term sustained release implant may be desirable. Long-term release, as used herein, means that the implant is constructed and arranged to deliver therapeutic levels of the active compound for at least 30 days, and preferably 60 days. Long-term sustained release implants are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include some of the release systems described above.","In practicing the methods of the present invention, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered in a therapeutically effective amount. Generally, doses of active compounds would be from about 0.01 mg\/kg per day to 1000 mg\/kg per day. It is expected that doses ranging from 50-500 mg\/kg will be suitable, preferably intravenously, intramuscularly, or intradermally, and in one or several administrations per day. The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with radiation therapy, hormone therapy, surgery and immunotherapy, which therapies are well know to those skilled in the art.","When practicing the conjoint or combination therapy described in more detail below, the administration of the compounds and compositions of the present invention can occur simultaneous with, subsequent to, or prior to chemotherapy or radiation, so long as the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation sensitizes the system to the compounds and compositions of the present invention.","In general, routine experimentation in clinical trials will determine specific ranges for optimal therapeutic effect for a particular compound and composition of the present invention and each administrative protocol, and administration to specific patients will be adjusted to within effective and safe ranges depending on the patient condition and responsiveness to initial administrations. However, the ultimate administration protocol will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient, the potency of the compound or composition, the duration of the treatment and the severity of the disease being treated. For example, a dosage regimen of the compound or composition can be an oral administration of from 1 mg to 2000 mg\/day, preferably 1 to 1000 mg\/day, more preferably 50 to 600 mg\/day, in two to four (preferably two) divided doses, to reduce tumor growth. Intermittent therapy (e.g., one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks) may also be used.","In the event that a response in a subject is insufficient at the initial doses applied, higher doses (or effectively higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that the patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds. Generally, a maximum dose is used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand, however, that a patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons, psychological reasons or for virtually any other reason.","The compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention can be administered to a subject suffering from cancer, an autoimmune disease or another disorder where a defect in apoptosis is implicated. In connection with such treatments, the patient can be treated prophylactically, acutely, or chronically using compounds and compositions of the present invention, depending on the nature of the disease. Typically, the host or subject in each of these methods is human, although other mammals may also benefit from the administration of a compound of the present invention.","As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,244,851, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, IAP antagonists can be used for the treatment of all cancer types which fail to undergo apoptosis. Thus, compounds of the present invention can be used to provide a therapeutic approach to the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors, including but not limited to carcinomas, sarcomas including Kaposi's sarcoma, erythroblastoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, melanoma and myoblastoma. Treatment or prevention of non-solid tumor cancers such as leukemia is also contemplated by this invention. Indications may include, but are not limited to brain cancers, skin cancers, bladder cancers, ovarian cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers, pancreatic cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers, lung cancers and bone cancers. Examples of such cancer types include neuroblastoma, intestine carcinoma such as rectum carcinoma, colon carcinoma, familiary adenomatous polyposis carcinoma and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, esophageal carcinoma, labial carcinoma, larynx carcinoma, hypopharynx carcinoma, tong carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, medullary thyroidea carcinoma, papillary thyroidea carcinoma, renal carcinoma, kidney parenchym carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, uterine corpus carcinoma, endometrium carcinoma, chorion carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, testis carcinoma, breast carcinoma, urinary carcinoma, melanoma, brain tumors such as glioblastoma, astrocytoma, meningioma, medulloblastoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gall bladder carcinoma, bronchial carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, multiple myeloma, basalioma, teratoma, retinoblastoma, choroidea melanoma, seminoma, rhabdomyo sarcoma, craniopharyngeoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, myosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and plasmocytoma.","The inventors believe that the IAP antagonists of the present invention will be particularly active for treating human malignancies where cIAP1 and cIAP2 are over-expressed (e.g., lung cancers, see Dai et al, Hu. Molec. Genetics, 2003 v 12 pp 791-801; leukemias (multiple references), and other cancers (Tamm et al, Clin Cancer Res, 2000, v 6, 1796-1803). The inventors also expect that the IAP antagonists of the present invention will be active in disorders that may be driven by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF playing a pro-survival role (for example, there is a well defined role for TNF acting as a survival factor in ovarian carcinoma, similarly for gastric cancers (see Kulbe, et al, Cancer Res 2007, 67, 585-592).","In addition to apoptosis defects found in tumors, defects in the ability to eliminate self-reactive cells of the immune system due to apoptosis resistance are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are characterized in that the cells of the immune system produce antibodies against its own organs and molecules or directly attack tissues resulting in the destruction of the latter. A failure of those self-reactive cells to undergo apoptosis leads to the manifestation of the disease. Defects in apoptosis regulation have been identified in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erthematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.","Examples of such autoimmune diseases include collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sharp's syndrome, CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's syndrome, esophageal dysmotility, telangiectasia), dermatomyositis, vasculitis (Morbus Wegener's) and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, renal diseases such as Goodpasture's syndrome, rapidly-progressing glomerulonephritis and membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis type II, endocrine diseases such as type-I diabetes, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), autoimmune parathyroidism, pernicious anemia, gonad insufficiency, idiopathic Morbus Addison's, hyperthyreosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and primary myxedema, skin diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, herpes gestationis, epidermolysis bullosa and erythema multiforme major, liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis type-1, autoimmune hepatitis type-2, primary sclerosing cholangitis, neuronal diseases such as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, myasthenic Lambert-Eaton syndrome, acquired neuromyotony, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (M\u00fcller-Fischer syndrome), stiff-man syndrome, cerebellar degeneration, ataxia, opsoklonus, sensoric neuropathy and achalasia, blood diseases such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Morbus Werlhof), infectious diseases with associated autoimmune reactions such as AIDS, Malaria and Chagas disease.","The present invention also is directed to the use of the compounds and compositions as a chemopotentiating agent with other treatment approaches. The term \u201cchemopotentiating agent\u201d refers to an agent that acts to increase the sensitivity of an organism, tissue, or cell to a chemical compound, or treatment namely \u201cchemotherapeutic agents\u201d or \u201cchemo drugs\u201d or to radiation treatment. Thus, compounds and compositions of the present invention can be used for inhibiting tumor growth in vivo by administering them in combination with a biologic or chemotherapeutic agent or by using them in combination with chemoradiation. In these applications, the administration of the compounds and compositions of the present invention may occur prior to, and with sufficient time, to cause sensitization of the site to be treated. Alternatively, the compounds and compositions of the present invention may be used contemporaneously with radiation and\/or additional anti-cancer chemical agents (infra). Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds and compositions of the present invention, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician, and may be particularly suitable for certain compositions of the present invention.","Biological and chemotherapeutics\/anti-neoplastic agents and radiation induce apoptosis by activating the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways, and, since the compounds and compositions of the present invention relieve antagonists of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) and, thus, remove the block in apoptosis, the combination of chemotherapeutics\/anti-neoplastic agents and radiation with the compounds and compositions of the present invention should work synergistically to facilitate apoptosis.","A combination of a compound of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic\/anti neoplastic agent and\/or radiation therapy of any type that activates the intrinsic pathway may provide a more effective approach to destroying tumor cells. Compounds of the present invention interact with IAP's, such as XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, ML-IAP, etc., and block the IAP mediated inhibition of apoptosis while chemotherapeutics\/anti neoplastic agents and\/or radiation therapy kills actively dividing cells by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway leading to apoptosis and cell death. As is described in more detail below, embodiments of the invention provide combinations of a compound of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic\/anti-neoplastic agent and\/or radiation which provide a synergistic action against unwanted cell proliferation. This synergistic action between a compound of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic\/anti-neoplastic agent and\/or radiation therapy can improve the efficiency of the chemotherapeutic\/anti-neoplastic agent and\/or radiation therapies. This will allow for an increase in the effectiveness of current chemotherapeutic\/anti-neoplastic agents or radiation treatments allowing the dose of the chemotherapeutic\/anti-neoplastic agent to be lowered, therein providing both a more effective dosing schedule as well as use of a more tolerable dose of chemotherapeutic\/anti-neoplastic agent and\/or radiation.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the patient is treated by administering a compound or a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention at a time the patient is subject to concurrent or antecedent radiation or chemotherapy for treatment of a neoproliferative pathology of a tumor such as, but not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, hepatoma, melanoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, and combinations thereof.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the compound or composition of the present invention can be administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic and\/or for use in combination with radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and\/or photodynamic therapy, promoting apoptosis and enhancing the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and\/or photodynamic therapy.","Embodiments of the invention also include a method of treating a patient afflicted with cancer by the contemporaneous or concurrent administration of a chemotherapeutic agent. Such chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to the chemotherapeutic agents described in \u201cModern Pharmacology with Clinical Applications\u201d, Sixth Edition, Craig & Stitzel, Chpt. 56, pg 639-656 (2004), herein incorporated by reference. The chemotherapeutic agent can be, but is not limited to, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anti-tumor antibiotics, plant-derived products such as taxanes, enzymes, hormonal agents, miscellaneous agents such as cisplatin, monoclonal antibodies, glucocorticoids, mitotic inhibitors, topoisomerase I inhibitors, topoisomerase II inhibitors, immunomodulating agents such as interferons, cellular growth factors, cytokines, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds, cellular growth factors and kinase inhibitors. Other suitable classifications for chemotherapeutic agents include mitotic inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-estrogenic analogs.","Specific examples of suitable biological and chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, cisplatin, carmustine (BCNU), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cytarabine (Ara-C), gemcitabine, methotrexate, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, topotecan, etoposide, paclitaxel, vincristine, tamoxifen, TNF-alpha, TRAIL, interferon (in both its alpha and beta forms), thalidomide, and melphalan. Other specific examples of suitable chemotherapeutic agents include nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, ethylenimines, triazenes, folate antagonists, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, anthracyclines, bleomycins, mitomycins, dactinomycins, plicamycin, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, taxanes, glucocorticoids, L-asparaginase, estrogens, androgens, progestins, luteinizing hormones, octreotide actetate, hydroxyurea, procarbazine, mitotane, hexamethylmelamine, carboplatin, mitoxantrone, monoclonal antibodies, levamisole, interferons, interleukins, filgrastim and sargramostim. Chemotherapeutic compositions also comprise other members, i.e., other than TRAIL, of the TNF superfamily of compounds.","Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of a compound or composition of the present invention in combination with topoismerase inhibitors to potentiate their apoptotic inducing effect. Topoisomerase inhibitors inhibit DNA replication and repair, thereby promoting apoptosis and have been used as chemothemotherapeutic agents. Topoisomerase inhibitors promote DNA damage by inhibiting the enzymes that are required in the DNA repair process. Therefore, export of Smac from the mitochondria into the cell cytosol is provoked by the DNA damage caused by topoisomerase inhibitors. Topoisomerase inhibitors of both the Type I class (camptothecin, topotecan, SN-38 (irinotecan active metabolite)) and the Type II class (etoposide) are expected to show potent synergy with compounds of the present invention. Further examples of topoisomerase inhibiting agents that may be used include, but are not limited to, irinotecan, topotecan, etoposide, amsacrine, exatecan, gimatecan, etc. Other topoisomerase inhibitors include, for example, Aclacinomycin A, camptothecin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, ellipticine, epirubicin, and mitaxantrone.","In another embodiment of the invention, the chemotherapeutic\/anti-neoplastic agent for use in combination with the compounds and compositions of the present invention may be a platinum containing compound. In one embodiment of the invention, the platinum containing compound is cisplatin. Cisplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP, such as but not limited to XIAP, cIAP-1, c-IAP-2, ML-IAP, etc. In another embodiment a platinum containing compound is carboplatin. Carboplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP, including, but not limited to, XIAP, cIAP-1, c-IAP-2, ML-IAP, etc. In another embodiment a platinum containing compound is oxaliplatin. The oxaliplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP, including, but not limited to, XIAP, cIAP-1, c-IAP-2, ML-IAP, etc.","Platinum chemotherapy drugs belong to a general group of DNA modifying agents. DNA modifying agents may be any highly reactive chemical compound that bonds with various nucleophilic groups in nucleic acids and proteins and cause mutagenic, carcinogenic, or cytotoxic effects. DNA modifying agents work by different mechanisms, disruption of DNA function and cell death; DNA damage\/the formation of cross-bridges or bonds between atoms in the DNA; and induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations, to achieve the same end result. Three non-limiting examples of a platinum containing DNA modifying agents are cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.","Cisplatin is believed to kill cancer cells by binding to DNA and interfering with its repair mechanism, eventually leading to cell death. Carboplatin and oxaliplatin are cisplatin derivatives that share the same mechanism of action. Highly reactive platinum complexes are formed intracellularly and inhibit DNA synthesis by covalently binding DNA molecules to form intrastrand and interstrand DNA crosslinks.","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to induce apoptosis in colorectal cells. NSAIDs appear to induce apoptosis via the release of Smac from the mitochondria (PNAS, Nov. 30, 2004, vol. 101:16897-16902). Therefore, the use of NSAIDs in combination with the compounds and compositions of the present invention would be expected to increase the activity of each drug over the activity of either drug independently.","Many naturally occurring compounds isolated from bacterial, plant, and animals can display potent and selective biological activity in humans including anticancer and antineoplastic activities. In fact, many natural products, or semi-synthetic derivatives thereof, which possess anticancer activity, are already commonly used as therapeutic agents; these include paclitaxel, etoposide, vincristine, and camptothecin amongst others. Additionally, there are many other classes of natural products such as the indolocarbazoles and epothilones that are undergoing clinical evaluation as anticancer agents. A reoccurring structural motif in many natural products is the attachment of one or more sugar residues onto an aglycone core structure. In some instances, the sugar portion of the natural product is critical for making discrete protein-ligand interactions at its site of action (i.e., pharmacodynamics) and removal of the sugar residue results in significant reductions in biological activity. In other cases, the sugar moiety or moieties are important for modulating the physical and pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule. Rebeccamycin and staurosporine are representative of the sugar-linked indolocarbazole family of anticancer natural products with demonstrated anti-kinase and anti-topoisomerase activity.","Taxanes are anti-mitotic, mitotic inhibitors or microtubule polymerization agents. Taxanes are characterized as compounds that promote assembly of microtubules by inhibiting tubulin depolymerization, thereby blocking cell cycle progression through centrosomal impairment, induction of abnormal spindles and suppression of spindle microtubule dynamics. Taxanes include but are not limited to, docetaxel and paclitaxel. The unique mechanism of action of taxane is in contrast to other microtubule poisons, such as Vinca alkaloids, colchicine, and cryptophycines, which inhibit tubulin polymerization. Microtubules are highly dynamic cellular polymers made of alpha-beta-tubulin and associated proteins that play key roles during mitosis by participating in the organization and function of the spindle, assuring the integrity of the segregated DNA. Therefore, they represent an effective target for cancer therapy.","Yet another embodiment of the present invention is the therapeutic combination or the therapeutic use in combination of a compound or composition of the present invention with TRAIL or other chemical or biological agents which bind to and activate the TRAIL receptor(s). TRAIL has received considerable attention recently because of the finding that many cancer cell types are sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, while most normal cells appear to be resistant to this action of TRAIL. TRAIL-resistant cells may arise by a variety of different mechanisms including loss of the receptor, presence of decoy receptors, or overexpression of FLIP which competes for zymogen caspase-8 binding during DISC formation. In TRAIL resistance, a compound or composition of the present invention may increase tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL leading to enhanced cell death, the clinical correlations of which are expected to be increased apoptotic activity in TRAIL resistant tumors, improved clinical response, increased response duration, and ultimately, enhanced patient survival rate. In support of this, reduction in XIAP levels by in vitro antisense treatment has been shown to cause sensitization of resistant melanoma cells and renal carcinoma cells to TRAIL (Chawla-Sarkar, et al., 2004). The compounds of the present invention bind to IAPs and inhibit their interaction with caspases, therein potentiating TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","Compounds and compositions of the present invention also can be used to augment radiation therapy (or radiotherapy), i.e., the medical use of ionizing radiation as part of cancer treatment to control malignant cells. Although radiotherapy is often used as part of curative therapy, it is occasionally used as a palliative treatment, where cure is not possible and the aim is for symptomatic relief. Radiotherapy is commonly used for the treatment of tumors. It may be used as the primary therapy. It is also common to combine radiotherapy with surgery and\/or chemotherapy. The most common tumors treated with radiotherapy are breast cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, head & neck cancers, gynecological tumors, bladder cancer and lymphoma. Radiation therapy is commonly applied just to the localized area involved with the tumor. Often the radiation fields also include the draining lymph nodes. It is possible but uncommon to give radiotherapy to the whole body, or entire skin surface. Radiation therapy is usually given daily for up to 35-38 fractions (a daily dose is a fraction). These small frequent doses allow healthy cells time to grow back, repairing damage inflicted by the radiation. Three main divisions of radiotherapy are external beam radiotherapy or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiotherapy and unsealed source radiotherapy, which are all suitable examples of treatment protocol in the present invention. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, while sealed and unsealed source radiotherapy has radioactive material delivered internally. Brachytherapy sealed sources are usually extracted later, while unsealed sources are injected into the body.","Administration of the compounds and compositions of the present invention may occur prior to, concurrently with, or subsequent to the combination treatment protocol. A variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected will depend, of course, upon the particular chemotherapeutic drug selected, the severity of the condition being treated and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of the invention, generally speaking, may be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Such modes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, rectal, topical, nasal, intradermal, inhalation, intra-peritoneal, or parenteral routes. The term \u201cparenteral\u201d includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or infusion. Intravenous or intramuscular routes are particularly suitable for purposes of the present invention.","It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and the scope of the appended claims."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
