Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate to setting up a communication session within a wireless communications system.","2. Description of the Related Art","When a synchronous communication is desired between two communication devices, such as a telephone call between two telephones, it is common to have one device attempt to start the communication and bridge the connection by contacting the other device. The contacted device will then broadcast an alert, such as a ring or other audible alert, and can also give a visual alert, such as flashing lights or activity on a display, to inform a person near the device that another communication device is attempting to bridge a communication.","In telephone systems, it is common to send some identification data, often called \u201ccaller id\u201d which indicates a caller's number, and other identification data such as the name associated with the calling telephone, during the ringing signal, or when the call is being set up, but before the call is answered. The information made available to the called party may be made visible on a display on the telephone or on a separate attached device. The caller ID information can be manipulated as to the calling number and identity of the calling party, but cannot otherwise be modified to include more data that could provide more data to the user of the called telephone about the nature of the intended call bridge attempt.","There are also specialized telephones and other communication devices, either land-line based telephones or mobile devices, that allow a user to select a specific ringtone or alert for an incoming call based upon the caller id information. This does allow the user of the receiving device to know via the alert mechanism of the phone or other communication device the identity of the caller, but it does not allow the caller to manipulate the ringtone or alert, and does not give any information on the nature of the incoming request to bridge a communication.","In an embodiment, an originating communication device within a wireless communications system sends a call request to a server to initiate a communication session with a target communication device, and also sends, along with the call request, a session description request, the session description request requesting alerting data to be sent to the target communication device from the server in addition to a call announce message for announcing the communication session to the at least one target communication device, the alerting data describing a nature of the communication session. The server sends the call announce message and the alerting data to the target communication device. The target communication device receives the call announce message and the alerting data, notifies a user of the target communication device of the announced communication session and outputs the alerting data to the user of the target communication device in conjunction with the notification.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of embodiments of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d, \u201ccomprising,\u201d, \u201cincludes\u201d and\/or \u201cincluding\u201d, when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","In this description, the terms \u201ccommunication device,\u201d \u201cwireless device,\u201d \u201cwireless communications device,\u201d \u201cPTT communication device,\u201d \u201chandheld device,\u201d \u201cmobile device,\u201d and \u201chandset\u201d are used interchangeably. The terms \u201ccall\u201d and \u201ccommunication\u201d are also used interchangeably. The term \u201capplication\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass executable and non-executable software files, raw data, aggregated data, patches, and other code segments. The term \u201cexemplary\u201d means that the disclosed element or embodiment is only an example, and does not indicate any preference of user. Further, like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, and the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d includes plural references, unless otherwise specified in the description.","Conventionally, when a call is announced to a target communication device, the target communication device is only informed that a call originator wishes to engaged in a communication session. The user of the target communication device is not necessarily provided with any additional information related to the call at this point. The user can either accept the call and find out more about the communication session, or can reject the call and attempt to find out information related to the call in other ways, such as by texting the calling party and asking what the calling party wanted to speak about. Embodiments of the invention are directed to providing session-description information, or \u2018alerting data\u2019, to the target communication device along with the call announcement message (e.g., which allows the user of the target communication device to make a more informed decision regarding whether to accept the communication session, etc.).","For example,  is a representative diagram of a pair of communication devices, shown here as mobile phone  and , with the originating communication device  preparing a text message, as shown on resident display , which here is noting that the call is an \u201cUrgent Call.\u201d The originating device  then sends the text message through a telecommunication network  to the target communication device  with the initial communication bridge attempt, which here is a voice phone call. The text message is then displayed on the resident display  of the target communication device  at receipt of the incoming communication attempt. Accordingly,  shows, in an illustrative manner, how an incoming call notification along with alerting data (i.e., \u201cUrgent Call\u201d) that describes the nature of the incoming call can be used to permit a called party or target user to make a more informed decision with regard to whether to accept a call.","The alerting data can be text, audio data (such as a talk spurt), specialized ringtones, multimedia or any other data that can provide information to the user of the target device  of the nature of the incoming call. As will be described below in more detail with respect to , the alerting data can be included within a call setup message, or alternatively can be stored and indexed within the carrier network such that the call message need only refer to the index of the alerting data to be transmitted to the target device(s) for the communication session.","The telecommunication network  can be any fully or partially wired or wireless data or voice network, and does not necessarily require specific modification to permit the transmission of the alerting data. Modification of the originating communication device and target communication device can be used to accomplish the functionality as defined herein. Otherwise, the telecommunication network  can be modified to provide a call attempt protocol to provide the alerting data immediately before, during, or after the communication bridge attempt.","As used herein, the term \u201csynchronous communication\u201d is defined as a communication that requires real time, or substantially real time interaction (e.g., either half-duplex or full-duplex interaction) from all communicating parties. Voice communications are one example of synchronous communications, but other data applications and functions can be performed synchronously and utilize the present system and method. Further, the communication devices shown herein, such as mobile phones  and  are typically not in synchronous communications with each other so the originating device will selectively (typically at the control of the user) attempt to bridge a communication with one or more target devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["32","34","36","12","30","38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["50","12","42","44","48","40","52"]},"Thus, in overview, there is provided a system for communicating data from an originating communication device (mobile phone ) to a target communication device (mobile phone ) upon an initial communication bridge attempt, such as a voice call attempt. The system includes an originating communication device, such as mobile phone  or other communication device (such as a wired phone, personal digital assistant, mobile or desktop computer platform, etc.) configured to selectively initiate a communication session with (e.g., or attempt to bridge a synchronous communication, such as a voice call, to) one or more target communication devices), and the originating communication device is further configured to selectively transmit alerting data to a target communication device during the communication session initiation attempt. At least one target communication device (such as mobile phone ), having a user thereof, is configured to selectively allow the alerting data to be outputted (e.g., displayed or played, either audibly and\/or visually) to the user thereof upon receipt of the alerting data upon receiving an announce message for announcing the communication session.","As shown in , the originating communication device and target communication device can be wireless communication devices and the communication session initiation attempt can be an attempt to set-up a voice telephone call. As shown in , the target communication device, mobile phone , includes a display  and the alerting data is media (e.g., text, video, audio, etc.) output at thereon (e.g., displayed on the display  to the user of the target communication device, or output via a speaker if the alerting data includes audio, etc.).","In one embodiment, the originating communication device (such as mobile phone ) can be further configured to selectively force the target communication device (mobile phone ) to output the alerting data to the end user of the target communication device upon receipt of the alerting data and the call announce message for the communication session. For example, data frame B in  will force the mobile phone  to output the alerting data and also to answer the phone call and\/or open up a communication channel back to the originating device, whereas data frame A in  forces the output of the alerting data but does not necessarily force the target device or mobile phone  to actually accept the announced call. The target communication device can have settings that will allow the user to control whether or not an originating device can force the output of the alerting data or force the bridging of the communication back to the originating device. In other words, the target communication device can override either (i) the forcing of the alerting data output, or (ii) the forcing of the call acceptance. Alternatively, the system can be modified such that the target communication device does not have control over either the outputting of the alerting data (e.g., in case of data frames as in ) or the call acceptance (e.g., as in ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["60","74","62","64","66","68","70","60","64","66","68","70","64","62","66","68"]},"In this embodiment, a group communication computer device, shown here as server , which is present on a server-side LAN  across the wireless network , to indicate that the wireless device is present, i.e. accessible, on the wireless network . The group communication computer device  can share this information with the set of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device, or can also share it with other computer devices resident on the server-side LAN  or accessible across the wireless network . The group communication computer device  can have an attached or accessible database  to store the group identification data for the wireless devices. It should be appreciated that the number of computer components resident on server-side LAN , or across the wireless network , or Internet generally, is not limited.","The direct communication, such as a PTT communication, can be established through a half-duplex channel between the communicating wireless telecommunication device ,, and the one or more other wireless telecommunication devices of the target set. The group communication computer device  can also inform the wireless telecommunication device ,, of the inability to bridge a direct communication to the target set  if none of the wireless telecommunication devices (or at least one) of the target set have informed the group communication computer device  of their presence on the wireless network . Further, while the group communication computer device  is shown here as having the attached database  of group identification data, the group communication computer device  can have group identity data resident thereupon, and perform all storage functions described herein.","Thus, in the embodiment shown in , the attempt to initiate the communication session (i.e., to bridge a synchronous communication) is a half-duplex push-to-talk communication attempt from an originating member of a PTT group , to multiple target communication devices, such as pager  and PDA . Each of the target communication devices will then receive the identical alerting data from the originating communication device and output the alerting data (e.g., unless one or more of the target communication devices are embodied so as to disable the forced-output of alerting data). In this embodiment, the bridge attempt is the receipt of the half-duplex communication at the target communication device(s), as opposed to the bridging of a full duplex voice channel back to the originating device. However, the voice or other data carried in the half-duplex transmission from the originating communication device can be delay sensitive (e.g., requiring quick and\/or immediate delivery), so the communication bridge attempt is still a synchronous communication.","Also in the embodiment in , there is shown an alerting data database  that can be used to send alerting data, such as specialized ringtones, media, etc., to the one or more target communication devices upon an initial communication bridge attempt from the originating communication device to the one or more target communication devices. In this embodiment, the originating communication device (such as mobile phone ) need not store all media or data that it can use for alerting data, but rather, the originating communication device can interact with the alerting data database  to direct the alerting data to be delivered to the target communication device(s). For example, the alerting data fields  and\/or  as shown in  can include an index of a desired alerting data stored in the alerting database  instead of the actual alerting data to be conveyed to the target communication device(s) in association with the announce message for the communication session. The originating communication device can therefore send information to the target communication device(s) along with the communication bridge attempt (i.e., the announce message) informing the target communication device(s) to expect alerting data from another computer device. Alternatively, the originating communication device can pull data from the alerting data database , and can insert the data into the data frame or other data stream such that the originating communication device directs the alerting data database  across the wireless network  to send data in conjunction with the attempt to communicate with the target communication device.","Although a group communication is typically half-duplex audio conferencing among members of the communication group , the group communication can be voice, applications, graphic media, such as pictures in JPEG, TIF, and the like, or audio files such as MP3, MP4, WAV, and the like. The media can also be streaming media, such as a multimedia application (Powerpoint, MOV file, and the like).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["74","100","102","104","106","70","74","80","74","80","78"]},"The group communication server(s)  are connected to a wireless service provider's packet data service node (PDSN) such as PDSN , shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PDSN  can interface with a base station controller  of a base station  through a packet control function (PCF) . The PCF  is typically located in the base station . The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a mobile switching center (\u201cMSC\u201d) . The carrier network  communicates with the MSC  by a network, the Internet and\/or POTS (\u201cplain ordinary telephone system\u201d). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the MSC  transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC  can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the base transceiver station (sometimes referred to as \u201cbranch-to-source\u201d)(BTS)  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones ,,,, by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods known in the art. It should also be noted that carrier boundaries and\/or PTT operator network boundaries do not inhibit or prohibit the sharing of data as described herein.","Cellular telephones and mobile telecommunication devices, such as wireless telephone , are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held PDAs. These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor of the wireless device. The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , can download many types of applications, such as web pages, applets, MIDlets, games and data. In wireless devices that have designated a communication group  (), the wireless communication device can directly connect with the other member of the set and engage in voice and data communication. However, all such direct communications will occur through, or be at the control of, the group communication server . In other words, these communication session are server-arbitrated by the group communication server . All data packets of the devices do not necessarily have to travel through the group communication computer device  itself, but the group communication computer device  must be able to ultimately control the communication because it will typically be the only server-side  component that is aware of and\/or can retrieve the identity of the members of the communication group, or direct the identity of the members of the communication group  to another computer device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["110","112","62","110","114","110","110","116","70","116","122","122","122","124","122","126"]},"As shown here, the wireless device can be a mobile telephone , with a graphics display , but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform  as known in the art, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager with a graphics display , or even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory  can be comprised of read-only memory (ROM) or random-access memory (RAM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local database  for storage of software applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","In this embodiment of the wireless device, the computer platform  also includes a direct communication interface  that can open the direct communication channel from the wireless device (e.g., for a half-duplex voice communication, as in a PTT call). The direct communication interface  can also be part of the standard communication interface for the wireless device which ordinarily carries the voice and data transmitted to and from the wireless device. The direct communication interface  typically is comprised of hardware as is known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["132","62","138","600","132","134","132","78"]},"For example, the session-description request can be communicated along with the call setup request of  by configuring the call setup request to include alerting data field  as in , or alternatively by configuring the call setup request to include alerting data field  as in . In a further example, the PTT client  can establish a traffic channel (TCH) with a radio access network (RAN), and can then send the call setup request to the GCS  via the RAN. The call setup request can contain, for instance, the target user address, a Group application ID, or a request to establish a group. The call setup request may also be sent with a DataoverSignaling (DoS) Access channel message, instead of on a reverse-link TCH.","Referring to , after receiving the call request and alerting data, a Dispatch Call Handler (DCH) at the GCS  (\u201cDCH \u201d) performs the PTT call setup functions, , , including locating the target, applying call restrictions, and selecting a vocoder. In addition, the DCH  notifies the target device (e.g., PTT client ) that a PTT call is being established with alerting data included, . For example, the notification of  can correspond to an announce message that packaged within a DoS message that includes a field indicating the alerting data to be conveyed to the target device(s). Alternatively, the alerting data can be sent separate from the announce message, and can even be sent on a different channel from the announce message (e.g., such as a media channel). In another alternative example, the alerting data can be sent concurrently with the announce message (e.g., as would be the case in the event the alerting data is included in the actual announce message), or non-concurrently (e.g., if the alerting data is sent to the PTT client  after the announce message is sent).","The target PTT Client  will receive the incoming call announcement and alerting data, and verify that the target PTT Client  has the resources available to participate in the PTT call. If the target PTT Client  determines sufficient resources are available to support the PTT call, the target PTT Client  outputs the alerting data (e.g., if embodied to do so automatically), . For purposes of illustration here, it is assumed that the target PTT client  does have resources available. Next, the PTT Client  determines whether to accept the call, . For example, if the call message of  included a \u201cForce Answer\u201d field  as in , then the PTT Client  automatically accepts the call unless the PTT Client  has disabled forced-call answering. Otherwise, if a forced answer is not requested by the call announce message, then a user of the PTT Client  determine whether to accept the call, . In either case, assume that the PTT Client  determines to accept the call in , and thereby sends a call accept message, .","Once the call accept message is received from the target PTT Client  at the DCH  or GCS , the BSC  determines whether sufficient resources are available for supporting the communication session, . If sufficient resources are determined to be available, the BSC  sends a floor grant message to the DCH  indicating the status of the target wireless device, . The DCH  determines if the target device is available, , and if so, sends the floor grant to the originating PTT Client , , which indicates the call is being established and the PTT Client  can start talking (often with an audible \u201cbeep\u201d to the user of the device). The PTT Client  acknowledges the floor grant message and begins forwarding media for the PTT communication, . The DCH  processes the media from the PTT client  and forwards the media to the BSC , , for transmission to each target device (e.g., PTT Client , etc.) that has joined the communication session, .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["10","12","10","140","134","142","142","10","134","134","144","78","142","134","78","144","78","78"]},"A determination is then made, after sending the alerting data at step , as to whether the communication has been bridged, as shown at decision  (e.g., whether the call has been answered or accepted, whether the PTT voice stream been delivered, etc.).

Otherwise, if the communication is bridged at decision , then the communication is bridged and the process is handed over to the communication control of the origination communication device, as shown at step .

If the communication session is not joined at decision , then the process outputs a failed communication error and terminates as shown at termination . Otherwise, if the communication session is joined at decision , the communication session is handed over to the communication control of the target wireless device, as shown at . Alternatively, if the synchronous communication desired is a PTT communication, a return duplex communication can still be forced at decision , and step  could still be necessary if the half-duplex channel is turned into a full-duplex communication channel.","It can thus be seen that system  provides an inventive method for communicating alerting data from an originating communication device (such as mobile phone ) to a target communication device (such as PDA ) during setup of a communication session, with the steps of attempting to bridge a synchronous communication (such as voice call, PTT communication, data connection, and the like) from an originating communication device  to one or more target communication devices (such as pager , PDA ), and then selectively transmitting alerting data from the session arbitrator to the one or more target communication devices upon attempting to bridge the synchronous communication thereto, and outputting the alerting data to a user of the target communication device upon receipt of the alerting data at an initial communication bridge attempt from the originating communication device. If the originating communication device and target communication device are wireless communication devices, such as mobile phones  and , attempting to bridge a synchronous communication is attempting to bridge a wireless communication channel, such as a voice traffic channel, as is necessary for a telephone call. If embodied in a PTT communication system as shown in , attempting to bridge a synchronous communication is a half-duplex push-to-talk communication attempt.","If the alerting data includes video media, outputting the alerting data includes displaying the media on a display of the target communication device (mobile device ) to the user thereof. If the alerting data includes audio media, outputting the alerting data includes playing the media on a speaker of the target communication device (mobile device ) to the user thereof. As shown in , if the alerting data includes text sent from the originating communication device (mobile phone ), outputting the alerting data includes displaying the text on a display  of the target communication device (mobile phone ) to the user thereof.","Accordingly, in an embodiment of the invention, the target communication device can be forced to output the alerting data to the end user of the target device upon receipt of the alerting data upon an initial communication bridge attempt from the originating communication device. By contrast, conventional target communication devices typically play a ringtone and if a target user determines not to accept the call, any associated media is either not received or not output at the target communication device. An embodiment of the invention can also include forcing the target communication device to bridge the synchronous communication to the originating communication device (i.e., to accept the call), such as through receipt of data frame B in , and in the target communication device executing the process of . And as shown in , an embodiment of the invention can include sending the alerting data to the target communication device from another computer device, such as alerting data database , upon an initial communication bridge attempt from the originating communication device.","Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
