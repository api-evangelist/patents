Statement of the Technical Field","The present invention relates to the field of application performance monitoring and more particularly to adjusting monitoring parameters in an application performance monitor.","2. Description of the Related Art","Decades ago, application performance related mostly to the complexity of an application and the capabilities of its host platform. In view of the simplicity of the relationship between performance and resource availability, enhanced application performance could arise only through more efficient or less complex application coding, or through an enhanced hosting platform including more memory, more caching resources, faster fixed storage, or speedier processing. As a result, until recently, little attention had been paid to the performance of an application as an indicator of anything more than merely an overly complex application, or an underpowered host platform.","The popularization of more complex, enterprise computing environments has resulted in new efforts to explore the relationship between the state of a host platform and the performance of a hosted application. To further explore the changing states of applications deployed within the enterprise, application performance monitoring systems have been developed whose purpose is to detect an impending state change of a monitored application. In furtherance of its purpose, typical performance monitoring systems can be coupled to monitored applications and can monitor resources which affect the operation of the host platform. Importantly, these resources can include both hardware and software constructs.","To differentiate between events which are considered typical and events which are considered anomalous, thresholds can be established in respect to monitored resources such that when a monitored resource produces a metric which surpasses the threshold, a state change in the application or in its host can be inferred. Specifically, only where the value of a monitored resource exceeds a threshold, an indication can be generated for the benefit of a systems administrator. In this way, the performance monitor can detect a state change in the application so as to predict an impending failure of the application or the host platform.","In the prototypical performance monitor, resource data collected in the course of monitoring the performance of an application can be collected over regular intervals, referred to in the art as cycles. Specifically, a single crossing of a threshold, or a single failure to reach a required threshold can be anomalous in nature and may not necessarily indicate an impending failure. Thus, it can be important to collect metrics for a monitored resource through course of several cycles. Where a monitored resource exceeds a threshold value, or fails to reach a threshold value multiple times over several cycles, only then can a state change be inferred. Of course, the frequency of the cycles, the number of cycles to be included in any measurement, and the threshold values can be adjusted to accurately predict an impending failure.","Nevertheless, improperly setting the parameters of a performance monitoring application can defeat the operation of the performance monitoring application itself. For instance, where the frequency of the cycles is set too high, multiple threshold crossings can be shielded from view. Conversely, where the frequency of cycles is set too low, the monitoring application can become intrusive in that the monitoring application itself can consume too many host resources. Similarly, where the threshold has been set too low, a false indication of failure can result and where the threshold has been set too high, an impending failure can go undetected.","Network administrators periodically adjust the monitoring parameters of a performance monitoring application to account for the present state of the host system. Where the network administrator deems the host system to be in a precarious state, the threshold values can be set lower and the frequency of the cycles can be set to a higher value. Conversely, where the host system seems to be operating in a reliable state, threshold values can be set higher and the frequency of the cycles can be set to a lower value. In both cases, however, the adjustment of the monitoring parameters relates only to the state of operation of a single, monitored application. Consequently, the adjustment of the monitoring parameters fails to account for the state of applications related to the monitored application. Yet, in many cases, the state of health of one application can impact the operation and performance of a dependent application.","The present invention addresses the deficiencies of the art in respect to performance monitoring and provides a novel and non-obvious method, system and apparatus for adjustable monitoring in a relational environment. The system can include a registry of related applications, at least two performance monitors communicatively linked to one another and coupled to respective related applications listed in the registry, and a set of adjustable monitoring parameters for each of the performance monitors. The system further can include a policy engine coupled to at least one of the performance monitors and configured to process a policy for defining an adjustment of a corresponding set of the adjustable monitoring parameters based upon an indication received from a communicatively linked one of the performance monitors.","A method for adjusted monitoring in a relational environment can include measuring resource values in a coupled application, detecting an indication arising from the measurement, locating an application related to the coupled application, and, transmitting a notification of the indication to a performance monitor coupled to the related application. The method further can include receiving a notification of an indication from another performance monitor, and processing the received notification in association with the coupled application. The locating step can include the step of querying a registry of related applications. Finally, the method can include adjusting performance monitor parameters responsive to the detection.","Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","The present invention is a system, method and apparatus for adjusted monitoring in a relational environment. In accordance with the present invention, a monitor configured to monitor a primary application in the relational environment can further engage in a communicative link to a registry of relationships between applications in a relational environment. The registry can include dependency information such that the performance of a dependent application can rely upon the performance of the primary application and so forth. In particular, a table can be maintained which can specify dependency relationships between different monitored applications in the environment.","When the monitor for the primary application detects an incident in the primary application, not only can the incident be processed conventionally in respect to the primary application by notifying a system administrator and possibly adjusting the monitoring parameters of the monitor to reflect the state change in the primary application, but also the monitor can notify a companion monitor for the dependent application that an incident has occurred in the primary application. Based upon the notification, the companion monitor can adjust its respective monitoring parameters to account for the state change in the primary application. In this way, the companion monitor can benefit from the knowledge acquired by the monitor for the primary application.","In more specific illustration,  is schematic illustration of a system for adjusted monitoring in a relational environment. The system can include two or more related applications ,  co-existing in a computing environment. Each of the related applications ,  can include any computing process executing within a host session such as a virtual machine, or within the process address space of a host operating system. Each of the related applications ,  can be disposed together in the same host session, or across multiple host sessions wherein the related applications ,  can be communicatively coupled to one another through a data communications network (not shown). Notably, either or both of the related applications ,  can be dependent upon one another, for instance in the circumstance where the application  is a Web server dependent upon a message queue representatively embodied in the application .","Each of the applications ,  can be monitored for performance through the operation of respective performance monitors ,  according to respectively configured monitoring parameters , . Each of the performance monitors ,  can enjoy a communicative coupling to the respective applications , . In this regard, the communicative coupling can include a direct coupling by way of an application programming interface or a direct vector into the event loop of the respective applications , , or an indirect coupling through coordinated communications such as through a connection-oriented protocol.","Optionally, the communicative coupling can be loose in nature by way of a subscribe\/publish paradigm. In any event, the skilled artisan will recognize that the manner in which the monitors ,  can be communicatively coupled to the applications ,  does not affect the spirit or scope of the invention. Rather, any communicative coupling can suffice so long as the monitors ,  can collect performance metrics from the applications ,  to detect the occurrence of incidents which are of note and which can indicate an important state change with the respective applications , .","Notably, each of the monitors ,  can be coupled to a relationship registry . The relationship registry can be a data store configured to store relationship information between the applications ,  in the host environment. The relationship registry  can range from a simple correlation between one or more applications, to a specific accounting of the nature of the relationship such as which application is dependent upon the other, the location of the respective applications, known performance issues, and the like. Preferably, each of the monitors ,  can access the relationship registry  both to discover applications which relate to the respective monitored applications , , and also to identify monitors associated with the related applications.","In operation, and for exemplary purposes only, the monitor  coupled to the application  can adjust its monitoring parameters  to a default state for the nominal operation of the application . Through the course of monitoring the performance of the application , the measurement of one or more resource properties which either exceed a limiting threshold, or fail to reach a prerequisite threshold can trigger an event or incident indicating a change of state in the application . More particularly, the occurrence of the event or incident can indicate to the monitor  that a failure condition may already have occurred or might be more likely to occur given the state of the application .","Responsive to the detection of the incident, the monitor  can perform any number of optional, albeit conventional steps known in the art of performance monitoring, including notifying a system administrator, and adjusting the monitoring parameters  to a more sensitive state. Uniquely, however, the monitor  further can consult the registry  to identify those other applications which relate to the application . Specifically, noting the dependent relationship between the application  and the application , the monitor  can forward a notification  to the monitor  indicating that an incident has been detected in the application . The notification  can simply identify the occurrence of the incident, or the notification  can provide a detailed accounting of the incident.","In any case, based upon the notification , the monitor  can undertake remedial action in respect to the dependent application , such as tuning the monitoring parameters  to a more sensitive state. By tuning the monitoring parameters  to a more sensitive state, the monitor  can better detect a change of state in the dependent application  which might occur given the state change in the application . Importantly, despite the consumption of additional processing resources to achieve a more sensitive state, the consumption can be justified given the higher likelihood of a state change in the application .","To better illustrate the monitoring process of the present invention,  is a flow chart illustrating a reduced process for cooperatively monitoring an application in the system of . Beginning in block , the monitor can be loaded for a respective application, and the monitor can be configured for operation in accordance with specified monitoring parameters. In block , a communicative coupling to a registry of relationships between applications in the computing environment and relationships with other applications can be noted. Specifically, it can be determined whether the application enjoys a relationship, whether dependent or otherwise, with other applications in the computing environment.","Optionally, the process of identifying relationships can be automated such that the monitor can probe the application for particular configuration elements. Specifically, in block  the monitor can probe the application to infer relationships with other applications such as the dependence upon co-existing application resources. Upon discovering a relationship, the relationship data can be written to the registry in block . Whether performed manually or automatically, in block , the process can repeat until no relationships remain to be recorded in the registry.","In block , the monitor can be placed in a performance monitoring mode. In this regard, the monitor can measure resource values for resources within the application through the course of repetitive monitoring cycles. For each cycle, the resource values for each monitored resource can be compared to one or more respective pre-configured thresholds. When a specified number of measured values exceeds the established threshold (or where a number of measured values fails to meet a required threshold), an indication can be generated. In decision block , where an indication has been generated, in block  the registry can be queried for related resources. Subsequently, in block  the monitor can notify the companion monitors of the respective related resources that an indication has been detected in the monitored application.","Upon receiving a notification from a monitor coupled to a related resource, each companion monitor can respond to the notification by adjusting its monitoring configuration, or by generating a notification for the benefit of a systems administrator. As an example,  is a flow chart illustrating a process for adjusted monitoring responsive to the cooperative monitoring of . Beginning in block , the companion monitor can receive a notification from a monitor coupled to a related application. The notification can indicate a state change in the related application which can range from an alarm that a fault condition has been detected, to a clearing event that a normative state of the related application has been restored.","In decision block , where an alert has been received, in block  the sensitivity of the performance monitor can be increased. In this regard, it can be presumed that if a fault condition has arisen in an application upon which the monitored application depends, a higher likelihood now exists that a fault condition will arise in the monitored application. Conversely, in decision block , where a clearing event has been received, in block  the sensitivity of the performance monitor can be decreased. Again, in this circumstance it can be presumed that because the related application has reached a normative state, the probability that a fault condition will arise in the monitored application will decrease. In either case, in block , the monitor can return to its monitoring mode.","Importantly, the process illustrated through  are by no means considered to represent the exclusive embodiment of the present invention. Rather, each performance monitor can be configured to react in any number of ways to an indication so long as one or monitors coupled to related applications can be notified of the indication. While it can be advantageous to autonomically adjust the monitoring parameters to account for detected indications, in a basic embodiment, only a notification can be forwarded to a systems administrator. In contrast, in a more complex implementation, not only can an adjustment of the monitoring parameters be undertaken responsive to the receipt of an indication, but also the nature and the extent of the adjustment can be governed by policy terms dictated within a monitoring policy.","The present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. An implementation of the method and system of the present invention can be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system, or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems. Any kind of computer system, or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein, is suited to perform the functions described herein.","A typical combination of hardware and software could be a general purpose computer system with a computer program that, when being loaded and executed, controls the computer system such that it carries out the methods described herein. The present invention can also be embedded in a computer program product, which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein, and which, when loaded in a computer system is able to carry out these methods.","Computer program or application in the present context means any expression, in any language, code or notation, of a set of instructions intended to cause a system having an information processing capability to perform a particular function either directly or after either or both of the following a) conversion to another language, code or notation; b) reproduction in a different material form.
