{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to electronic program guides and, more particularly, to broadcasting electronic program guide templates.","Electronic program guides (EPGs) provide consumers with a means of identifying services and events available through a television transport stream. EPGs may be embedded as applications in a DTV (digital television) receiver. These embedded EPGs are commonly tailored to the needs of the receiver manufacturer or, in the case of a cable system, the needs of the cable operator.","An alternative to embedded EPGs is to broadcast or insert a template that configures an EPG within the bandwidth of DTV channels. This strategy permits the broadcaster to tailor the EPG template to their needs, whether that be through branding, emphasizing their own content, or enhancing their revenue stream through advertising or additional data services.","With today's receivers, consumers may explore available programming through an embedded EPG. This embedded EPG rarely emphasizes the branding of one broadcaster over another, preferring to emphasize the manufacturer's branding over that of the current channel's broadcaster. With the broadcast EPG of the future, broadcasters will no longer have to relinquish control of how their branding and programming are delivered to the consumer. In addition, broadcasters will be able to emphasize current programming, what's on next, as well as big ticket events of the future. Additional revenue opportunities will be available to broadcasters using broadcast EPGs through the use of user-interactive links such as advertising, links to additional content, impulse purchase items, etc. Additionally, DTV receivers of the future will be able to download and execute applications delivered through the DTV transport stream.","What is needed is a system, method and software for providing additional electronic program guide information. The system should provide a customizable electronic program guide template capable of being inserted into a television transport stream. The electronic program guide template should be further enabled to call and execute applications, as well as provide an interface with which the user can interact.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a system for providing additional electronic program guide information comprising at least one template maintaining one or more instructions capable of configuring an electronic program guide.","The present invention also provides a method comprising maintaining at least one template having one or more instructions capable of configuring an electronic program guide and inserting the template into at least one information stream.","The present invention further provides a computer readable medium tangibly embodying a program of instructions for providing additional electronic program guide information, the program of instructions implementing at least one template comprising one or more instructions capable of configuring an electronic program guide.","It is an object of the present invention to enable broadcasters to utilize non-hardware specific electronic program guides.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a means of inserting local programming and data into a viewer's electronic program guide.","The present invention provides the advantage of reducing the signal bandwidth required for transmitting and receiving information for electronic program guides.","A further advantage of the present invention is to provide broadcast station customized electronic program guides without requiring event and service information.","Another advantage of the present invention is accessing, receiving, and executing applications using electronic program guides.","A further advantage of the present invention is that broadcasters will be able to control how programs are presented to consumers and can emphasize current programming, future programming and future premier events.","Another advantage of the present invention is the ability to provide user interactive links such as advertising, and links to additional content (i.e., biographies, filmographies, digital versatile disk content, etc.) within electronic program guides for generating additional revenue opportunities.","A further advantage of the present invention is that broadcast electronic program guides may be used as the primary means for broadcasters to manage consumers' viewing by providing a means for stations to brand programming, emphasize current and future events, insert revenue-enhancing local advertising, and provide links to other content.","Another advantage the present invention provides is the ability to access electronic program guide data and graphical user interface assets independent of the received electronic program guide template.","Another advantage of the present invention is the ability to provide periodically changing user interface assets displayed within an electronic program guide.","The present invention also provides the advantage of providing a means for a local station to emphasize their brand and content.","The present invention also provides the advantage of providing a means for local stations to enhance their revenue streams through advertising and other promotional insertions.","The present invention further provides the advantage of allowing electronic program guides to be broadcast independent of graphical user interface assets.","The present invention also provides the advantage of allowing the selection of elements for broadcast to be done manually or automatically based upon various decision criteria.","In the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration, specific preferred embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and that logical, mechanical and\/or electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","A representative hardware environment for practicing the present invention is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of an information handling system  in accordance with the present invention, having a central processing unit (CPU) , such as a conventional microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via at least one system bus . Information handling system  may be, for example, a portable or desktop Gateway computer or a Gateway Destination system (Gateway and Destination are trademarks of Gateway, Inc.). Information handling system  shown in  includes random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , an input\/output (I\/O) adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as a disk unit  and a tape drive  to system bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone  (and\/or other user interface devices to system bus ), a communications adapter  for connecting information handling system  to an information network such as the Internet, and a display adapter  for connecting system bus  to a display device such as a monitor . The mouse  typically has a first button and a second button,  and  respectively, and is used to control a cursor (not shown) displayed on the monitor .","Referring next to , a home entertainment or convergence system, such as the Gateway Destination System mentioned above, is shown generally at . Reference numerals or letters in  which are like, similar, or identical to the reference numerals or letters of  indicate like, similar, or identical components or features. External to convergence system , is satellite , which in one preferred embodiment is an HS601 model, operated by Hughes at a 101 degree west longitude geosynchronous orbital location, transmits signals comprising 150 channels of modulated digital video, audio, and data at a frequency of about 12 GHz. The satellite signals are received by home entertainment system  through antenna  containing a low noise block converter amplifier. Antenna  is preferably about 18 inches in diameter and receives left and right hand circularly polarized signals between 12.2 and 12.7 GHz. Antenna  provides a \u201cdownconverted-spectrum\u201d signal between 950 and 1450 MHz via a coaxial cable or other suitable communication medium  to information handling system , such as a personal computer or other system or circuitry capable of processing data. Suitable antennas  are already being manufactured and sold by RCA Corporation via direct sales and through numerous major retail chains such as Radio Shack.","System  contains circuitry and software to further process signals from the antenna, generally demodulating and decoding the signal to produce a VGA (video graphics adapter) signal. The VGA signal is provided via a standard VGA compatible monitor cable to drive a large screen data quality monitor  which is suitable for viewing in a family room or entertainment room environment. System  provides for user input by means of remote controls  and . Remote control  comprises a handheld size device with standard television controls and a numeric keypad, and in one embodiment, VCR (video cassette recorder) controls and a pointing device. It provides RF (radio frequency) or IR (infrared) control signals received by system . Remote control  is a full function personal computer keyboard with additional standard television and VCR controls, a pointing device which is preferably in the form of a touchpad, and it also provides RF control signals to system . RF control signals were selected over IR control signals or hardwired connections in one embodiment due to its benefits in a home entertainment environment. RF control allows the system to be in a different room from monitor , or if in the same room, a clear line of sight is not required. In another embodiment, IR control signals were selected because the standard circuitry is available at a low cost. Monitor cable  is a standard type cable typically used on VGA display devices, and comprises up to fifteen electrical conductors, interfacing with monitor  in a D-series shell connector. In one embodiment, full multi-media sourcing and destinationing of audio\/video\/data (A\/V\/D) broadcast is provided for.","Information handling system  may include a tuner , tuner circuitry, or card capable of both tuning to multiple channels and receiving television information or signals in the form of the NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) or PAL (Phase Alteration Line) forms, from any medium such as from a cable system or from a digital satellite system. One embodiment of the signal on cable  from satellite dish  provides digital A\/V\/D signals from such sources as DirecTV or Primestar (DirecTV and Primestar are trademarks of their respective companies). In another such embodiment, the signal on cable  provides analog A\/V such as NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) antenna signals. In another such embodiment, the signal on cable  from camera  provides analog A\/V such as NTSC audio\/video signals. In further embodiments, the signal on cable  from cable-data source  provides analog and\/or digital A\/V\/D. In further such embodiments, the signal on cable , from PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) , provides data or phone signals such as ISDN (integrated services digital network) or POTS (plain old telephone system) signals. In one set of such embodiments, system  is programmed to automatically record analog signals, such as television programming, onto recordable media, such as a video tape in VCR  coupled to cable . In another such set of embodiments, system  is programmed to automatically record digital signals, such as digital television programming or CD-ROM (Compact Disk\u2014Read Only Memory) type audio, onto recordable media, such as recordable compact disks, in CD jukebox  coupled to cable . CD jukebox  also plays CDs or CD-ROMs for use elsewhere. In another such embodiment, signals are sent to stereo surround sound system  for audio output to one or more speakers , and on cable  to TV . In one such embodiment, earphones  on cable  and gamepad  on cable  provide additional input\/output through remote control . Home network  is \u201csmart wiring\u201d used to transmit data and control within the home, coupled by cable  to system . Videoblaster  provides video signal processing on cable\/connector . Cables , , , , , , , , , and  are examples of cables that may be wired coupling or wireless, such as RF or IR.","One example of convergence system  is the Destination System using the DestiVu user interface manufactured and sold by Gateway, Inc. In this manner, convergence system  is a fully functional computer integrated with a television, providing TV viewing (via broadcast, cable, satellite, VCR, digital disk, or other broadcast media) and personal computing functionality. This convergence of computer and television enables a user the combined access to both television programs and information, as well as computer related functionality such as computer information and programs, and Internet access.","Although many of today's televisions employ much of the same hardware resources employed by computers, such as information handling system , it is possible that the present invention might be practiced in other electronic devices or in networked electronic devices. For example, with the development of audio\/video networking, such as the recently proposed HAVi standard, television sets or other audio\/video devices such as audio\/video receivers and VCRs that do not themselves contain certain resources, could implement the present invention by utilizing the resources of other devices on a network.","Referring next to , a detail of an operating system's graphical user interface, or GUI, as is typically displayed on monitor  in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. Reference numerals or letters in  which are like, similar, or identical to the reference numerals or letters of  indicate like, similar, or identical components or features. The operating system shown in  is IBM's OS\/2 (OS\/2 is a trademark of International Business Machines Corporation). However, the present invention will work with DestiVu, Windows 98, Windows 95 (DestiVu is a trademark of Gateway, Inc. and Windows 98 and Windows 95 are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation), or any other graphical user interface. This GUI includes cursor , desktop , three icons , a first and a second window,  and  respectively, and a dialog box , all of which are well known in the art. Dialog box  further contains a first button and a second button,  and  respectively. Programs are represented by the graphical user interface as either icons  or windows  and . The horizontal region along the top of the windows are a first title bar and a second title bar,  and  respectively. A program window  or  has the \u201cfocus\u201d when it has been designated by a user or by an operating system to receive input from keyboard  or mouse . In OS\/2, the user gives the window focus by clicking a mouse button,  or , when cursor  is inside that window. Some operating systems, however, give a window the focus merely whenever cursor  is present within that window. The operating system typically indicates which program has the focus by changing the color of the focused window's title bar  or .","The present invention, in a preferred embodiment, is implemented as a program of instructions and therefore the following detailed description illustrates this implementation. It is understood that many different modules and many different sequences of code can be implemented to achieve the functions detailed herein, as well as the possibility of and\/or for generating hardware specific coding, allowing for the optimization of specific hardware resources. With this in mind, the following detailed description avoids discussing any specific modules or sequences of code and relies only on detailing the functions by which the present invention, in a preferred embodiment, may be practiced.","Before discussing the present invention's template insertion methods, it is first necessary to discuss the background and inner workings of a broadcast template for configuring an electronic program guide (EPG). With today's receivers, consumers may explore available programming through an embedded EPG where the embedded EPG seldom emphasizes one broadcaster over another, preferring to emphasize the manufacturer's or provider's brand over that of the current channel's broadcaster. In a preferred embodiment, however, a DTV receiver downloads and executes applications delivered through a broadcast signal for broadcast stations. Through the utilization of broadcast templates for EPGs, broadcasters no longer have to relinquish control of how EPGs present program information to consumers. The present invention enables broadcasters to emphasize current programming, what program airs next, and big ticket events in the future. Further, broadcasters can also place advertising within their guide and links to additional content (biographies, filmographies, and other content similar to that in DVD titles). These user-interactive links can generate additional revenue opportunities in terms of advertising and impulse purchases.","In a preferred embodiment, broadcast templates may contain presentation information to identify a broadcaster's name and network affiliation, local advertising, and links to additional content. Application Program Interface (API) calls are placed in the EPG template for accessing event information at run-time on the DTV receiver. When the EPG template application is called and executed on the DTV receiver, it makes the appropriate function calls on the DTV receiver, accessing the receiver's PSIP (Program and System Information Protocol) information to be added to the EPG template. Similar to an embedded EPG, the broadcast EPG templates may be interactive. Through the ATSC-defined APIs, the user is able to perform such EPG functions as selecting programs for viewing, recording programs, etc.","The broadcast EPG template is the primary means for station broadcasters to manage their consumers' viewing through the branding of their EPG template and information accessed within. Such branding may include emphasizing current and future events, inserting revenue-enhancing local advertising, and providing links to other content. The broadcast EPG template also provides access to return channels within DTV receivers providing access to transaction based services, enhancing the revenue of the broadcaster, and possibly the broadcast EPG template developer. As return channels in DTV receivers proliferate, return channels accessed by broadcast EPG templates may serve as a navigator to local advertisers and pay services.","In a preferred embodiment, the system, such as convergence system  of , receives signals comprising at least one template comprising one or more instructions for configuring an EPG. The template information is multiplexed in a digital TV signal. Due to the voluminous nature of EPG data and the potential redundancy of downloaded data, the broadcast template and associated information excludes EPG data, but may contain graphical user interface assets like bitmaps, audio, etc. The template and associated information are encoded within a broadcast signal. They are likely to be in the form of a declarative language that is processed by a data driven software application. They may also be procedural programs that access the receiver's Application Program Interfaces (APIs). In other embodiments, information for the templates (i.e., asset, user interface, tuning information, program information, etc.) may be separately accessed by the receiver to obtain the desired information. This information may be obtained in a plurality of ways, such as tuning in to the appropriate station frequencies or in other embodiments, periodically tuning in to the network frequencies to access and store the information in a database, where, upon request, the data may be accessed by the template for viewing by the user. Therefore, broadcast EPG templates possess all the characteristics of current electronic program guides, thus allowing users to access programs or events, schedule recordings, schedule reminders, etc. For example, upon a user selecting an event from an EPG created using a broadcast EPG template, the EPG queries service information from the service information APIs and subsequently accesses the appropriate tuning APIs for the user to view the selected events.","Referring now to , a block diagram of an electronic program guide system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. System \/ contains a receiver configured to receive a DTV broadcast signal. The DTV broadcast signal is fed through a series of down converters and demodulators and supplied to an ATSC compliant HDTV transport decoder and demultiplexer. The signal is then sent to MPEG-2 demultiplexer module  to extract the data elementary streams that contain audio, video, and other data elementary content. The data elementary streams may contain information related to one or more APIs.","After extraction, the data elementary streams are then transported to broadcast data manager module . An application received by the system via a broadcast signal is capable of calling a function, or an application programming interface (API) as represented by an application execution APIs module . In other words, the application execution APIs module  is capable of running the application received via the broadcast signal. If the broadcasted application is not executed, or run, immediately, then the application may be stored in application storage module . Furthermore, as shown and discussed with reference to  below, if the application has persistent data, such as an electronic program guide database  or a service and tuning data database , the application may also be stored in the application storage module .","Tuning APIs module  contains the extracted data elementary stream content related to enabling the receiver to tune to various station and program broadcast frequencies. Service information APIs module  is used in conjunction with tuning APIs module  to present available station programming upon request. Service information APIs module  contains information for the various networks, or broadcast stations, and services received by system \/ such as ABC, CBS, CNN, Pay-Per-View Information, Broadcast Internet information, URLs, etc., and program information associated with the available stations and services. Presentation APIs module  contains user interface information and\/or assets such as graphics, audio, etc., for creating a user interface to be displayed within the EPG. The user interface information and\/or assets can each be uniquely configured with respect to each broadcast station. Application module  contains at least one EPG application for displaying an EPG that accesses a plurality of resources to create the EPG. One such resource is graphical user interface assets module . Graphical user interface assets module  contains additional information for each of the networks or broadcast stations such as graphics, station advertisements, banners, pay-per-view information, and other value-added information. Upon execution, application module  displays a graphical user interface comprising a combination of graphical user interface assets obtained from graphical user interface module , presentation information from presentation API , as well as rendered text extracted from service information APIs module .","Event handling software module  is used to handle events, wherein the term \u201cevent\u201d is meant to refer to things that occur when a user performs an action (such as making a selection with a mouse or remote control), or when external events occur (such as when the time changes from 8:59 pm to 9:00 pm), or when scheduled \u201cevents\u201d occur (such as when a television program begins). Tuning and service information are delivered through service information APIs module  and tuning APIs module  to provide the user with the most current event information available for a selected event.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a receiver  according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown. Receiver  is configured to receive a propagated signal comprising information associated with an EPG. Receiver  is also capable of modifying the received information such that received information can be used with an electronic program guide native to receiver  or with an EPG configured by a broadcast template received by receiver .","Receiver  can be included with system \/ and configured to receive a DTV broadcast signal. Receiver  includes a DTV receiver input  for receiving the DTV broadcast signal. DTV receiver input  is configured to receive and demodulate MPEG-2 transport streams by sending the MPEG-2 transport streams to an MPEG-2 transport demultiplexer and decoder . MPEG-2 transport demultiplexer and decoder  splits the DTV broadcast signal into its audio, video, and data components. If one of the data components is an application, that data component is transferred to application execution engine . If the data component is service and tuning information, that data component is transferred to service and tuning data  module. If the data component is EPG information such as event information, graphics, etc., that data component is transferred to electronic program guide database . In a preferred embodiment, the various data components are stored separately within receiver . The data components stored in EPG database  and service and tuning data module  is made available to any native electronic program guide  resident on receiver . Broadcast EPG , received with the DTV broadcast signal by receiver , is configured to access the information within EPG database . In one embodiment of the present invention, broadcast EPG  is capable of modifying the information in EPG database  and service and tuning module  before its utilization in native EPG . Additionally, any application, whether broadcast or native to receiver , can access the information stored within EPG database . Broadcast EPG  and native EPG  utilize tuning service  and information stored within service and tuning data module  to enable receiver  to tune to selected events.","In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, Receiver  further comprises EPG database  for storing EPG information. Receiver  comprises DTV Receiver Input  configured to receive a broadcast EPG for selectively modifying the EPG information stored within EPG database . Receiver  is configured to receive and store broadcast EPG information. Broadcast EPG  is received by Receiver  and configured to access information stored within EPG database .","In one embodiment of the present invention, EPG information comprises private EPG information. Private EPG information is information intended for use by select EPGs. Private event information can include many types of information such as elaborate event descriptions, local affiliate information, user selectable information, etc. For example, suppose NBC broadcasted EPG assets they did not want other broadcast EPGs, such as ABC, CBS, etc., to have access to. Private event information can be stored within system \/ to ensure that accurate, up-to-date information is available to the select EPGs.","To begin detailing the present invention's methods for inserting the above detailed templates for configuring an EPG into an information stream, it is first necessary to discuss how the information stream is received. Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating the means by which local affiliate stations receive national programming feeds is shown according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Local affiliate stations typically receive the national programming feed via Ku-Band satellite transmissions . Through a series of down converters  and signal demodulators , the national programming feed is supplied to an ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) compliant HDTV (High Definition Television) transport stream decoder and de-multiplexer . The transport stream decoder and de-multiplexer  splits the demodulated national programming feed into its elementary audio , video , and information  streams. This break down permits local affiliates to exchange nationally originated material with locally originated material.","With the information stream  separated from the TV broadcast, a local affiliate can now swap nationally originated material with locally originated material before recombining the streams and re-broadcasting the DTV signal. Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating a method and typical hardware components for inserting local programming and local information into an information stream is shown. As mentioned above, the transport stream decoder and de-multiplexer  splits the demodulated national feed into its real time audio , video , and information  streams. Local program insertion unit  is configured to replace nationally originated audio  and video  elementary streams with locally originated audio  and video  elementary streams. In a preferred embodiment, PSIP (Program and System Information Protocol) information  can also be modified by local program insertion unit . It is to be understood that the SI (System Information) protocol promulgated by DVB, as an alternative to the ATSC's PSIP approach, may be utilized. The locally originated audio  and video  elementary streams may be encoded from NTSC sources or locally originated HDTV sources, such as in-station studios. A data carousel server  allows the local station to introduce locally originated information or data services . The resulting audio , video , and information  streams are then fed to an ATSC compliant transport encoder and multiplexer .","One type of information service  that can be added to the transport system is a broadcast template for configuring an electronic program guide (EPG). An EPG configured by a broadcast template is different from a typical EPG embedded in a receiver in that it can be readily branded by a local affiliate and can include other content specific to the local affiliate such as local advertising and local data service options. This broadcast template will be fed to data carousel server  by broadcast EPG server . Broadcast EPG server  can be a system like information handling system  or a similarly enabled device.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating the inner workings of broadcast EPG server  implementing a method for inserting a broadcast template for configuring an EPG into an information stream is shown. Broadcast EPG server  provides a broadcast template to data carousel server . Information stream  from local program insertion unit , or information stream  from transport decoder and de-multiplexer  if there is no local program insertion unit , is fed to PSIP filter software . PSIP filter software  extracts the real time PSIP information from the remaining system information and data services. The filtered PSIP  is provided to an EPG database encoder . EPG database encoder  translates and stores PSIP information  into database , most likely a relational database. PSIP software  also extracts the clock signal  from information stream  and sends this clock signal  to EPG generator  and EPG insertion component .","At periodic intervals, clock signal  triggers EPG generator  to format a new electronic program guide for insertion. The EPG is formatted using the above described templates available in EPG template library database  in conjunction with or based upon components of the encoded PSIP information in EPG database . The templates contain logic and declarations that enable the formatting of the EPG's presentation using information in EPG database . EPG generator  also allows for the insertion of advertising and other non-EPG content, such as GUI assets indicative of a network's local affiliate, local advertisements, etc., into the broadcast template. This content is made available by GUI asset library  and formatted according to the current template. EPG generator  either stores the template in cache  for later insertion into data carousel server , or it sends it directly to EPG template insertion unit .","At periodic intervals, clock signal  triggers EPG insertion unit  to add or replace the template in data carousel server  and to subsequently insert the template into the broadcast information stream. EPG insertion unit  can also be configured to insert local assets, such as advertisements or GUI assets, into data carousel server  for broadcast. This additional insertion can be performed in conjunction with, or independent of, the template's insertion into data carousel server  or into the information stream. EPG authoring workstation  is included to allow local affiliates to manually create templates for broadcasting instead of relying on clock signal  to correlate program or service information, etc., and EPG database  to automatically create templates. The above detailed description references several methods of automating the template related functions herein. As anticipated by the present invention, the methods of automation are numerous and automation itself is optional.","Accordingly, the present invention comprises a method, system, signal, receiver and software for receiving templates, as well as broadcast electronic program guides and electronic program guide information for configuring an Electronic Program Guide (EPG). A broadcast signal is received by a system where the signal contains information for the template and wherein the template is registered with the receiver upon being received. The information accessible by the template includes programs, service, event, tuning, user interface, application, interactive, and user preference information contained within the received signal. Application Program Interfaces (APIs) are used to provide the above information and to further provide information for displaying and configuring EPGs and user interfaces contained therein. APIs contained within the system consist of application execution APIs, tuning APIs, program and service information APIs, and user interface APIs. Event handler software is used to access event information contained within the APIs and may further be used to access program information, schedule recordings, schedule reminders, etc. The template further comprises desired station information, user interface assets, and event information that may change periodically throughout the day. Also accessible by the template is user interactive data allowing users to access additional event information and return channels for Internet access. The template may also include user preference information such as favorite programs, networks, web addresses, etc.","Additionally, the present invention provides for automatic generation of templates for configuring EPGs for insertion into a broadcast information stream. A nationally broadcast television signal is filtered to allow for local affiliate information, video, and audio insertion. The remaining information is sent to an EPG database encoder and then to an EPG database for later use. In the automated version of the present invention, a signal of some sort, such as a clock signal received with the national feed, is utilized to draw this information from the EPG database into an EPG generator. The EPG generator uses this information, a template from an EPG template library database along with assets from a GUI asset database to generate a local affiliate specific template for broadcast. This template is then sent to the user immediately or as a result of some automating signal. The present invention also provides a workstation, drawing on the same resources, allowing for the manual generation of local affiliate specific templates for broadcast.","Although an embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described in detail herein, along with certain variants thereof, many other varied embodiments that incorporate the teachings of the invention may be easily constructed by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the specific form set forth herein, but on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, as can be reasonably included within the spirit and scope of the invention.","Although the invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it should be recognized that elements thereof may be altered by persons skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. One of the preferred implementations of the invention is as sets of instructions resident in the random access memory  of one or more computer or information handling systems configured generally as described in . Until required by the computer system, the set of instructions may be stored in another computer readable memory; for example, in a hard disk drive, or in a removable memory such as an optical disk for eventual use in a CD-ROM drive, or a floppy disk for eventual use in a floppy disk drive. Further, the set of instructions can be stored in the memory of another computer or encoded or embodied in a signal, such as an analog or digital signal, embodied in a propagation medium and transmitted over the propagation medium by a user.
