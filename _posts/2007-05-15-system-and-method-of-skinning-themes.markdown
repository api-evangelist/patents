More specifically, in order to satisfy both requirements of reacting to user input and graphically reflecting the application status, a mechanism for implementing a contract between an SVG template document and application code  is developed. In one embodiment the application  is responsible for handling user input and the media engine is responsible for defining and displaying the graphical interface . To graphically reflect the application status, the application code  defines a set of \u201cdata elements\u201d and \u201ccustom events\u201d that represent specific data and events that are generated by the application . A data element  is some information that the application  manipulates or modifies and can be presented on the graphical interface . A data element  is assigned a name which is a string. A custom event is some event of significance that occurs in the application's business logic which may need to be reflected in the graphical user interface . Similar to data elements , custom events are assigned a name which is a string. It is not the responsibility of the application  to define what user interface changes occur as a result of these events, or how to display the information of data elements . The application's responsibility is to inform the media engine whenever it needs to update the information associated data elements  and when custom events occur.","In one embodiment the template file defines the custom events and data elements that are displayed in the graphical interface. The application code  determines what application data elements  or custom events (which may include user input events) to bind to the data elements and events defined in the graphical interface.","A skinning themes document is written for an application  using the names of the data elements  and the names of the custom events. The skinning theme document, or template file, describes how to display the information associated with the data elements  and custom events.","The media engine acts as an interface between the application  and the graphical interface template file. The application  notifies the media engine of updates to data elements  and the occurrence of custom events. The media engine uses the skin template file to define how to display this information on the display . Using the skin document as a template, the media engine , or more particularly the renderer  of the media engine , renders the graphical interface  to the display .","The media engine uses the template file for describing how to render a graphical interface . The media engine may use a parser  to parse the template information form the template file and store it in a template  that is accessible to the media engine . If the template file describes the graphical interface  using a markup language, then the parser  would be able to read the markup language and store the template information in the template . For example, if the template file defines the graphical interface  in SVG, then an SVG parser would read the template information in the SVG file and store the parsed information in a template . The parser may be referred to as a transcoder since it translates the template file code into code representing the template . The template  holds the template information in a form expected by the media engine and the renderer . As previously described, the template  is not required. It is possible for the parser  to provide the template information directly to the media engine or the renderer .","The media engine described above is not involved in the processing of user input. It receives a template file defining a graphical interface , and notifications from an application  regarding data elements  and custom events. In the above example an application  would be responsible for handling user input. This may be accomplished by interacting with functionality provided by an input device driver, with operating system functionality, or other methods as may be known.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":["b ","b","b "],"b":["110","110","118"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":["c ","c","c ","a ","c ","c"],"b":["110","110","110","110","117","117","110","105","117","105","105"]},"An application  may notify the event engine  that it wishes to be informed when ever a user input occurs. This notification can be achieved by an API call to the content interaction APIs of the media engine . The content interaction APIs would include additional calls for providing the user input control to an application . The call should include information the event engine  can use to notify the application . This information can include the application identifier, the function that the event engine  is to call when an event occurs. The call may also indicate the types of user input events the application  is interested in. For instance an application  may only wish to be notified of input from a scroll wheel, or from a keyboard, or pointing device, etc. When ever a user input event occurs the event engine  checks to see if any applications  are to be notified, and if there are any, it sends a notification of the event.","An application does not necessarily need to notify the event engine  that it wishes to receive notification of input events. Alternatively the application may poll the event engine  to determine if an event has occurred, and if one has to receive it. The application would make a call to a content interaction API querying or requesting an user input event.","As described above an application  in accordance with the present disclosure may obtain user input in various ways. The above description can also apply to not only user input events but also to system events or other generated events. For example an application  may register with the event engine  through the content interaction APIs to receive notification each time the display  is refreshed.","In addition to the event handling described above the event engine  may also act as a controller of the media engine . The event engine  may control the times at which a graphical interface  is refreshed. This can be accomplished through the use of an event engine  timer, that fires an event at a certain frequency. When ever the event fires, the event engine  can access the template , and provide the template information to the renderer  along with the values of data elements  and information regarding the occurrence of events. The renderer  then uses this information to render a graphical interface  to the display .","As described in the above paragraph, the media engine or more particularly the event engine  stores the template information separately from the data element and event information. It may be desirable to store all the information in the template . When a notification of a change to data elements  arrives via the content interaction APIs , the event engine  may store this information in the template . In this manner the renderer  only needs reference to the template  object to render the graphical interface . This can be achieved by in various ways. For example the event engine  may pass a copy of the template  information to the renderer , it may pass a reference to the template  to the renderer . Alternatively the renderer  may be designed to access a template  located in a specific location. The event engine  would be responsible for ensuring that the proper template is located in the location. This method can be used advantageously as the media engine may have numerous templates that the event engine  keeps updated with the application data element information and event information. The event engine  can then be used to switch graphical interfaces  by updating the specific location with the desired template.","The above description has described various calls that can be made to the content interaction APIs , . Below is a listing of possible API calls that the media engine , , should support. It must support at a minimum the update data call. Without this support the application cannot pass information to the media engine , , to display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"int update_data_element(string element_ID, string"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"element_value)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["used to notify the media engine to update the element_ID with the new element_value","returns an int for error purposes, may be other type or no return"]}}}},"int notify_custom_event (string custom_event_ID)\n\n","bool query_new event (string event_filter)\n\n","string get_new_event (string event_filter)\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"bool register_event_listner(string application_ID,"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"string listener_ID, string event_filter)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":["used to register an event listener with the media engine. application_ID is an identifier used to identify the application.

The varying length of the string presents problems when laying out a graphical interface . If the string is too long, it may overlay other parts of the graphical interface . If the text is too short, other elements may not align properly. In the above examples of media engine , , although providing for flexibility of the specification of the graphical interface , no easy way of dynamically handling the size of data elements was described. Either the media engine must make some predetermined decision on how to handle the length of strings, such as truncating all strings that are too long. All though this works well, the layout manager  provides even greater flexibility to the media engines , by providing a way of specifying how to handle the dynamic display of data elements. This allows a graphical interface designer to describe how data elements are to be handled by including layout manager  control information in the template file. As an example the template  and layout manager  may be used to specify that a data element is to be 10 characters long, and that if the data element provided to the media engine is longer than 10 characters, that it should be truncated to 5 characters long, and the string \u2018( . . . )\u2019 appended to the end of the string. As another example, a graphical interface designer may wish to have the characters of a particular data element appear as all upper case characters. This can be specified in the template file. The layout manager would receive the data element string and modify it as determined by the template , in this case changing all of the characters to upper case. This manipulation of the data element is performed by the layout manager . The layout manager may be controlled by including, in the template  or the template file, directions to the layout manager  specifying how the length of a data element should be modified. The renderer  will then display the sting as prepared by the layout manager . The layout manager  allows for the text style of data elements to be specified and dynamically controlled.","As shown schematically in , the layout manager may alter the data elements according to the dynamic layout described in the template and these changes may be stored directly in the template . The renderer  then uses the template  in the same manner as previously described. Alternatively the data elements may be stored in the template  (or separate from the template ) as provided from the application . The layout manager  may alter the data elements as they are provided to the renderer . The layout manager may modify display characteristics of the element such as its placement, size, visibility, etc. In this manner the renderer receives the data elements as string describing the data element as provided by the application , and modified by the layout manager  in such a manner as described in the template .","The layout manager may be used to control the display of elements other than text elements. A layout manager may be used to dynamically control the display characteristics of graphical information as well. A graphical interface designer may wish to display a graphic or image in a certain location only if there is no text that would be covered by its placement. The layout manager  can be used to provide a means of controlling the display of the element. For example if graphical interface  describes that an icon is to be displayed in a location free of text, the icon element can be passed to the layout manager , along with layout manager control information specifying the layout requirements. The layout manager may then dynamically alter the display information of the element in the template  prior to the element being rendered. The layout manager  may alter the coordinates specifying the placement of the icon, or it may determine that there is no space available on the graphical interface , and so the icon should not be displayed. The modified element with the dynamic display characteristics can then be passed to the renderer  for rendering to the graphical interface .","The layout manager  can provide a means of manipulating data elements prior being rendered by the renderer , as well as providing a means of dynamically controlling the display characteristic of elements that the renderer  may not be able to render appropriately. The template  can specify information for controlling the layout manager .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","400","405","407","400","400","103","117","400"]},"The example application  notifies the media engine , , of any changes to the value of a data element ,  using the media engine API call named \u2018update_data_element\u2019.

This is not a requirement of the system, but rather is an easy way to ensure consistency when updating data elements. The string for data_element_ID representing an element in an array of data elements may be constructed by appending the array name with the index number of the particular element.

A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over communication network via antenna . DSP  not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in receiver  and transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in DSP .","Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of handheld device , and therefore handheld device  comprises a memory module , memory module card or a Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM), to be inserted in or connected to an interface  in order to operate in the network. Alternatively, memory module  may be a non-volatile memory that is programmed with configuration data by a service provider so that mobile station  may operate in the network. Since handheld device  is a mobile battery-powered device, it also includes a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . Such a battery  provides electrical power to most if not all electrical circuitry in handheld device , and battery interface  provides for a mechanical and electrical connection for it. The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator that provides power V+ to all of the circuitry.","Handheld device  includes a microprocessor  that controls overall operation of mobile station . Communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through communication subsystem . Microprocessor  also interacts with additional device subsystems such as a display , a flash memory , a random access memory (RAM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , a serial port , a keyboard , a speaker , a microphone , a short-range communications subsystem , and any other device subsystems generally designated at . Some of the subsystems shown perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. Notably, some subsystems, such as keyboard  and display , for example, may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a communication network, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list. Operating system software used by microprocessor  is preferably stored in a persistent store such as flash memory , which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as RAM .","Microprocessor , in addition to its operating system functions, preferably enables execution of software applications on handheld device . A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including at least data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on handheld device  during its manufacture. A preferred application that may be loaded onto handheld device  may be a personal information manager (PIM) application having the ability to organize and manage data items relating to a user such as, but not limited to, e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. Naturally, one or more memory stores are available on handheld device  and memory module  to facilitate storage of PIM data items and other information.","The PIM application preferably has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network. In a preferred embodiment, PIM data items are seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network, with the mobile station user's corresponding data items stored and\/or associated with a host computer system thereby creating a mirrored host computer on handheld device  with respect to such items. This is especially advantageous where the host computer system is the mobile station user's office or enterprise computer system. Additional applications may also be loaded onto handheld device  through network, an auxiliary I\/O subsystem , serial port , short-range communications subsystem , or any other suitable subsystem , and installed by a user in RAM  or preferably a non-volatile store (not shown) for execution by microprocessor . Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of handheld device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using handheld device .","In a data communication mode, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by communication subsystem  and input to microprocessor . Microprocessor  will preferably further process the signal for output to display  or alternatively to auxiliary I\/O device . A user of handheld device  may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using keyboard  in conjunction with display  and possibly auxiliary I\/O device . Keyboard  is preferably a complete alphanumeric keyboard and\/or telephone-type keypad. These composed items may be transmitted over a communication network through communication subsystem .","For voice communications, the overall operation of handheld device  is substantially similar, except that the received signals would be output to speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented. Although voice or audio signal output is preferably accomplished primarily through speaker , display  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information, as some examples.","Serial port  in  is normally implemented in a personal digital assistant (PDA)-type communication device for which synchronization with a user's desktop computer as a desirable, albeit optional, component. Serial port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of handheld device  by providing for information or software downloads to handheld device  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto handheld device  through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","Short-range communications subsystem  is an additional optional component that provides for communication between handheld device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth\u2122 communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices. Bluetooth\u2122 is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.","Handheld device  may be configured such as via software (instructions and data) to provide the home screen integrated presentation of information in a GUI as described above.","The system and methods according to the present patent disclosure may be implemented by any hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software having the above described functions. The software code, either in its entirety or a part thereof, may be stored in a computer-readable memory. Further, a computer data signal representing the software code which may be embedded in a carrier wave may be transmitted via a communication network.
