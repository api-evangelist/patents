title: Network fingerprinting
abstract: A network fingerprinting component for a computerized system issues network identifiers (NID) for computer networks. Identity confidences may be determined for each issued network identifier with respect to current computer networks. Computer network attributes may include passive network attributes and active network attributes. Retrieving values for active network attributes involves generating network traffic. As a result passive network attributes may be available to the network fingerprinting component before active network attributes. Learned identity confidence modifiers may be applied to identity confidences determined independent of active network attributes to achieve more accurate identity confidence sooner. Better learned identity confidence modifiers may be obtained by comparing identity confidences for a particular computer network determined independently of active network attributes with identity confidences for the computer network determined once active network attributes become available and then adjusting the learned identity confidence modifiers so as to minimize any differences.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention-pertains generally to computer networks and, more particularly, to computer network identity.","Modern computers communicate with each other over a variety of computer networks. Mobile computers may utilize several computer networks in a day. Even fixed-location computers may have access to multiple computer networks, for example, to achieve increased reliability through redundancy, to take advantage of cost differentials between computer networks, or for changing communications security requirements.","A computer, a computer operating system, and\/or a communications application may need to change its configuration based upon the computer network or networks to which it is connected. Some conventional methods of differentiating between computer networks are ad hoc or limited to particular network types. In a modern heterogeneous networking environment, this may result in configuration inconsistencies and, ultimately, confusion and frustration for users of computer systems.","Some conventional methods of differentiating between computer networks provide ambiguous results without providing information regarding the level of ambiguity. Such methods may be unsuitable, particularly for security conscious applications. In addition, it may be that access to network services is denied, for example, for security reasons, until the level of ambiguity is sufficiently low. As a result, it is desirable that network disambiguation be fast and efficient.","This section presents a simplified summary of some embodiments of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some embodiments of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In an embodiment of the invention, one or more connections are established to one or more computer networks. A network identifier may be issued for each computer network. An identity confidence may be determined for each issued network identifier with respect to one or more current computer networks.","In an embodiment of the invention, a first set and a second set of identity confidences are determined. Determining the first set of identity confidences includes applying one or more of a set of learned identity confidence modifiers to one or more of the identity confidences of the first set. Determining the second set of identity confidences includes applying one or more of a set of active network attribute identity confidence modifiers to one or more of the identity confidences of the second set. The set of learned identity confidence modifiers may be adjusted so that if the first set of identity confidences were to be re-determined then differences between the re-determined first set of identity confidences and the second set of identity confidences would be minimized.","In an embodiment of the invention, a computerized system includes a network fingerprinting component. The network fingerprinting component may be configured to issue one or more network identifiers for one or more computer networks. The network fingerprinting component may be configured to maintain a set of issued network identifiers. The network fingerprinting component may be further configured to maintain a set of current identity confidences. The set of current identity confidences may include an identity confidence for each issued network identifier with respect to one or more current computer networks.","Prior to proceeding with a description of the various embodiments of the invention, a description of a computer in which the various embodiments of the invention may be practiced is now provided. Although not required, the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, programs include routines, objects, components, data structures and the like that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The term \u201cprogram\u201d as used herein may connote a single program module or multiple program modules acting in concert.

In a distributed computing environment, programs may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Referring to , an example of a basic configuration for the computer  on which aspects of the invention described herein may be implemented is shown. In its most basic configuration, the computer  typically includes at least one processing unit  and memory . The processing unit  executes instructions to carry out tasks in accordance with various embodiments of the invention. In carrying out such tasks, the processing unit  may transmit electronic signals to other parts of the computer  and to devices outside of the computer  to cause some result. Depending on the exact configuration and type of the computer , the memory  may be volatile (such as RAM), non-volatile (such as ROM or flash memory) or some combination of the two. This most basic configuration is illustrated in  by dashed line .","The computer  may also have additional features\/functionality. For example, computer  may also include additional storage (removable  and\/or non-removable ) including, but not limited to, magnetic or optical disks or tape. Computer storage media includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, including computer-executable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory, CD-ROM, digital versatile disk (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to stored the desired information and which can be accessed by the computer . Any such computer storage media may be part of computer .","The computer  preferably also contains communications connections  that allow the device to communicate with other devices such as remote computer(s) . A communication connection is an example of a communication medium. Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media.

All these devices are well known in the art and need not be described at length here.","In the description that follows, the invention will be described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations that are performed by one or more computing devices, unless indicated otherwise. As such, it will be understood that such acts and operations, which are at times referred to as being computer-executed, include the manipulation by the processing unit of the computer of electrical signals representing data in a structured form. This manipulation transforms the data or maintains it at locations in the memory system of the computer, which reconfigures or otherwise alters the operation of the computer in a manner well understood by those skilled in the art. The data structures where data is maintained are physical locations of the memory that have particular properties defined by the format of the data. However, while the invention is being described in the foregoing context, it is not meant to be limiting as those of skill in the art will appreciate that various of the acts and operation described hereinafter may also be implemented in hardware.","An example of a computer networking environment suitable for incorporating aspects of the invention is described with reference to .

Accordingly, the various embodiments of the invention may be practiced on clients, servers, peers or combinations thereof, even though specific examples contained herein may not refer to all of these types of computers.","The computer  is connected to the computer network . An authentication (Auth.) server  is also connected to the computer network . Authentication servers are known in the art, so only some of their features are highlighted here. The authentication server  is a type of computer (typically having an authentication server application or operating system component executing on the computer) that provides authentication services, for example, issuing authentication tokens to computers that successfully authenticate or locally maintaining an authoritative authentication state. A computer network policy, for example a security policy, may require that a computer successfully authenticate before being granted further access to network services and resources such as files, databases, directories, printers and so on. A Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae XP server configured as a domain controller is an example of an authentication server.","The computer network  is connected to the computer network  by a firewall . Firewalls are known in the art, so only some of their features are highlighted here. The firewall  is a type of computer (typically having a firewall application or operating system component executing on the computer) that enforces a computer network traffic policy, for example a security policy, with regard to computer network traffic arriving at the firewall. For example, the firewall  may permit some types of computer network traffic to pass from the computer network  to the computer network  but block other types.","The computer  is connected to the computer network . The authentication server  is also connected to the computer network . The computer network  is connected to the computer network . The computer  is connected to the computer network . The computer network  is connected to the computer network . The cloud representing computer network  is larger than the clouds representing computer networks , ,  and  to indicate that the computer network  is a computer network over which other computer networks communicate (i.e., is an inter-network), for example, the computer network  and the computer network  communicate over the computer network .

Network services  include services provided by low level communications devices and protocols such as devices and protocols in accordance with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x series of communications standards, the Internet protocol (IP), the transmission control protocol (TCP), for example. Network services  may further include computer network infrastructure services such as the services provided by the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), the Internet domain name system (DNS) and the like. Network services  may also includes higher level communications services such as those provided by a distributed component object model (DCOM) and the like. Each of these network service examples is well known in the art and need not be detailed here. For details of an example distributed component object model see the DCOM section of the Microsoft\u00ae Developer Network (MSDN\u00ae) Library.","Network application programming interfaces are known in the art. Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock), as detailed in the Windows Sockets 2 section of the February 2003 Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation in the MSDN\u00ae Library, is an example of a suitable network API . The network location awareness component  of the network API  retrieves and monitors computer network attributes. Applications  may access the computer network attributes through the network API  and register with the network location awareness component  for notification of changes to the computer network attributes. Network location awareness is known in the art, so only some of its features are highlighted here. For details of an example network location awareness component, see the Network Location Awareness Service Provider section of the February 2003 Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Platform SDK documentation in the MSDNE\u00ae Library.","Examples of computer network attributes that may be retrieved and monitored by the NLA component  include low level communications device operating parameters, for example, media access control (MAC) addresses of wireless access points in accordance with the IEEE 802.11 series of wireless communications standards. Communications protocol operating parameters such as IP addresses and IP subnet specifications may also be retrieved and monitored by the NLA component .","Additional computer network attributes may include infrastructure service configuration and operating parameters such as the network addresses of default gateways, DHCP servers, authentication servers, DNS and other name servers, as well as authentication domain name, server names, unique server identifiers, for example, globally unique identifiers (GUIDs), and the physical location of servers and\/or network elements, for example, as determined by a global positioning system. The NLA component  may retrieve and monitor any suitable network services  configuration or operating parameter.","The NLA component  may retrieve parameters directly from the network services  or through the network API . Computer network attributes such as network services  configuration and operating parameters may be classified as passive or active. In an embodiment of the invention, computer network traffic, for example, a pair of request and response messages, is generated by the NLA component  when retrieving active network attributes (ANA), but retrieving passive network attributes (PNA) does not generate computer network traffic. Communication media connected status, IP address, IP subnet and default gateway network address are each examples of passive network attributes. In an embodiment of the invention, passive network attributes are computer network attributes that are present prior to the establishment of an active communications connection. Examples of active network attributes include authentication state (e.g., from an authoritative remote authentication server) and other network service attributes maintained by remote network service providers, in particular, remote network service presence. It may take the NLA component  more time to retrieve and\/or detect changes in active network attributes than passive network attributes.","Different computer networks may have some of the same computer network attributes. For example the computer network  and the computer network  of  may utilize the same private IP subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0\/24). The computer network attributes of a particular computer network may change over time. For example, the number of wireless access points in the computer network  () may change over time. These characteristics of computer networks are part of the reason why it may be a challenge to unambiguously determine an identity of a particular computer network.","The network fingerprinting component  determines a computer network identifier (NID), e.g., a GUID, for each computer network of which the network location awareness component  becomes aware. In an embodiment of the invention, the network fingerprinting component  further determines a level of confidence for each network identifier (an \u201cidentity confidence\u201d) with respect to various computer networks. The identity confidence of a particular network identifier may be a probability of correct identification of one of the computer networks of which the network location awareness component  is aware. For example, the identity confidence may have a value between a minimum identity confidence value (e.g., 0%) and a maximum identity confidence value (e.g., 100%). The identity confidence may have values on a quantized scale such as a scale of 0 (no confidence) to 5 (highest confidence).","The identity confidence of a particular network identifier may be based upon comparison of current and previous sets of network attributes. The network fingerprinting component  may have access to each network attribute retrieved by the network location awareness component . The network fingerprinting component  may subscribe to changes to network attributes monitored by the network location awareness component . It may be that some computer networks do not possess particular computer network attributes that may be utilized as part of determining identity confidence, for example, some compute networks may not include an authentication server. One or more of the highest levels of identity confidence may not be available for such computer networks.","In response to a request for an identity of one of the computer networks of which the network location awareness component  is aware, for example, a request generated by one of the applications , the network fingerprinting component  may respond with a response set of network identifiers as well as the identity confidence of each network identifier. For example, the response set of network identifiers may be sorted in order of descending identity confidence of the network identifiers. In an embodiment of the invention, computers incorporating the network fingerprinting component  may exchange information regarding identified networks (e.g., network identifiers) with their neighbors, enabling a shared network map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["310","310","402","404","406","404","402"]},"The set of issued active network attributes  may contain the sets of active network attributes associated with the issued network identifiers .","Data structures maintained by the network fingerprinting component  further include a set of current passive network attributes (PNA)  and a set of current active network attributes (ANA) . At a particular instant, each computer network connected to the computer(s) incorporating the network fingerprinting component  has a particular set of passive network attributes and a particular set of active network attributes. At that particular instant, those passive network attributes available to the network fingerprinting component  (i.e., available from the network location awareness component  of  in this example) may be contained by the set of current passive network attributes . Those active network attributes available to the network fingerprinting component  at that particular instant may be contained by the set of active network attributes .","Data structures maintained by the network fingerprinting component  further include a set of current identity confidences (CIC) , a set of passive network attribute (PNA) identity confidence modifiers (ICM) , a set of active network attribute (ANA) identity confidence modifiers (ICM)  and a set of learned identity confidence modifiers (LICM) . In an embodiment of the invention, a current identity confidence is determined for each issued network identifier by applying identity confidence modifiers to a base confidence (e.g., 0%). Passive network attribute identity confidence modifiers  may be applied to current identity confidences  when current passive network attributes  match corresponding issued passive network attributes . Active network attribute identity confidence modifiers  may be applied to current identity confidences  when current active network attributes  match corresponding issued active network attributes . Learned identity confidence modifiers  may be applied to current identity confidences  to modify current identity confidences  determined independently of current active network attributes . Unless otherwise indicated below or clearly contradicted by context, computer network and other attributes may match if the difference between the attribute values is within a matching tolerance.","Data structures maintained by the network fingerprinting component  further include a set of passive network attribute (PNA) changed indicators  and a set of active network attribute (ANA) changed indicators . The set of passive network attribute changed indicators  may include one or more timestamps indicating when current passive network attributes  were last updated, one or more Booleans indicating that corresponding current passive network attributes  have changed since current identity confidences  were last determined, or any suitable attribute change indicator that helps avoid duplicate determinations of identity confidence. The set of active network attribute changed indicators  may include similar change indicators.","The passive network attributes identity confidence modifiers , the current passive network attributes , the passive network attributes changed indicators  and the issued passive network attributes  data structures are depicted in a passive network attributes column. Each data structure in the passive network attributes column may have a corresponding entry for each passive network attribute.

Each data structure in the active network attributes column may have a corresponding entry for each active network attribute.

Each data structure in the issued network identifiers row may have a corresponding entry for each issued network identifier. As will be apparent to one of skill in the art, the data structures depicted in  may be maintained in one or more tables of a relational database, for example.","In an embodiment of the invention, a key use for network identifiers is as an index to network-dependent configurations and\/or policies, for example, security policies. Such configurations and policies may be referenced early in an initialization of the computer incorporating the network fingerprinting component , for example, prior to enabling any network interface hardware and\/or communication connections  (). The network fingerprinting component  may receive requests for network identifiers frequently as part of the initialization, for example,  requests within 2 minutes. This computer initialization scenario is not necessarily the most important operating scenario for the network fingerprinting component  but it does help provide context for the following discussion with regard to methods of associating network identifiers with computer networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["308","308"]},"The network fingerprinting component  typically subscribes to less than each of the network attributes of which the network location awareness component  is aware. For example, the network fingerprinting component  may subscribe to three passive network attributes such as network interface hardware MAC address, IP subnet and authentication domain name, and two active network attributes such as remote authentication server presence and authentication state with the remote authentication server. When the network location awareness component  initially becomes aware of, or retrieves an updated value for, the network attributes in which the network fingerprinting component  is interested, the network location awareness component  may pass the new or updated value to the network fingerprinting component .","The network fingerprinting component  may add new or updated passive network attributes to the current passive network attributes  () and update corresponding passive network attributes changed indicators .

If there are more issued network identifier candidates then the procedure progresses to step . Otherwise, the active network attribute identity confidence modifiers  () have been applied to the current identity confidences . As will be apparent to one of skill in the art, procedures equivalent to the described example are possible, for example, step  may be understood as a branching decision for traversing an identity confidence evaluation tree.","Passive network attributes for a particular computer network may become available before active network attributes. It may be that high network identity confidence, e.g., 100%, can not be obtained without active network attributes, for example, it may be that passive network attributes are insecure, or it may simply be policy that high confidence network identification includes confirmation by active network attributes. In order to provide accurate network identity confidences independent of active network attributes, learned identity confidence modifiers  () may be applied to current identity confidences .","Learned identity confidence modifiers  may begin as a default identity confidence modifier, for example, as a null modifier. If active network attributes, once they become available, confirm a particular identity confidence determination made independently of active network attributes then the associated learned identity confidence modifier may be augmented, that is, transformed so that, when applied, the learned identity confidence modifier will result in higher identity confidence values. If active network attributes contradict the particular identity confidence determination made independently of active network attributes then the associated learned identity confidence modifier may be reduced, that is, transformed so that, when applied, the learned identity confidence modifier will result in lower identity confidence values. For example, the learned identity confidence modifier may modify the identity confidence by adding the value of a learned variable to the identity confidence value. To augment such a learned identity confidence modifier, an augmentation constant may be added to the learned variable. To reduce such a learned identity confidence modifier, the augmentation constant may be subtracted from the learned variable. In an embodiment of the invention, learned identity confidence modifiers  are adjusted so as to minimize the difference between current identity confidences  as determined before and after active network attributes become available for a particular computer network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIG. 10","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["1002","310","308","310","410","412"]},"For example, the network fingerprinting component  may compare the active network attribute changed indicators  to the passive network attribute changed indicators . If each of the active network attribute changed indicators is less (e.g., has an earlier timestamp) than the earliest passive network attribute changed indicator then it may be determined that this is the first time that active network attributes have become newly available since the current identity confidences  were last calculated independent of active network attributes. If it is so determined then the procedure progresses to step . Otherwise, the procedure progresses to step .","At step , a copy of the current identity confidences  () that were calculated independent of active network attributes (the pre-ANA CICs) is recorded, for example, in temporary storage. At step , one or more of the current active network attributes  are updated with the newly available active network attributes. At step , the corresponding active network attribute changed indicators  are updated. In an embodiment of the invention, step  and step  occur as an atomic update operation.","At step , the current identity confidences  () are calculated, for example, as described above with reference to . The resulting current identity confidences  (the new CICs) are updated to reflect information provided by the newly available active network attributes. At step , the learned identity confidence modifiers  are adjusted by comparing the recorded identity confidences (the old, pre-ANA CICs) with the newly calculated current identity confidences (the new CICs). If particular old and new identity confidence pairs compare poorly (e.g., have a high difference) then the corresponding learned identity confidence modifier may be adjusted so as to reduce the difference in future calculations. Learned identity confidence modifiers associated with particular old and new identity confidence pairs that compare well (e.g., have a low difference) may remain unadjusted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["1012","1102","1104","1106","1108"]},"At step , the newly calculated (i.e., as described above with reference to ) current identity confidence of the candidate network identifier is compared to the recorded identity confidence (i.e., the old, pre-ANA CIC) of the candidate network identifier. If the (new) current identity confidence compares well with (e.g., matches) the recorded (old) identity confidence then no adjustment to the learned identity confidence modifier is desirable and the procedure progresses to step . If the recorded identity confidence is less than the current identity confidence then it may be desirable to augment the learned identity confidence modifier and the procedure progresses to step . If the recorded identity confidence is greater than the current identity confidence then it may be desirable to reduce the learned identity confidence modifier and the procedure progresses to step .","At step , the learned identity confidence modifier of the candidate network identifier may be augmented (e.g., linearly) so that, the next time it is applied, a higher current identity confidence results. For example, if the learned identity confidence modifier before step  is \u201cadd 20% to the current identity confidence\u201d then after step  the learned identity confidence modifier may be \u201cadd % to the current identity confidence.\u201d At step , the learned identity confidence modifier of the candidate network identifier may be reduced (e.g., linearly) so that, the next time it is applied, a lower current identity confidence results.
