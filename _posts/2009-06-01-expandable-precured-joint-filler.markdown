{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made under U.S. Government Contract N00019-02-C-3002. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This disclosure relates to manufacturing aircraft outer surfaces.","In the drawings and description that follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawings are not necessarily to scale. Certain features of the invention may be shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat schematic form and some details of conventional elements may not be shown in the interest of clarity and conciseness. The present invention is susceptible to embodiments of different forms. Specific embodiments are described in detail and are shown in the drawings, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to that illustrated and described herein. It is to be fully recognized that the different teachings of the embodiments discussed below may be employed separately or in any suitable combination to produce desired results. The various characteristics mentioned above, as well as other features and characteristics described in more detail below, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the embodiments, and by referring to the accompanying drawings.","Referring initially to , an exemplary embodiment of an aircraft , during manufacturing, includes a pair of adjacent surface panels, and , supported on a substrate  and spaced apart from one another to thereby define a gap . In an exemplary embodiment, the surface panels, and , may, for example, be composed of a metallic material and\/or a composite material. In an exemplary embodiment, the opposing faces, and , of the adjacent surface panels, and , are inclined in the direction of one another. As a result, the spacing between the upper portions of the opposing faces, and , of the adjacent surface panels, and , are less than the spacing between the lower portions of the opposing faces of the adjacent surface panels.","Referring now to , in an exemplary embodiment, a filler  that defines an internal cavity may then be positioned within the gap  between the adjacent surface panels, and . In an exemplary embodiment, the filler  is positioned within the gap  between the adjacent surface panels, and , while applying a vacuum to the cavity of the filler using a conventional source of vacuum . In an exemplary embodiment, the filler  is composed of a flexible resilient material such as, for example, a pre-cured polymer or a pre-cured composite material. In an exemplary embodiment, an adhesive, primer and\/or sealant may be applied to the interior surfaces of the gap , prior to the insertion of the filler  into the gap, in order to facilitate the subsequent retention of the filler within the gap.","Referring now to , in an exemplary embodiment, the source of vacuum  is then no longer operated to apply a vacuum to the cavity of the filler . As a result, the filler  expands to fill the gap  between the adjacent surface panels, and . In an exemplary embodiment, in order to further increase the expansion of the filler , a pressurized gas and\/or uncured foam or filler material such as, for example, a sealant, may also be injected into the cavity . Furthermore, in an exemplary embodiment, the inclined opposing end faces, and , of the adjacent surface panels, and , capture and retain the filler  within the gap .","Referring now to , in an exemplary embodiment, any portion of the filler  that extends above the top surfaces of the adjacent surface panels, and , may then be machined away. In this manner, a smooth outer surface is provided that is more aerodynamic. The use of an pre-cured filler  reduces shrinkage effects that would otherwise occur if the filler were not pre-cured. Furthermore, the use of a pre-cured filler  reduces the presence of volatile chemicals and minimizes curing times that would otherwise be required.","It is understood that variations may be made in the above without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, while the exemplary embodiments are directed to the manufacture of an aircraft, the teachings of the present disclosure may be applied to the manufacture of any structure such as, for example, automobiles, boats, naval ships, and buildings. Further, spatial references are for the purpose of illustration only and do not limit the specific orientation or location of the structure described above. While specific embodiments have been shown and described, modifications can be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or teaching of this invention. The embodiments as described are exemplary only and are not limiting. Many variations and modifications are possible and are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of protection is not limited to the embodiments described, but is only limited by the claims that follow, the scope of which shall include all equivalents of the subject matter of the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
