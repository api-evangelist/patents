printers for use in home and office environments are well known and are widely commercially available with varying designs and capabilities. Typically, commercially available desktop printers are of a size and configuration that requires a relatively substantial amount of space to accommodate the printer unit and associated components, such as print media input and\/or output trays. Indeed, much of this large \u201cfootprint\u201d of conventional printers may be occupied by the input and output trays. The footprint of the printer typically also includes the space required for accessing the printer and for printing in an unobstructed manner.","Even in conventional printers which do not use such print media trays and incorporate print media source and collection areas within the printer unit itself, a limitation in minimising the printer's footprint still remains in that it must at the very least correspond to the largest print media size to be printed, for example, A4 or A3 paper.","With the ongoing trend of smaller and more compact workstations it is necessary to maximise the available workspace, such that it is becoming increasingly necessary to reduce the amount of space occupied by equipment, such as desktop printers. Thus, there is a need to minimise the footprint of a desktop printer.","In a first aspect the present invention provides a printer for printing on media supplied from a media supply and delivering printed media to a media collector, comprising:\n\n","Optionally the print engine comprises a pagewidth inkjet printhead.","Optionally the first surface of the body is opposite the second

printer.","A printer  in accordance with the present invention is variously illustrated in . The printer  comprises a housing , a head unit  and a print media source tray assembly .","The housing  is provided as a substantially vertically extending body of the printer  having an inverted L-shape with an upper portion  and a lower portion . The upper portion  is arranged to receive a picker assembly  and a print engine assembly  (see ) which together provide a print media transport system for transporting print media from the print media source tray assembly  which acts as a print media source or supply of the printer , to the printing mechanics of the print engine assembly  (described later). The lower portion  is arranged as a print media collection area or collector. In this description, all references to upper, lower, outer, inner, bottom and top are provided with respect to the orientation of the printer  shown in .","The head unit  covers the picker and print engine assemblies  and  held by the upper portion  of the housing  and is pivotally attached to the upper portion  via hinges  (see ). This provides easy access to the picker and print engine assemblies  and  so that maintenance thereof and the clearing of print media jams and the like can be performed. The head unit  incorporates a user interface  via which a user can operate the printer  (discussed in more detail later).","The print media source tray assembly  is received by the lower portion  of the housing , as is shown in , and is capable of storing print media  for printing in a paper tray portion  thereof (see ). The print media  may be provided in the form of variously sized print media stacks each comprising of about 250 sheets, and up to 500 sheets, i.e., a ream of paper. For example, in  photographic print media, e.g., 4\u2033\u00d76\u2033 paper, is held by the source tray assembly , whilst in  A4 paper is held. In the following description the print media for use in the printer  is referred to as paper, however other forms of print media are applicable.","The housing  and the source tray assembly  are supported by a base unit  which houses power and data connections for the various electronic components of the printer . Particularly, the collection area  of the housing  and the source tray assembly  are supported by the base unit  in a substantially vertical orientation. That is, the planar surfaces of the source tray assembly  and the collection area  which are used to support paper for printing and paper which has been printed, respectively, are held by the base unit  so as to be substantially vertically oriented, which provides a reduced \u201cfootprint\u201d of the printer  as discussed in more detail later.","Referring to , , ,  and  (where  shows a cross-sectional view of the printer  taken along the line A-A of ), the printer  is constructed by sliding an inner surface and side portions of the collection area  over front edges and side portions , respectively, of the base unit , with the upper portion  of the housing  mounting the print engine assembly and picker assemblies  and  hingedly covered by the head unit .","The source tray assembly  is secured to the base unit  by engaging a tab on the bottom edge thereof with a slot in an upper surface of the base unit . Through this, the source tray assembly  can be hingedly engaged with the housing , as shown in , in order to access the paper tray portion . This is done by using a handle recess  provided in an outer surface of the source tray assembly . Those skilled in the art will understand that the above construction technique is merely one such technique, and alternative means of constructing the printer , such as using one or more \u201cclipping\u201d arrangements, are within the scope of the present invention.","The printer  thus constructed is intended for use as a desktop printer which is capable of printing information onto paper at a rate of at least 30 pages per minute (ppm), preferably at least 60 ppm, with a printing resolution providing for so-called photographic quality printing of at least 1200 dots per inch (dpi), preferably at least 1600 dpi. In use, the printer  presents a footprint, i.e., the surface area occupied by the printer  on the desktop, which is greatly reduced from that of conventional printers since the printer  along with its paper supply and collector, i.e., the source tray assembly  and the collection area , stands in a substantially vertical orientation with respect to the desktop surface. The manner in which the printer  operates in this substantially vertical orientation will now be discussed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0151"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 4"],"b":["103","100","110","103","103","114","103","100","103","112","101","114","111","115","116","115","117","118","110","103","116","115","116","117","118"],"i":"b "},"A support member  is held between the cover portion  and the tray  so as to be slidable beyond the top edge of the source tray assembly  to an uppermost position, as is shown in .

A hole (or depression) is provided in the locking member to allow a user's finger and the like to be placed therein so as to disengage the tab from the holes of the tray . The fence plate  is secured to the tray  by engaging a clip portion with a rod  provided in a recess of the tray  and a clipping element , shown individually in , positioned beneath the rod . In this way, the fence plate  is able to slide laterally across the tray  along the rod .","The tray , and consequently the source tray assembly , is made to a size sufficient to accommodate the maximum sized paper to be used with the printer . In the embodiment shown in the figures, the maximum paper size that may be accommodated in this way is US legal (8.5\u2033\u00d714\u2033). However, the printer  may be arranged to accommodate a different maximum print media size. Different sized paper is accommodated in the source tray assembly  as shown in  by moving the stop and fence plates  and  into varying positions via the holes -. Those skilled in the art will understand that the above-described arrangement to accommodate variously sized paper stacks within the source tray assembly  is merely an example, and alternative arrangements and mechanisms may be used in accordance with the present invention to securely hold such paper stacks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0158"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12"],"b":["101","101","112","101","124","110","124","101","125","124","124","101","124","124"]},"Referring to the cross-sectional view of the printer  in , the collection area  of the housing  is angled from the horizontal by about 75\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 (i.e., 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 from the vertical), which angle is provided so as to assist in collection of the printed paper from the print engine assembly  as discussed in more detail later. Consequently, when the source tray assembly  is mounted to the housing , it is at an angle of about 70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 from the horizontal (i.e., 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 from the vertical). This angle on the source tray assembly  assists in the storage of the stack  and reduces the occurrence of \u201csagging\u201d in the paper of the stack  over time. However, the action of the picker assembly  used to pick-up the topmost sheet from the stack  may cause subsequent sheet(s) to experience some movement that may cause them to separate slightly from the stack , particularly at the lower regions.","Thus, the foils  are provided to apply a retaining force against the sheets in the stack  urging them back against the stack  thereby preventing individual sheets from separating and falling into the lower region of the paper tray portion  which can cause jams to occur. The resilient nature of the foils  provides the appropriate retaining force to maintain the sheets in position. Whilst two foils  are shown a greater or lesser number of foils is within the scope of the present invention as to are foils having recessed portions along their length rather than being continuous, so long as the arrangement thereof provides the securing of the sheets in the stack . The stack  is situated at the upper right corner of the tray  so that a topmost sheet of the stack  is presented to the picker assembly , as shown in .","The picker assembly , shown most clearly in , may comprise a drive roller  driven by a motor  via a gearing mechanism  situated on motor and roller axles  and . In the arrangement shown, the drive roller  is rotated clockwise by the motor  so as to pick-up the topmost sheet , where the speed of the drive roller  is controlled by feeding back a detection result of an encoder arrangement  to the motor  via control circuitry (not shown). The drive roller  has a surface, such as rubber, which grips the sheets of paper.","An idler or pinch roller  having a position variable with respect to the drive roller  is used so that a sheet of differently sized print media can pass therebetween. A separator pad  is provided to ensure that only a single sheet is fed through the picker assembly  to the print engine assembly  for printing at any one time, thereby preventing multiple feeds to the print engine assembly  which can cause jams and\/or distorted prints. It will be understood that other types of picker mechanism could be used in accordance with the present invention.","The picker assembly  is held within the upper portion  of the housing  via a support frame , as shown in ,  and , so as to be in the position shown in  relative to the stack . In operation, the topmost sheet of the stack  is located against the drive roller  of the picker assembly  so that it may be readily picked-up for advancement to the print engine assembly  for printing, as shown in . As each consecutive topmost sheet is picked-up the relative height of the stack  decreases. Therefore, the platen  of the source tray assembly  is spring loaded towards the picker assembly  to ensure that the topmost sheet is consistently presented to the picker assembly .","To achieve this, the housing  comprises a spring mechanism  which contacts the lever arm  of the platen  as shown in . The spring mechanism  urges the lever arm  towards the tray  thereby causing the platen  to pivot about its pivot points \/, which causes an upper portion of the sheets in the stack  to be angled away from the tray  and towards the housing . Thus, throughout the pick-up process the upper portion of the stack  is urged toward the picker assembly . As an alternative, the spring mechanism  can be incorporated on the lever arm  of the platen  so as to engage with the inner section of the housing  to provide the same action.","In this pick-up process, when the stack  approaches its depleted state, there will be a situation where only a small number of sheets remain, e.g., two sheets. In this situation it is possible that all of these sheets will be picked-up together, creating a multiple feed. This is because the friction between the sheets may be greater than the friction between the stack  and the source tray assembly . Thus, the pad  is provided on the platen , as previously described, so as to present a higher friction surface between the last sheet of paper in the stack  and the platen  than that between the last and second-to-last sheets of paper in the stack . This arrangement assists in ensuring that too many sheets are not fed at once which otherwise may cause a jam to occur at the interface between the separator pad  and the drive roller  of the picker assembly  or further downstream of the transport system or print engine assembly .","Upon leaving the drive roller , the leading edge of the advancing sheet impinges upon an upper surface of the head unit , as is shown in . A plurality of (shaped) guides  are therefore provided on this upper surface of the head unit  (see also ) to guide the sheet to the print engine assembly . That is, the leading edge of the sheet follows the trajectory of the shape of the guides  to contact a guide plate  of the print engine assembly  which then directs the sheet into the print engine assembly  under the drive of the drive roller  of the picker assembly .","The print engine assembly  may be of the type described in the present Applicant's U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 10\/760,254 to 10\/760,258, the disclosures of which are all incorporated herein by reference. These applications have been identified by their filing docket number, which will be substituted with the corresponding application number, once assigned. As such, the print engine assembly  is generally comprised of two parts: a cradle unit  and a cartridge unit , shown variously in , ,  and .","The cartridge unit  comprises a printhead  for printing on a sheet of print media as it passes thereby and ink handling and storage reservoirs  for providing ink to the printhead . The printhead  is a pagewidth printhead, which means that no scanning of the printhead  across the sheets is required. This enables high-speed printing to be performed. Those skilled in the art however will understand that the present invention is applicable to printers employing other types of printheads. Further, as shown in , the cartridge unit  comprises a single printhead . However, a duplex printer may be used employing a cartridge unit having two pagewidth printheads aligned so that printing surfaces thereof oppose each other with a gap therebetween for accommodating the sheet of print media.","The cradle unit  comprises the guide plate , a roller assembly  and an associated motor  for advancing the sheet and controlling the trajectory and speed of the sheet as it passes the printhead , drive electronics  for controlling the printing performed by the printhead  and a capping unit  for capping the printhead  when printing is not being performed.","The cradle unit  is mounted within the upper portion  of the housing  and the cartridge unit  is removable received within the cradle unit , which allows for easy replacement of the printhead  and ink storage reservoirs  when necessary. A release latch  is provided for controlling this removal. The ink handling and storage reservoirs  of the cartridge unit  may store different coloured ink and associated printing fluids, such as fixative for assisting the setting of the printed ink. The printhead  draws the ink from the reservoirs  in order to print on the print media sheets.","A refill port  is incorporated in the cartridge unit  to which a refill cartridge  can be applied so as to refill the reservoirs with the particular types of inks which may have been depleted through printing, as shown in  for the case of cyan ink. In order to facilitate this refilling process an indicator light , such as an LED, is provided on the cradle unit  which is controlled to indicate to a user when refilling is needed and\/or has been completed in the manner described in the present Applicant's above-mentioned applications. The need for refilling can also be indicated to a user via the user interface  of the head unit  or by print manager software loaded on the user's personal computer (PC) connected to the printer , as discussed later.","The mounted position of the cradle unit  is such that the leading edge of the sheet being fed from the drive roller  of the picker assembly  and guided by the plurality of guides  and the guide plate  enters the roller assembly  of the cradle unit  so as to be advanced past the printhead  to be printed under action of the roller assembly  (and, in part, of the drive roller ). The leading edge of the sheet progresses through the cradle unit  and following printing exits the upper portion  of the housing  via an exit slot (see ). As such, the sheet is guided through an angle of at least 140\u00b0, and preferably an angle of at least 180\u00b0, from the source tray assembly  to the collection area  via the printhead .","During the printing process, the trailing edge of the sheet is transferred from being driven by the drive roller  to being driven only by the roller assembly  of the print engine assembly . Once printed, the trailing edge exits the upper portion  of the housing  via the exit slot , whereupon the printed sheet is collected by the collection area  of the housing , as shown in . The orientation of the cradle unit  and the cartridge unit  of the print engine assembly  is such that the printed sheet falls under gravity through the exit slot so as to be collected by the collection area .","Sheets of print media may also be manually fed to the roller assembly  of the print engine assembly  rather than being fed from the stack  held by the source tray assembly . This manual feeding is primarily provided for printing individual print jobs on print media that may not be present in or suitable for the source tray assembly , such as photographic paper or other types of print media, such as cardboard, wood, fabric and plastics.","In order to provide for this manual feeding, a slot  is provided in an upper portion of the head unit , as shown in , through which print media sheets are manually fed. The slot  has a length sufficient to accommodate the width of the maximum print media size for the printer . In order to reduce the entry of dust and the like into the print engine assembly  through the slot , since dust, etc may damage the printhead , a flap  (see ) spring loaded so as to be hinged inwardly or outwardly may be provided to close the slot  when manual feeding is not being performed.","Referring again to , the head unit  may comprise a margin element  which runs the length of the slot  on the upper surface of the head unit . The margin element  partly supports the sheet being fed and incorporates a sliding fence  which assists in controlling the feeding of differently sized print media through the slot . In order to manually feed a print media sheet into the printer  in this arrangement, the flap  is hinged so as to be lowered or raised and the leading edge of the sheet is fed through the slot  so as to impinge on the left hand side (in the orientation of ) of the guide plate  of the print engine assembly . The sheet then progresses down the guide plate  so as to enter the roller assembly  similar to the process for an automatically fed sheet described earlier.","When manual feeding is being performed for consecutive sheets, the support member  of the source tray assembly  can be extended as shown in  so that the yet-to-be-fed sheets can be held against the upper surface of the head unit  and the support member . This support is provided by the support member  being angled from the vertical due to the above-described angle of the source tray assembly .","Additional guiding support for the manually fed sheets may be provided as shown in . That is, the flap  of the head unit  may alternatively be arranged so as to provide such support for a manually fed sheet by being configured to be larger than the slot , see , and hinged so that part of the flap  extends into the head unit  and the remaining part of flap  projects out of the head unit  when manual feeding is desired. As can be seen, in this arrangement the guide plate  is provided within the head unit  so as to assist in the supporting position of the flap , and the margin element  and the sliding fence  are incorporated into the flap .","Further, as can be seen from , the head unit  in this arrangement is configured slightly differently and more compactly from the head unit  shown in , in order to accommodate the larger flap . Due to the more compact size, a direct drive picker assembly  may be used as shown in , which has the motor  and drive roller  on the same axle.","As described earlier, the outer surface of the lower portion  of the housing  serves as a collector for collecting the printed sheets which exit the print engine assembly  through the exit slot of the upper portion  of the housing . This is done whether the printed sheet is automatically or manually fed.","In order to securely collect a number of printed sheets , which may amount to at least the number of sheets comprised in the stack , the collection area  comprises guides or ribs  for guiding collection of the printed sheets and holding such once collected. To achieve this the guides  are substantially L-shaped with a foot  located at the bottom end of the collection area  and a leg  running substantially for the length of the collection area , as shown in .","As can be seen in , the flat upper surfaces of the feet  are aligned parallel with one another and substantially orthogonal to the incline of the collection area  so as to provide a stop surface and support for the leading edge of the falling printed sheet . By using a plurality of the ribs  (e.g., three are shown in the figures) with the feet  in parallel-alignment, the consecutively released sheets can be \u201csquared-up\u201d or \u201cknocked-up\u201d so as to provide a neat collection of the printed sheets ","The middle rib  situated between the two outer ribs  is located closer to the right hand side outer rib  (as orientated in ) than the left hand side outer rib . This is so that print media having a width which does not extend for the full width of the collection area , such as the photographic paper shown in  aligned in the upper right corner of the tray , is properly collected and knocked-up by the collection area .","Further, the middle rib  is arranged so that the leg  thereof projects out from the surface of the collection area  further than the legs  of the outer ribs . This is illustrated in , where in the top view of , broken line  shows that the legs  of the outer ribs  are aligned parallel to one another with respect to the surface of the collection area  whilst the leg  of the middle rib  projects out from the surface beyond line , and in the side view of , the leg  of the middle rib  is clearly shown as projecting further from the surface of the collection area  than that of the outer rib(s) .","The legs  of the ribs  are arranged in this way so that curvature is imparted to the printed sheets with a middle portion of each of the printed sheets being situated further from the collection area  than the edge portions thereof. That is, a lateral curvature orthogonal to the surface of the collection area  is imparted to the collected sheets, which applies a retaining force on the sheets by allowing the sheets to become more rigid and less inclined to fall forward upon contact with the feet . This ensures that the sheets are allowed to settle on the collection area  without toppling forward which may effect the image printing thereon. This action is assisted by the previously-mentioned angle of about 75\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 from the horizontal of the collection area , upon which angle the legs  also substantially lie.","The manner in which the sheet exits the upper portion  of the housing  and is captured on the collection area  is shown in , respectively. As can be seen from , the sheet exits the exit slot of the upper portion  of the housing  in a substantially vertical orientation (i.e., in the direction of arrow A). Once the sheet is released from the exit slot , as shown in , the sheet drops downward under gravity until its downward motion is stopped by the leading edge of the sheet coming into contact with the feet .","As can be seen in , the feet  project from the surface of the collection area  substantially orthogonal to this surface. Therefore, the feet  are angled about 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 from the horizontal. As such, upon contact with the feet  the sheet is caused to settle or (slowly) fall back to the surface of the collection area  in the direction of arrow B so as to finally come to rest in the position shown in . As described above, since curvature is imparted to the sheet it becomes relatively rigid thereby reducing the likelihood of the top portion of the sheet toppling over causing the sheet to move forward off of the collection area .","Due to the high-speed printing ability of the printer , contact between surfaces of printed sheets could have detrimental effects on the quality of the printed image(s), such as smudging and the like which may occur due to the relatively short amount of time between the collection of consecutive sheets, e.g., about one second for 60 ppm printing. That is, the ink printed on the surface of the sheets may not have time to dry or set before the next sheet contacts and comes to rest on the previous sheet's surface, such that the ink may bleed between the sheets.","The above-described sheet collection arrangement of the present invention minimises the possibility of such effects on the printed image occurring as follows. As consecutive printed sheets are delivered vertically to the collection area , the exposure of the printed sheet to air is maximised as it proceeds along its downward trajectory after exiting the upper portion  of the housing  thereby facilitating increased drying and setting of the printed ink. Further, as the leading edge of the first sheet is captured by the feet  of the ribs , following release of the sheet from the upper portion , the sheet falls into position against the surface of the collection area  whereby a cushion of air is created between the falling sheet and the collection area . For the successive sheets, this cushion of air remains while the sheet settles and until it comes to rest through this settling motion on the previously collected sheet. This cushion of air prior to settling of the sheets assists the drying\/setting of the ink printed on the previously collect sheet, or on both sheets in the case of duplex printing.","In addition to acting as a means for collecting printouts, the ribs  of the collection area  may also act as a means of providing a user of the printer  with an indication of the state of the printer  and\/or the printing being performed thereby. This is achieved by forming the ribs  from light pipes  through which light can be emitted indicating such states, where these light pipe  are provided within the surface of the collection area  as shown in .","The structure of one of the light pipes  is shown in . The light pipe  consists of a hollow transparent material, such as plastic, provided as a light transmitting channel which may be moulded into the shape of the ribs  or any other desired shape. The inner surface of the hollow material incorporates a lining which is highly reflective for light striking its surface at certain angles and transmissive for light striking at other angles. As such, light transmitted into the hollow portion is trained so as to flow for the length of the light pipe  and be emitted thereby through its entire length. A light source assembly  positioned on the light pipe , as shown in , is used to supply light into the hollow portion of the light pipe . The light source assembly  may be positioned relative to the light pipe , such as in the position shown in  or at the end of the light pipe , for example. The light source assembly  may comprise three differently coloured light sources, a red light source , a green light source  and a blue light source , as shown in . Each of the light sources - may be a LED. The use of these different coloured light sources - allows a wide spectrum of colours to be emitted by the light pipe  when the light sources - are selectively operated either individually or in combination. Alternatively, a single light source capable of multiple colour emission may be used. As such, different coloured light can be used to indicate different states of the printer  and\/or the printing being performed thereby by controlling the light source assembly  emission with the control circuitry of the printer  and\/or the drive electronics  of the print engine assembly .","For example, a blue light emitted by the light pipes  used as the ribs  of the collection area  may indicate that the printer  is in a standby state, whilst a green light may indicate that the printer  is in the state of printing and a red light may indicate that the printer  is malfunctioning, such as there being a paper jam or there being a need for more paper or ink. Other combinations of lighting, strobing, flashing, etc could alternatively be used for such purposes. For example, increased aesthetic appeal of the printer  could be provided by indicating the standby state with a cycle through a spectrum of colours. The operational state of the printer , such as the occurrence of a paper jam, may be determined in a conventional manner as understood by those skilled in the art.","The light pipes  can also be incorporated into the head unit  of the printer , as shown in . The light pipes  of the head unit  can be controlled in the same manner as those of the ribs , as discussed above, in order to indicate to a user the state of the printer , etc. Further, the combination of the light pipes  in both the head unit  and the collection area  can be used to indicate the state of different parts of the printer  by the individual operation thereof. Further still, other parts of the printer  could also be arranged with the light pipes  for this purpose. For example, the display of a red light with the light pipes  in the head unit  whilst the rest of the light pipes  of the printer  display green light could be used to immediately indicate to a user that there is a problem in the area of the head unit , such as paper jam or the like, whilst the rest of the printer  is functioning normally. In this way the user can easily and quickly identify and address any problems with the functioning of the printer .","Alternatively, the light pipes  may be provided in only one area of the printer  to indicate the state of the whole of the printer . In this case, the light pipes  are preferably provided only in the head unit  on the front facing surface thereof about the user interface , as shown in  for example, so as to provide good visibility for users. In this arrangement, if a problem arises with the functioning of the printer , the light pipes  of the head unit  can be used to indicate that a problem has occurred, upon which the user can refer to the user interface  or the print manager software loaded on the user's PC to determine what problem has occurred, and where.","For example, the light pipes  may emit blue light to indicate the standby state of the printer , green light to indicate the normal operation state of the printer , orange light to indicate a fault state of the source tray assembly , such as paper jam at the picker assembly  or the source tray assembly  not being fully closed with respect to the housing , and purple light to indicate a fault state of the head unit , such as a paper jam at the roller assembly  of the print engine assembly . However, other combinations of coloured lights may be used to indicate the state of the different operational areas of the printer .","The user interface  may be a display screen, such as a liquid crystal display, as shown in , used to display information about the state of the printer  and the like, and is preferably a touch screen via which users can operate the printer . This means that mechanical buttons and the like do not need to be provided on the printer  which facilitates a compact design of the printer . However, such buttons can be provided together with a simple display screen if desired.","The user interface  can therefore be used, either alone or in combination with the light pipes , to display information as to the state of the printer , such as the ink capacity left in the ink storage reservoirs of the print engine assembly , the occurrence of a paper jam in the transport system, as well as command and information menus, etc for the operation of the printer . To achieve this, the user interface  may further comprise a memory and a processor (not shown) for storing software for such menus and processing commands input by the user by touching areas of the touch screen. Alternatively, such components may be provided by the drive electronics  of the print engine assembly  with suitable connections between the user interface  and the drive electronics  being provided in the head unit  and the upper portion  of the housing .","The command and information menus displayed by the user interface  can also be used to display information on print jobs being, or to be, performed by the printer . In order to receive print jobs, the printer  may be connected directly to a user terminal (not shown), such as a PC, or connected to a plurality of such terminals via a network, which terminal(s) transmit the print jobs to the drive electronics  of the print engine assembly  for processing and printing by the printhead . Such menus can also be easily adapted to display in different languages, etc, which is convenient for providing the printer  for use in different countries. In this way the user interface  is able to display information to a user regarding the operation of the printer  which is more useful than that which is typically provided at the print manager level on a PC connected to the printer, which is typically the case for conventional desktop printers. This connection can be provided in a wired manner via a Pictbridge connector  situated in the collection area  area of the housing , as shown in , which allows for connection between the terminals and the printer . The Pictbridge connector  is positioned below the paper collection surfaces of the feet  of the collection area  so that a cable connected thereto (not shown) does not to interfere with the printout collection.","However, the Pictbridge connector  may instead be positioned on the side or rear of the housing , or within the base unit .","Alternatively, the connection between the terminals and the printer  can be provided in a wireless manner by using a WIFI card  and\/or a Bluetooth\u00ae card  located in the inner section of the housing , as shown in .","Alternatively still, or in addition, the printer  may incorporate means for directly receiving image data for the print jobs by incorporating slots  and , such as those shown in  in one of the side portions of the lower portion  of the housing . The slots  and  are arranged to receive photocards and the like so that images stored thereon can be downloaded to the printer's  or the drive electronics'  memory for direct printing.","Power for the user interface , the print engine assembly  particularly for the motor  of the roller assembly , the printhead , the drive electronics  and the capping unit ), the picker assembly  (particularly for the motor  of the drive roller ), the light pipes  and other electronic components of the printer  is supplied from an external power source (not shown) via a power connector  and power supply unit (PSU)  provided in the base unit , as shown in ,  and . Corresponding connections from the PSU  to the various electronic components can be provided via suitable wiring housed within the inner section and upper portion  of the housing  of the printer .","As can be seen from , in which a cover of the base unit  (see ) has been removed from a support portion thereof, the base unit  not only provides a base for holding the housing  and source tray assembly  in a substantially vertical orientation but also provides for the various connections of the printer . That is, in addition to the power connector , the base unit  may also hold a USB connector  and an Ethernet connector , for connection to external devices\/terminals and networks, for the reasons discussed earlier. As with the power connections, corresponding connections from the connectors  and , and also from the card devices  and  and the Pictbridge connector , to the various data components of the printer  can be provided via suitable wiring housed within the inner section and upper portion  of the printer .","The support portion of the base unit  extends from the bottom portion of the base unit  to the rear of the printer  so as to provide additional support for the assembled printer , particularly since the housing  and the source tray assembly  are angled from the vertical towards the rear of the printer . Further, the cover is arranged on the support portion and is easily removable to gain access to the connectors ,  and  for connection to corresponding device\/terminal cables (not shown). The cover is conveniently able to be placed on the support portion even when cables are connected as space is provided for accommodating the plugs on the end of the cables and a gap is provided for accommodating the cables themselves (see ). Feet portions are also provided on the bottom of the base unit  for providing stability to the substantially vertical printer , as shown in ,  and .","Apart from serving the above-mentioned purposes of providing a support for the housing , the head unit  and the source tray assembly , and connections for power and data, the base unit  may also be arranged on a stand assembly  for the printer  as shown in . The stand assembly  enables the printer  to be easily converted from a pure \u201cdesktop\u201d printer to a stand-alone printer. This provides for even greater desk space in a home or office environment. Further, the stand assembly  is provided with a similar footprint to that of the printer , such that the assembled printer  and stand assembly  continues to provide a relatively small footprint printing system.","As shown in , an upper frame portion  of the stand assembly  is arranged so as to conform to the shape of the bottom of the base unit , including the support portion of the base unit , which is shown in . In this way, the base unit  is locked to the upper frame portion  by a nesting arrangement, thereby providing secure assembly of the printer  to the stand assembly .","Cables  from external devices\/terminals for connection to the connectors ,  and  provided in the base unit  are accommodated in a cable housing  which is held at a top end thereof by the upper frame portion  at the rear of the stand assembly . The cable housing  comprises a cover  which neatly and safely encloses the cables , whilst being removable so as to provide quick access thereto. A handle  is provided at the top of the cable housing  on the upper frame portion  for easy transport of the assembled printer  and stand assembly .","A lower frame portion  and a base plate , to which the lower frame portion  is attached, are provided at the bottom of the stand assembly . The base plate  provides sufficient stability to the assembled printer  and stand assembly  whilst retaining a relatively small footprint, whilst the lower frame portion  is shaped similar to the upper frame portion  so as to hold the bottom end of the cable housing . The upper and lower frame portions  and  hold a frame  therebetween within which one or more print media trays  may be arranged.","As can be seen, each of the print media trays  are provided at an angle to the vertical so as to each be able to hold a stack of print media, such as paper. The trays  may be used to store paper for printing and\/or paper that has been printed. The frame  is shown in  arranged with three of the trays , however a greater or lesser number of the trays may be provided in accordance with the present invention.","The provision of a plurality of trays  provides storage for stacks of different sized print media for printing. That is, if printing on different sized paper than is presently loaded in the source tray assembly  of the printer  is required, it is a simple task for a user to source this paper from the trays  to replace the paper in the source tray assembly  or manually feed this paper into the printer . Further, the plurality of trays  can be used to hold additional stacks of the most common paper size used with the printer  so as to provide an efficient means of reloading the source tray assembly  when the need for such is indicated to a user via the light pipes  and\/or the user interface , for example.","The provision of the plurality of trays  may also provide a means to collate different print job outputs. That is, in a network printing environment, say, it may be necessary to collate the outputs of a number of users since those users may not immediately collect their printouts. Such manual collation may be needed due to the high-speed printing capability of the printer  through which many outputs may be produced in a relatively short amount of time.","The trays  are arranged to slide into place in the frame  so that the inner edges thereof rest on the cable housing  (see ). Further, the upper and lower frame portions  and  are arranged to removably receive the frame  and cable housing  therein. In this way, the stand assembly  is provided as a modular assembly of the above-mentioned parts such that it is easily assembled and disassembled. In its disassembled state, the stand assembly  presents a number of compact parts which can be easily packaged with the parts of the disassembled printer , i.e., the separate parts of the housing , the head unit , the source tray assembly , the picker assembly , the print engine assembly  and the base unit . In order to facilitate assembly\/disassembly and the mobility of the assembled printer  and stand assembly , the components of the stand assembly  are preferably made from a lightweight material, such as plastic.","Exemplary construction and operation of the vertical printer of the present invention is now described.","For the desktop printer  configured to print on A4 paper as being the maximum-sized paper, the pagewidth printhead  of the print engine assembly  has a printhead width of 224 mm or 8.8 inches. In order to form this printing width the printhead  comprises a plurality of printhead integrated circuits (ICs) incorporating printing or ink ejecting nozzles therein, such as those described in the present Applicant's above-referenced applications Ser. Nos. 10\/760,254 to 10\/760,258.","In accordance with the present invention, at least 5,000 nozzles may be incorporated to provide the required quality of printing, i.e., at least 1600 dpi, at the high-speed of at least 30 ppm, preferably at least 60 ppm. However, depending upon the printing quality and speed required, the printhead may comprise at least 10,000 nozzles, preferably at least 20,000 nozzles, and more preferably at least 50,000 nozzles in higher-speed, higher-quality printing applications.","These nozzles are arranged as a two-dimensional array across the width of the printhead so as to eject ink, and other printing fluids such as fixative, onto the surface of the passing print media in order to print images thereon. Each of the nozzles corresponds to a printed dot on the print media, and therefore the larger the number of nozzles and the greater the packing density thereof in the printhead the closer the printed dots, and therefore the higher the resolution of the printing. The drive electronics  receives and processes image data from an external data source, via one or more of the data connectors ,  and  or data devices  and , and drives the nozzles of the printhead in accordance with the processed image data (explained in more detail later).","With respect to the type of nozzle systems which are applicable for the printhead , any type of ink jet nozzle array which can be integrated on a printhead IC is suitable. That is, systems such as a continuous ink system, an electrostatic system and a drop-on-demand system, including thermal and piezoelectric types, can be used.","Regarding a thermal drop-on-demand system, there are various types known which typically include ink reservoirs adjacent the nozzles and heater elements in thermal contact therewith. The heater elements heat the ink which creates gas bubbles therein. The gas bubbles generate pressures in the ink causing droplets to be ejected through the nozzles onto the print media. The amount of ink ejected onto the print media by each nozzle and when this occurs is controlled by the drive electronics. Such thermal systems impose limitations on the type of ink that can be used however, since the ink must be resistant to heat, and also require a cooling process which can reduce the optimum printing speed.","Regarding a piezoelectric drop-on-demand system, various types are also known which typically use piezo-crystals arranged adjacent the ink reservoirs which are caused to flex when an electric current flows therethrough. This flexing causes droplets of ink to be ejected from the nozzles in a similar manner to the thermal systems described above. Such piezoelectric systems allow more control over the shape and size of the ink droplets than the thermal systems and the ink does not have to be heated and cooled between cycles, giving a greater range of available ink types.","Further, a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) of nozzles could be used which includes thermo-actuators which cause the nozzles to eject ink droplets. Such nozzle systems are described in the present Applicant's following co-pending and granted applications:","U.S. Pat.

Further, the rows of the nozzle arrangements  are staggered with respect to each other, allowing closer spacing of ink dots during printing than would be possible with a single row of nozzles. The multiple rows also allow for redundancy (if desired), thereby allowing for a predetermined failure rate per nozzle.","The printhead ICs of the printhead  are manufactured using an integrated circuit fabrication technique and, as previously indicated, embody a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS). Referring to , which shows a single nozzle, each printhead IC includes a silicon wafer substrate  and CMOS microprocessing circuitry formed thereon. This is done by depositing a silicon dioxide layer  on the substrate  as a dielectric layer and aluminium electrode contact layers  on the silicon dioxide layer . Both the substrate  and the layer  are etched to define an ink channel , and an aluminium diffusion barrier  is positioned about the ink channel .","A passivation layer  of silicon nitride is deposited over the aluminium contact layers  and the layer . Portions of the passivation layer  that are positioned over the contact layers  have openings  therein to provide access to the contact layers .","Each nozzle includes a nozzle chamber  which is defined by a nozzle wall , a nozzle roof  and a radially inner nozzle rim . The ink channel  is in fluid communication with the chamber .","A moveable rim , that includes a movable seal lip , is located at the lower end of the nozzle wall . An encircling wall  surrounds the nozzle and provides a stationery seal lip  that, when the nozzle is at rest as shown in , is adjacent the moveable rim . A fluidic seal  is formed due to the surface tension of ink trapped between the stationery seal lip  and the moveable seal lip . This prevents leakage of ink from the chamber whilst providing a low resistance coupling between the encircling wall  and the nozzle wall .","The nozzle wall  forms part of lever arrangement that is mounted to a carrier  having a generally U-shaped profile with a base  attached to the layer . The lever arrangement also includes a lever arm  that extends from the nozzle wall and incorporates a lateral stiffening beam . The lever arm  is attached to a pair of passive beams  that are formed from titanium nitride and are positioned at each side of the nozzle, (best seen in ). The other ends of the passive beams  are attached to the carriers .","The lever arm  is also attached to an actuator beam , which is formed from TiN. This attachment to the actuator beam is made at a point which is a small, but critical, distance higher than the attachments to the passive beam .","As can best be seen from , the actuator beam  is substantially U-shaped in plan, defining a current path between an electrode  and an opposite electrode . Each of the electrodes  and  is electrically connected to a respective point in the contact layer . The actuator beam  is also mechanically secured to an anchor , and the anchor  is configured to constrain motion of the actuator beam  to the left of  when the nozzle arrangement is activated.","The actuator beam  is conductive, being composed of TiN, but has a sufficiently high enough electrical resistance to generate self-heating when a current is passed between the electrodes  and . No current flows through the passive beams , so they do not experience thermal expansion.","In operation, the nozzle is filled with ink  that defines a meniscus  under the influence of surface tension. The ink  is retained in the chamber  by the meniscus , and will not generally leak out in the absence of some other physical influence.","To fire ink from the nozzle, a current is passed between the contacts  and , passing through the actuator beam . The self-heating of the beam  causes it to expand, with the actuator beam  being dimensioned and shaped so that it expands predominantly in a horizontal direction with respect to . The expansion is constrained to the left by the anchor ; so the end of the actuator beam  adjacent the lever arm  is impelled to the right.","The relative horizontal inflexibility of the passive beams  prevents them from allowing much horizontal movement of the lever arm . However, the relative displacement of the attachment points of the passive beams and actuator beam respectively to the lever arm causes a twisting movement that, in turn, causes the lever arm  to move generally downwardly with a pivoting or hinging motion. However, the absence of a true pivot point means that rotation is about a pivot region defined by bending of the passive beams .","The downward movement (and slight rotation) of the lever arm  is amplified by the distance of the nozzle wall  from the passive beams . The downward movement of the nozzle walls and roof causes a pressure increase within the chamber , causing the meniscus  to bulge as shown in . The surface tension of the ink causes the fluid seal  to be stretched by this motion, however ink is not allowed to leak out.","As shown in , at the appropriate time the drive current is stopped and the actuator beam  quickly cools and contracts. This contraction causes the lever arm  to commence its return to the quiescent position, which in turn causes a reduction in pressure in the chamber . The interplay of the momentum of the bulging ink and its inherent surface tension, and the negative pressure caused by the upward movement of the nozzle chamber  causes thinning, and ultimately snapping, of the bulging meniscus  to define an ink drop  that continues upwards until it contacts passing print media.","Immediately after the drop  detaches, the meniscus  forms the concave shape shown in . Surface tension causes the pressure in the chamber  to remain relatively low until ink has been suctioned upwards through the inlet , which returns the nozzle arrangement and the ink to the quiescent state shown in .","In order to control the delivery of the drops from each of the nozzles, the print engine assembly  uses the drive electronics . As described earlier, the drive electronics  receives image data of print jobs to be printed by the printer . Referring to , this image data may be received from an external data source, such as a computer system or user's PC . The PC  is programmed to perform various steps involved in printing image data (i.e., a document), including receiving the document (step ), buffering and rasterising the document to provide a page description (steps  and ) and compressing this to provide a page image (step ) suitable for transmission to the print engine assembly  of the printer .","At the drive electronics  of the print engine assembly  provided in the printer , the compressed, multi-layered page image is buffered (step ) and then expanded to separate the different layers of the page image (step ). The expanded contone layer is dithered (step ) and then the black layer is composited over the dithered contone layer (step ). Coded data can also be rendered (step ) to form an additional layer, to be printed using infrared ink, for example, that is substantially invisible to the human eye. The black, dithered contone and infrared layers are combined (step ) to form a page that is supplied to the printhead  for printing (step ), which as mentioned above, is preferably configured to print in 5 colours.","Further, the document data is preferably divided into a high-resolution bi-level mask layer for text and line art and a medium-resolution contone colour image layer for images or background colours. Optionally, coloured text can be supported by the addition of a medium-to-high-resolution contone texture layer for texturing text and line art with colour data taken from an image or from flat colours. The contone layers are generalised by representing them in abstract \u201cimage\u201d and \u201ctexture\u201d layers which can refer to either image data or flat colour data. This division of data into layers based on content follows the base mode Mixed Raster Content (MRC) model known to those skilled in the art. Like the MRC base mode, compromises are made in some cases when data to be printed overlap. For example, all overlaps may be reduced to a 3-layer representation in a process (collision resolution) embodying the compromises explicitly. The central data structure is a generalised representation of the three layers, called a page element , shown in a simplified UML diagram in . The page element  can be used to represent units ranging from single rendered elements emerging from a rendering engine up to an entire band of a print job. Conceptually, the bi-level symbol region selects between the two colour sources, as described in more detail below with reference to . It will be appreciated that the device components shown in , which carry out the steps  to  shown in , will typically be device dependent, in that they process the data into a form required by a software or hardware component further downstream.","In , a renderer  is provided outside of the more general printer system pipeline shown in  in order to render files to be printed and deliver the rendered elements to a data receiver  (step ) of the pipeline, using an Application Programming Interface (API) exposed by the data receiver  for that purpose. The rendered elements are delivered in order according to the painter's algorithm, which is well known to those skilled in the art. The data passed in through the API is converted by the data receiver  into lists of dictionaries and page elements for processing in later stages.","The data is then rasterised (step  in ) as follows. A collision resolver  accepts the simple page elements created by the data receiver  (via buffering at step ) and creates a fully opaque \u201cresolved\u201d page element for each intersection of a new element with the background and any elements already present. Fundamentally, the collision resolver  guarantees that the entire page is tiled with opaque elements. A stripper  divides a band of data into horizontally overlapping pieces, which is performed since the printer  is relatively fast and as such uses multiple parallel devices in order to achieve the required output dot-rate. In such cases, each horizontally overlapping piece is fed into a corresponding device downstream. Where such data division is not required, the stripper  can be omitted.","Different printing configurations will require different configurations of layers for delivery to the downstream hardware. A layer reorganiser  converts 3-layer page elements to the appropriate 2- or 3-layer form for the specific configuration. Again, there may be cases in which this function is not required, in which case the layer organiser  can be omitted. A contone combiner  combines and clips the image and texture layers of all page elements in a strip into single image and texture layers, as required by downstream hardware.","A colour converter  transforms the contone planes of all page elements from the input colour space to a device-specific colour space (which is usually CMYK). A mask combiner  performs the same operation on the mask layer as the contone combiner  performs on the contone layers. All elements are clipped to a strip boundary and drawn into a single mask buffer.","A densitometer  measures the density of the current page as a percentage of total possible density. This operation is necessary when the power supply of the printer  is not able to handle a fully dense page at full speed. A contone compressor  compresses the contone layers of all page elements in order to reduce downstream memory and\/or transmission bandwidth requirements. A mask formatter  converts the mask layer of page elements, which may be represented as regions of placed symbol references, into the form expected by a downstream mask decompressor.","A size limiter  ensures that all size limitations, for bands and for entire pages, are adhered to, by either dividing bands into smaller bands or by recompressing the data, repeating until the constraint is satisfied. If data is to be transmitted to the printer  between pipeline stages, a serialised form of the data structures is generated (in a serialiser ), transmitted, then deserialised (in a deserialiser ).","Within the drive electronics  of the print engine assembly  incorporated in the printer , a distributor  converts data from a proprietary representation into a hardware-specific representation and ensures that the data for each strip is sent to the correct hardware device whilst observing any constraints or requirements on data transmission to these devices. The distributor  distributes the converted data to an appropriate one of a plurality of pipelines . The pipelines  are identical to each other, and in essence provide decompression, scaling and dot compositing functions to generate a set of printable dot outputs for the nozzles of the printhead .","Each pipeline  includes a buffer  for receiving the page image data from the PC  (step  in ). A contone decompressor  decompresses the colour contone planes and a mask decompressor  decompresses the monotone (text) layer (step  in ). Further, a contone scaler  and a mask scaler  are provided to scale the decompressed contone and mask planes, respectively, to take into account the size of the print media onto which the processed page is to be printed by the printhead .","The scaled contone planes are then dithered by a ditherer  using stochastic dispersed-dot dither (step  in ). Clustered-dot, or amplitude-modulated, dither is not used since dispersed-dot, or frequency-modulated, dither reproduces high spatial frequencies (i.e., image detail) almost to the limits of the dot resolution while simultaneously reproducing lower spatial frequencies to their full colour depth when spatially integrated by the eye. A stochastic dither matrix is carefully designed to be relatively free of objectionable low-frequency patterns when tiled across the image. As such, its size typically exceeds the minimum size required to support a particular number of intensity levels (e.g., 16\u00d716\u00d78 bits for 257 intensity levels).","The dithered planes are then composited in a dot compositor  on a dot-by-dot basis to provide dot data suitable for printing (steps  and  in ). This data is forwarded to data distribution and drive circuitry , which in turn distributes the data to the correct nozzle actuators  of the printhead  which in turn cause ink to be ejected from the correct nozzles at the correct time (step  in ).","In the above system, a mainly software-based PC portion  is provided prior to the serialiser , and a mainly hardware-based print engine assembly portion , that is located within the printer  remote from the PC , is provided including everything from the deserialiser  onwards. It will be appreciated, however, that the indicated division between computer system and printer is somewhat arbitrary, and various components can be placed on different sides of the divide without substantially altering the operation as a whole. It will also be appreciated that some of the device components can be handled in hardware or software remotely from the computer system and printer. For example, rather than relying on the general-purpose processor of the PC, some of the components in the architecture can be accelerated using dedicated hardware.","Preferably, the hardware pipelines  are embodied in a controller of the print engine assembly , which also preferably includes one or more system on a chip (SoC) components, as well as the print engine assembly pipeline control application specific logic, configured to perform some or all of the functions described above in relation to the printing pipeline.","Referring to , from the highest point of view the controller of the print engine assembly  consists of three distinct subsystems: a central processing unit (CPU) subsystem , a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) subsystem  and a print engine assembly pipeline (PEP) subsystem . Various components of these subsystems  to  are described below, with a more detailed description of these components, including their various functions, being provided later in Tables 1 to 3.","The CPU subsystem  includes a CPU  that controls and configures all aspects of the other subsystems and provides general support for interfacing and synchronizing the various components of the printer  with the print engine assembly . It also controls the low-speed communication to Quality Assurance (QA) devices (described in more detail later). The CPU subsystem  also contains various peripherals to aid the CPU , such as General Purpose Input Output (\u201cGPIO\u201d), which includes motor control, etc, Interrupt Controller Unit (\u201cICU\u201d), Low-Speed Serial (\u201cLSS\u201d) master and general Timers (\u201cTIM\u201d).","The DRAM subsystem  accepts requests from the CPU , Serial Communications Block (\u201cSCB\u201d) on the CPU subsystem , which provides a full speed USB1.1 interface to the host as well as an Interface (\u201cINT\u201d) to other controllers of the print engine assembly  and blocks within the PEP subsystem . The DRAM subsystem , and in particular DRAM Interface Unit (\u201cDIU\u201d) thereof, arbitrates the various requests and determines which request should win access to DRAM incorporated therein. DIU arbitrates based on configured parameters, to allow sufficient access to DRAM for all requestors. DIU also hides the implementation specifics of DRAM, such as page size, number of banks and refresh rates.","The PEP subsystem  accepts compressed pages from DRAM and renders them to bi-level dots for a given print line destined for PrintHead Interface (\u201cPHI\u201d) that communicates directly with the printhead ICs of the printhead . The first stage of the page expansion pipeline includes Contone Decoder Unit (\u201cCDU\u201d), Lossless Bi-level Decoder (\u201cLBD\u201d) and Tag Encoder (\u201cTE\u201d). CDU expands the JPEG-compressed contone (typically CMYK) layers, LBD expands the compressed bi-level layer (typically K), and TE encodes infrared tags for later rendering (typically in IR or K ink). The output from the first stage is a set of buffers: Contone FIFO Unit (\u201cCFU\u201d); Spot FIFO Unit (\u201cSFU\u201d); and Tag FIFO Unit (\u201cTFU\u201d). CFU and SFU buffers are implemented in dynamic random access memory.","The second stage includes Halftone Compositor Unit (\u201cHCU\u201d), which dithers the contone layer and composites position tags and the bi-level spot layer over the resulting bi-level dithered layer. A number of compositing options can be implemented, depending upon the printhead  with which the controller is used. Up to six channels of bi-level data are produced from this stage, although not all channels may be present on the printhead . For example, the printhead  may be CMY only, with K pushed into the CMY channels and IR ignored. Alternatively, the encoded tags may be printed in K if IR ink is not available (or for testing purposes).","In the third stage, Dead Nozzle Compensator (\u201cDNC\u201d) compensates for dead nozzles in the printhead  by colour redundancy and error diffusing of dead nozzle data into surrounding dots. The resultant bi-level six channel dot-data (typically CMYK, IR and fixative) is buffered and written to a set of line buffers stored in DRAM via Dotline Writer Unit (DWU). Finally, the dot-data is loaded back from DRAM, and passed to PHI via a dot FIFO (not shown). The dot FIFO accepts data from Line Loader Unit (\u201cLLU\u201d) at the system clock rate, while PHI removes data from the dot FIFO and sends it to the printhead  at a rate of 2\/3 times the system clock rate.","The details and functions of the above-described components of the subsystems  to  and those shown in  but not described above are provided in Tables 1 to 3 below, for the CPU subsystem , the DRAM subsystem  and the PEP subsystem ,

DRAM of the DRAM subsystem  is 2.5 Mbytes in size, of which about 2 Mbytes are available for compressed page store data. A compressed page is received in two or more bands, with a number of bands stored in memory. As a band of the page is consumed by the PEP subsystem  for printing, a new band can be downloaded. The new band may be for the current page or the next page. Using banding it is possible to begin printing a page before the complete compressed page is downloaded, but care must be taken to ensure that data is always available for printing or a buffer under-run may occur.","The embedded USB 1.1 device accepts compressed page data and control commands from the PC  (), and facilitates the data transfer to either DRAM, or to another controller in a multiple controller print engine assembly. A multiple controller print engine assembly  may be used to perform different functions depending upon the particular implementation. For example, in some cases a controller can be used simply for its onboard DRAM, while another controller attends to the various decompression and formatting functions described above. This can reduce the chance of buffer under-run, which can happen in the event that the printhead  commences printing a page prior to all the data for that page being received and the rest of the data is not received in time. Adding an extra controller for its memory buffering capabilities doubles the amount of data that can be buffered, even if none of the other capabilities of the additional controller are utilized.","Each controller may have several QA devices designed to cooperate with each other to ensure the quality of the mechanics of the printer , the quality of the ink supply so the nozzles of the printhead  will not be damaged during printing and the quality of the software to ensure the printhead  and the mechanics of the printer  are not damaged.","Normally, each controller of the print engine assembly  will have an associated QA device (not shown) which stores information on the attributes of the printer , such as the maximum printing speed. The cartridge unit  of the print engine assembly  also contains an ink QA device (not shown) which stores information on the cartridge unit , such as the amount of ink remaining in the ink storage and handling reservoirs . The printhead  also has a QA device (not shown) which is configured to act as a ROM (effectively as an EEPROM) that stores printhead-specific information such as dead nozzle mapping and the characteristics of the printhead . The CPU  in the CPU subsystem  of the controller also runs a logical (software) QA device (not shown) and may optionally load and run program code from a QA device that effectively acts as a serial EEPROM. Generally, all of the QA devices are physically identical, with only the contents of flash memory differentiating one from the other.","Each controller has two LSS system buses that can communicate with QA devices for system authentication and ink usage accounting. A large number of QA devices can be used per bus and their position in the system is unrestricted with the exception that printhead QA and ink QA devices should be on separate LSS busses.","In use, the logical QA device communicates with the ink QA device to determine remaining ink. The reply from the ink QA device is authenticated with reference to the printhead QA device. The verification from the printhead QA device is itself authenticated by the logical QA device, thereby indirectly adding an additional authentication level to the reply from the ink QA device.","Data passed between the QA devices, other than the printhead QA device, is authenticated by way of digital signatures. For example, HMAC-SHA1 authentication may be used for data, and RSA may be used for program code, although other schemes could be used instead.","A single controller can control a plurality of the printhead ICs of the printhead  and up to the six printing fluid channels (e.g., CMYK, IR and F). However, the controller is preferably colour space agnostic. Such that, although the controller can accept contone data as CMYX or RGBX, where X is an optional 4th channel, it also can accept contone data in any print colour space. Additionally, the controller provides a mechanism for arbitrary mapping of input channels to output channels, including combining dots for ink optimization and generation of channels based on any number of other channels. However, inputs are typically CMYK for contone input, K for the bi-level input, the optional IR tag dots are typically rendered to an infrared layer, and a fixative channel is generated due to the high-speed printing capability.","Further, the controller is also preferably resolution agnostic, such that it merely provides a mapping between input resolutions and output resolutions by means of scale factors and has no knowledge of the physical resolution of the printhead . Further still, the controller is preferably pagelength agnostic, such that successive pages are typically split into bands and downloaded into the page store as each band of information is consumed.","Turning now to , the printhead ICs of the printhead  will be further described. For clarity, only one printhead IC  is shown in , but it will be appreciated that a corresponding arrangement is implemented for the other printhead ICs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0219","num":"0274"},"figref":"FIG. 40","b":["252","144","107","252","253","252","254","255","254","253","256","253","254","257"]},"The nozzle core array  is shown in detail in . As can be seen in  the nozzle core array  comprises an array of nozzle columns , a fire\/select shift register  and up to six channels, each of which is represented by a corresponding dot shift register .","As shown in , the fire\/select shift register  includes a forward path fire shift register , a reverse path fire shift register  and a select shift register , and each dot shift register  includes an odd dot shift register  and an even dot shift register . The odd and even dot shift registers  and  are connected at one end such that data is clocked through the odd shift register  in one direction, then through the even shift register  in the reverse direction. The output of all but the final even dot shift register  is fed to one input of one of plurality of multiplexers . This input of the multiplexers  is selected by a signal (CoreScan) during post-production testing. In normal operation, the CoreScan signal selects dot data input Dot[x] supplied to the other input of each of the multiplexers . This causes Dot[x] for each colour to be supplied to the respective dot shift registers .","A single column N of the array of nozzle columns  is also shown in . In the embodiment shown, the column N includes 12 data values, comprising an odd data value  and an even data value  for each of the six dot shift registers . Column N also includes an odd fire value  from the forward fire shift register  and an even fire value  from the reverse fire shift register , which are supplied as inputs to a multiplexer . The output of the multiplexer  is controlled by a select value  in the select shift register . When the select value  is zero, the odd fire value  is output, and when the select value  is one, the even fire value  is output.","Each of the odd and even data values  and  is provided as an input to corresponding odd and even dot latches  and , respectively. Each of the dot latches  and  and its associated data value  and  form a unit cell, such as a unit cell  shown in  for the odd latch  and the odd data value . This situation for the odd dot shift register  is illustrated in more detail in , which is also applicable to the situation for the even dot shift register .","Referring to , the odd dot latch  is a D-type flip-flop that accepts the output of the odd data value , which is held by the unit cell (a D-type flip-flop)  which forms an element of the odd dot shift register . The data input to the flip-flop  is provided from the output of a previous element in the odd dot shift register  (unless the element under consideration is the first element in the shift register , in which case its input is the Dot[x] value). Data is clocked from the output of the flip-flop  into the odd dot latch  upon receipt of a negative pulse provided on line LsyncL.","The output of the odd dot latch  is provided as one of the inputs to a three-input AND gate . Other inputs to the AND gate  are a fire enable (Fr) signal (from the output of multiplexer ) and a pulse profile (Pr) signal. The firing time of a nozzle is controlled by the pulse profile signal Pr and can be, for example, lengthened to take into account a low voltage condition that arises due to low battery, in a situation where the power supply of the printer  is provided as a battery element (not shown) mounted in the housing , for example. This is to ensure that a relatively consistent amount of ink is efficiently ejected from each nozzle as it is fired. The profile signal Pr may be the same for each of the dot shift registers , which provides a balance between complexity, cost and performance. However, the Pr signal can be applied globally (i.e., is the same for all nozzles) or can be individually tailored to each unit cell or even to each nozzle.","Once the data is loaded into the odd dot latch , the Fr and Pr signals are applied to the AND gate , combining to trigger the nozzle to eject a dot of ink for each odd dot latch  that contains a logic 1.","The signals for each nozzle channel as shown in  are summarized in Table 4 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0228","num":"0283"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 4"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Name","Direction","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["d","Input","Input dot pattern to shift register bit"]},{"entry":["q","Output","Output dot pattern from shift register bit"]},{"entry":["SrClk","Input","Shift register clock in; d is captured"]},{"entry":[{},{},"on rising edge of this clock"]},{"entry":["Fr","Input","Fire enable; needs to be asserted for nozzle to fire"]},{"entry":["Pr","Input","Profile; needs to be asserted for nozzle to fire"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As shown in , the Fr signals are routed on a diagonal to enable firing of one colour in the current column, the next colour in the following column, and so on. This averages the current demand by spreading it over six columns in time-delayed fashion.","The dot latches and the latches forming the various shift registers are fully static and are CMOS-based. The design and construction of latches is well known to those skilled in the art and so is not described in detail herein.","As stated earlier, the printhead , which has a printing surface or zone across the width of a maximum-sized page of print media that can be printed on using the printer , may incorporate at least 5,000 nozzles and even more than 50,000 nozzles in order to provide the required quality of printing at the high-speed printing of the printer  across this pagewidth. For example, the combined printhead ICs  may define a printhead having 13824 nozzles per channel, including the coloured ink and fixative channels.","The nozzle speed may be as much as 20 kHz for the printer  capable of printing at about 60 ppm, and even more for higher speeds. At this range of nozzle speeds the amount of ink than can be ejected by the entire printhead  is at least 50 million drop per second. However, as the number of nozzles is increased to provide for higher-speed and higher-quality printing at least 100 million drops per second, preferably at least 300 million drops per second, and more preferably at least 1 billion drops per second may be delivered.","Consequently, in order to accommodate printing at these speeds, the drive electronics , and particularly the controller(s) thereof, must calculate whether a nozzle is to eject a drop of ink at a rate of at least 50 million dots per second, and depending on the printing speed, at least 100 million dots per second, preferably at least 300 million dots per second, and more preferably at least 1 billion dots per second for the higher-speed, higher-quality printing applications.","For the colour printer  printing with the maximum width of A4 paper, the above-described ranges of the number of nozzles and print speeds results in an area print speed of at least 50 cmper second, and depending on the printing speed, at least 100 cmper second, preferably at least 200 cmper second, and more preferably at least 500 cmper second at the higher-speeds.","The above-described characteristics of the printer  enable it to print at high-quality of at least 1200 dpi, preferably at least 1600 dpi, in colour at the high-speed of at least 30 ppm, preferably at least 60 ppm. These characteristics coupled with the reduced footprint and size of the printer , as discussed earlier, results in a compact high-speed, high-quality printer which heretofore has not been possible. For example, the printer , not including the stand assembly , may be constructed to have an overall width of about 300 mm, an overall height of about 465 mm and an overall depth of about 230 mm for accommodating A4 paper as the maximum-sized paper. However, other dimensions are possible depending upon the application for the printer.","Thus, it is envisaged that the fully assembled printer  has a minimum total volume, i.e., the sum of the actual volumes occupied by the components of the printer  including the housing , the head unit , the source tray assembly  and the base unit , of about 30,000 cmand a maximum total volume, i.e., the overall space occupied by the printer , of about 40,000 cm. This results in a minimum printing rate to printer size (volume) ratio of at least about 0.002 ppm\/cmfor printing at 60 ppm. In cases where the printer  is able to print at even higher rates, i.e., more than 60 ppm and up to as much as 500 ppm for duplex printing as described earlier, a printing rate to printer size ratio of at least about 0.005 ppm\/cm, preferably at least about 0.01 ppm\/cmand more preferably at least about 0.02 ppm\/cmis possible.","Further, the components of the printer  including the housing , the head unit , the source tray assembly , the base unit  and the various components thereof can in the most part be moulded from lightweight material, such as plastic. As such, along with the above-described reduced size, the weight of the printer  can also be reduced. For example, it is envisaged that the printer  will have a weight of about 3.5 kg to about 4.6 kg. Thus, at the above-mentioned possible printing rates of the colour printer  beginning at about 30 ppm, a printing rate to printer weight ratio of about 0.2 ppm\/kg is possible. Even if different, heavier materials are used for constructing the components of the printer  a printing rate to printer weight ratio of at least about 0.5 ppm\/kg, preferably at least about 1 ppm\/kg, and more preferably at least about 5 ppm\/kg is possible as the printing rate is increased. Such printing rate to printer weight ratios are much better than those possible for conventional colour printers capable of printing at high-speed, since these printers are typically very large and heavy.","While the present invention has been illustrated and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, various modifications will be apparent to and might readily be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but, rather, that the claims be broadly construed."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","CO-PENDING APPLICATIONS","CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0111"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 13","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0114"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0115"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0119"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0120"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIGS. 23A and 23B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0122"},"figref":["FIG. 24A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0123"},"figref":["FIG. 24B","FIG. 24A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0125"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0127"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0128"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0129"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0130"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0131"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 31"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0132"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0133"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0134"},"figref":["FIG. 35","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0135"},"figref":["FIG. 36","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0136"},"figref":["FIG. 37","FIG. 36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0137"},"figref":["FIG. 38","FIG. 36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0138"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0139"},"figref":["FIG. 40","FIG. 36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0140"},"figref":["FIG. 41","FIG. 40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0141"},"figref":["FIG. 42","FIG. 41"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0142"},"figref":["FIG. 43","FIG. 36"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
