title: Remote multi-touch
abstract: A remote multi-touch system includes a pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device, a display separate from the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device, and a controller communicatively coupled to the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device and the display. The pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device measures a position at which one or more touches are executed on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device and, for each of the one or more touches, a force with which that touch is executed. The controller receives a touch report for each of the one or more touches from the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. Each touch report indicates the position at which that touch is executed and the force with which that touch is executed. The controller outputs to the display a pre-touch visualization command for displaying a pre-touch visualization. The pre-touch visualization is displayed at a location of the display mapped from the position at which that touch is executed on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Touch screen devices allow a user to control the device by physically touching images presented on the device. For example, a virtual button displayed by the device can be physically touched on the device as a way of actuating the virtual button. Until recently, such touch screen devices have only been able to recognize one touch input at a time. However, advances in touch screen technology have allowed multiple touches to be concurrently recognized. With the development of multi-touch, touch screen devices, powerful multi-touch input modalities are being established. In particular, many multi-touch gestures have been created that are believed to increase user enjoyment and productivity.","Remote multi-touch allows a user to perform multi-touch touch inputs on a pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device that is physically separated from a display device. The pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device measures a position at which one or more touches are executed. For each of the one or more touches, a force with which that touch is executed is measured. The display device displays a pre-touch visualization in response to gentle touches executed on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","Remote multi-touch allows a user to control a user interface by touching a surface other than the display surface visually presenting the user interface. Instead of touching the display surface directly, gentle touches on a remote pressure sensing array are interpreted as \u201cpre-touch\u201d events. Visual indications of the gentle touches are presented on the display so that a user can aim virtual finger positions on the interface. At increased force levels, the touches are interpreted as touch events, equivalent to a user touching a conventional multi-touch display surface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","12","14"]},"The pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device  measures a position at which one or more touches are executed on the device . In other words, the device is configured to detect the location where a user touches the device with a fingertip, stylus, or other object. Such detection may be performed independently for two or more different touches. As such, if a user touches the device with two separate fingers, the device measures the independent positions of each touch on the device. In the illustrated example, the device independently measures position where an index finger touches the device and position where a thumb touches the device.","Furthermore, the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device  measures the force with which each touch is executed. Like the position measurements, the force measurements are touch-specific. In other words, the force with which each touch is executed is measured independent of the force with which other touches are concurrently executed. It is to be understood that the pressure with which a touch is executed may alternatively and\/or additionally be calculated by dividing the touch force by the area to which the touch is executed. In some embodiments, the pressure of each touch (i.e., force of touch divided by area to which touch is applied) can be used to determine the touch force; and in some embodiments, the force of each touch (i.e., pressure of touch multiplied by area to which touch is applied) can be used to determine the touch pressure. It is to be understood that the methods described herein may use force and\/or pressure as a threshold criterion.","Controller  is communicatively coupled to the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device  and the display . In the illustrated embodiment, controller  and display  are integrated into a common device in the form of an all-in-one personal computer. This is not intended to be limiting. The controller may be part of a stand-alone computer, part of the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device , a component of an integrated device including both a display and a pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device, or otherwise incorporated in any suitable manner. Controller  is described in more detail with reference to .","Controller  may be communicatively coupled to the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device  and\/or the display  via any suitable wired or wireless connection. As nonlimiting examples, USB, USB 2.0, IEEE 1394, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.11x, HDMI, DVI, and\/or direct bus connections may be used.","As explained in more detail below with reference to , controller  is configured to implement logic for analyzing and processing multi-touch touch inputs that are executed on device . In particular, the controller is configured to recognize gentle touches as pre-touch events, and to cause the display to present corresponding pre-touch visualizations in response to such pre-touch events. For example, pre-touch visualization is displayed in response to the input touch at position , and pre-touch visualization is displayed in response to the input touch at position . Further, the controller is configured to recognize firm touches as touch events, and to report such touch events so that further action may be taken.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","32","30","16"]},"The format and mechanism of delivery of the touch report can vary without departing from the scope of this disclosure. In some embodiments, each touch report for each separate touch may be embodied as a unique data structure that is communicated from the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device to the controller. In such embodiments, such data structures may be packaged together with other data structures reporting different touches. In some embodiments, the touch report for each of the one or more touches may be an aspect of a common data structure received from the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. Furthermore, the touch report for each of the one or more touches may be embodied as an aspect of a signal received from the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. In any case, the touch report for each of the one or more touches may include a value indicating a variable resistance of the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device at a position of the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device where that touch is executed. It is to be understood that the above examples are not limiting. Multiple touches may be reported in any suitable manner that allows the position and force of each different touch to be separately considered.","At , method  includes determining if a force with which a touch is executed is below an activation threshold. Such a determination may be made for each separate touch independent of other touches. However, for the sake of simplicity, the following description describes method  with reference to a single example touch. It is to be understood that this touch could be executed concurrently with other touches, and method  may be independently applied to such other touches.","If the force is below the activation threshold (YES at ), method  proceeds to , where a pre-touch visualization command is output. For example, the pre-touch visualization command may be output from controller  of  to display  of . The pre-touch event may occur from a time of first touch until that touch reaches the activation threshold, and\/or the pre-touch event may occur while a touch is applied with any predetermined range of forces.","The pre-touch visualization command is configured to cause a display to display a pre-touch visualization (e.g., pre-touch visualizations and of ). The pre-touch visualization may have virtually any visual appearance without departing from the scope of this disclosure. As an example, the pre-touch visualization may look like a virtual fingertip\u2014i.e., a semi-transparent finger object in the shape of a fingertip displayed on the display so that the interface may be viewed through the semi-transparent finger object. As another example, the pre-touch visualization may look like a cursor.","The pre-touch visualization is displayed at a location of the display that is mapped from the position at which the corresponding touch is executed on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. In other words, each location of the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device may be mapped to a corresponding location of the display so that touches to a particular location of the device will predictably result in a pre-touch visualization being displayed at a corresponding location of the display. In some cases, different portions of the same pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device may be mapped to different displays (e.g., in a multi-display system configuration). Alternatively, separate pressure-sensitive, multi-touch devices may be paired with the different displays in a multi-display configuration.","As introduced above, each different touch of a user may be separately processed, even when such touches are executed concurrently. As such, the pre-touch visualization commands for each of the one or more touches may be collectively configured to display pre-touch visualizations for all touches concurrently executed on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. In other words, if a first touch and a second touch are concurrently executed, then a corresponding first pre-touch visualization and a corresponding second pre-touch visualization may be displayed together. The pre-touch visualizations are displayed while the corresponding touches are executed, thus providing the user with visual feedback as to where the user's touches will affect the user interface.","If the force is below the activation threshold (NO at ), method  proceeds to , where a touch input command is output. For example, the touch input command may be output from controller  of  to an operating system, application, or virtually any other system entity configured to receive user input commands. The touch input command may be output via an application programming interface (API), a system message, or virtually any other suitable mechanism. The touch input command may be configured similarly to a corresponding type of command that is output by a conventional multi-touch input device when a user touches a multi-touch display screen. As such, software designed for conventional multi-touch screen devices may be used with remote multi-touch devices.","The touch input command indicates the position at which a touch is executed on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. This may be accomplished by including, in the command, coordinates of the touch on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device, mapped coordinates of the display corresponding to the touched position on the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device, and\/or identification of a user interface element on which the pre-touch visualization is aimed.","Unlike a pre-touch, which may be used by a user to aim a finger to interact with a desired aspect of a user interface, the touch input command signals the actual multi-touch interaction with that aspect of the user interface. For example, a user may use a gentle pre-touch to position a pre-touch visualization on a virtual button of a user interface. In order to actuate that button, the user may more firmly press the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device while the pre-touch visualization is aimed at the virtual button. If the firm touch exceeds the activation threshold, the touch input command signals that the button is to be actuated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"sub":["0","0","0 "],"b":["40","40","42","44","14"]},"At time t, the pre-touch visualization  moves across user interface  because the touch of the user moves across the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. In this example, touch report  indicates that the touch moves to position [975, 420], and that the touch is executed with a force of [2.8], which is still less than the example activation threshold of [4].","At time t, touch report indicates that the touch has not moved but is now executed with a force of [5.2], which is above the example activation threshold of [4]. In other words, once the user aims the pre-touch visualization at button  with a gentle touch, the user executes a more firm touch. Because the touch force exceeds the activation threshold at time t, a touch input command is output to the example photo-editing application. As a result, the photo-editing application recognizes that the user has activated button , and thus executes a user interface operation associated with button \u2014i.e., rotating photograph .","In the illustrated embodiment, a post-touch visualization  is displayed when the touch force exceeds the activation threshold. The post-touch visualization may have a different visual appearance than the pre-touch visualization. As nonlimiting examples, the post-touch visualization may be a different color, shape, and\/or level of transparency than the pre-touch visualization. In some embodiments, the post-touch visualization may return to the pre-touch visualization if the force falls below the activation threshold but the touch is not fully lifted. The post-touch visualization provides the user with visual feedback as to when the device is touched with sufficient force to overcome the activation threshold.","Audio and\/or haptic feedback may also be used to provide the user with feedback as to when the device is touched with sufficient force to overcome the activation threshold. In particular, a haptic feedback signal may be output to the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device when the activation threshold is overcome and\/or an audio signal may be output to a speaker. The haptic feedback signal may be configured to cause the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device to provide haptic feedback to a user when a force with which a touch is executed exceeds the activation threshold. For example, the device may briefly vibrate when the force overcomes the activation threshold. Likewise, the audio signal may provide feedback in the form of a sound, such as a \u201cclick.\u201d","While the example illustrated in  shows a single touch, it is to be understood that the concepts discussed above may be applied to two or more touches that are concurrently executed. Furthermore, each touch input may be continuously monitored to determine each time a user exceeds an activation threshold and\/or falls below an activation threshold.","In some embodiments, the activation threshold may remain static. In other words, the same threshold is used to determine when a pre-touch changes to a touch (i.e., via increasing force) and when a touch changes to a pre-touch (i.e., via decreasing force). In some embodiments, the activation threshold is selectively variable. In other words, the threshold from switching from a pre-touch to a touch and\/or a touch to a pre-touch may change based on one or more factors. In some cases, a first activation threshold for a first touch may be selectively variable independent of a second activation threshold for a second touch.","In some embodiments, a different threshold is used to determine when a pre-touch changes to a touch (i.e., via increasing force) and when a touch changes to a pre-touch (i.e., via decreasing force). For example, the activation threshold may be selectively variable between at least a higher relative threshold and a lower relative threshold. The higher relative threshold may be used before a force with which a touch is executed initially exceeds the higher relative threshold\u2014i.e., higher relative threshold for switching from pre-touch to touch. The lower relative threshold may be used after the force exceeds the higher relative threshold\u2014i.e., lower relative threshold for switching back from touch to pre-touch.","When dragging a touch across the device, there may be unintended force variations. Because of this, the data may be filtered to ignore momentary dropouts.","When more than one finger is touching, the force provided by the wrist may be shared among a plurality of touch points. As such, the activation thresholds may be reduced as a function of the number of touch points.","Whether static or dynamic, the activation threshold can be set to any desired level. In general, the activation threshold is set to a level that allows gentle touches to be distinguished from firm touches so that a user can execute bi-modal touch inputs. Furthermore, the activation threshold may consider aspects other than absolute force. As an example, the activation threshold may consider a first and\/or second order derivative of force over time. In this way, a sudden increase in absolute force may be recognized, and such increase may signal a user's desire to actuate a button or perform a similar action.","The activation threshold for each touch may function independently of the activation threshold for all other touches, or a standard activation threshold may be applied to all touches.","In some embodiments, the above described methods and processes may be tied to a computing system including one or more computers. In particular, the methods and processes described herein may be implemented as a computer application, computer service, computer API, computer library, computer device driver, and\/or other computer program product.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["60","16","60","60","60"]},"Computing system  includes a logic subsystem , a data-holding subsystem , and a display subsystem .","Logic subsystem  may include one or more physical devices configured to execute one or more instructions. For example, the logic subsystem may be configured to execute one or more instructions that are part of one or more applications, services, programs, routines, libraries, objects, components, data structures, or other logical constructs. Such instructions may be implemented to perform a task, implement a data type, transform the state of one or more devices, or otherwise arrive at a desired result.","The logic subsystem may include one or more processors that are configured to execute software instructions. Additionally or alternatively, the logic subsystem may include one or more hardware or firmware logic machines configured to execute hardware or firmware instructions. Processors of the logic subsystem may be single core or multicore, and the programs executed thereon may be configured for parallel or distributed processing. The logic subsystem may optionally include individual components that are distributed throughout two or more devices, which may be remotely located and\/or configured for coordinated processing. One or more aspects of the logic subsystem may be virtualized and executed by remotely accessible networked computing devices configured in a cloud computing configuration.","Data-holding subsystem  may include one or more physical, non-transitory, devices configured to hold data and\/or instructions executable by the logic subsystem to implement the herein described methods and processes. When such methods and processes are implemented, the state of data-holding subsystem  may be transformed (e.g., to hold different data).","Data-holding subsystem  may include removable media and\/or built-in devices. Data-holding subsystem  may include optical memory devices (e.g., CD, DVD, HD-DVD, Blu-Ray Disc, etc.), semiconductor memory devices (e.g., RAM, EPROM, EEPROM, etc.) and\/or magnetic memory devices (e.g., hard disk drive, floppy disk drive, tape drive, MRAM, etc.), among others. Data-holding subsystem  may include devices with one or more of the following characteristics: volatile, nonvolatile, dynamic, static, read\/write, read-only, random access, sequential access, location addressable, file addressable, and content addressable. In some embodiments, logic subsystem  and data-holding subsystem  may be integrated into one or more common devices, such as an application specific integrated circuit or a system on a chip.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["68","68","68","60"]},"Display subsystem  may be used to present a visual representation of data held by data-holding subsystem  (e.g., pre-touch and post-touch visualizations). As the herein described methods and processes change the data held by the data-holding subsystem, and thus transform the state of the data-holding subsystem, the state of display subsystem  may likewise be transformed to visually represent changes in the underlying data (e.g., change from pre-touch to post-touch visualization). Display subsystem  may include one or more display devices utilizing virtually any type of technology. Such display devices may be combined with logic subsystem  and\/or data-holding subsystem  in a shared enclosure, or such display devices may be peripheral display devices.","The remote multi-touch techniques described herein may be applied to virtually any pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device. As one nonlimiting example,  schematically shows an embodiment of a pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device  including a resistor matrix . The resistor matrix  includes a plurality of column conductors  and a plurality of row conductors . The resistor matrix  includes a plurality of resistors . Each of the plurality of resistors  is located at a different intersection between a column conductor and a row conductor. Each of resistors  selectively connects a column conductor to a row conductor with a variable resistance.","Each of the plurality of resistors  may act as touch sensitive resistive switches that may be electrically closed by an applied force. The magnitude of the resistance associated with the resistive switch may be determined by the magnitude of the applied force. In other words, when no touch inputs are being physically applied to the pressure-sensitive resistive switches, the material has a high resistance and all of the switches are open.","The resistor matrix  may further include output pins  configured to apply a voltage to a corresponding column conductor. In some cases, one or more column conductors may be driven to a desired voltage and\/or one or more column conductors may be held at a virtual ground. The output pins  may be coupled to a logic subsystem . The logic subsystem  may apply different voltages to different output pins  to drive corresponding columns to different (or the same) desired voltages including virtual ground. The logic subsystem  may be configured to vary the voltages applied to the output pins  rapidly as part of a fast scanning technique to measure resistances of resistors connected to selected row conductors  and\/or column conductors  of the resistor matrix .","The resistor matrix  further includes a plurality of transimpedance amplifiers , each coupled to a corresponding row conductor  of the resistor matrix . Each of the transimpedance amplifiers  may act as a measurement circuit to measure a row current of a row conductor coupled to that transimpedance amplifier. Each of the transimpedance amplifiers  may be configured to hold a corresponding row conductor at virtual ground or another desired voltage to measure a row conductor. As an example, when a resistive switch is closed, such as due to the application of touch input, the row conductor and the column conductor are connected via the closed switch to complete the circuit. If the column conductor connected to the closed resistive switch is being held at a voltage that differs from the corresponding row conductor, current flows across the resistive switch to the transimpedance amplifier associated with that row. Since the transimpedance amplifier is holding the row at virtual ground, receipt of such current results in the transimpedance amplifier measuring the resulting row current to ground by outputting a proportional voltage to the logic subsystem . Accordingly, by setting a single column to a desired voltage while holding other columns in the row at virtual ground, a single resistor can set the current of each row and correspondingly the resistance of that resistor can be determined by the logic subsystem . The resistances measured at each of the plurality of resistors may then be analyzed and input touches applied to the pressure-sensitive, multi-touch device may be identified.","It is to be understood that the configurations and\/or approaches described herein are exemplary in nature, and that these specific embodiments or examples are not to be considered in a limiting sense, because numerous variations are possible. The specific routines or methods described herein may represent one or more of any number of processing strategies. As such, various acts illustrated may be performed in the sequence illustrated, in other sequences, in parallel, or in some cases omitted. Likewise, the order of the above-described processes may be changed.","The subject matter of the present disclosure includes all novel and nonobvious combinations and subcombinations of the various processes, systems and configurations, and other features, functions, acts, and\/or properties disclosed herein, as well as any and all equivalents thereof."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
