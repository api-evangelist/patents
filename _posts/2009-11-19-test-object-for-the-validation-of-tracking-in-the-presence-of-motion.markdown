{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/116,988 filed Nov. 21, 2008; the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention is generally related to medical devices, systems, and methods. In particular, the present invention is in the field of quality assurance and verification for radiosurgery or radiation therapy planning.","Radiosurgery and radiotherapy are hampered by motion of the patient during dose delivery. This motion results in less dose delivered to the target structure and, potentially, more dose delivered to critical structures than desired. Patients can be immobilized to reduce inadvertent motion but breathing, cardiac motion, and bowel motions are involuntary and cannot be prevented during the treatment period. A radiosurgery system has been developed (Accuray CyberKnife with Synchrony) that can detect breathing motion of the patient and move the radiation source to compensate for this motion. This system does not compensate for cardiac or other involuntary movements. Treatment plans can be created that take into account the reduction in precision produced by patient motion in order to predict the dose delivered to moving targets or critical structures.","Test objects have been developed that simulate movements due to respiration. Wong et al. [K H Wong, S Dieterich, J Tang, K Cleary, , Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment, 6:589-594, (2007)] describe using motion tables to simulate respiratory motion of a lung tumor and skin motion simultaneously for testing of the Accuray CyberKnife system. The Wong system allows a radiation detector to be moved in three dimensions to accurately reflect the position of a lung tumor while light emitting diodes are moved to reflect the position of the skin on the chest.","Accuray and Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc (CIRS) jointly developed a simpler test object for testing Accuray's CyberKnife with Synchrony system. This test object consists of two motors. One motor provides inferior-superior motion of a radiation detector and vertical motion of LED's (chest motion). A second motor rotates the radiation detector in an arc to provide additional motion.","Both the Wong and the Accuray\/CIRS test objects are designed to use a fiducial in the radiation detector that can be used for alignment with the radiation delivery system. This fiducial is automatically detected by an x-ray imaging subsystem. The radiation source is then moved based on the position of the fiducial.","Neither the Wong or the Accuray\/CIRS test objects has been applied to the motion of the heart. The contractile motion of the heart is substantially faster than the respiratory motion that these test objects were designed to mimic. It is speculated that the contractile motion of the heart is too fast for the Accuray CyberKnife Synchrony system to track. The Wong and CIRS\/Accuray test objects are used to test the motion that is tracked and not to test the compensation applied in the treatment planning stage for motion that is not compensated.","The heart exhibits complicated motion due to contraction. This motion causes different parts of the heart to move in significantly different ways. Therefore, tracking fiducials that are not located on the target area can subject the treatment to some error. This may, however be acceptable if the treatment area is not conducive to the placement of fiducial markers. The differential motion between the fiducial location and the treated location can be compensated in the treatment plan. However, the test objects developed by Wong and CIRS\/Accuray do not have any provision for differential motion between the fiducial and the radiation detector.","In light of the above, it would be desirable to develop a target motion simulator system having both respiratory and cardiac motion for use in verifying target tracking with a radiosurgery or radiation therapy device. It would be particularly beneficial if the systems were compatible with existing radiosurgery or radiation therapy systems.","The present invention generally provides target motion simulator devices, systems, and methods for quality assurance and verification for radiosurgery or radiation therapy systems. The invention is particularly well suited for simulating motion of moving targets, such as target tissues of the heart and tissue structures adjacent the heart, that move with the respiratory and cardiac or heartbeat motion.","In a first aspect, the invention provides a target motion simulator system for use in verifying target tracking with a radiation therapy device. The system comprises a radiation detection target coupled to a first motion actuator simulating a first motion of a first tissue and a fiducial coupled to a second motion actuator simulating a second motion of a second tissue offset from the first tissue, a component of the first motion having different frequency content than the second motion. A synthetic physiological signal generator is synchronized with the component of the first motion, wherein an output signal from the generator, in combination with a sensed position of the fiducial, may be used by the radiation therapy device in tracking the target.","In another aspect, the invention provides a target motion simulator system for use in verifying target tracking with a radiation therapy device. The system comprises a radiation detection target coupled to a first motion actuator simulating both a first respiratory motion and a first cardiac motion of a first tissue and a fiducial coupled to a second motion actuator simulating a second respiratory motion of a second tissue offset from the first tissue. An electrocardiogram (EKG) output signal generator is synchronized with the first cardiac motion, wherein an EKG output signal from the EKG signal generator, in combination with a sensed fiducial position signal, may be used by the radiation therapy device in tracking the target.","Optionally, the target motion simulator system may further comprise an internal fiducial coupled to a third motion actuator simulating both the first respiratory motion and a second cardiac motion. The internal fiducial may comprise a deformable heart shell around the target or proximate the target, or a portion of a catheter. In addition, the target motion simulator system may further comprise a radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure model coupled to a fourth motion actuator simulating both the first respiratory motion and a third cardiac motion.","In another aspect, the invention provides a target motion simulator system for simulating motion of a target having both respiratory and cardiac motion for use in verifying target tracking with a radiation therapy device. The system comprises an internal chest simulator coupled to a first respiratory motion actuator simulating internal chest respiratory motion with a radiation detection target coupled to the internal chest simulator with a first cardiac motion actuator simulating a first cardiac motion. The target movement includes both internal chest respiratory motion and first cardiac motion. An external skin simulator is coupled to a second respiratory motion actuator simulating external skin respiratory motion with an external fiducial coupled to the external skin simulator. An electrocardiogram (EKG) output signal generator synchronized with the first cardiac motion, wherein an EKG output signal from the EKG signal generator may be used by the radiation therapy device in tracking the target.","In another aspect, the invention comprises a method of using a target motion simulator system having both respiratory and cardiac motion for use in verifying target tracking with a radiation therapy device. The method comprises moving a radiation detection target with both a first respiratory motion and a first cardiac motion and moving a fiducial with a second respiratory motion. An electrocardiogram (EKG) output signal is simulated and synchronized with the first cardiac motion. The radiation detection target is tracked with the radiation therapy device using input from the EKG output signal and the external fiducial movement and fires a radiation dose from the radiation therapy device at the target.","Optionally, the method of using a target motion simulator further comprises moving an internal fiducial with the first respiratory motion and a second cardiac motion and tracking the internal fiducial with the radiation therapy device, wherein the radiation therapy device uses input from the internal fiducial movement in tracking the radiation detection target.","Optionally, the method of using a target motion simulator further comprises moving a model of a radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure with both the first respiratory motion and a third cardiac motion, tracking the radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure with the radiation therapy device and determining radiation received by radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure.","In another aspect, the invention comprises a method of using a target motion simulator system having both respiratory and cardiac motion for use in verifying target tracking with a radiation therapy device. The method comprises moving an internal chest simulator simulating an internal chest respiratory motion, moving a radiation detection target coupled to the internal chest simulator simulating a first cardiac motion, and moving an external fiducial coupled to an external skin simulator simulating external skin respiratory motion. Simulating an electrocardiogram (EKG) output signal synchronized with the first cardiac motion and tracking the radiation detection target and external fiducial with the radiation therapy device using input from the EKG output signal and the external fiducial movement, and firing a radiation from the radiation therapy device at the target.","Optionally, the method of using a target motion simulator further comprises determining radiation received by the target.","Optionally, the method of using a target motion simulator further comprises moving an internal fiducial coupled to the internal chest simulator simulating a second cardiac motion and tracking the internal fiducial with the radiation therapy device, wherein the radiation therapy device uses input from the internal fiducial movement in tracking the radiation detection target.","Optionally, the method of using a target motion simulator further comprises moving a radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure coupled to the internal chest simulator simulating a third cardiac motion, tracking the radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure with the radiation therapy device and determining radiation received by the radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure.","In another aspect, the invention provides a simulator system for simulating motion of a target for use in verifying target tracking with a radiation therapy device. The system comprises a movable primary actuator stage with a radiation detection target coupled to the primary actuator stage with a first movable secondary actuator stage, a combination of movement from the primary actuator stage and first secondary actuator stage simulating both a first respiratory motion and a first cardiac motion. A fiducial is coupled to the primary actuator stage with a second movable secondary actuator stage, a combination of movement from the primary actuator stage and second secondary actuator stage simulating a second respiratory motion, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) output signal synchronized with the first cardiac motion, wherein the EKG output signal may be used by the radiation therapy device in tracking the target.","The present invention generally provides target motion simulator devices, systems, and methods for quality assurance and verification for radiosurgery or radiation therapy systems. The invention is particularly well suited for simulating motion of moving targets, such as target tissues of the heart and tissue structures adjacent the heart, that move with the respiratory and cardiac or heartbeat motion. The cardiac motion is typically considerably faster than the respiration motion and the invention uses simulations of both motions in the target motion. The target motion simulator may be correlated to a heart signal sensor such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) or (EKG), with the EKG output signal being used by the radiation therapy device in tracking the target. Multiple models may be employed, including separation of the target motion into a cardiac motion and a respiration motion. In other embodiments, the target motion may be correlated to both cardiac and respiratory motion. Internal and external fiducials may be used, with each fiducial being moved with either respiratory motion, cardiac motion, or both. A radiation-sensitive collateral tissue structure or critical structure may also be simulated having respiratory motion, cardiac motion, or both.","The present invention may take advantage of many components included in or derived from known radiation delivery system components. Suitable system components may comprise:\n\n","In exemplary CyberKnife-based systems, the above 5 items may correspond to:\n\n","An exemplary CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system  is illustrated in . Radiosurgery system  has a single source of radiation, which moves about relative to a patient. Radiosurgery system  includes a lightweight linear accelerator  mounted to a highly maneuverable robotic arm . An image guidance system  uses image registration techniques to determine the treatment site coordinates with respect to linear accelerator , and transmits the target coordinates to robot arm  which then directs a radiation beam to the treatment site. When the target moves, system  detects the change and corrects the beam. Hence, system  makes use of robot arm  and linear accelerator  under computer control. Image guidance system  includes diagnostic x-ray sources  and image detectors , this imaging hardware comprising two diagnostics fluoroscopes. These fluoroscopes provide a frame of reference for locating the patient's anatomy, which, in turn, has a known relationship to the reference frame of robot arm  and linear accelerator .","Typically, a target and its surrounding tissue are first imaged using CT, resulting in a volume of data. The target volume is then delineated in this CT volume and a desired dose to the target is prescribed. Delicate or other tissue structures of concern in the vicinity of the target are also delineated and may be assigned a maximum desired dose that can be deposited at these structures. A computer program then receives the location and the shape of the target and the critical structures, the prescribed doses and the geometric configuration of the radiation delivery system and computes (a) the position and orientation of the beams to be fired and (b) a contour diagram showing dose received by all voxels in the CT volume. The radiation oncologist then reviews this data to see if the target is receiving the right dose and if structures in the vicinity receive too much dose. He or she may modify the boundaries of the target and the critical structures, along with dose received by them, to reach an acceptable treatment plan.","During treatment delivery, the target can be first registered with the coordinate system of the treatment delivery system by using the patient registration system. The treatment delivery system may also receive the beam positions and orientations from the treatment planning stage. It then positions and orients the Linac and fires the beams towards the target.","A preferred robot manipulator may be capable of positioning and orienting the Linac so that it follows the target due to breathing. Since Fluoroscopic imaging may be disadvantageous for the entire duration of the radiation delivery (optionally about 2 hours or more) because it subjects the patient to extra radiation, the tracking system may first build an intra-operative correlation model between the motion of the skin of the patient recorded by the imaging of external light emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted to the skin of the patient and any fiducials implanted in the vicinity of the target and seen in the X-rays. (The tumor itself need not be visible in the X-rays). Tracking of the LEDs using one or more cameras oriented toward the skin of the patient can then be used to determine data regarding the respiration cycle and the positions of tissues that move with the respiration cycle. More specifically, intra-operative correlation models can be built by taking a series of X-ray images in quick succession for one or more breathing cycles and at the same time, recording the position of the skin using the signals from the LEDs. Following this, the LED signals alone may be used for at least a portion of the tracking X-rays may be intermittently acquired to verify the validity of the correlation model. If the model is no longer sufficiently valid, a fresh model is generated by following the same procedure as before.","Targets in the heart (tumors or other types of targets) pose two challenges for radiation delivery systems:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},"Case 1: No (or Negligible) Cardiac Component; With Significant Respiratory Component","In this case, the target in the heart muscle has only a respiratory component and not a cardiac component. Targets in the left atrium near the pulmonary veins may fall into this category. The steps may include:\n\n","In Step 2 above both X-ray images and LED signals can be acquired using either prospectively or retrospectively gating. In prospective gating, the ECG waveform may be analyzed by a system module and X-ray images and LED signals can be acquired when the cardiac phase \u03a6 arrives in time. In retrospective gating, the X-ray images, LED signals and ECG samples are continuously acquired and saved with their respective time stamps. Later a separate module compares the time stamps of X-ray images and LED signals to the time stamps of the ECG samples to sort them into the appropriate cardiac phase. Alternatively, if retrospective gating is used, multiple CT volumes, CT(j), j=0, . . . , M\u22121, at cardiac phases \u03a6(j) may be acquired in Step 1 and X-rays and LED signals in Step 2 may also be acquired at any one of the cardiac phases, \u03a6(j). The registration in Step 3 will then be done by using CT and X-ray images corresponding to the same cardiac phase, \u03a6(j).","Case 2: With Significant Cardiac Component and With Significant Respiratory Component","The target in the heart muscle has both a respiratory component and a cardiac component. Targets in the ventricles near the valves fall into this category.","Approach 1:","1.

Alternatively, outline the target in one CT volume and automatically track it over all the CT volumes to generate the targets in other CT volumes.\n\n3. Pick one of the CT phases, \u03a6, as the reference phase. Acquire a series of pairs of N X-rays, X-rays(i), i=0, . . . , N\u22121, and N samples of the signals from the LEDs, LED(i), over 1 respiratory cycle at the cardiac phase \u03a6 as in Case 1 () using prospective or retrospective cardiac gating as before. Build a correlation model between LEDs(i) and X-rays(i) by following steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Case 1 and using the CT data from the cardiac phase, \u03a6.\n\n4. Following this, use the LED signal, LEDs(i) signal to determine the location of the target in the CT volume corresponding to cardiac phase, \u03a6, assuming the heart does not move due to cardiac motion (similar to Case 1). Then use the EKG signal, EKG(i), to determine the present cardiac phase, and add the offset off the target between the CT volumes of the present cardiac phase and the cardiac phase, \u03a6, to superimpose the cardiac motion component, and thereby to determine the present target position.\n\n5.

The actuators may simulate individual motion, such as respiratory or cardiac motion, or may simulate a combination of motions, such as both respiratory and cardiac motion. The actuators used for cardiac motion should be capable of motion similar to heart structures, for example speeds up to 5 cm\/s and accelerations up to 20 cm\/s. In order to achieve these speeds and accelerations, the radiation detector target mass must be minimized. Prior art test objects have used a structure or shell around the radiation detector in order to provide build up of absorbed dose in the tissue. Some of these prior art shells have been several centimeter thick and made of tissue equivalent materials. Shells of this sort are too massive to be accelerated easily and have been avoided in the present invention. Instead, dose modeling techniques are relied upon to provide accurate dose estimates without a shell for the radiation detector target. This is a conscious trade between dose measurement accuracy and motion fidelity that is justified by the significant effect that motion has on dose delivered to cardiac structures.","The actuators used in the target motion simulator system may be driven to simulate or match general physiologic position measurements or may simulate individual subjects. These measurements may be made using an electrophysiologic mapping system (CARTO) or biplane fluoroscopy. The CARTO mapping system records the position of a catheter inserted into the heart through a groin incision and was designed to determine a map of the atria of the heart for use for RF ablations. This system records 2 seconds of position data in order to determine an average location for a measurement point. By rapidly recording measurement points (less than 2 second intervals) while not changing catheter locations, the position of a single location can be recorded over 10-15 seconds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","10","100","105","110","115","120","110","105","110","115","120","115","120","150","155"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["100","125","130","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["200","205","210","205","215","210","220","225","210","205","230","235","230","240","235","245","250","255","250","205","255","240","245","250"],"sub":["1 ","2 ","1 ","1 ","2 ","2 ","2 ","1 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","3 "],"i":["a","a","a "]},"The following are more detailed description of various components of the phantom:\n\n","Note that all actuators can also carry any waveform, be it cardiac motion or respiratory motion or a combination of both.

Using a radiation detector without this build up region reduces the accuracy of the radiation measurements, but motion of the heart demands this compromise and the modeling techniques disclosed herein are sufficiently accurate to allow the compromise to be made. In addition, the use of separate actuators to move the radiation detector and fiducial(s) separately is not obvious. The problem is not apparent for therapy targets outside of the heart region. Within the heart region, it is not obvious that separate actuators can be aligned and synchronized with the accuracy required.","The ability of a target motion simulator system to move a radiation detector target with the same motion as a cardiac structure was tested using an optical tracking system and CARTO position measurements of the cavotricuspid isthmus. In order to measure the position, an LED was attached to a ball-cube radiation detector that was attached to the motion actuator.

The radiation detection target and fiducials are imaged , typically using a remote imaging modality such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound imaging, X-ray imaging, optical coherence tomography, a combination of these or other imaging modalities, and\/or the like. The imaging used in many embodiments may include a time sequence of three dimensional tissue volumes, with the time sequence typically spanning one or more cycles (such as a cardiac or heartbeat cycle, a respiration or breathing cycle, and\/or the like).","Based on the images, a plan  will be prepared for simulating treatment of the radiation detection target, with the plan typically comprising a series of radiation beam trajectories which intersect within the radiation detection target.

Embodiments of the invention may employ the 3-D volumes acquired in the imaging step  during the planning , with some embodiments making use of the motion model represented by the time sequence of 3-D tissue volumes so as to more accurately identify exposure of radiation outside of the radiation detection target, within radiation-sensitive collateral tissue models, inside the target, and the like. Planned timing of some or all of a series of radiation beams may be established based on the a synthetic physiological signal generator simulating a cardiac cycle, respiration cycle, and\/or the like so as to generate the desired dosages within the radiation detection target, so as to minimize or inhibit radiation exposure to radiation-sensitive collateral tissue, and\/or to provide desired gradients between the radiation detection target and radiation-sensitive collateral tissue. In some embodiments, the order of the planned radiation beams may be altered and\/or the trajectories of the radiation beams may be calculated in response to the motion of the model volume.","Once the plan  is established, the simulated treatment  can be implemented. The simulated treatment will often make use of a processor to direct movement of a robotic structure supporting a radiation beam source, along with registration, validation, and\/or tracking modules which enhance accuracy of the treatment. Tracking may employ the motion model developed during imaging , and\/or may also employ a separate intra-operative motion model. The treatment  step and the associated hardware may use a sensor and\/or input for physiological wave forms such as synthetic physiological signal generator synchronized with the radiation detection target and fiducials for use in such tracking.","While the exemplary embodiments have been described in some detail, by way of example and for clarity of understanding, those of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of modifications, adaptations, and changes may be employed.
