title: Techniques for sharing content on a web page
abstract: Techniques that enable content from a web page to be shared directly with one or more targets, which may be an application, a buddy from a buddy list (e.g., in a chat application), and the like. An embodiment of the present invention can identify contents on a web page that are to be made sharable and make the identified contents sharable. The content that is made sharable can then be shared with a share target using, for example, drag and drop operations. For example, a user may select sharable content on a web page, drag the content to a target, and drop it directly on the target thereby sharing the content with the target.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a non-provisional of and claims the benefit and priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/096,705 filed Sep. 12, 2008, entitled METHOD FOR SHARING CONTENT ON A WEBPAGE THROUGH EMBEDDED INSTANT MESSAGING, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to sharing of information, and more particularly to techniques for sharing content from a web page.","Web pages contain content of different types including text, images, video, flash, advertisements, embedded content, and the like. However, in spite of advances in web page content, the ability to easily share the content is still not available. For example, if a user wants to share an image displayed on a web page with a friend the user is having a conversation with in an instant messaging (IM) chat client, the user has to first store the image from the web page as a file on the user's computer. The user then has to select the stored file and send the file to the friend. This is quite cumbersome. Accordingly, better techniques for sharing web page content are desired. In another example, if a user wants to send this page to another friend in an instant messenger, the user must copy the URL from the address bar and then paste the URL into an IM window. Accordingly, better techniques for sharing web page content are desired.","Embodiments of the present invention enable content from a web page to be shared directly with one or more targets, which may be an application, a buddy from a buddy list (e.g., in a chat application), and the like. Techniques are described that can identify contents on a web page that are to be made sharable and make the identified contents sharable. The content that is made sharable can then be shared with a share target using, for example, drag and drop operations. For example, a user may select sharable content on a web page, drag the content to a target, and drop it directly on the target thereby sharing the content with the target.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a first content element that is to be made sharable is identified from a set of content elements contained by a web page loaded in a browser. The identified first content element is then made sharable. In one embodiment, first content element is made sharable by enabling the first content element to be dragged and dropped onto a target.","Various different techniques may be used to identify content that is to be made sharable. In one embodiment, the web page is scanned to identify a first set of one or more tags, each tag corresponding to a content element of the web page to be made sharable. The first set of tags may include a first tag corresponding to the first content element that is identified and made sharable. For each tag in the first set of tags, it is determined whether selection criteria corresponding to the tag is satisfied based upon attributes of the tag. A tag is selected from the first set of tags only upon determining that selection criteria corresponding to the tag is satisfied based upon one or more attributes of the tag. For each selected tag, the content element corresponding to the selected tag is made sharable.","Various different display techniques may be used to enable a user to easily identify web page content that has been made sharable. In one embodiment, the content element that is made sharable may be visually highlighted, for example, using borders, tooltips, etc.","Web page content that has been made sharable can be shared with one or more targets. In one embodiment, upon detecting that a sharable content element has been shared with a target, information is provided to the target that enables the target to access, view, or interact with the shared content element. In one embodiment, the information provided to the target comprises a uniform resource locator (URL) that enables the target to access the shared content element.","The targets with which content may be shared can be of different types. For example, the target may be an element of an instant messaging application. Upon detecting that content has been shared with an element of an instant messaging application, a message may be sent to an entity (e.g., a friend, a buddy) corresponding to the element of the instant messaging application that enables the entity to access, view, or interact with the first content element.","In one embodiment, code may be associated with a web page that enables one or more of the web page contents to the identified and made sharable.","The foregoing, together with other features and embodiments will become more apparent upon referring to the following specification, claims, and accompanying drawings.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details.","Embodiments of the present invention enable content from a web page to be shared directly with one or more targets, which may be an application (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Email, or even a Shopping Cart), a buddy from a buddy list (e.g., in a chat application), and the like. Techniques are described that can identify contents on a web page that are to be made sharable and make the identified contents sharable. The content that is made sharable can then be shared with a share target using, for example, drag and drop operations. For example, a user may select a sharable content on a web page, drag the content to a target, and drop it directly on the target thereby sharing the content with the target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"As depicted in , system  comprises several computer systems communicatively coupled to each other via communication network . In one embodiment, communication network  is the Internet. In alternative embodiments, communication network  may be any type of network that enables communications between the various computer systems including but not restricted to an Intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an Ethernet network, and the like, or combinations thereof. Different communication protocols, including wired and wireless protocols, may be used for data communications over network  including but not limited to TCP\/IP, SNA, IPX, AppleTalk, IEEE 802.XX suite of protocols, the Bluetooth protocol, and\/or other protocols or combination of protocols.","The computer systems depicted in  include a web server , a user system , and a 3party system . While only one web server and user system are shown in , system  may include several users systems and web servers. Likewise, system  may include multiple 3party systems. Web server  is configured to host one or more websites , each website comprising one or more web pages. Users may access web pages provided by web server  using user system . For example, a user may use an application such as browser  executing on user system  to access one or more web pages stored by web server . Examples of commonly used browsers include Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, and others. A user may request a new web page by providing a uniform resource locator (URL) corresponding to the web page to the browser or by clicking on a link in a web page. The new web page  corresponding to the URL or the clicked link is then fetched and output or rendered to the user by the browser.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, contents of a web page accessed by a user, such as web , can be made sharable. Making content on a web page sharable enables that content to be shared with a target. In one embodiment, making content of a web page sharable comprises enabling drag and drop functionality for the sharable content. In one embodiment, sharing the content with the target enables the target to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content. This may be done by communicating the shared content to the target as a result of the sharing and\/or by communicating information to the target that enables the target to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content.","In one embodiment, processing performed to make content on a web page sharable comprises identifying specific content on the web page that is to be made sharable and then making the identified specific content sharable. In one embodiment, this processing is performed by the user system upon loading of the web page whose content is to be made sharable. For example, when a web page is loaded, the web page is scanned to identify specific content that is to be made sharable and that identified content is then made sharable. Further details related to this processing are described below with reference to . Examples of content of a web page that may be made sharable include but are not restricted to images or photos displayed by the web page, videos or movies displayed by the web pages, flash videos, music, games including flash games, paragraphs of a web page, tables on the web page, links on the web page, embedded objects (e.g., flash objects, maps, contact information, files, custom content) on the web page, text (including user-selected text), and the like.","In one embodiment, visual indications may be provided for content on a web page that is made sharable to enable a viewer of the web page to easily identify the sharable content. The visual indications may come in various forms including drawing a border around the sharable content, changing the style (e.g., color overlays, font size, bolding, text style, etc.) of displaying the sharable content, structural alterations to the sharable content (e.g., the overlay of a \u201cDrag to Share\u201d graphic over the sharable content). The visual indications may be shown in static form and\/or in dynamic form. Dynamic visual indications are typically associated with cursor related events related to the sharable content. For example, a border around a sharable content may be drawn whenever there is as a mouseover event over the sharable content.","For content that had been made sharable, the user can then share content with one or more targets (also referred to as share targets). A share target may be another application such as a communication application (e.g., an email application, a chat application, an instance messaging (IM) application), a social network application (e.g., Facebook or Twitter which may execute in a separate tab of the browser), an editor application (e.g., MS WORD, image editing applications), a commerce application (e.g., a Shopping Cart, a Wish List), and the like. A share target may be a specific buddy or friend from a buddies or friends list in an IM chat, an email recipient, and the like. A share target may also include an active IM conversation represented by an IM window to a specific user. The targets may be represented in different forms including an icon, an image representing a target, a window, etc. A target application may be running in many forms (e.g., locally on the user system, online on the user system's web browser, remotely on another user's system, remotely on a server, remotely on a mobile device).","As indicated above, in one embodiment, making content sharable comprises enabling drag and drop capability on the content. In such an embodiment, sharable content may be shared with a shared target using a drag and drop operation. For example, a user viewing a web page comprising sharable content may select the sharable content using an input device such as a mouse, drag the selected content to a share target, and then drop the dragged content on the share target. The action of dropping the selected content on the share target initiates the sharing process for the content to be shared with the share target.","The effect of sharing web page content with a share target enables the share target to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content. The actions that are performed upon sharing content with a target may depend upon the nature and context of the share target. As an example, suppose that a user viewing a web page via browser  wants to share sharable content (e.g., an image or video displayed on the web page) with a specific buddy from a list of buddies in an IM chat  executing on user system . The user may drag the sharable content from the web page and drop it onto a window or other element of IM chat window  representing the specific buddy. This causes a message to be sent to the specific buddy comprising the sharable content or comprising information that enables the buddy to access, view, and\/or interact with the sharable content. In this manner, the sharable content is shared with the IM buddy. As another example, the user may drag and drop the sharable content from the web page onto a communication application such as email application  executing on user system . In this instance, dropping the sharable content on email application  may cause a new email message to be opened with the sharable content included or attached to the email message. As another example, if the sharable content was dropped onto a particular email or on a particular contact, then a message may be sent to the particular email sender or to the particular contact comprising the shared content or comprising information that enables the particular sender or particular contact to access, view, and\/or interact with the sharable content. As yet another example, suppose that the user wants to share the sharable content with a friend in his social network such as in Facebook or Twitter. The user may drag the sharable content from the web page and drop it onto a representation of the friend in a Facebook or Twitter window . This causes a message to be sent to the friend comprising the sharable content or information that enables the friend to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content. As another example, if the sharable content is dragged and dropped into an editor (e.g., a text editor, image editor, video editor), the editor may be opened and the shared content made usable via the editor. As yet another example, the target may be a shopping cart. The user may drag an image on a web page and drag the image to the shopping cart. The image may represent an item to be purchased (e.g., shoes, a book) and dropping the image on the shopping cart enables the shopping cart to add the items represented by the image to a shopping list for the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"200"},"At a high level, the method for making content on a web page sharable can be divided into steps that are performed at design time and steps that are performed at run time when a user accesses a web page. As depicted in , at design time actions may be performed that set up the infrastructure to enable sharing of content of web page content (step ). In one embodiment, as part of the design time actions, the provider of a web page associates code or instructions with a web page whose one or more contents are to be made sharable. The code is associated with the web page such that the code is executed at the user system when the web page is accessed by a user. When the code is executed at run time, the contents of the web page that are to be made sharable are identified and made sharable.","In one embodiment, the code that is associated with the web page to make the page's contents sharable may be provided by the web page provider. In an alternative embodiment, the code may be provided by a 3party such as Meebo, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. In the alternative embodiment, the code may be stored on a system  (in ) of the 3party and exposed to web page providers via a set of application programming interfaces (APIs). A web page provider may include such an API call in the web page code such that the function referenced by the API is called and executed when that web page is loaded by the browser on a user system and execution of the function causes one or more contents of the web page to be identified and made sharable. In one embodiment, the code corresponding to the API is executed by the browser on the user system. The code may be in various different languages. In one embodiment, the code is in a scripting language such as JavaScript. The APIs may also include APIs for customizing and controlling the process of making content on a web page sharable.","For example, in one embodiment, the provider may include the following JavaScript b function call in the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) code for the web page whose contents are to be made sharable:\n\n","The discoverSharable function provides a simple and convenient way for a web page provider to enable web page content sharing on web pages (on entire web sites) provided by the provider. The discoverSharable function may be included with every web page associated with a web site or only a select set of web pages. A web page provider may deliberately not want to make contents of some web pages sharable and thus could exclude those web pages from executing the discoverSharable function in their code. The web page provider has complete control over which web pages execute the discoverSharable function. The web page provider thus has complete control over which web pages contain sharable content.","In one embodiment, the types of content that are made sharable by execution of the discoverSharable function can also be configured\/customized. For example, a particular web page provider may only want to make images and videos contained by a web page to be made sharable. In such a scenario, the discoverSharable function may be configured such that only images and videos, if any, contained by a web page are identified and made sharable. The other content that a web page may contain is not made sharable. In this manner, the type of content that is made sharable can be controlled. In another embodiment, APIs may also be provided that enable a web page to specifically mark content to be made sharable or alternatively to specifically mark content that is not to be made sharable optionally taking precedence over the configuration that specifies which content types are to be made sharable.","In the embodiment described above, the web page provider has to take actions to associate specific code that enables sharing with a web page. In an alternative embodiment, the ability to make web page content sharable may be provided directly to the user, without involving the web page provider. In this alternative embodiment, the user may download code that enables content to be made sharable and associate the code with a browser executing on the user system. For example, the user may download the code from 3party system  and associate the code with the browser as a plug-in. In this embodiment, the code may be configured to execute whenever a new web page is loaded by the plug-in-enabled browser. In another embodiment, a user can execute the code from the 3party system  by activating a bookmarklet, which in many browser systems consists of JavaScript code embedded in a bookmark. Activating the bookmarklet executes the JavaScript code on the page, causing the identification of sharable content. In these alternative embodiments, the web page provider does not have to do anything to enable web page content sharing. This also implies, however, that the web page provider cannot control which pages are enabled for content sharing.","Once design-time actions have been performed to enable web page content to be made sharable, the actual processing to identify the content and make it sharable is performed during runtime. During runtime processing, a user may request a particular web page using an application such as a browser executing on a user system (step ). The web page may be requested for example by the user providing the URL for the web page to the browser. Alternatively, the web page may be requested as a result of the user clicking on a link on another web page already loaded by the browser. The web page requested by the user is then loaded by the browser and displayed to the user (step ).","If the discoverSharable function is included in the source code for the accessed web page (or the browser is enabled with a plug-in configured to make web page content sharable), the discoverSharable function is executed upon loading the web page (step ). As part of , the web page is scanned to automatically identify contents of the web page that are to be made sharable (step A). One or more of the contents identified in A are then made sharable (step B). Processing may be performed to add visual indicators (either static or dynamic) to the web page contents made sharable in B to enable a user to easily determine which web page content is sharable (step C). The contents made sharable in B are then available to be shared with one or more share targets (step ).","As described above, the discoverSharable function (or any such code) associated with a web page is executed when that web page is loaded by a browser. This may be sufficient for a static web page wherein the content of the web page does not change after the web page has been loaded. However, many web pages are capable of dynamically loading content without requiring the entire web page to be reloaded. As a result, the contents of such a web page may change subsequent to the initial load of the page with new or changed content being added to the web page dynamically. In such a scenario, the discoverSharable function (or any such code) may be called multiple times (e.g., each time that new content is loaded onto the web page, each time the web page modifies its current content). In this manner, the new or changed content can also be discovered and made sharable. The web page provider can control when the discoverSharable function is to be executed since the provider knows when the web page content changes. In one embodiment, the discoverSharable may be automatically called periodically. For example, the frequency of execution of the function can be time based, for example, the function may be configured to execute every 5 minutes. In this manner, content on dynamic web pages may also be identified and made sharable.","Structurally, a web page comprises one or more elements that represent the contents of the web page. Examples of elements contained by a web page include but are not restricted to an image, a sound, a video, a table, a heading, a paragraph, a division, an embedded element, and the like. An element of a web page can contain other elements. For a web page constructed using a markup language such as HTML or dynamic-HTML, each element contained by the web page is identified in the source code for the web page using one or more HTML tags. For example, an image element is contained within an <img . . . \/> tag, a sound element may be contained within an <audio . . . \/> tag, a video element may be contained within a <video . . . \/> tag, a table is contained within <table> and <\/table> tags, a paragraph is contained within <p> and <\/p> tags, a division element is contained within <d> and <\/d> tags, embedded content including plug-ins, audio, and video content may be contained within <object . . . \/> or <embed . . . \/> tags, and so on. In this manner, specific contents or elements of a web page can be identified based upon the corresponding tags contained in the source code of the web page. These tags are accordingly used by an embodiment of the present invention to identify specific content of the web page that is to be made sharable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"300"},"Upon execution of the discoverSharable function, the source code (e.g., HTML code) of the web page is scanned to identify tags corresponding to content elements of the web page that are to be made sharable (step ). For example, if images and video content are to be made sharable, then in  the web page is scanned for tags that contain image and video content. For example, the web page may be scanned for <img> tags corresponding to images. For video content, the web page may be scanned for <embed> tags, or <video> tags, or other tags that contain video content.","In one embodiment, as part of the scan performed in , other information related to the identified tags may also be determined. For example, for an <img> tag, the source of the image may be scanned for within the body of the <img> tag attributes. Likewise, for an <embed> tag, the source of the embedded content may be scanned for within the attributes of the <embed> tag. Further, for some tags, a check is made for parent tags (tags which contain the tag being examined) to find relevant information. For example, an <a> tag associated with the <img> tag might provide a relevant location for the sharable item. In this example, as described below, the scan determines the information to be communicated to a target when the image corresponding to the <img> tag is shared with the target. In one embodiment, if there is no <a> tag associated with the <img> tag, then the URL of the current web page containing the <img> tag is sent to the target, else the URL referenced by the href attribute of the <a> tag is sent to the target. This could occur when a user is sharing a photo from a gallery of photos intending to share a photo with a target rather than the entire gallery.","As indicated above, a web page provider may specifically mark a content element to be made sharable or alternatively specifically mark a content element to be not made sharable. These markings are also checked for as part of the processing performed in . If a tag corresponding to a content element is marked to be made sharable, then that tag is included in tags to be made sharable. If a tag is marked for non-sharing, then that tag is excluded from the tags identified in  even though the tag would otherwise have been selected for inclusion.","In one embodiment, the web page content elements corresponding to the tags identified in  are made sharable. In another embodiment, the elements corresponding to the one or more tags identified in  are candidates for being made sharable. The candidates identified in  are passed through a filtering step to determine one or more of the candidates that should be made sharable. The filtering step is used to narrow down the elements that are made sharable. For example, a web page may contain several small images including images that are artwork or part of the user interface of the web page. These small images are typically not the ones that a user shares with targets. These small irrelevant images would be identified in  but should preferably be filtered out in the filtering step.","Accordingly, from the one or more tags identified in , only those tags that satisfy predefined selection criteria are selected to be made sharable (step ). In one embodiment, whether or not a tag satisfies the selection criteria is determined based upon one or more attributes associated with the tag. For example, whether an <img> tag corresponding to an image element satisfies the selection criteria defined for <img> tags is determined based upon the attributes of that <img> tag. Different selection criteria may be configured for the different types of tag. For example, the selection criteria specified for an <img> tag may be different from the selection criteria specified for an <embed> tag.","In one embodiment, the selection criteria for an <img> tag specifies that the <img> tag is to be selected to be made sharable only if the associated height attribute value (measured in pixels) is at least 70 and the associated width attribute value (measured in pixels) is at least 70. Per such selection criteria, an image element of a web page is selected to be made sharable only if the image is at least 70\u00d770 pixels in dimension. Accordingly, an <img> tag identified in  is selected in  to be made sharable only if the associated height attribute value is at least 70 pixels and the associated width attribute value is at least 70 pixels. This filters out images that may have been identified in  but are smaller than 70\u00d770 pixels.","In one embodiment, the selection criteria for an <embed> tag specifies that the <embed> tag is to be selected to be made sharable only if the associated height attribute value (measured in pixels) is at least 300 and the associated width attribute value (measured in pixels) is at least 250. Per such selection criteria, an embedded video element of a web page is selected to be made sharable only if the video element is at least 300\u00d7250 pixels in dimension. Accordingly, an <embed> tag identified in  is selected in  to be made sharable only if the associated height attribute value is at least 300 pixels and the associated width attribute value is at least 250 pixels. This filters out videos that may have been identified in  but are smaller than 300\u00d7250 pixels.","Other heuristics may also be used to specify the selection criteria for a tag type. These heuristics may include, for example, the content file size, content element location in the web page structure, content source location, or other content-related attribute or metadata.","The web page contents corresponding to the one or more tags selected in  are then made sharable (step ). A content element is made sharable by associating actions with the content element that enable the content element to be shared with a target. In one embodiment, a content element is made sharable by associating actions with the element that enable drag and drop capability for that element. Actions may be associated with the content element in the form of one or more event handlers that are associated with the content element and that enable drag and drop functionality for the content element. An event handler specifies one or more actions to be performed upon occurrence of an event. According to an embodiment of the present invention, one or more event handlers may be associated with a sharable content element that specify one or more actions to be performed when an event related to the sharable content element occurs, such as when the sharable content element is selected, dragged, and\/or dropped onto a target.","For example, for an image corresponding to an <img> tag that is to be made sharable, event handlers are added to the <img> tag to enable drag and drop capability. These might include an event handler for a mouse-related event such as an onMouseOver event so that when a user moves his or her mouse over the image, a visual indicator (e.g., borders, drop shadows, animated tooltips over or above the image reading \u201cDrag to Share\u201d) will prompt the user to share. Other event handlers responding to onMouseDown and onMouseMove events may detect if the user is starting to drag the sharable content element. Once the user starts dragging the mouse, a share interface appears and indicates the share targets as locations where the sharable item being dragged may be dropped.","For the content elements that are made sharable in , processing may be performed to visually highlight the elements as being sharable (step ). The visual indications may come in various forms including drawing a border around the sharable content, changing the style (e.g., color overlays, font size, bolding, text style, etc.) of displaying the sharable content, and structural alterations to the sharable content. The visual indications may be shown in static form or in dynamic form. Dynamic visual indications are typically associated with cursor related events related to the sharable content. For example, a border around a sharable content may be drawn whenever there is as a mouseover event over the sharable content. A mouseover event occurs when a mouse cursor enters over the sharable content displayed on the web page. Dynamic visual indications may also include changing the appearance of the cursor (e.g., a mouse cursor) when there is a mouseover event on a sharable element, providing a tooltip when the user hovers the cursor over a sharable element without clicking it, etc. A tooltip is a graphical user interface element that displays a small hover box that appears with supplementary information regarding the item being hovered over. The supplemental information may indicate that the hovered over item is a sharable web page element.","In one embodiment, visual indications are added to a web page element by adding styles and\/or actions (e.g., using event handlers) to the tag corresponding to the sharable element. For example, an event handler may be added that causes a border to be drawn around the sharable content element, a tooltip to appear, etc. when the mouse cursor is moved over or hovers over the sharable content element on the web page. In one embodiment, default styles may be defined. For example, by default a shadow around a sharable content element may be created on a mouseover over the sharable element. The default behavior may be changed. For example, APIs may also be provided that enable a web page provider to change or customize the default styles.","In one embodiment, a setSharableStyle function is provided that enables the default behavior to be changed or customized. In one embodiment, the setSharableStyle function call takes the following parameters:\n\n","For each content element made sharable in , metadata may be determined and added to the tag corresponding to the content element (step ). In one embodiment, the metadata determined and added to a tag corresponding to a sharable content element comprises information to be communicated to a target with which the content element is shared. Further details related to the metadata are provided below. The content elements made sharable in  are then available for sharing (step ).","In the manner described above, contents (also referred to as content elements) of a web page are dynamically determined and made sharable. While  and the associated description describes how to identify and make image and video content elements sharable, this is however not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. In alternative embodiments, other content elements of a web page may also be made sharable.","After a content element of a web page has been made sharable that element can be directly shared with a target. Sharing a content element with a target enables that target to access, view, and\/or interact with the content element being shared. In one embodiment, when a content element is shared with a target, the following items are provided to the target as a result of the sharing (e.g., as a result of the drag and drop operation):\n\n","In one embodiment, as part of execution of the discoverSharable function, metadata is determined and associated with a sharable content element comprising information related to the URL, thumbnail, title, description, and type for the content element.

In one embodiment, as part of the processing to identify a thumbnail to be used for shared video, an attempt is made to find a thumbnail by querying the service provider providing the video on the web page. Many service providers such as YouTube provide APIs that can be used to query information about a video, such as title of video, whether there is a thumbnail for the video, etc. These APIs may be used to find metadata information for video content, including determining a thumbnail for the video. If the service provider cannot provide any information for the video, then a generic default thumbnail may be used.","In one embodiment, metadata may be determined, created, and attached to sharable content during execution of the discoverSharable process. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the metadata is determined ahead of when the sharable content is actually shared with a target. In another embodiment, the metadata may be determined, created, and attached to sharable content when the user starts sharing that content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":"400"},"Processing may be initiated when a user selects a sharable content element and starts dragging the content element (step ). For example, the user may use a mouse to select a sharable content element and start dragging the element. In response to the selection and dragging, a thumbnail corresponding to the selected content element is displayed and shown as being dragged (step ). Optionally, as the user drags the element, a list of potential drop targets may be indicated (step ). In one embodiment, icons representing potential drop targets may be displayed proximal to the dragged element. In another embodiment, potential drop targets may be visually highlighted (e.g., shadows or borders drawn around the potential target icons\/windows). In another embodiment, dragging a sharable element may cause a closed buddy list (e.g., from an IM application) to open showing buddies which may be potential drop targets. In yet another embodiment, minimized dialogs or windows for potential target applications may open in response to the dragging. In another embodiment, non-visible targets may be made visible in response to the dragging.","The dragged content element may then be dropped onto a target (step ) to indicate that the dragged content element is to be shared with the target. Examples of targets include one or more friends or buddies in a chat client or social networking application, dialogs or windows of a chat client, friend presence elements in a web page, other elements of the chat client or web page (possibly associated with a particular friend\/buddy or friends\/buddies), any application, a shopping cart, and the like. In general, any entity with which a user viewing a web page would like to share information may be a target.","Various actions may be performed upon dropping the dragged element onto a target that enable the target to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content (step ). As previously described, the actions that are performed may depend upon the context of the target. For example, if the sharable content is dropped onto a friend in an IM chat client, a message is sent to the friend including a URL (and possibly additional metadata such as a title or thumbnail) that the friend can use to access, view, and\/or interact with the sharable content. The friend can then click on the URL link sent in the message to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content. In one embodiment, clicking the URL link directs the friend to a web page from where the content can be accessed, viewed, and\/or interacted with.","In general, actions are performed in  that enable the target to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content element. In one embodiment, the shared content itself may be included in the message sent to the target. In another embodiment, rather than sending the shared content, instead information (e.g., a URL) that enables the target to access, view, and\/or interact with the shared content may be sent. Sending a URL link instead of the shared content itself reduces the amount of data that is provided to the target. This is especially helpful when the shared content is very large in size and cannot be sent via a message to the target. Further, in one embodiment, clicking the URL link may redirect the target user to a web page from the web site of the web page provider that provides access to the shared content. This may be desired by the web page provider since it directs users to the provider's web site.","In some embodiments, as part of , the target with which the content is shared may also be visually highlighted. For example, a border may be drawn around the target. In some embodiments, a log may be stored on the user's system identifying targets and content that has been shared with each target. This provides the user with historical information regarding the user's sharing activities so that the user can easily access a list of recently shared content later.","As described above, embodiments of the present invention enable web page content to be directly shared with one or more targets. For example, a user may share web page content directly from a browser to an IM client target. The intermediate step of downloading and saving the content to the client\/desktop is not required. Embodiments of the present invention make sharing of web page content easy both from the perspective of the web page provider and the end user. The web page provider can associate code with a web page whose contents are to be made sharable. In some embodiments the code itself may be provided by a 3party and the web page provider simply has to include an API function call to the code in the web page's code. From the user's perspective, being able to directly share web page content with a target, for example by using drag and drop operations, reduces the time and effort needed for the content sharing.","Various functions and APIs may be provided for customizing the manner in which content to be made sharable on a web page is identified and made sharable. For example, as described above with respect to step  in , selection criteria is used to select which tags will be made sharable. In one embodiment, default selection criteria may be configured for the various types of tags (or types of content) to be made sharable. For most web page providers, the default selection criteria may be sufficient. However, some web page providers may want to change and customize the default criteria to have more control over which content become sharable. For such customization, in one embodiment, the discoverSharable function can be called with parameters that override the default parameters. For example, the following function call may be made:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0091"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Meebo.exec(\u2018discoverSharable\u2019, {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003minImageWidth : 200,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003minImageHeight : 200,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003minVideoWidth : 400,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003minvideoHeight : 300,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003}"]},{"entry":[{},");"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":["The minImageWidth parameter specifies the new minimum width for an <img> tag to be made sharable.

The discoverSharable function can be configured to make specific content elements (e.g., only images and video content) sharable. A web page provider may however want more control on what content is made sharable. Further, there may be times when a content element is not selected for sharing, possibly because the element does not satisfy the selection criteria, but is to be made sharable. Alternatively, in some situations, a web page provider may not want to use the discoverSharable function and instead want to \u201cmanually\u201d identify content elements to be made sharable. For such instances, in one embodiment, a makeSharable function is provided that enables specific content elements to be marked for sharing. The web page provider may include a function call in the source code for the web page to the makeSharable function. The code for the function may be resident on the system of a 3party such as Meebo, Inc. In one embodiment, the function is called as follows:","Meebo.exec(\u2018makeSharable\u2019, element_ID)","The element_ID identifies the content element that is to be made sharable.
