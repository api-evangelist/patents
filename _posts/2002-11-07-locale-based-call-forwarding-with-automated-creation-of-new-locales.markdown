Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, systems, and products for locale based call forwarding.","2. Description of Related Art","Conventional call forwarding services offered by telecommunication providers face fundamental usability challenges. Despite the fact that users are often located at the same locales and often forward the same numbers in dependence upon the user being at those locales, call forwarding services require a user to initiate a new call forwarding instruction each time the user forwards a telephone number. Many users are unwilling to take the time to program a call forwarding instruction. Rather than take the time to program a call forwarding instruction, the user misses a telephone call despite being located at a usual locale. It would be beneficial therefore to have methods of locale based call forwarding. It would be beneficial also to have methods of locale based call forwarding including an ability to automatically create new locales in dependence upon reported physical locations of users.","The present invention provides methods of call forwarding that include tracking recent locations of a user with the user's mobile personal communications device and a wireless telecommunications network; determining whether the recent locations match a set of historical location records identifying a locale for the user; creating, if the recent locations do not match a set of historical location records, a new set of historical location records identifying a new locale for the user in dependence upon the recent locations; and forwarding a telephone number in dependence upon the new locale. In typical embodiments, determining whether the recent locations match a set of historical location records identifying a locale for the user includes comparing a plurality of recent locations and a set a historical location records. Typical embodiments include creating, if the recent locations do not match a set of historical location records, a new set of historical location records identifying a new locale for the user in dependence upon the recent locations further comprises storing the plurality of recent locations as a new set of historical location records. In this type of embodiment, creating a new set of historical location records identifying a new locale for the user in dependence upon the recent locations includes storing the plurality of recent locations as a new set of historical location records, and creating a new locale record; wherein the new set of historical location records are related to the new locale record through a foreign key.","In typical embodiments, creating a new locale record further comprises obtaining a user-specified new locale name from a user for the new locale and storing the user-specified new locale name in a new locale name record, wherein the new locale record is related to the new locale record through a foreign key. In typical embodiments, obtaining a user-specified new locale name from a user for the new locale comprises contacting the user and receiving the user-specified new locale name. In many embodiments, the method of the invention includes creating a new call-forwarding record for a new locale.","In many embodiments, creating a new call-forwarding record for the new locale comprises obtaining a user-specified call forwarding number from a user for the locale and storing the user-specified call forwarding number in a call-forwarding record. Many embodiments include creating a new a phone number record for the new locale and creating a new a phone name record where the new phone name record is related to the new phone number record through a foreign key. In many embodiments, creating, if the recent locations do not match a set of historical location records, a new set of historical location records identifying a new locale for the user in dependence upon the recent locations includes editing the new set of historical records.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.","The present invention is described to a large extent in this specification in terms of methods for locale based call forwarding.

SLEE applications are event driven applications, sometimes referred to as asynchronous. SLEE applications receive requests for services in the form of events. One way to build an event driven application is to provide a single event handler method to receive all events. When such an event handler receives an event, it inspects the event and directs further processing of the event with a switch statement, switching on the event type of the event. The switch statement implements the event routing logic within the application.","The SLEE component model is an alternative way of implementing event driven applications that models the external interface of an event driven application as a set of events that the application can receive. Each event type is handled by its own event handler method. This enforces a well-defined event interface. The event driven component model allows the SLEE to provide the event routing logic for the application. In a SLEE, events are defined entities each of which has an event type.","SLEE applications comprise components known as Service Building Block or \u2018SBB\u2019 components. Each SBB component is identified with event types accepted by the component. Each SBB component has event handler methods that contain application code that processes events of these event types.","A SLEE event emitted by an event producer is routed and delivered to a component identified with the event's event type. A SLEE (or a SLEE server) has a logical event router. A SLEE event router receives events emitted from event producers, identifies SBB components interested in the events, and delivers events to the interested SBB components.","An SBB component may be a parent or a child to zero or more other SBB components, forming SBB component entity trees having a root SBB component at the root position of such a tree. A SLEE is the logical parent of the all root SBB components.","A root SBB component is an SBB component that may be instantiated by a SLEE to process events. A root SBB component is identified with event types whose occurrence causes the SLEE (or its logical event router) to instantiate an instance of the root SBB component. Such SBB components are known as root SBB components because their instances may serve as roots of SBB entity trees.","A root SBB component typically represents a complete service. For example, an application developer may develop a CallBlocking SBB component and a CallForwarding SBB component to implement a call blocking service and a call forwarding service. These SBB components are root SBB components because instances of them may be instantiated to block and forward calls respectively. The application developer may create a new root CallBlockingAndForwarding SBB component to implement the call blocking and forwarding service from the CallBlocking SBB and CallForwarding SBB.","The architecture of  includes a call forwarding application () running on a SLEE server ().

The location information stored in the locationID () field includes data such as, for example, mobile communication tower numbers, geophysical coordinates, latitude, longitude, global positioning coordinates, and any other location data provided by any location provider, as will occur to those skilled in the art. An example of a location provider is AT&T Wireless. The \u201cFind Friends\u201d service provided by AT&T Wireless provides to third parties the location of a registered wireless phone to the nearest cell phone tower.","A location provider may be a wireless telecommunication provider providing wireless communication service to the mobile personal communication device. The accuracy of the location in the locationID field () is dependent upon the precision with which the location provider identifies the physical location of the mobile personal communication device. Wireless communications providers identify the location of a mobile personal communication device by identifying one or more of the many communication towers in communication with the mobile personal communication device. The signal strength of the mobile personal communication device and the known location of the communication towers in communication with the mobile personal communication device provides an approximate location of the mobile personal communication device.

Each locale record represents a physical condition of a user for which a call forwarding system according to embodiments of the present invention will provide a particular arrangement of call forwarding. \u2018Physical condition of a user\u2019 means any physical configuration of a person that can be detected and identified. It does not mean merely a physical location. On the contrary, it often means that a user is in motion across several or many physical locations. Each physical condition of a user that can be tracked for call forwarding and that is sufficiently meaningful to the user to be identified as such is represented in data structures by a locale record and referred to in this disclosure as a \u2018locale.\u2019 Each locale carries with it one or more call forwarding instructions for telephone numbers that the user is authorized to forward. The locale records () are related many-to-one to the user records () through the userID field () used as a foreign key.

The forwarding instruction records () are related to the locale records () many-to-one through the localeID field () used as a foreign key. Each forwarding instruction record represents an instruction from the user to forward a particular telephone number when a user's physical condition is associated with a particular locale. Each forwarding instruction record () includes a forward-from field () identifying the telephone to be forwarded according to a forwarding instruction record. A telephone number that the user has authority to forward is identified in the forward-from field (). The telephone number stored in the forward-from field () is a telephone number that the user specified to be forwarded in dependence upon the user's locale. Alternatively, the forward from-field () includes a phone name corresponding to a telephone number that the user specified to be forwarded in dependence upon the user's locale. The forwarding instruction record () also includes a forwarding-to field (), representing a telephone number to which calls are to be forwarded. Alternatively, a phone name corresponding to a telephone number is stored in the forward-to field ().","The data structures of  include locale name records ().
