title: Hydrocarbon well information portal
abstract: A networked information management system and architecture for managing files and documents pertaining to oil and gas wells and properties. On request by an authenticated user, a client workstation displays geographical information system (GIS) layers, via a web collaboration portal, for a region of the earth at which wells or properties may be located. The wells or properties within the displayed region enable links to documents or files associated with those wells and properties, and by way of which the system user can access the documents and files. Both structured and unstructured data elements can be accessed by the system. A collaboration portal allows for standardized access to the data, and also for simultaneous or collaborative access to the data. Workflow management capability is also implemented.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. Nos. 61\/377,329 filed Aug. 26, 2010, and 61\/387,234 filed Sep. 28, 2010, and entitled \u201cHydrocarbon Well Information Portal,\u201d which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","Not applicable.","This invention is in the field of natural gas and oil (hydrocarbon) production. Embodiments of this invention are more specifically directed to the management of information regarding properties at which natural gas and oil wells are being drilled or are producing.","The economics of the oil and gas industry continue to raise the stakes for optimized hydrocarbon production. As well known in the art, the costs of drilling new wells and of operating existing wells continue to rise due to many factors. For example, new wells must be drilled to extreme depths, often in relatively inaccessible locations, in to reach remaining producible quantities of oil and gas. The cost of operating wells and production facilities also continues to rise. In addition, the integrity of producing wells must be monitored and maintained as necessary, adding additional cost to the overall production business. These high costs, as well as the relatively high prices for oil and gas in the world market, have placed significant pressure on the oil and gas producer to optimize oil and gas production in both the near and long term, while closely watching costs in doing so.","The optimization of production from a field or reservoir often involves decisions regarding the number and placement of wells, including whether to add or shut-in wells, and if so, where to do so. Once a decision has been made to drill a well, the logistics of drilling the well involves a wide range of personnel and factors. Geologists and geophysicists are involved in determining the location, depth, and direction of the well; engineering personnel are involved in arranging the specifics of the well itself; land personnel are involved to ensure that the proper rights and approvals are in place; and facilities personnel are involved to provide the appropriate support materials and equipment, including facilities for receiving well output, to name a few. Project management personnel are also involved to schedule the deployment of the necessary drilling personnel, and to specify and negotiate the necessary contracts with drilling contractors and other contract personnel and organizations. The personnel involved in these decisions are often dispersed, including personnel in different office locations, field personnel, mobile personnel, and personnel in different organizations and companies.","After a well is in place, decisions continue to be made regarding its operation. In addition, secondary and tertiary recovery operations, for example involving the injection of water or gas into the reservoir, require decisions regarding whether to initiate or cease such operations, and also how many wells are to serve as injection wells and their locations in the field. Some wells may require well treatment, such as fracturing of the wellbore if drilling and production activity have packed the wellbore surface to the extent that production has slowed. In some cases, production may be improved by shutting-in one or more wells for an extended period of time, in which case the optimization of production may require reconfiguring the entire production field.","All of these actions are performed with an eye toward maximizing production at minimum cost. As evident from these examples and as known in the art, the optimization of a production field is a complex problem, involving many variables and presenting many choices. In addition, the number and complexity of the decisions involved in drilling and operating new wells has increased with the depth and complexity of these new wells, increasing the number and nature of decision points involved in the operation of the overall reservoir.","Recent advances in technology have increased the amount of information that can be acquired from various locations and facets of an oil and gas field, and as such have enabled advanced computational and analysis techniques to extract useful information about the field from that information. Downhole and surface transducers provide real-time and periodic measurements of well conditions and operational status. Well logs, core samples, and other measurements of the formations and strata intersected by each well are also obtained, lending insight into the reservoir at and beyond the wellbore. Of course, production rates from each well and from the production field as a whole are measured over time. Beyond measurement data, documents such as field reports, maintenance records, engineering analyses, and the like that are pertinent to one or more wells in the production field are also prepared over time, and provide important insight into well history and past decisions. Some information is proprietary to the operator (e.g., status and parties to leases, location and attributes of pipelines, locations of other wells, locations of private roads, etc.), while other information important to the production operation is publicly available (e.g., topography of the production field, locations of rivers, roads, utilities, etc.). Not only is a large amount of pertinent information available, but this information exists in many forms.","Another trend involves the economies of scale that are enjoyed by larger operators in managing a large number of wells and properties over wide areas of the earth. Because of the size, number, and complexity of properties being managed, these larger operators often have many professionals involved in the management of the production effort, with these personnel often located at various facilities around the world. Various personnel also have diverse areas of skill and expertise applicable to the management of oil and gas production. As such, it would be useful for these diversely-skilled personnel, at multiple locations, to collaborate in making short term and long term decisions regarding the management of the oil and gas properties.","However, even with modern conventional information management systems, this collaboration and the resulting decisions are hampered by the time required to gather, exchange, correlate, and verify information among these people of different disciplines and at various locations. As a result of these trends and circumstances, the management of information relating to potential and producing oil and gas fields and properties, which has always been a large task, has become even larger. Unfortunately, conventional information management systems are limited in many ways. For example, documents and files pertaining to individual wells are often maintained in any one of a number of places within the overall information management system of a producer, especially in the case in which the wells being managed are located in many parts of the country or world. This dispersion of well files and documents renders it difficult for a decision maker to obtain the correct information quickly and efficiently. As a result, time-critical decisions are sometimes based on incomplete or out-of-date information and data, even if up-to-date information in fact exists somewhere in the overall information management system.","In addition, the content structure of these various files and documents varies widely. Measurement data and other objective measures pertinent to the operation are typically stored in a highly structured data set. Other information is semi-structured, while other information such as written reports and communications are essentially unstructured. Besides this variation in the structure of production field information, organizations often store these files and documents in an ad hoc manner, dependent largely on the personnel involved in generating and retaining such information. As a result, a good amount of the overall information pertinent to the oil and gas production operation is rendered essentially inaccessible or inscrutable to those personnel who are unfamiliar with the structure and organization of certain files and documents, such as those maintained in connection with a remote production field or under the supervision of a different organizational sub-unit. This variation in structure and organization is exacerbated upon an operator acquiring an existing production field or facility, as the acquired information pertinent to that acquired field or facility is necessarily of a different structure and organization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","4","2","3","5","6","2"]},"Operationally, this conventional information arrangement is cumbersome, insofar as rendering accurate and timely decisions are concerned. As visualized in , the interpersonal communication and interaction at plane  is ad hoc, with each interaction requiring some sort of meeting or other communication initiated by one party and participated in by others. And the access of information from information plane  is also ad hoc, generally requiring knowledge of the location and format of a particular item of information, or of an ad hoc index or other catalog of information. Typically, the manner in which information is stored in this rudimentary generic information management arrangement is dependent on the person storing the information, and as such can vary widely from sub-organization to sub-organization, or from person to person.","These difficulties in information management and decision making as reflected in  are compounded by the rate at which significant new well information is acquired by modern measurement and communication technology. Due to the ad hoc or otherwise compartmentalized organization of many conventional information management systems, such new information is not readily made available to or accessible by the appropriate personnel, particularly when such personnel are dispersed among sub-organizations and locations.","Embodiments of this invention provide an information management system and method that provides easy access to and management of documents and data related to the exploration and production of oil and gas from various properties, in a geophysical context.","Embodiments of this invention provide such a system and method that maintain documents and files regarding the individual wells and production fields being managed in a current \u201cevergreen\u201d state, including within workflows for the wells and fields.","Embodiments of this invention provide such a system and method that improve decision making across operational disciplines by facilitating collaboration among professional personnel in connection with the operation of the properties.","Embodiments of this invention provide such a system and method that reduce the cycle time of field operations, and that reduce the time to ramp-up production from new resources deployed in the properties.","Embodiments of this invention provide such a system and method that integrates structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and information containers in a manner that is accessible via a common user interface.","Other objects and advantages provided by embodiments of this invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having reference to the following specification together with its drawings.","Embodiments of this invention may be implemented into an information management system and method of operating the same in which documents and files pertaining to individual oil and gas wells are accessible by way of a portal enabled to display the various wells and properties via a geographical information system (GIS). More specifically, a client workstation displays, in a map or other geographically-oriented format, the location of various wells and production fields. Each item (well, property, etc.) displayed in this format has links or contextual menus that allow selection of one or more documents or well files pertaining to that well or property, and specifically a most-current version of those documents and files. Workflows for each well or property can also be accessed via this GIS-enabled portal, in a manner that facilitates collaboration. Related information to the property, including financial and engineering data and documents, can also be accessed directly from the geographical display. In addition, other geographical features and facilities pertaining to that property can be displayed, and interrogated under user control. For example, one or more display layers are selectable, by way of which the user can view the attributes of the assets.","According to another aspect of the invention, an information management system and method of operating the same is provided that aggregates and integrates various and disparate items of information, including structured data files, semi-structured files, and unstructured information, and conveys that information in a meaningful way to a client by way of a geographical display and arrangement. The aggregated information includes proprietary information and publicly available information. The geographical display is provided with multiple displayable layers, by way of which various types of information pertinent to the assets can be displayed and accessed. In each case, the document or file itself is made available by way of the geographical user interface.","According to aspects of this invention, individual wells and properties proximate to one another can be efficiently viewed and analyzed by each user. Access to most recent information and status regarding each well and property is provided, regardless of the organizational position or physical location of the user; indeed, multiple users can simultaneously or sequentially access these files for each well in a collaborative effort. As a result, management of production fields and properties is facilitated, and can be more readily and efficiently optimized from an economic standpoint.","The present invention will be described in connection with its embodiments, namely as implemented into a networked computer system distributed over multiple locations, for managing information from multiple producing natural gas and oil fields. However, it is contemplated that other information management systems and businesses using such systems can also benefit from this invention, particularly in the management of information regarding geographically dispersed installations and equipments. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the following description is provided by way of example only, and is not intended to limit the true scope of this invention as claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","4","1","4","1","4"]},"In this generic arrangement, multiple data centers DC, DC are deployed and managed by the operator. In this example, data center DC is in communication with production fields FLD, FLD in its general geographic vicinity, and data center DC is in communication with production fields FLD, FLD. Data centers DC, DC can include storage resources for storing data, measurements, and information concerning its associated production fields FLD through FLD; personnel of the operator can also be deployed at or near these data centers DC, DC to manage and analyze those data, measurements, and information. Headquarters facility HQ is located in a different part of the country, in this example, and serves as the location of management and other technical personnel who manage and analyze the data, measurements, and information acquired in the various production fields FLD through FLD, as well as analysis results prepared by personnel at data centers DC, DC, in the field, or elsewhere in the overall system. The communication links between production fields FLD through FLD and their respective data centers DC, DC, as well as between data centers DC, DC themselves and with headquarters location HQ, are conventional wired or wireless (e.g., satellite) communication links.","As such, in a typical operator's information management system, data and information concerning properties and facilities at various geographic location can be dispersed among the various data centers DC, DC, at headquarters facility HQ, and also at the production fields FLD through FLD themselves. Each of the personnel deployed at these various locations may have an interest in data stored at a different location, for example in determining action to be taken at their particular location or equipment, in making larger scale decisions regarding the overall management of the operator's business. As such, it is useful for these personnel to have access to information from production fields and data centers, company-wide, to the extent that may be authorized. In addition, to efficiently and accurately carry out these responsibilities, it is often optimal for personnel at different locations, and with diverse sets of skill and experience, to collaborate in the management and decision-making process. The distribution of available information among the various operating sites, the dispersion of personnel among these operating sites, and also idiosyncrasies in the manner in which information is arranged and stored among these various sites and facilities, results in a daunting information management task.","It has been observed, in connection with this invention, that the geographical relationship of wells and other field-equipment and facilities is a useful way to visualize and manage disparate sources of information to assist in the decision-making and management processes. Wells in the same region, or tapping into the same reservoir (or into connected strata of the same reservoir, or into different but connected reservoirs) have common characteristics that are useful in management of the field, but of course may also be interrelated via the reservoir itself. In other words, action taken at one well affects the production from another well. In addition, maintenance and operational personnel are often deployed to the wells themselves, such that a plan or schedule of using these personnel at other wells in the vicinity can result in efficient utilization of personnel. According to embodiments of this invention, this geographical relationship among nearby wells and production fields is used in the management of information concerning those wells and properties.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","3","1","3","1","2","2","3","4","3"]},"In the architecture shown in , the overall information system is represented by multiple \u201cservers\u201d, including authentication server . The term \u201cserver\u201d has a broad meaning within the field of information management and technology. Fundamentally, a \u201cserver\u201d is a computer executing a computer program to provide a service in response to a request from a client. As such, the same physical computer hardware may be executing multiple server applications, each providing a different service to different clients; in other cases, a single computer may be operating as both a client (executing a client application) and also as a server (executing a server application) responding to that client. Server software may be resident and operating on multiple physical computers to provide a single server function to a client. In a purely hardware sense, the term \u201cserver\u201d typically refers to a computer hardware that is designed and constructed primarily to execute server applications and perform server functions, for example together with other hardware \u201cservers\u201d in a \u201cserver farm\u201d.","To summarize, those skilled in the art will comprehend that the server architecture described in this specification in connection with  is not necessarily representative of a one-to-one correspondence between each server function and a single computer. Rather, it may be useful to consider the servers of  as \u201clogical\u201d servers, realized by server applications being executed on individual physical server computers or as distributed server applications operating on one or more physical server computers. It is contemplated that the architecture illustrated by the physical representation in  will be helpful to the skilled reader in understanding the construction and operation of the system according to embodiments of this invention, and that those skilled in the art having reference to this description will be able to readily implement these and other logical servers that are useful in realizing information management according to embodiments of this invention.","In any case, the physical server computer executing each server application, as shown in , includes program memory in the form of computer-readable media storing the server applications. These server applications are in the form of computer program instructions that, when executed by one or more processors within the physical server computer, cause those processors and other peripheral functions in the physical server computer to perform the functions performed by the server including those described in this specification.","Referring to , WAN  and router  connect to authentication server , by way of which access to the overall system is granted (or denied) to client systems C through C. Authentication server  ensures that a particular user and client system Cx (referring to one of client systems C through C in this arrangement) is authorized to access the information system, for example by way of a certificate-based login, username\/password combination, and the like. In addition, authentication server  can operate to control the particular resources to which a particular user or client system Cx is to be permitted access, and the level of privilege to be afforded to that user (e.g., read-only, read-modify, delete, etc.) relative to those resources. For authorized users and client systems C through C, authentication server  provides access to one or more web servers W, W.","Web servers W, W represent one or more computers operating web server applications, by way of which the client applications executing at client systems C through C can access the various information sources and applications provided by this information management system. As known in the art, an application such as a web browser executing at one of client systems C through C accesses one of web servers W, W, more specifically a web server application executing at that web server W, W that receives user inputs and requests via the web browser client, and that communicates responses as appropriate to that web server application. According to one embodiment of this invention, web servers W, W store and execute MICROSOFT OFFICE SHAREPOINT SERVER (MOSS) applications, which constitute web server applications that provide web-accessible services in a manner that enables and facilitates collaboration among multiple users. As known in the art, the MOSS framework provides a web-based user interface to client systems C through C, by way of which users at those client systems C through C can access web applications executed at web servers W, W as well as at other servers in the information system. The collaboration portal provided by the MOSS user interface facilitates that user access and collaboration, and also provides a uniform user interface to all users accessing the information management system.","Web servers W, W respond to requests from client systems C through C, within the web applications executed on web servers W, W. In some cases, web servers W, W access procedures, programs, routines, or scripts available at one of application servers A, A. As known in the art, application servers A and A refer to software resources, and the computer hardware executing those software resources, that allow other computer resources (e.g., web servers W, W, and client systems C through C) to access and execute software components provided by application servers A and A. As mentioned above, the particular computer hardware operating as application servers A and A may or may not be the same hardware serving as one or more of web servers W and W; in addition, the numbers of web servers W, W and application servers A, A may vary from one to several.","One function of application servers A, A is to operate as an extended virtual machine for the web applications executing at web servers W, W, by transparently managing connections between client systems C through C and various databases in the overall network implementing the information management system and architecture according to embodiments of this invention. In the example of , database servers D and D are in communication with application servers A, A, respectively. As known in the art, database servers D, D refer to software resources, and the computer hardware executing those software resources, that provide database services to a requesting computer or process. Such database services include responding to structured queries provided by the accessing resource, which in this case may correspond to one of web servers W, W executing a procedure provided by one of application serves A, A in its operation as an extended virtual machine. In the architecture of , database server D is also directly accessible to web servers W, W (i.e., without executing a procedure provided by application servers A, A), to carry out database services in connection with its memory resources. Examples of database servers D through D known in the art include SQL, Oracle, DB, Informix, and Ingres database servers.","According to embodiments of this invention, database server D provides its database services in connection with geographic information service (GIS) database . As known in the art, and as will be described in further detail below, GIS database is a structured database including various types of geographical information that are selectably retrievable for individual plots of land or geography. Database server D provides its database services in connection with database store , in which data provided to and generated by various software applications are stored; database server D also allows access to configuration database , in which various configuration information relative to the information management system and architecture of this embodiment of the invention is retained. Database server D also provides its database services in connection with file store , at which various files and documents relevant to the management of relevant oil and gas properties may be stored. Database server D provides its database services in connection with other databases, including production database containing production data for the relevant oil and gas properties, competitor database containing data obtained relative to competitor wells and facilities at those relevant oil and gas properties, working interest database containing data corresponding to determination of the working interests in the relevant oil and gas properties, and well header database containing data related to specific wells, primarily in connection with the geographical location of the specific wells.","The illustration of  shows, as mentioned above, a hardware-oriented arrangement of the various servers, services, and functions of an information management system according to embodiments of the invention.  illustrates this information management system and architecture in the form of a software-based architecture, without referring to particular computer resources (including hardware resources) providing those resources and services, as a unified information management experience. Those skilled in the art having reference to this description will readily comprehend this organization of the information management system, as will now be described.","As shown in , users access the information management system via user authentication module , by way of which access to some or all of the information managed by the system is controlled. For example, a username and password combination may be required of the user; other security techniques such as certificates, biometric validation, and the like may alternatively be interrogated and evaluated by user authentication module . Other security features may also be implemented by way of user authentication module , such features including user groups of users having similar permission levels. Further in the alternative, different data resources in the system may require different username\/password combinations or different log-in credentials.","Assuming successful validation of the credentials of the user by user authentication module , presentation layer module  is made accessible to the user. Presentation layer module  serves as the base portal framework and user interface to the information management system of embodiments of this invention. It is contemplated that this interface will appear to the user, at his or her client system Cx, in the form of a familiar website interface. For example, as indicated in , presentation layer module  makes various functionality available to the user. Web site function  corresponds to the function executed by presentation layer module  that presents a web page interface to the user, including such functionality as links, common menu functions, and the like. Various \u201cweb parts\u201d are also arranged and presented by presentation layer interface . GIS web part  (or \u201cweb widget\u201d) refers to a portable object of computer-readable code that is installed and executed from within web site . Essentially, GIS web part  is a stand-alone executable application, executed by the computer resource carrying out the function of presentation layer module  (e.g., web servers W, W of ), within the context of the displayed web site. In this context, GIS web part  provides access to, display of, and navigation within, geographical information that is accessed from a GIS database (as described below). Document web part  is another web part, in the form of an executable application, by way of which various data and documents stored within the information management system and architecture according to this embodiment of the invention, are accessed.","As will be described in further detail below, GIS web part  cooperates with document web part . More specifically, GIS web part  is realized by program code that includes custom code (e.g., custom .NET code) that integrates the GIS navigation and display functions with document web part , so that the user can access documents by way of and within the context of the display of GIS information accessed via GIS web part .","Presentation layer module  can be realized using conventional collaboration interface software known in the art. In embodiments of this invention, as described above, MICROSOFT OFFICE SHAREPOINT SERVER (MOSS) applications are web server applications useful for providing the web-accessible services of presentation layer module , as described herein. As known in the art, this MOSS framework is useful in providing a common interface by way of which multiple users can readily collaborate. As such, it is contemplated that the collaboration portal of the MOSS user interface provides a uniform user interface to all users accessing the information management system, and is thus a useful choice for implementation of presentation layer module  of .","By way of web parts ,  in presentation layer module , or otherwise via web site function , authenticated users can access and invoke execution of various applications . In this architecture, GIS web part  accesses application server , by way of which component procedures such as processes, routines, and the like are acquired for execution under user control via presentation layer module , in connection with the accessing of GIS information. These functions provided (and, perhaps, executed) by application server  include access to GIS server . GIS server  in  refers to the software functionality by way of which geographical information in GIS database is accessed in response to user input via presentation layer module . A commercially available example of GIS server , and useful in connection with the information management system and architecture of embodiments of this invention, is the ArcGIS SERVER software package available from ESRI, preferably including the ArcSDE spatial data management server. In any case, GIS server  provides web-oriented spatial and geographical database services in accessing GIS database , for display to the user via presentation layer module . In the example in which GIS server  is realized by the ArcGIS SERVER software package and the ArcSDE server, GIS database may be realized as a relational database of the geographical information.","Applications , to which presentation layer module  provides access according to embodiments of this invention, also include document web service , which provides access to various documents relating to the oil and gas properties being managed. Web service  refers to an application programming interface (API) that is accessible via document web part  in presentational layer module , by way of which the user obtains access to document server applications . According to embodiments of this invention, the document services in this architecture are implemented by way of the DOCUMENTUM enterprise content management platform, available from EMC Corporation, in cooperation with the DOCWAY content management software products available from Wingspan Technology, Inc. In that context, document web part  is implemented as a DOCWAY web part, which cooperates with web service  (e.g., an installation of a DOCWAY web service) to access and execute document server applications  of , which are implemented (in this example) by an instance of a DOCWAY web server. In this example, document server applications  include document content server , document repository , and workflow engine . Document server  executes the requested queries, search terms, browsing commands, and the like received via document web part , to access associated application data sources , which in this example include data store and file store . Web service  is also capable of directly providing database services with configuration database , containing user and configuration information, including configuration information relating to integration with GIS data.","Document server applications  also access external data information server . External data information server  is a database server (e.g., database server D of ), for example a COMPOSITE information server available from Composite Software Inc., by way of which document server applications  can access data sources  containing information originally acquired and stored outside of the DOCUMENTUM system. As described above, these data sources  include production database containing production data for the relevant oil and gas properties, competitor database containing data obtained relative to competitor wells and facilities at those relevant oil and gas properties, working interest database containing data corresponding to determination of the working interests in the relevant oil and gas properties, and well header database containing data related to specific wells. These data sources  can also include external data sources maintained by other entities, such as IHS Inc. For example, external data sourced by IHS can include information pertaining to individual wells, such as a well name, the API number for the well, details about the location of the well, etc.; data available in the public domain that pertain to competitor wells; and the like. Applications , and web service , are capable of correlating and associating data obtained from these external (i.e., external to document server applications ) data sources  with the data and documents obtained from data sources . As mentioned above and as will be described in further detail below, these contents stored in external data sources  and information obtained from data sources  are integrated, at presentation layer module , with GIS information obtained by GIS server , to provide an integrated geographical access tool to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["10","25","23","24","26","27","25","25","23","24","26","27","23","24","25","25","25","25","23","24","26","27","25","25","25"],"i":["a","a","a ","b ","c "]},"GIS web site  within presentation layer module , as described above, includes GIS web part  () that accesses GIS server  (via GIS application server  as described above), to obtain the desired GIS information for display via web site . As will be described in further detail below, GIS web site  allows selection of various \u201clayers\u201d of the GIS information to be queried by GIS server  and displayed within web site . In addition, as shown in the logical presentation of , GIS web site  also accesses web service  (for example, via GIS web parts  and document web part ) to access documents associated with a particular geographical area, as may be obtained by GIS server . For example, GIS web part  within GIS web site  may make a request to web service  by passing a unique well identifier (or API) as may be identified by the user from displayed GIS information. Web service  may be hosted on the presentation layer module  server (e.g., MOSS server), if desired. Web service , after validating that the user has sufficient permission for the access, connects to document server , which executes the communicated query and returns the result of that query, as obtained via content server as shown in , to GIS web site  for communication and display to the user via web site , for example by way of a frame or tab corresponding to GIS web site . An example of a suitable server application for document server  is the DOCWAY suite of content management products available from Wingspan Technology, Inc. Documents pertaining to the displayed geographical area may be presented by document management web site , for example by way of a pop-up window in the form of a \u201ccabinet\u201d of the contents of a folder for that well, including or alternatively by way of a hyperlink to that folder or file. Users may, similarly, upload documents pertaining to a particular well at a specific GIS location by way of this connection.","Document management web site  allows the user, via web site , to access or view documents separately from the GIS display. In this example, document management web site  includes several web parts, or web widgets, including an inbox web part, a search web part, and cabinet (browsing) web parts. The web parts included within document management web site  interact with document server , which hosts the web services required by the document web parts of document management web site ; those web services of document server  access content server , and thus the data and files stored in the corresponding sources  ().","Workflow management web site  provides a workflow-based environment for managing business and operational processes, particularly those that are document-centric, in connection with the various wells and properties being managed. As known in the art, the term \u201cworkflow\u201d refers to a defined sequence of connected operations or steps (\u201cactivities\u201d) involved in accomplishing a particular objective, such as drilling or operating an oil or gas well. In general, operations or steps within a workflow may have dependencies, because some steps cannot begin until other steps are completed. In the context of the information management system and architecture according to embodiments of this invention, and as will be described below, various users within functional groups create, edit, or approve documents that contribute to the operations of the well; according to embodiments of this invention, these documents are maintained in a centralized well database, such as databases , , , (). Typically, one user initiates a workflow for a particular well or property; based on the defined process and associated documents for each step of the process, and other users will receive a message indicating they have a \u201ctask\u201d that requires their attention in order for the workflow to proceed to the next step. Workflow management web site  provides an environment by way of which current workflow tasks (i.e., tasks awaiting completion), documents prepared or in process in connection with a workflow, or workflows created or \u201cowned\u201d by a particular system user, can be retrieved by a system user based on his or her identity. These documents and files are accessed by way of queries generated and executed by document server , via content server ","Support web site  provides access to support and \u201chelp\u201d documents for the information management system, and also admin web parts by way of which the configuration and operation of the system can be configured and modified.","Another view of the information management system and architecture according to embodiments of this invention, as applied to oil and gas wells and properties, is illustrated in  in a form indicative of the various data elements and functional data flow paths.","As shown in , the users access the system by way of web-based collaboration portal , as invoked and displayed at their respective client systems C through C (). As mentioned above, typically the program code for web-based collaboration portal  is stored, fetched, and executed at a different physical computer from client systems C through C, with client systems C through C merely viewing that execution by way of a web browser application and interface. For example, in the arrangement of , web servers W, W may correspond to the computing resource executing the program code (i.e., presentation layer module ) for web-based collaboration portal . In any case, web-based collaboration portal  corresponds to the interface provided by presentation layer module  described above in connection with , for example by way of web site  (). Each of the users accessing web-based collaboration portal  thus view a common interface, by way of which these users can view the same information at the same time (e.g., during an online \u201cmeeting\u201d), or at different times in a collaborative effort, regardless of their physical location or organizational assignments and boundaries. Web-based collaboration portal  provides tools (e.g., web parts) that allow the users to access (search, browse, etc.) various sources of information, in an integrated manner. According to embodiments of this invention, the integration of the available data and information is performed on a geographical basis, using GIS information and layers, such that the data and information, whether structured (i.e., database contents) or unstructured (documents in text or image form), can be identified and viewed according to the geographical position of the wells and properties to which the data and information pertain. To accomplish this integration, web-based collaboration portal  includes specific computer-executable program code to associate these data and information, in the manner described above in connection with .","As such, web-based collaboration portal  provides access to information in the form of GIS layers . As known in the art, and as described above, GIS layers  organize this geographical information by way of geographic attributes that can be individually selected for display by the user, via web-based collaboration portal . Typically, the display of GIS information by way of layers depends on the nature of the layer information itself: geographical boundaries are shown as boundaries, specific locations shown by point or area icons or shading, and wider scale information (maps, photos) indicated by selectable links with pop-up windows or frames. Web-based collaboration portal  also enables the ability to search the GIS database by way of GIS layers , for example by way of political boundaries layer information (section layer , township layer , range layer , city\/town layer , county layer , state layer . The display of retrieved GIS information can show these various identifiers by way of displayed boundaries and identification overlays, for the selected ones of these political boundary layers through . GIS layers  also include physical and facility layers, such as body of water layer and railroad\/surface road layer , each of which can be displayed to the users via web-based collaboration portal .","Oil and gas production facilities and locations can also be displayed geographically, according to embodiments of this invention, by way of specific layers in the GIS database. In this example, as shown in , GIS layers  include well location layer , facility location layer , proprietary (i.e., belonging to the operator) pipeline network layer , mineral (oil and gas) lease layer , production field outline layer , and well drainage area layer . Pop-up or overlay geographic layers are also available, for example topography map layer , and aerial photo layer . Aerial photo layer can replace the graphical representation of the displayed geography, with boundaries and specific locations overlaid onto the aerial photo of the selected region, as known in the art.","Web-based collaboration portal  also allows users to access information, such as data and documents, associated with the geographical regions being viewed or selected, by way of document integration layer . Document integration layer  refers to database servers, software modules, and other functionality, such as described above, by way of which both unstructured data  and structured data  associated with a particular geographical region or item (well, production field, lease, road, etc.), each which may have different file formats, can be accessed and displayed to the user, in an integrated manner, by way of web-based collaboration portal . According to embodiments of this invention, document integration layer  may interrogate unstructured data  and structured data  according to unique well identifiers as may be identified by the user from displayed GIS information. In embodiments of this invention, documentation integration layer  integrates oil and gas well and property information with GIS layers by way of a data key, assigned to each well or property, and that is a common identifier for that well or property in each of the domains of spatial data (e.g., GIS layers ), unstructured data  including unstructured meta data, and structured data . The various components involved in accessing the desired data and documents refer to the well or property by way of this key, which thus serves as a cross-reference identifier for the well or property. For oil and gas wells in the United States, examples of this key or identifier include the 10-digit or 14-digit API well number, assigned to the particular well as a unique, permanent, numeric identifier under an industry standard established by the American Petroleum Institute; the Global Unique Well Identification (GUWI) number assigned to the well (or converted from another identifier such as the API well number) under the standard established by Information Handling Services (IHS); and one or more proprietary well identifier defined or otherwise maintained by the operator or other party. For non-well properties such as leases or tracts, the key or identifier may be an agreement number, or one or more proprietary identifier for the particular property. Multiple keys or identifiers may be used for each well or property, depending on the particular data servers involved in integrating data between the spatial data, structured data, or unstructured data domains. As such, the particular manner in which document integration layer  executes the access of the desired information varies, depending on the type of data being accessed.","Unstructured data  includes, for these embodiments of the invention, several types of data and information stored in various formats. Types of unstructured data  include well files , which itself includes various types of documents specific to a particular well. Examples of well files include procedures, reports, analyses, logs, assessments, and the like; these documents and files may be text or images (scanned documents), and may be generated and accessed by personnel from a wide variety of functions and sub-organizations (e.g., land negotiators, regulatory personnel, facility and safety engineers, drilling and completion engineers, environmental engineers, operations and production engineers and personnel, and resource development personnel such as geologists, geophysicists, and reservoir engineers. Well files also include documents and files pertaining to well properties , contracts (e.g., contracts between the operator and drilling contractors, completion contractors, and the like), pertinent leases , and surface rights agreements . In addition, workflow engine is accessible to document integration layer , from within unstructured data . As will be described in further detail below, workflow engine operates to analyze and report the status and upcoming tasks involved in the drilling and operation of particular wells and properties; such tasks generally result in reports, analyses, contracts, and the like that are contained elsewhere within unstructured data .","In the arrangement of , as described above, these unstructured data  are stored by way of document services implemented by way of the DOCUMENTUM enterprise content management platform, which are made available able to collaboration portal  realized by way of the MICROSOFT OFFICE SHAREPOINT SERVER (MOSS) applications by way of document integration layer . Alternatively to the DOCUMENTUM platform, unstructured data  may be stored in the form of a SHAREPOINT library available under the SHAREPOINT 2010 applications available from Microsoft Corporation, in which case those unstructured data  can be accessed without the need for document integration layer . Collaboration portal  itself may also alternatively be realized by way of the SHAREPOINT 2010 applications, as desired.","Referring to the architecture of , many types of structured data  are also accessible to the users via web-based collaboration portal  and document integration layer . In the data flow of , document integration layer  accesses these structured data  by way of data services layer . Data services layer  refers to those database servers, web services, software modules, and the like involved in generating and forwarding structured searches, for example SQL queries, based on the unique well identifier (e.g., API, GUWI, proprietary identifier, etc.) selected by the user from displayed GIS information for that well including that identifier, and communicated via document integration layer .","Access from data services layer  into structured data  is made, according to this example, by way of one or more SQL views  associated with various structured databases through . As known in the art, SQL views  correspond to virtual tables of stored queries for the corresponding database. Typically, as known in the art, SQL views  are dynamic virtual tables that are generated from the contents of the associated databases. In this example, SQL views  can access proprietary (i.e., owned by the operator itself) well database , proprietary well activity database , and competitor well database . Proprietary well database includes, for example, production data by time, working interest data, well headers, and the like for wells owned by the operator associated with the users. Proprietary well activity database includes data indicative of the status of particular wells and properties, such as lists and properties of open wells, and the like. Competitor or third party well database includes, for example, production data and well header information for wells operated by external parties to the operator, and in the same general or specific vicinity as the operator's own proprietary wells and properties. Other structured databases may, of course, be additionally or alternatively included within structured data  accessible to users of the information management system and architecture according to embodiments of this invention.","Other structured databases may also be directly accessible from web-based collaboration portal . For example, as shown in , web-based collaboration portal  interfaces with web service  to query and access a structured database corresponding proprietary borehole database ; in this example, database includes well logs, borehole curves of temperature, pressure, etc., and other structured data pertinent to specific boreholes and the immediately surrounding formations. These data obtained from proprietary borehole database via web service  are integrated by web-based collaboration portal  along with other data and documents, for display and use by the corresponding users.","In addition to accessing these various unstructured data  and structured data , users can readily upload files, documents, and data entries into unstructured data  and structured data  via web-based collaboration portal , document integration layer , and data services layer , as the case may be according to the type of data, documents, and other information being uploaded.","While specific architectures and data flows are included in this description of embodiments by way of example, it is contemplated that other architectures and approaches, including the user and incorporation of newer software technology, may alternatively be used to realize the invention. For example, it is contemplated that the K2 software applications available from Sourcecode Technology Holdings, Inc. may serve as the standard workflow tool for orchestrating and managing the flow of information and data. Further changes and alternatives to the overall integration framework can be realized by way of layers including:\n\n","As mentioned above and as will become more apparent from the following description, the information management system and architecture according to embodiments of the invention enable a large set of users to access data and information pertaining to wells and information, from a geographically presented interface that presents information related to the location of particular wells and properties, as well as surrounding features and elements to those wells and properties. In addition, this common geographical search, query, and access of these data and information can be made by way of a common interface, facilitating collaboration among the users of the system.","Referring now to through , an example of the operation of the information management system and architecture according to embodiments of this invention will be described. illustrates a generalized flow diagram as used in connection with the display of integrated documents with geographical (GIS) information, such as in a map view. As evident from the foregoing description in connection with , the information management system and architecture of embodiments of this invention is especially well-suited toward navigation and access of the information with reference to the geographic location and environment of wells and properties. It is contemplated that such an information management system described above, can be readily programmed according to the architecture described above, by those skilled in the art having reference to this specification, without undue experimentation. Of course, in so doing, it is contemplated that those skilled artisans would modify and adapt the system and architecture described above; it is also contemplated that such variations and adaptations are within the scope of the invention as claimed.","The operation of an instance of the information management system and architecture of , begins in process  by a user invoking web-based collaboration portal , for example by way of its web-site . In process , the invoking user is authenticated, for example by way of a username\/password combination, certificate or other key, or the like. As mentioned above, the permissions and credentials of the user may be limited to certain types of data and information, or to certain wells and properties. Website  of web-based collaboration portal  is then presented to the user, at the user's client workstation (e.g., client systems C through C). As described above, the user can then navigate through this website , via its various frames, web parts, and the like, to search for and access data and information regarding particular wells and properties.","In process , according to this embodiment of the invention, the user selects the manner in which he or she wishes to access or view information. As described above relative to , various web sites , , ,  are made available to the user, within web-based collaboration portal , via redirect web part within web site . For example, different \u201ctabs\u201d may be made available, from which the user may select one of web sites , , ,  as the desired navigation approach.

The available layers correspond to those layers through shown in , and variations thereof. The screenshot of illustrates the manner in which GIS layers  can be selected. In the example shown in , the selected GIS layers include \u201cwells\u201d, \u201cfacility\u201d, \u201csubsurface\u201d, \u201cland\u201d, \u201cbase map\u201d, and \u201cstreet map\u201d, as indicated by the checked boxes within GIS layer frame . Each of these layers can be further expanded, to select and not select certain features or sub-layers within each layer. In the main frame of this screenshot, a portion of a particular property is shown in a map view, illustrating those layers. Township and range identifiers are shown (e.g., \u201c4N11E\u201d, etc.), as is a sub-window indicating the scale and projection of the current map view. Wells are indicated by small icons, for example as shown by well W; production facilities are similarly indicated, for example as shown by facility F.","Referring back to , one option available to the user for finding documents and data pertinent to wells such as well W is the use of \u201cmap tips\u201d, in process . illustrates an example of the use of map tips by execution of process . The map tips functionality is enabled by selection of \u201cMapTips\u201d box  in the GIS toolbar, as shown in . The user may specify particular classes of wells, facilities, or other features and installations to be shown in the map view by way of search by attribute sub-window , by way of which the user may select one or more specific layers, or select an attribute, condition, or other defining attribute of the features and installations that the user desires to view in the map view; other wells, facilities, etc. not meeting the \u201csearch by attributes\u201d criteria will not appear. Once selected, the user then rolls or hovers the cursor of his or her client system Cx over an indicator for a particular well, facility, or other feature or installation displayed in the map view, a pop-up window for that feature or installation appears at the display of client system Cx. In the example of , pop-up window  shows some of the available documents and data for a well. This pop-up window  includes an indication of the name and status of the feature and installation, as well as live links to documents and data associated with that feature or installation. In the example shown in , a well \u201cIGOU\u201d is the feature selected by the user, and is indicated as a gas well operated by \u201cBP America Production Company\u201d. Links are provided in this pop-up window  to well logs for this well, well files for this well, a \u201cDIMS report\u201d for this well (i.e., which pertains to borehole and drilling reports for that well as it was drilled), and a \u201clog viewer\u201d link to a script or application for viewing well logs over time for that well, for example by showing multiple logs side-by-side with one another.","It will be evident to those skilled in the art having reference to this specification that the information management system and architecture described above in connection with  will respond to the user inputs received via web-based collaboration portal  by executing its various program modules and functions. Referring to , by way of example, web-based collaboration portal  obtains the desired information from GIS layers  as selected by the user, and in response to map tips process , in this case, obtains identifiers for available unstructured data  via document integration layer , and identifiers for available structured data  via document integration layer  and data services layer . Document integration layer  combines the links and identifiers for the appropriate unstructured data  and structured data , and presents those links and identifiers to web-based collaboration portal  for presentation to the user via pop-up window  in the example of . As described above, according to embodiments of this invention, document integration layer  obtains these links and identifies for unstructured data  and structured data  for a particular well or property identified via GIS layers , by way of a data key that is assigned to each well or property, and that serves as a common identifier for that well or property in each of the domains of spatial data (e.g., GIS layers ), unstructured data  including unstructured meta data, and structured data . Examples of such a key or identifier include well numbers (e.g., API or GUWI well numbers, or proprietary well numbers or identifiers) and agreement numbers. Of course, the particular manner in which these links and identifiers are displayed to the user need not be a pop-up window, but could be some other approach (frame, new window, etc.), perhaps as selected by the user according to his or her user preferences.","Once the criteria and corresponding well, facility, or other feature or installation is selected by the user by way of map tips process , and the pop-up window  with links to the specific documents, files and data appears, process  can then be executed by way of which the user can view, edit, upload, and otherwise operate on specific documents, files and data of interest via his or her client system Cx. It is contemplated that authentication process  will determine the appropriate permissions for the user (i.e., read-only, read\/write, etc.), which will of course control the access provided in process . The various servers in the information management system and architecture described above, and involved in obtaining the desired data or document, will then respond to the user request, and present that data element to the user via web-based collaboration portal . It is contemplated that process , in allowing the user to view and possibly edit the document or data file, will be carried out in many cases by opening a local application program within client system Cx, or alternatively a web-based application program executed at web server W or W, or at another server in the system. The particular application will, of course, depend on the type of document or file selected by the user via web-based collaboration portal . As such, it is contemplated that the particular applications so opened for viewing and possibly editing of the documents and files can be a .pdf document reader, a spreadsheet application, a text editor or word processor, a database program, and the like, as conventional in the art. According to embodiments of this invention, a significant benefit is the ability to open, view, and edit the actual documents and files associated with a particular well or property, from within a geographic view of the location of the well or property. Web-based collaboration portal  enables this geographic access of well and property documents, by way of a common interface that facilitated collaboration among the various users and responsible organizations.","Upload of new documents or data can also be effected, for example by the user clicking the appropriate \u201cimport\u201d link within pop-up window . Web-based collaboration portal  will then present the user with the appropriate dialog by way of which the user can identify the location of the document or data to be imported; the appropriate server functionality within the information management system and architecture, for example document server  and associated modules, will then receive and store the imported document or data. An important benefit of the information management system and architecture according to embodiments of this invention is provided in the context of imported or uploaded documents, in that web-based collaboration portal  provides a uniform interface for the uploading of those documents and data. By associating these uploaded data elements with a particular well via portal , those uploaded data elements now become accessible to other users, by way of the same GIS-based geographical display, regardless of the physical location of the uploaded file, and regardless of the business or personnel organizational role of the uploading user. This common interface thus facilitates the availability of current analyses and information pertaining to wells and facilities in production fields, to all relevant personnel involved in the management and operation of those facilities, and thus facilitates the collaboration of those personnel throughout the organization, regardless of physical location or organizational role.","Referring back to , another approach available to users via web-based collaboration portal  is by execution of a GIS \u201ctoolbox\u201d process . The web site view of illustrates toolbox button , by way of which the user can open the GIS toolbox function from his or her client system Cx. According to embodiments of this invention, GIS toolbox process within web-based collaboration portal  provides multiple \u201ctools\u201d by way of which the user can perform functions, including searching for particular properties. illustrates several of these tools. Driving direction tool invokes a search of GIS layer to provide information regarding the shortest driving path between locations (e.g., wells, locations, latitude\/longitude, or company office locations), as well as turn-by-turn directions. Well\/facility editor tool allows the user to edit attributes about a well or facility, such as the well header information for a well, and to create entries for new wells or facilities. Predefined query tool allows the user to select a previously defined and stored database query, generally a commonly used query; it is contemplated that the user may store certain \u201cfavorite\u201d queries that can be retrieved by that user via predefined query tool . Examples of predefined queries include wells inside a specified county (or other named geographical or political region), wells by a specified operator, wells by API\/UWI number (either by full number, or by partial number, such as by using wild cards). It is contemplated that the results from these queries may be displayed in a window, or exportable to a word processing or spreadsheet document at client workstation Cx. Production data tool invokes a display of production data for company-owned and operated wells, company-owned wells operated by others, and competitor wells in the displayed area. Redlining tool allows the user to make annotations on the displayed map view, either free-hand or using drawing tools. Search-by-attributes tool invokes a search tool within web-based collaboration portal  by way of which the user can search for wells, facilities, etc. that satisfy one or more attributes. Other tools, such as a security tool for changing user permissions, and a preference editor for entering and editing user-level preferences and options in using web-based collaboration portal , may also be provided.","Following selection of one of the tools through within GIS toolbox process , and user entry of the desired values within the selected tool as appropriate, the corresponding results are displayed in the map view frame for viewing, editing, and perhaps uploading in process , in the manner described above. For example, illustrates an instance of the use of search-by-attribute tool . As evident from , toolbox button  is now replaced by pull-down menu , which allows selection of a particular tool through ; search-by-attribute tool has been selected in this instance, as evident within pull-down menu  in . For this tool , the particular attribute being searched by is selected in pull-down menu , for example \u201cWell-BP operated\u201d as shown in . In response to that selection, the map view (partially hidden in ) will show those wells meeting the criteria within the current field of view. By clicking on a particular well (which may be identified in the map view as the user rolls the cursor over a well indicator), header information for the selected well is presented in frame ; as shown in the example of , this header information includes information concerning that well including a well name, well number, an API indicator, the owner, operator, its location (latitude\/longitude), etc.","Also within header frame , as shown in , links to various documents and data pertaining to the well are provided. As mentioned above in connection with map tips process , a \u201clog viewer\u201d is provided, by way of which various logs and curves can be displayed side-by-side, enabling analysis of the interaction between measurements. Window  illustrates an example of the use of this log viewer for the well identified in frame . As shown in , an \u201cexplore\u201d navigator is provided in the left-hand pane of window , by way of which logs and curves can be selected for side-by-side display in the right-hand pane, as shown in this example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"i":["e ","d","b","d ","d","e","f"],"b":["52","50","52","54","52","30"]},"Referring back to , if a document management view is selected rather than a GIS or geographical view (decision is \u201cno\u201d and decision is \u201cyes\u201d), then GIS web site  () is not instantiated.

Workflow management process  is then performed, by way of which the user can view and manage the creation and operation of various wells and properties, from the viewpoint of his or her responsibilities and action items.","The term \u201cworkflow\u201d, for purposes of this embodiment of the invention, refers to a defined sequence of connected operations or steps (\u201cactivities\u201d) involved in accomplishing a particular objective. These connected operations or steps may have dependencies, such that certain steps cannot begin until other steps are completed. In the context of an organization, different personnel or functional groups may be assigned to different steps (and may be carrying out similar steps in other workflows, according to the specialization of that group). The management of a business activity according to workflow concepts is known in the art. For example, the creation and operation of an oil and gas well, over its life, can be considered as a workflow consisting of a sequence of several workflow phases, each phase including several tasks, and with \u201cphase trigger\u201d events serving as necessary steps for moving from one phase to the next.","In a general sense, the execution of workflow management process  by the information management system according to embodiments of this invention allows users and other personnel to manage and be awarded accountability for key documents created through the course of business processes such as the creation and operation of an oil and gas well. In modern oil and gas operations, various users within functional groups create, edit, or approve documents that contribute to the operations of the well; according to embodiments of this invention, these documents are maintained in a centralized well database, such as databases , , , (). Within workflow management process , one user initiates a workflow for a particular well or property; based on the defined process and associated documents for each step of the process, other users will receive a message indicating they have a \u201ctask\u201d that requires their attention in order for the workflow to proceed to the next step. The various steps in the process can be performed sequentially (e.g., if one task must be completed before another task starts), in parallel, or both. A particular task may be completed by the uploading of the appropriate document to the information management system, by the user responsible for the task (its \u201cowner\u201d). As such, workflow management process  interfaces with process , by way of which the user can view, edit, upload, and otherwise operate on specific documents, files and data of interest via his or her client system Cx. In tandem with the document repository, this workflow approach provides a mechanism to establish accountability for completing the well file documentation according to the standards established, and to ensure that the well file stays up to date with the most recent documentation pertaining to that well (i.e., \u201cevergreen\u201d). It is contemplated that a wide range of workflows can be realized and supported according to embodiments of this invention, including such workflows as new well delivery, well work hopper and prioritization, well intervention, and other important business processes.","Referring now to , a generalized business process workflow applicable to multiple processes related to oil and gas production, as carried out by an information management system and architecture constructed and operating according to embodiments of the invention, will now be described. In this high level business process workflow, the information management system and architecture is capable of managing these multiple processes in such a manner that all the data pertaining to wells in one or more production fields, such data generated as a part of several business processes and workflows, are made available to relevant users through a single spatial (GIS) interface. It is contemplated that a portion of the data pertaining to the workflow stages are entered by users into pre-existing forms, such as ASP.Net forms with Telerik controls; these data can reside as structured data within the information management system and architecture of embodiments of this invention, and also may be converted into portable, and thus more readily accessible, formats such as the well known .pdf format.","In a general sense, the overall business process workflow includes i) a Project Initiation Document (PID) workflow stage; ii) a Statement of Requirements (SOR) workflow stage; iii) a Hand-over Documents (HOD) workflow stage; and iv) a Post Appraisal Document (PAD) workflow. Of course, additional or fewer stages may be implemented, or similar stages to those shown in  and described herein but with the individual tasks differently arranged. It is contemplated that those skilled in the art having reference to this specification will readily be able to implement such a generalized business workflow, within the scope of this invention.","As shown in , the generalized business process workflow begins with Project Initiation Document (PID) workflow stage , in which the users initiating a particular large-scale project provide basic definitional information such as the asset name, project name, and the like. Those information establish the PID, upon which various users (including users other than the initiators) to enter data pertaining to the defined project, such as Objectives, Risks, Geologic Targets, Scoping economics, a depletion plan for the asset, and the like. Following entry of that additional data pertaining to the project, the workflow proceeds to subsequent stages where it is reviewed and approved (decision ) by such functions as reservoir management, and relevant supervisory personnel responsible for new well delivery.","Upon approval in decision  of the PID generated in workflow stage , Statement of Requirements (SOR) workflow stage  can be initiated by the relevant users. In this SOR workflow stage , those data entered into forms during the PID workflow stage  are automatically transferred to the SOR being generated in workflow stage , in combination with an option for those users to modify and update only the dynamic data fields in the PID. In addition, the users enter additional data such as well design specifics, well evaluation requirements etc. Following importation and input of the data relevant to the SOR, the completed SOR is reviewed and approved in decision  by the appropriate users, such as the operative management personnel responsible for new well delivery, drilling management, completion management, and the relevant facilities group.","Upon approval of the SOR in decision , the generalized business process workflow initiates Hand-over Documents (HOD) workflow stage . In this workflow stage , responsible personnel in various responsible business functions such as Construction, Drilling, Completions, and Operations review the data previously entered into the PID and SOR, and enter updated or additional data relevant to those specific business functions. Approval of documents generated in this HOD workflow stage  is obtained from key stakeholders (decision ), as necessary according to the operative business practices before making the individual completed documents available, via the information management system and architecture of this invention, to the relevant function assigned to particular tasks according to pre-designed workflows.","In Post Appraisal Document (PAD) workflow stage , authorized users can review the data previously entered into the information management system and architecture for this project in stages , , , record and enter new data based on actual experience with execution of the project, such as data obtained during drilling of the relevant well. Those data entered in PAD workflow stage  are then also reviewed and approved by the authorized users (decision ), after which the completed workflows and data are stored within the information management system of embodiments of this invention in process . These workflows and data can be stored in the form of structured data (e.g., those data entered into forms) and also unstructured data, such as documents rendered as pdf files based on the data entered in forms. In either case, as described above, these documents and data can be made accessible to users through the GIS\/spatial interface in the manner described above, along with other well files. Those data originally entered into forms, and then rendered as .pdf files, are thus readily available for review and portability at any point in the workflow cycle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"],"i":"a ","b":["90","90","91","92","92","93","94","94","95","96","96","97","98","99","100","101","90"]},"As evident from , phases  through  are interlocked among themselves, with control passing from one phase to another upon the occurrence of a phase trigger , , . . . .
