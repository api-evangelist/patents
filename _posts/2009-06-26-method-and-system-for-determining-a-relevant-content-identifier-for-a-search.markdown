{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An internet or web search engine is a tool designed to search for information on the World Wide Web. Search engine\/system providers aim to have a high degree in accuracy in delivering desired search result desired by a user for a given set of search terms. Approaches for ensuring delivery of accurate and desired search results have largely relied on finding search terms within a web page and\/or a history of delivering a particular web page to a user with the same search terms.","Embodiments of a method, a system and a computer-readable medium for a direct answer for search are disclosed. In an embodiment, a search query is received over a network, one or more answer entities are determined from one or more answer candidate snippets, with an answer candidate snippet having at least a portion of content available over the network for an answer candidate, a content identifier is determined for an answer candidate, a title is tokenized for the content identifier, a comparison is performed between a vector of tokens for the title and a vector of the one or more answer entities, an indicator of the relevance is adjusted for the content identifier in accordance with the comparison, and at least one answer candidate snippet is sent for a response to the search query.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed toward intelligent search systems, methods, and computer readable mediums. Intelligent search systems may attempt to provide more relevant search results in response to a search query. In one or more embodiments, the intelligent search system may provide a direct answer, such as a text statement with an answer, in response to an explicit or implicit question determined from a search query. As used herein, a search system, method, and\/or a computer readable medium with instructions to provide an answer in response to a search query may be referred to as an implementation of \u201cdirect answer from search\u201d (DAFS). The answer to a search query may be presented instead or in addition to search results. Search results may contain a content identifier for the answer. A content identifier is a reference or link to content that is relevant to may be relevant to the search query. The content identifier may be a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). For example, a search query that contains \u201cWhen did Columbus discover America?\u201d may return a text answer \u201cColumbus discovered America in 1492.\u201d Similarly, the same question may be implied with a search query that contains terms \u201cAmerica, Columbus, discover, year\u201d and the same answer of \u201cColumbus discovered America in 1492\u201d may be returned. The content identifier(s) that identified the answer may be presented with the answer.","One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed toward determining confidence in an answer that may be presented in response to a search query with an intelligent search system. Confidence may be a score or a percentage that indicates a level of certainty that an answer candidate is the answer desired with a given search query.","One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed toward determining a relevant content identifier to present in response to a search query for an intelligent search system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","124","125","128","118","120","122","130"]},"As depicted in , Website A  may have data or content available over the network. Data and content available over the network may be in the form of text, hypertext markup language (HTML) pages, extensible markup language (XML), pages generated by scripts or application servers, and any other type of data available over the network. A website may have one or more web pages and the web pages may have a common root URL. Web page is used broadly throughout to include a static markup language file (e.g. HTML page), a generated page, a portion of a web page, or any portion of a page or data that is available over a network. Although a web server is not depicted, a client may request that a web server provide access to Website A , and the web server may provide access to the data that allows for presentation of a webpage of Website A . For example, a webpage of Website A  may be data, such as a HTML page, that may transmitted to a client at a Client Computer System  in response to a request, such as an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, received at a web server.","A Crawler  is a software program or script that locates and retrieves content available on the network. The Crawler  may follow links to websites and webpages available on the network to ensure that content for one or more websites is captured. Website A , Website B , and Website C  may be crawled by a Crawler . The Crawler  may be configured to indiscriminately crawl the web or may be given priorities for collecting content available on the network. The Crawler  may collect a copy of the content, changes to content since the data was last captured, information on content available, and\/or check to ensure the website is operational. Optionally, a copy of content collected by the Crawler  may be stored in a Collected Data Store . The Collected Data Store  may be any type of database. A database is any collection of data that may be stored and queried for retrieval of the stored data.","After data has been collected, an Indexer  may index or categorize the data. The Indexer  may be software or a script that indexes and\/or categorizes the data collected by the Crawler . The indexed data optionally may be stored in a Search Database . A Search Engine  may query a Search Database  to retrieve indexed data upon request.","A Client Computer System  may have client software, such as a web browser, that may send a request through an Interface  to Intelligent Search System  and\/or the Search Engine . The Intelligence Search System  and Search Engine  are depicted as being part of a Server Computer System  and the Server Computer System  receives requests from a client over the network or with a direct connection to the Server Computer System . Although depicted as a Client-Server model, those skilled in the art will recognize that other models are available for implementation of an intelligent search system. In one or more embodiments, the Intelligent Search System  may send queries through the Search Engine  to the Search Database . Optionally, the Search Engine  may query Reference Site Indexed Data , Famous People Data , Local Data  or any other collected data. The Reference Site Indexed Data , Famous People Data , and Local Data  may be fed to the system by a third-party or similarly collected by the Crawler .","The Client Computer System  may receive a response from the Search Engine  and\/or Intelligent Search System . As discussed above, the Intelligent Search System  may respond with a text answer to a search query in addition to search results. The Intelligent Search System  may transmit data for display of a webpage on the Client Computer System  with the search results and the text answer.","Although the elements of the search system are depicted as being part of one server, those skilled in the art will recognize that the elements of the search system may be on multiple computer systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","100","202","202","200","100","202"]},"A Client Computer System  may interact with the DAFS System  using an Interface . The Interface  may be a webpage, an application programming interface (API) or any other type of interface that allows for communicating a request to the DAFS System . Embodiments may view the Interface  as a front end for the DAFS System  and the back end may consist of the elements of the DAFS System  that handle responding to the search query. In one or more embodiments, the DAFS system  may be a web service which provides an API that can be accessed locally and over a network, such as the internet, and allows for execution of instructions on a remote system hosting the requested service. The Client Computer System  uses the Interface  to request a search query and input Search Terms  for the search query. For example, the Client Computer System  may use a client, such as a browser, to request the web page Interface  for the DAFS System  and input a request for a search query with Search Terms  and submit the request to the DAFS System . Embodiments may provide a web page interface with a form text input box that allows for the input of text search terms. Other embodiments may restrict search terms permitted to be inputted, such as with radio buttons or display of any other limitation on the selection of search terms.","As indicated above, the Search Terms  may explicitly or implicitly indicate a question and the DAFS System  may provide an answer for the question indicated by the Search Terms . The Question Expansion Module  may compare Search Terms  in a search query to a question pattern in order to determine the type of question that the query may represent. In one or more embodiments, a question pattern may have one or more question templates or grammars that enable identification of a type of question indicated by the Search Terms . In a preferred embodiment, a pattern (e.g. question pattern, answer pattern) is a regular expression that can be used to match a question in Search Terms or an answer within text. For example, the Question Expansion Module  may parse the search query by tokenizing (e.g. identifying specific words in the Search Terms) the Search Terms  and using a grammar to identify a question or set of questions that the Search Terms  represent. By way of further example, each a question pattern may represent one or more questions, such as \u201cwhen was x born\u201d or \u201cwhat is the birthdate of x\u201d and the question pattern would allow for the identification of the similar questions. Questions that may be categorized together for question patterns may be determined manually and\/or dynamically determined from prior interactions with the DAFS System . A tokenizer or lexer may identify tokens \u201cwhen, was, born\u201d and recognize \u201cMadonna\u201d as a name token, and a grammar may be used to identify a particular order of the Search Terms  that indicate a question, such as \u201cwhen was x born.\u201d In some embodiments, a comparison between the tokens identified and a set of tokens identified with a question pattern may indicate the question posed by the Search Terms .","Optionally, the Question Analysis Module  may identify a type or classification of answer that is expected from a question. The classification of the answer expected may be determined from a question pattern itself. For example, interrogative words within a question pattern and\/or Search Terms may be used to classify an answer for the Search Terms  (e.g. \u201cWho\u201d may indicate a person is expected as an answer, \u201cWhen\u201d may indicate a date is expected as an answer, \u201cWhere\u201d may indicate that a location is expected as an answer). Similarly, adjectives may indicate an answer. By way of example, the adjectives after \u201chow\u201d may be used to classify the category of the numeric value (e.g. \u201cmuch\u201d may indicate a price or other amount is expected as an answer, \u201ctall\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d may indicate a height is expected as answer, \u201clarge\u201d and \u201cbig\u201d may indicate a size is expected as answer). The nouns in a search query may indicate an answer (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d after the word \u201cwhat\u201d may indicate a time is expected as an answer). Occupational words may be used to identify the type of answer expected (e.g. \u201cpresident\u201d may indicate a president is expected as an answer). Statistics may also be used to determine the answer expected from a set of Search Terms . A generic machine learning system, such as dbacl, may be used to determine the answer expected from a set of Search Terms . Those skilled in the art will recognize that there may be a variety of ways to identify an answer expected from a set of Search Terms .","The Rewrite Generation Module  may be used to generate a variety of queries for Search Terms  inputted with the original search query. Embodiments may rely on question patterns to determine similar queries for a set of Search Terms . For example, continuing with the above example, Search Terms of \u201cWhen was Madonna born\u201d may allow for the generation of a query with Search Terms of \u201cWhat is the birth date of Madonna.\u201d","One or more queries may then be submitted by the Information Retrieval Module . Queries may be submitted to one or more databases or data stores to retrieve query results. The query results may indicate answer information for the one or more queries determined by the Rewrite Generation Module . For example, one or more queries may be sent to databases for Indexed Data , Reference Site Indexed Data , and Behavioral Data . Indexed Data  may be data that has been retrieved by crawling the internet and\/or provided by a third party and categorized for information retrieval. In one or more embodiments, reference site data that is indexed, illustrated with Reference Site Indexed Data , may be queried. Examples of reference data that may be indexed and search are Wikipedia\u00ae and Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary copyright\u00a9. Behavioral Data  may also be information on behavior or use of the system by users. The behavioral data may include, but is not limited to, interactions by a user within a session with the system, interactions by multiple users with the system, interactions with the system that indicate popularity of queries, answers, links, and data, and user click popularity for URLs. An example of behavioral data is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7,181,447, entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Conceptually Organizing and Presenting Information,\u201d filed May 24, 2004, hereby incorporated by reference.","Snippets  may be determined from the query results returned to the Information Module . Snippets  may be any information about data or content available over the network. A snippet may include a portion of a piece of content available over the network. For example, a Snippet  may include, but is not limited to, a title for a web page, a description of the web page, a content identifier (e.g. a URL) to locate the web page, and content available on the web page. An Answer Identification Module  may be used to identify the answer within one or more Snippet(s) . An answer pattern may be used to identify the answer within a snippet. The answer pattern may include, but is not limited to, a lexer, a parser, a grammar, a script, or any combination thereof.","An Answer Clustering Module  may cluster the Snippet(s)  into groups of Snippet(s)  that may identify similar or nearly the same answer. A cluster of Snippet(s)  may be viewed as a set of Snippet(s)  for an answer candidate and the set or a portion of the set of Snippet(s)  may be presented with the answer candidate in response to the originally submitted search query. An answer candidate is a potential answer for the originally search submitted query. The answer candidates may be ranked and one or more answers may be selected from the answer candidates for presentation in response to the originally submitted search query.","An Answer Relevance Module  may be used to determine the best URL within the answer candidates. A Confidence Module  may be used to determine the confidence in the answers to be presented to the user. The Confidence Module  may rank and\/or rerank the answer candidates for presentation. A Presentation Module  allows for presentation of the answer(s) returned by the DAFS System . The Presentation Module  may generated and\/or enable the transmission of data that allows for presentation of a web page on a client executing on the Client Computer System . The Presentation Module  may enable a thin client, a thick client, and\/or a stand-alone application to execute on a Client Computer System . In one or more embodiments, the Presentation Module  may allow streaming of data for presentation of the answers to the client, such that all data for presentation of the answer to the user does not have to be downloaded to the Client Computer System  to enable display of answers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["202","300","206","200","202","200"]},"Next, one or more question patterns may be retrieved using the Search Terms  (). The one or more question patterns may then be compared to the original search query (). The Search Terms  may serve as a guide for which question patterns may be retrieved. For example, Search Terms  of \u201cMadonna, birth, of\u201d may indicate that a question pattern should be retrieved with questions: \u201cwhen is x's birthday,\u201d \u201cwhat is the birthdate of x,\u201d and \u201cwhen was x born.\u201d Continuing with the example, the Search Terms  \u201cbirth of Madonna\u201d may also indicate that a question pattern with questions: \u201cwhen did x give birth,\u201d and \u201cwhen was x's child born.\u201d","A determination is made whether the original search query is supported by the DAFS System  (). The comparison of the original search query to the retrieved question patterns may indicate if the original search query may be supported by the DAFS System . If the DAFS System  does not support providing an answer for the original search query, then a Search Database  may be queried ().","By way of example, querying a Search Database  may include a search with the original search query against an indexed data may be performed with the search terms in the original search query. Although depicted as a Search Database , those skilled in the art will recognize that any number of queries and databases may be used to return search results for the original search query. Next, a determination is made as to whether search results were returned by searching with the original search query (). If search results were not returned from querying the Search Database , then the search ends. Optionally, the Presentation Module  may indicate that the search was unsuccessful. Alternatively, the search results may be sent to the Presentation Module  for presentation on the Client Computer System .","Continuing with , if the DAFS System  does support the original search query (), then the Search Database may optionally be queried in parallel with performance of the DAFS intelligent search (). As described in detail above, the Search Database may be queried with the original search query (). Depending on whether the query result () contains search results (), the search results may be presented with the Presentation Module (). If search results are not returned, the query search of the Search Database  may end. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the search with the DAFS System  may still be executing even though the query of the Search Database  executing in parallel has ended. Although depicted as two processes that execute in parallel, those skilled in the art will recognize that the searches may be performed in any order preferred.","Continuing with , an entity may be determined from a Search Term  () and the entity may be added to a set of answer entities determined from Search Terms  (). An entity may be a key term, topic, category, or keyword. Next, a determination is made as to whether there are more Search Terms  (), and if there are more search terms, then entities are determined from the Search Terms  () until there are no more Search Terms  and\/or enough entities have been determined for the DAFS System .","Alternatively, when a search for entities has been performed for the Search Terms  (), a determination is made as to whether there are similar or nearly similar queries for the original search query (). The question patterns may indicate queries that are similar to the original search query. The original search query may be rewritten and added to a set of rewritten queries for the DAFS search (). For example, an original search query with Search Terms  \u201cMadonna, birth, of\u201d may allow for rewrites of the original search query of \u201cwhen is Madonna's birthday,\u201d \u201cwhen was Madonna born,\u201d and \u201cwhat is Madonna's birth date.\u201d If there are more similar queries for a query as indicated by a query pattern (), then the original search query may be rewritten and added to a set of rewritten queries (). If all similar queries for a query pattern () have been added to the set of rewritten queries, then a determination is made as to whether there are more question patterns (). If there are more question patterns, then similar queries are determined for the original search query (), the original search query is rewritten () for each similar query () which may be determined by the query pattern.","Alternatively, if there are no more query patterns (), then the original search query and the set of rewritten queries are sent as query requests to the database (). The original search query and set of rewritten queries may be sent as a query request to a database by the Information Retrieval Module . If the Information Retrieval Module does not return query results (), then the DAFS search may end. The query results may be returned in the form of one or more Snippets . Optionally, the Presentation Module  may indicate that no DAFS search results were found. Alternatively, if Snippet(s)  were returned by the Information Retrieval Module  (), then the DAFS search may continue with .","Continuing to , answer patterns may be determined () to extract the answer from a Snippet  (). In one or more embodiments, the query used to query the database for query results by the Information Retrieval Module  may be used to determine the answer patterns that can be used to locate an answer within the text included or accessible with a Snippet . Embodiments may use a set of words to serve as an answer pattern and a search within the text of accessible with a given Snippet  may be performed to find the set of words within the text. For example, for a query that contains terms \u201cwhen was x born\u201d, the answer pattern may be \u201c[x] was born on [Month] [day] [comma] [year]\u201d (where x is a name, month is a month, day is a day possible within the month, comma is a \u201c,\u201d and year is a possible year). The answer pattern may be used to directly match a sentence within the text accessible with a Snippet  by parsing the text accessible with the Snippet . Text that is accessible with the Snippet  may be included within the Snippet , accessible by retrieving data with a content identifier for the Snippet  or any combination thereof. In one or more embodiments, the answer pattern may be used as a guide and the sentence fragment provided with the answer pattern may not need to be matched exactly. Next, a determination is made as to whether an answer candidate can be obtained with a Snippet  and answer pattern (). An answer candidate is a potential answer for the original search query. If an answer candidate () cannot be determined from the Snippet  with the answer pattern (), then a determination is made as to whether another answer pattern is available () and the process to find an answer within the Snippet  is repeated. If an answer candidate is determined from a Snippet  (), then the Snippet may optionally be clustered or grouped with Snippet(s)  that had the same answer. To cluster the Snippet  with the answer candidate, a search is performed for the existence of the cluster or group with a similar answer (). If a cluster does not exist (), then an answer candidate cluster () is created with the Snippet  added to the new cluster, and a determination is made as to whether there are more answer patterns (). Alternatively, the Snippet  may be added to the cluster for the answer candidate (), and a determination is made as to whether there are more answer patterns (). If there are more answer patterns, then the process is repeated until all answer patterns are exhausted. In other embodiments, the process for determining an answer from a Snippet  may end after an answer is found in a Snippet .","Alternatively, if there are no more answer patterns (), then a determination is made as to whether there are more Snippet(s)  (). The process for finding an answer with answer patterns is then repeated for the next Snippet  (). If the Snippets  needed for determining an answer have all been processed, then the answer candidates are ranked (). As previously described, the Snippet(s)  that produces the same or nearly the same answer may have been clustered. Next, a determination is made as to the relevant content identifier for the answer candidates () and a determination is made as to the confidence in the answer () to be presented to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["222","222","222","222"]},"Initially, a DAFS Computer System  may receive a set of answer candidate Snippet(s) for a search query (). As indicated above, a Snippet  may be any information about data or content available over the network. For example, a Snippet  may include, but is not limited to, a title for a web page, a description of the web page, a content identifier (e.g. a URL) to locate the web page, and content available on the web page. The content available on the web page may be a sentence, phrase, and\/or entity (e.g. keyword) provided on the web page. The set of answer candidate Snippet(s)  may be a cluster of Snippet(s)  identified for a particular answer candidate. The set of answer candidate Snippet(s)  for a search query may include Snippet(s)  returned with the original search query as well as rewritten queries. In other embodiments, the set of answer candidate Snippet(s)  may include a cluster for determined for a single query.","The Confidence Module  may receive the set of answer candidate Snippets  from any module within the DAFS system . Confidence may be performed after clustering and\/or directly after identification of Snippets  from the Information Retrieval Module . Confidence determination may be a process that is executed in parallel with other processes within the DAFS system .","Continuing with , one or more answer entities within an answer candidate Snippet  are determined (). An answer entity is a keyword and\/or phrase that may be found within the Snippet .  provides an example of a Snippet in accordance with an implementation of a DAFS System. Answer entities in  may be \u201cUncle Tom's Cabin\u201d from the title, \u201cAmerican History\u201d from the description, \u201cslayery\u201d and \u201cslayery_toms_cabin\u201d from the URL, \u201c1852\u201d and \u201cHarriet Beecher Stowe,\u201d \u201cwrote,\u201d and \u201cUncle Tom's Cabin\u201d from the content, etc. The answer entity may be an original Search Term , a topic, a category, a word, or phrase that is within the answer candidate Snippet . For example, in , the Search Terms  \u201cwho wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin\u201d may be found in the content, title, and URL of the Snippet of . The answer candidate Snippet  may be a Snippet  from the cluster of Snippets (e.g. a Snippet that represents the cluster). Alternatively, the answer entities may be determined for one or more Snippets for a cluster depending on the granularity desired for determining the confidence for an answer. For the remainder of the description of confidence, one answer candidate Snippet  will be described for confidence although those skilled in the art could use any number of Snippets  to determine the one or more answer entities for Snippets .","Next, a frequency of the determined one or more answer entities found within the set of answer candidate Snippet(s) for the search query is determined ().

For example, the Snippet of  may be in a cluster for answer candidate \u201cHarriet Beecher Stowe.\u201d The answer entities in the Snippet of  may have been present in 80% of a set of answer candidate Snippet(s). The score for answer candidate \u201cHarriet Beecher Stowe\u201d can be adjusted accordingly such that the answer candidate may be presented as an answer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["222","500","502"]},"A query request may be sent to a behavioral database (). The behavioral database may have interactions with the system by users or by users with a search system. The query request to the behavioral database may be for one or more related search queries to the search query. In a preferred embodiment, the behavioral database may group queries that return a URL in search results and the URL is selected by users for the group of queries. For example, if a first query \u201cwho wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin\u201d and a second query \u201cUncle Tom's author\u201d both contain a search result with the URL from , and users of a search system selected the URL from  with both the first and second query, then the two queries may be grouped for the URL. In one or more embodiments, the first and second queries may be stored in a table of a database for the URL.
