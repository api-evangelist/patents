The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present technology relates generally to the electrolyte redox shuttle compounds carried in the non-aqueous electrolyte providing intrinsic overcharge protection capability for lithium ion batteries, electrical double-layer capacitors and other electrochemical devices.","Lithium ion batteries were first commercialized in 1990, and soon thereafter drew tremendous attention from academic and industry interests due to the advantages such as high energy density and rapid charge\/discharge capabilities in comparison to state of the battery technology at the time. In recent years, lithium ion battery technology has become the most popular power source for portable electronic devices. In addition, lithium ion batteries have found application in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). However, safety of lithium batteries continues to plague the technology. For example, secondary lithium-ion batteries are known to exhibit problems in shorting of the battery, elevated operating temperatures and overcharge, which can lead to dangerous situations such as overheating, fire, and explosion of the battery.","Overcharge occurs when electricity flow is forced through a cell when its capacity is already full. This is one of the most common factors that could lead to serious safety issues of lithium-ion batteries. Due to the manufacture processes, there is always a \u201cweakest cell\u201d in a battery pack (i.e. the cell with the lowest charging capability in a multi-cell battery pack). During charging, the weakest cell will reach full capacity prior to the other cells, but because the overall voltage of the battery is not high, the full capacity cell with not trigger the voltage monitor of the charger to read \u201cfull.\u201d As a result, the weakest cell is put into an overcharge situation. Instead of being stored evenly across all electrodes in the battery pack, electricity will build up in, and increase the potential of, the cathode in the weakest cell, causing the potential to go beyond the electrochemical window of the electrolyte. In turn, this will cause reactions to occur such as oxidation of the electrolyte, leading up to and including explosion of the cell and battery pack.","Known methods to avoid the overcharge abuse in practice, include the use of electronic devices attached to each individual cell to monitor for overcharge, the use of overcharge protection compounds in each cell, and the use of redox shuttles in the electrolyte of the electrochemical cells.","A number of redox shuttle compounds are known. Generally, the redox shuttle molecule can be reversibly oxidized and reduced at a defined potential slightly higher than the end-of-charge potential of the positive electrode. This mechanism can protect the cell from overcharge by locking the potential of the positive electrode at the oxidation potential of the shuttle molecules.","For an ideal redox shuttle compound, there are at least three desirable properties. The first property is that it should have a reversible oxidation potential that is appropriate for the cathode material with which it is to be used. This means that the oxidation potential of the redox shuttle should be between 0.3V and 0.5V volts higher than the end-of-charge potential of the cathode. This will ensure that redox shuttle is accessed only overcharge potentials. The second property is that the redox shuttle should be electrochemically stabile or reversible. The stability and reversibility of the redox shuttle will determine how much overcharge protection is provided. The third property is that the redox shuttle is to have sufficient solubility in the electrolyte system in order to have an effective amount of the redox shuttle available.","In another aspect, a compound of Formula IVA or IVB is provided:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"59.61mm","wi":"55.46mm","file":"US08877390-20141104-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["8","9","10","11 ","8","9","10","11 ","8","9","10","11 ","8 ","10 ","9 ","11 ","8 ","10 ","9 ","11 "],"sub":["2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","3","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2 "]},"In another aspect, an electrolyte is provided including an alkali metal salt; a polar aprotic solvent; and a redox shuttle, where the redox shuttle is any of compounds of Formula IVA, or IVB described above generally, or specifically, and where the electrolyte solution is substantially non-aqueous.

A negative electrode having a larger irreversible first cycle capacity loss than that of the positive electrode is employed, so that if a cell is driven into reversal. the potential of the negative electrode is driven above that of the positive electrode. During over-discharge, the potential of the negative electrode therefore increases. However, the shuttle limits the negative electrode potential to a value slightly above that of the positive electrode maximum normal operating potential and prevents the negative electrode from reaching even higher and more destructive potentials. A negative electrode current collector whose lithium alloying potential is below the negative electrode minimum normal operating potential is also employed. This prevents the current collector from capturing lithium during recharging of the Li-ion cell. The resulting battery chemically limits or eliminates cell damage due to repeated over-discharge even though the negative electrode in a weak cell may be driven to a value more positive than the positive electrode potential.","A variety of redox shuttles may be employed in lithium-ion batteries. Suitable redox shuttles have an electrochemical potential above (e.g., slightly above) the positive electrode's maximum normal operating potential. Thus, according to some embodiments, redox shuttles in the electrolytes, have a redox potential from 3.5 V to 5.0 V. In other embodiments, the redox shuttles have a redox potential from 3.6 V to 4.6 V.","The redox shuttle selection may be guided in part by the positive electrode selection. As a general numeric guide, the shuttle may have a redox potential from 0.3 V to 0.6 V above the positive electrode's maximum normal operating potential, e.g., from 3.7 to 4.7 V vs. Li\/Li, from 3.7 V to 4.4 V vs. Li\/Li, from 3.7 V to 4.2 V vs. Li\/Li, or from 3.7 V to 4.0 V vs. Li\/Li above the positive electrode's maximum normal operating potential. For example, LiFePOpositive electrodes have a recharge plateau of around 3.45 V vs. Li\/Li, and redox shuttles for use with such electrodes may have a redox potential from 3.75 V to about 4.05 V vs. Li\/Li. Similarly, LiMnPOand LiMnOelectrodes have a recharge plateau around 4.1 V vs. Li\/Li, and redox shuttles for use with such electrodes may have a redox potential from 4.4 V to 4.7 V vs. Li\/Li.","Mixtures of two or more shuttles having different electrochemical potentials vs. Li\/Li may also be employed. For example, a first shuttle operative at 3.8V and a second shuttle operative at 3.9V may both be employed in a single cell. If after many charge\/discharge cycles the first shuttle degrades and loses its effectiveness, the second shuttle (which would not meanwhile have been oxidized to form its radical cation while the first shuttle was operative) could take over and provide a further (albeit higher potential) margin of safety against overcharge or over-discharge damage.","According to some embodiments, in addition to the redox shuttle, the electrolyte includes a polar aprotic solvent, and a lithium metal salt. The electrolytes are substantially non-aqueous. As used herein, substantially non-aqueous means that the electrolytes do not contain water, or if water is present, it is only present at trace levels. For example, where the water is present at trace levels it is present at less than 20 ppm.","A variety of solvents may be employed in the electrolyte as the polar aprotic solvent. Suitable polar aprotic solvents include liquids and gels capable of solubilizing sufficient quantities of the lithium salt and the redox shuttle so that a suitable quantity of charge can be transported from the positive electrode to negative electrode. The solvents can be used over a wide temperature range, e.g., from \u221230\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. without freezing or boiling, and are stable in the electrochemical range within which the cell electrodes and shuttle operate. Suitable solvents include dimethyl carbonate; ethyl methyl carbonate; diethyl carbonate; methyl propyl carbonate; ethyl propyl carbonate; dipropyl carbonate; bis(trifluoroethyl) carbonate; bis(pentafluoropropyl) carbonate; trifluoroethyl methyl carbonate; pentafluoroethyl methyl carbonate; heptafluoropropyl methyl carbonate; perfluorobutyl methyl carbonate; trifluoroethyl ethyl carbonate; pentafluoroethyl ethyl carbonate; heptafluoropropyl ethyl carbonate; perfluorobutyl ethyl carbonate; fluorinated oligomers; dimethoxyethane; triglyme; dimethylvinylene carbonate; tetraethyleneglycol; dimethyl ether; polyethylene glycols; sulfones; and \u03b3-butyrolactone.","The redox shuttles, as noted above, have suitable solubility in carbonate-based electrolyte solvents and gels. For example, the redox shuttles may be prepared in carbonate-based electrolytes, such as, 1.2M LiPFin EC\/EMC 3\/7 (i.e. an mixture of 3 parts ethylene carbonate and 7 parts ethylmethylcarbonate), or 1.2M LiPFin EC\/DEC 5\/5 (i.e. a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethylcarbonate). According to various embodiments, electrolytes may be prepared with a redox shuttle at a concentration of from 0.005 wt % to 50 wt %, or from 0.1 wt % to 30 wt %. In other embodiments, the electrolytes may be prepared with a redox shuttle at a concentration of from 2% to 10%.","Suitable lithium salts that may be used in the electrolytes, include, but are not limited to, Li[B(CO)]; Li[BF(CO)]; LiClO; LiBF; LiAsF; LiSbF; LiBr, LiPF; Li[CFSO]; Li[N(CFSO)]; Li[C(CFSO)]; Li[B(CF)]; Li[B(CH)]; Li[N(SOCF)]; Li[N(SOCFCF)]; LiN(SOCF); Li[BFCF]; and Li[PF(CFCF)]; and lithium alkyl fluorophosphates.","In some aspects, the electrolytes may include other compounds to enhance the performance of the electrolyte when used in an electrochemical cell. For example, the electrolytes may also include an electrode stabilizing compound to protect the electrodes from degradation. Such electrode stabilizing compounds are described by co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10\/857,365 and 11\/279,120. Such electrode stabilizing compounds can be reduced or polymerized on the surface of a negative electrode to form a passivation film on the surface of the negative electrode. Likewise, electrolytes can include an electrode stabilizing compound that can be oxidized or polymerized on the surface of the positive electrode to form a passivation film on the surface of the positive electrode. In some embodiments, the electrolytes further include mixtures of the two types of electrode stabilizing compounds. The compounds are typically present at a concentration of from 0.001 wt % to 8 wt %.","In some embodiments, the electrode stabilizing compound is a substituted or unsubstituted linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon including at least one oxygen atom and at least one aryl, alkenyl or alkynyl group. Passivating films may be formed from a substituted aryl compound or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl compound where the compound includes at least one oxygen atom. Alternatively, a combination of two compounds may be used. In some embodiments, one compound is selective for forming a passivating film on the cathode to prevent leaching of metal ions and the other compound can be selective for passivating the anode surface to prevent or lessen the reduction of metal ions at the anode.
