{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to computerized speech recognition. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and methods to remove ambiguity with respect to a speech recognition system.","Speech recognition is a technology that has a number of useful applications that allow people to interface with computing systems using their voices. These applications include: allowing a user to dictate text into a document; allowing a user to issue commands to one or more computer systems via speech; improving automated telephony systems; and many other applications. Such systems are useful in large centralized-server applications, such as computerized telephony processing systems; user interaction with desktop computing products; and even improved interaction and control of mobile computing devices.","Speech recognition is known and is being actively researched as perhaps the future of human interaction with computing devices. While speech recognition technology has progressed rapidly, it has not been perfected. Currently, speech recognition requires substantial computing resources and has not achieved 100% recognition accuracy. This is partly due to inherent ambiguities in human language, and also due, in part, to varying domains over which user speech may be applied.","In a speech recognition system supporting multiple third party applications, grammars from different applications will often accept the same speech command. Thus, there is inherent ambiguity in which application should execute the command when a user issues such a command. For example, the command \u201csend message\u201d may be accepted by grammars from both Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Messenger, both of which are available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. In addition to the ambiguity created by determining which application to direct a command to, there is reduced recognition accuracy when a command of a much more constrained grammar (such as would be directed to a specific application), is required to be recognized by a larger grammar such as a large vocabulary dictation grammar.","Providing a speech recognition system and methods that could facilitate the direction of user speech to specific programs and\/or modules as well as attempt to recognize such speech with specifiable grammars would represent an improvement to speech recognition without adding significant complexity to the user experience.","Speech recognition utilizing categories and prefixes is disclosed. Categories identify types of recognition and allow different grammars and prefixes for each category. Categories can be directed to specific applications and\/or program modules. Uttering a prefix allows users to easily direct text to specific grammars for enhanced recognition, and also to direct the recognized text to the appropriate application\/module.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well-known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, telephony systems, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general-purpose computing device in the form of a computer . Components of computer  may include, but are not limited to, a central processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit .","The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.

Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media.

The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies.","A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard , a microphone , and a pointing device , such as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer .

When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on remote computer . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","206","208","210"]},"Memory  is implemented as non-volatile electronic memory such as random access memory (RAM) with a battery back-up module (not shown) such that information stored in memory  is not lost when the general power to mobile device  is shut down. A portion of memory  is preferably allocated as addressable memory for program execution, while another portion of memory  is preferably used for storage, such as to simulate storage on a disk drive.","Memory  includes an operating system , application programs  as well as an object store . During operation, operating system  is preferably executed by processor  from memory . Operating system , in one preferred embodiment, is a WINDOWS\u00ae CE brand operating system commercially available from Microsoft Corporation. Operating system  is preferably designed for mobile devices, and implements database features that can be utilized by applications  through a set of exposed application programming interfaces and methods. The objects in object store  are maintained by applications  and operating system , at least partially in response to calls to the exposed application programming interfaces and methods.","Communication interface  represents numerous devices and technologies that allow mobile device  to send and receive information. The devices include wired and wireless modems, satellite receivers and broadcast tuners to name a few. Mobile device  can also be directly connected to a computer to exchange data therewith. In such cases, communication interface  can be an infrared transceiver or a serial or parallel communication connection, all of which are capable of transmitting streaming information.","Input\/output components  include a variety of input devices such as a touch-sensitive screen, buttons, rollers, and a microphone as well as a variety of output devices including an audio generator, a vibrating device, and a display. The devices listed above are by way of example and need not all be present on mobile device . In addition, other input\/output devices may be attached to or found with mobile device  within the scope of the present invention.","In accordance with one broad aspect of the present invention, a system is provided that facilitates recognizing speech specific to one or more computer applications and\/or program modules using a grammar specific to such application\/modules and directing the recognized text to an appropriate target. Additionally, grammar categories can be deterministically selected by uttering user-specifiable speech prefixes. For example, a user dictating text in dictation mode to a speech recognition system can require that the next word following a speech prefix (for example \u201cComputer\u201d) be recognized using whichever command grammar accepts the speech. In this manner, the word will be recognized based upon a much more constrained grammar and recognition accuracy will be improved. As will be described below in greater detail, embodiments of the present invention generally employ categories and prefixes to deterministically direct portions of speech to the correct grammars\/application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","304","306","306","308","310","312"]},"By allowing customizable prefixes and the ability to extend the system to third party applications, users can now, in accordance with embodiments with the present invention, essentially speak to different components of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","400","402","310","402","304","404","400","310","408","410","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506"]},"Embodiments of the present invention also preferably include a system indication of the type of speech for which it is listening. This is currently done, to a limited extent, in modern speech recognition systems when a speech recognizer will indicate that it is \u201clistening for diction\u201d or \u201clistening for commands.\u201d Preferably, the visual indication, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, will indicate the category name or an easily understandable equivalent thereof. For example, when the active category is Media Player, the visual indication may be, \u201cListening for Windows\u00ae Media Player commands.\u201d These indications can be tailored as appropriate and may even be defined in the data structure illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","608","610","612","614"]},"The use of an ActiveCategory reduces the degree to which users will need to utter prefixes. For example, if a user is interacting primarily with a Media Player application, it is undesirable to require the user to utter a prefix for every command directed to the Media Player application. Instead, the user can change the ActiveCategory to Media Player, using, for example, a voice command such as \u201cChange active category to Media Player\u201d or by manipulating a user interface element. Once the active category is switched to Media Player, the prefix for grammars not associated with the Media Player are required. Thus, in order to start an application entitled \u201cSolitaire\u201d the user must say, \u201cComputer Start Solitaire.\u201d However, when the Media Player is the ActiveCategory, the user need not utter the prefix for grammars associated with the Media Player.","A typical user interaction in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is as follows. A user starts the recognizer by interacting with a user interface element such as a microphone button. Initially, the recognizer will have grammars associated with speech accessibility activated and ready for recognition. A user can then utter a command, such as \u201cStart Media Player,\u201d which will be recognized using the initially activated grammars, and cause the recognizer to start an instance of the Media Player application. When the Media Player application is invoked, it activates additional application-specific grammars for controlling the playback of media content. Next, the user may utter, \u201cComputer Start Solitaire.\u201d Unlike prior art approaches, only grammars associated with the Command category can receive the recognition since the user explicitly specified the category via the prefix. In this example, the recognizer will start an instance of the \u201cSolitaire\u201d application. Next, the user changes the ActiveCategory to Media Player, since the user wants to interact with the Media Player without having to continually prefix each command to the Media Player. Then, when the user says, \u201cStart Solitaire\u201d the Media Player will receive the recognition and start playing media entitled \u201cSolitaire.\u201d This is because the Media Player was the ActiveCategory, and the utterance \u201cStart Solitaire\u201d did not include any prefix.","Aspects of the present invention provide an extensible, intuitive speech recognition experience for users while simultaneously facilitating increased recognition accuracy and disambiguation. It is expressly contemplated that embodiments of the present invention will be useful in any situation where speech recognition is done electronically. Accordingly, a wide variety of applications ranging from complex call centers to mobile computing devices will all benefit from the features and aspects provided herein.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
