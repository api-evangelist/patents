{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention relates to the field of communications systems and, more particularly, to an apparatus for providing bifurcated signaling and bearer traffic over a cable telephony network.","A cable telephony network allows voice to be transported over the Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) or using a Packetized Voice mechanism such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) for voice to be transported over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.","Cable companies have an installed base of equipment, which is primarily directed to the transport of video not voice and data. To provide voice over their infrastructure, cable companies must adapt their networks to accept voice at a great economical expense. Compounding the problem is that the transport of voice is very bandwidth intensive due to, for example, transport overhead. For example, to transport a 64 kilobit per second voice call, in certain circumstances, may require more than 140 kilobits per second of IP traffic. Also, the Cable companies require a Quality of Service (QoS) enabled network and a high processing capacity gateway to support VoIP telephony.","Current Host Digital Terminal (HDT) based voice over cable telephony architectures do not have the required end to end bandwidth to support traditional voice processing without the potential of producing signal degradation. Also, existing Packet Cable based voice over cable telephony architectures do not have the required end to end bandwidth to support traditional voice processing without the potential of producing high network delays. Additionally, the transport of voice traffic and signaling information lead to bottlenecks within the infrastructure of the cable telephony network.","The invention comprises an apparatus for providing bifurcated voice and signaling traffic utilizing a suggested hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC)\/wireless access architecture. The invention advantageously provides efficient, end-to-end communication by reducing bottlenecks within the infrastructure of the existing cable network. Additionally, signal degradation and delays are reduced.","Specifically, an apparatus for providing bifurcated voice and signaling data over a network, comprising: a memory, for storing protocols for interfacing with the network; and a processor, coupled to said memory, for segregating signaling traffic and related voice traffic including information useful in establishing a communications link, for transporting said voice traffic between a calling party and called party, and for transmitting said voice traffic and said signaling traffic via different communication channels.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.","The invention will be described within the context of three subscribers (A, B and C) communicating via respective telephony technologies. It should be noted that the present invention is compatible with different telephony technologies (i.e. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP, Voice over Digital Subscriber Loop (VoDSL), Fiber to the Home (FTTH) and the like). The benefits of the invention can be gained even if a respective subscriber uses an alternate technology.","It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the voice application presented here can be replaced with any multi-media application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","106","106","106","108","112","108","110"]},"It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that first MTA-CT  may be integrated into first cable modem .","At a cable Headend A or a Hub A, a first optical transceiver  is coupled to first fiber node . The first fiber node  is connected to first fiber coaxial coupler  via transmission medium . Second transmission medium  comprises, for example, a fiber optic cable. First optical transceiver  is coupled to a video transport network . The video transport network  supports the distribution of video and audio signals such as movies to headend offices and to subscribers.","First optical transceiver  is also coupled to a first Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) . First CMTS , is coupled to a first router  which is, in turn, coupled to an internet protocol (IP) network . IP network  provides interchange of transport data to a second cable headend or Hub. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that IP network  can be replaced with a data network adhering to a non-IP protocol.","First CMTS  is also coupled to a first Circuit Packet Bearer Traffic Gateway (CPBTG) . First CPBTG  is coupled to a first switch , illustratively a class 5 Wireless switch which is also known as a Mobile Switching Center (MSC), via a T1 trunk . T1 trunk  comprises, illustratively, twenty four Digital Signal Level Zero (DSO) channels.","It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that first switch  may be a voice switch with a wireless interface and that CPBTG  may also be integrated into the switch.","First switch  is coupled to a first base station system  via a second T1 trunk. First switch  includes a control module or controller G, a wireless global switch module B which allows a wireless switch module A to communicate with first BSS , a Visitor Location Register (VLR) F for storing the Equipment Identifier Numbers (EIN) E of cellular units from outside the serving area making calls within a local calling area; a Home Location Register (HLR) C database which stores the EINs of cellular phones from the local serving area; Equipment Identifier Register (EIR) E database for storing EINs of phones allowed to make calls; and Authentication Center (AuC) D database performs mathematical computations to verify the authenticy of the cell phone's identity.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that VLR F, HLR C, EIR E, and AuC D databases may be stored externally from first switch .","First base station system  is coupled to first MTA-CT  via a radio frequency (RF) link. First switch  is also coupled to the Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) . PSTN  supports communication between first switch  and a second switch  at central office B (which is local to subscriber B). Included in PSTN  is a gateway switch  for routing calls between local serving switches, for example, first switch  and second switch . A third telephone, at subscriber C, is coupled to gateway switch .","Second switch  is coupled to a second BSS  via a third T1 trunk . Second BSS  is coupled to a second MTA-CT , located at subscriber B, via a second radio frequency link. Second MTA-CT  is coupled to a second telephone  and a second computer . Second MTA-CT  is also coupled to cable modem . A second fiber coaxial coupler  is coupled to second cable modem  via transmission medium  for example, a coaxial cable.","At cable Headend B or Hub B a second optical transceiver  receives video from video transport network . A second fiber node  is coupled to second optical transceiver . Second fiber node  is coupled to second fiber coaxial coupler  via a transmission medium  such as coaxial cable. Second optical transceiver  is also coupled to a second CMTS . CMTS is coupled to a second router  which receives and transmits data information to and from the IP network . Second CMTS  is also coupled to a second CPBTG . Second CPBTG  is also coupled to second switch  via a fourth trunk .","In the case of a voice communication from subscriber A to subscriber B, the first MTA-CT  detects an \u201coff hook\u201d condition from first telephone  and communicates with first BSS  via a radio frequency link. First BSS  establishes a signaling path with first switch  via a DSO channel on T1 trunk . Signaling between first BSS  and first switch B can be done using, for example, Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol.","Once a signaling path is established between first BSS  and first switch , first BSS  notifies first MTA-CT  that the signaling path is established. First MTA-CT , responsively communicates signaling messages to first switch . Once signaling messages are established and the called party picks up the second telephone , the voice traffic flows from telephone  to first MTA-CT  in digitized form to first cable modem . The voice signal is then communicated to first CMTS . First cable modem  and first CMTS  utilize Data Over Cable System Interface Specification (DOCSIS) protocol to communicate data packet data between the respective devices. The bandwidth DOCSIS provides primarily depends upon channel radio frequency (RF) bandwidth, symbol rate, and modulation techniques used.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that first MTA-CT  will transmit voice in compressed form via first cable modem  based upon the wireless technology used. Since first switch  is a wireless switch, wireless voice compression techniques can be utilized between first MTA-CT  and first switch . In case local power is lost to first MTA-CT , the voice traffic is transmitted over the wireless network.","Further data compression can be achieved via the use of DOCSIS and Internet Protocol (IP)\/User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) header compression.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other communication protocols other than DOCSIS may be substituted.","First CMTS  then communicates voice signals to first CPBTG  where the voice signal is depacketized and communicated to first switch  in circuit form rather than packet form. Specifically, CPBTG  converts voice path setup and packet to circuit conversions and vice versa as opposed to present devices which only perform Network Based Call Signaling (NCS) and voice path setup. Illustratively, a product such as the Packet Star Access Concentrator model (PSAX ) manufactured by Lucent Technologies, Inc of Murray Hill, N.J. could be used with minor modifications as CPBTG .","First switch  then communicates the voice traffic to PSTN  where it is then communicated to second switch . Based on a called party number, second switch  determines that a call is going to a cable modem customer, and initiates communication with second BSS  where a signaling path is established between second switch  and second BSS . BSS , in turn, initiates a signaling path with second MTA-CT . Second MTA-CT  receives the signaling information and detects a ringing condition from subscriber A. In turn, MTA-CT  rings second telephone .","Once subscriber B picks up second telephone , this signaling information is conveyed back to first MTA-CT , and a voice path is established between first MTA-CT  and second MTA-CT  whereby voice traffic is communicated between first MTA-CT  to second MTA-CT  via the route first MTA-CT  to first cable modem  to first CMTS  to first CPBTG  to first switch  over public switch telephone network  to second switch  to second CPBTG  to second CMTS  to second cable modem  to second MTA-CT .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["106","106","1"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul200001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul200002-li00002"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul200002","list-style":"none"},"li":"MTA-CT  comprises a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) portion, a cellular portion, a user interface portion, a battery back up portion and a data portion."}}}},"The DSP portion transmits, receives and processes signals from the data portion, the user interface portion and cellular portion of MTA-CT . The cellular portion communicates signaling messages with first BSS . The data portion of MTA-CT  communicates data information between MTA-CT  and first cable modem . The user interface portion communicates with the data portion and cellular portion as well as peripheral devices.","The user interface portion provides the user interface functions of a telephone and may include an interface jack interfacing with a telephone. For example, an RJ11 jack. Traditional interface devices can be a key pad for dialing numbers, an audible indicator for announcing calls, keys such as mute, redial, hold, transfer, conferencing, a display for displaying user prompts, number dialed, Caller ID and the like. It should be noted that those skilled in the art may devise other devices that can be used with the present invention.","The data portion of the MTA-CT  comprises, illustratively, an Ethernet control processor  for processing data information from the DSP portion of the circuit and from the user interface portion of the circuit. Ethernet control processor  performs the voice processing, call processing, and network management software functions of MTA-CT .","Random Access Memory (RAM)  is coupled to Ethernet control processor . Flash memory  is also coupled to Ethernet control processor  as well as Ethernet transceiver .","Ethernet transceiver  serves as an interface to data devices such as cable modem  or first computer terminal . In addition, ethernet transceiver  allows the transmission and reception of voice packets from\/to an IP telephone. The interface to the ethernet transceiver  and an external device can be, for example an RJ45 jack.","Flash memory  allows easy upgradability of MTA-CT  since changes to standards or protocols can be reprogrammed in blocks instead of one byte at a time.","The cellular portion of MTA-CT  comprises an antenna  for transmitting or receiving radio signals. The preferred embodiment is a mechanical antenna due to its ability to dither at small intervals, and thus can maintain accurate signal tracking when used in conjunction with an angular position determinant. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that an electronic antenna may also be substituted for the mechanical antenna.","A cellular transceiver  comprising a radio frequency section (not shown) is coupled to antenna . Cellular control processor  is coupled to cellular transceiver  to process this cellular information and also communicate with the DSP portion and user interface portion of MTA-CT .","Coupled to cellular control processor  are a Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM)  and a Battery Back up Random Access Memory (BBRAM) . NVRAM  provides memory retention when the power is off. Cellular control processor  together with NVRAM  and BBRAM  provide the overall executive control of the functions and interfaces of cellular transceiver B.","Antenna  is also coupled to a diplexer  having a receive portion and a transmit portion. A low noise amplifier  is coupled to the receive portion of diplexer . Low noise amplifier  amplifies the signal and communicates the signal to down converter mixer . Down converter mixer  takes the high frequency signal from low noise amplifier  and combines it with a signal from synthesizer  and creates an intermediate frequency range signal for further processing. This signal having the intermediate frequency range is communicated to analog-to-digital converter  and is further communicated to the DSP portion of MTA-CT .","The DSP portion of MTA-CT  communicates the signal to digital-to-analog converter  which, in turn, communicates the signal to up converter modulator . Up converter modulator  also receives a signal from synthesizer . Up converter modulator  takes the incoming signals and performs frequency translation in such a manner that the output frequency is higher than the input frequency. The output frequency is communicated to high power amplifier  which in turn communicates the signal to the transmit portion of diplexer . Diplexer  allows radio frequency signals to be received and transmitted simultaneously.","The DSP portion of MTA-CT  comprises a modem  and an audio coder . The modem  modulates and demodulates signals from the data portion and cellular portion of MTA-CT . Audio coder  interfaces various peripheral devices such as an ear phone, microphone, an RJ11 jack for connecting a telephone, and the like. Audio coder  provides a conversion of analog voice into digital samples and vice versa. It also communicates these signals to data portions and cellular portions of MTA-CT .","The power battery backup portion of MTA-CT  includes an uninterruptable power supply (UPS)  which converts household power to direct current power for MTA-CT . UPS  also provides battery backup to maintain MTA-CT  operation through local power outages. For phone service to be operational the phone must be capable of originating calls, ringing, and terminating calls. Coupled to UPS  is a local power failure detector and communicator . Local power failure detector communicator  detects an absence of local power and in turn communicates a signal to the head end office alerting personnel to the absence of local power.","It is assumed for the purposes of powering that first MTA-CT  is integrated into the first cable modem . Cable modem failure detection requirements can be found in document DOCSIS operation support system interface specification document number SP-OSSIv1. 1-D01991115.","It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that if the first MTA-CT  is not integrated into first cable modem  then the UPS  and local power failure detector communicator  are supporting both first cable modem  and MTA-CT  independently.","It should also be noted that the processor portions of the circuit comprising Ethernet control processor , cellular control processor  and DSP portion of MTA-CT  are each described as performing separate functions, for example, voice processing, call processing, protocol processing, and network management software management functions of the telephone. This may consist of a digital signal processor for voice related functions, Ethernet control processor for controlling Ethernet functions and cellular control processor for controlling cellular transceiver functions. However, such functions can be integrated into a single processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00052","num":"00052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","300","300","106"]},"The real-time operating system (RTOS) interfaces the physical layer containing the hardware components of MTA-CT . The ROTS layer includes a link\/media access control (MAC)  layer which controls access to the cellular system physical layer. The RTOS layer also provides standard interfaces such as flash memory interface , DSP interface , an infrared data association (IrDE) interface , a serial interface , a display interface , and a universal serial bus (USB) interface . Drivers such as the Ethernet driver  are also supported on the RTOS layer.","The RTOS layer also includes a data packet structure portion for implementation which includes an internet protocol (IP)  data structure for keeping track of internet addresses for different nodes, for routing outgoing messages and recognizing incoming messages. A \u201cuser datagram protocol\u201d (UDP)  packet structure which transports packets and transmission control protocol (TCP)  packet structure are encapsulated in the IP  data structure. Real time transport protocol (RTP)  which supports a transport of real time data, for example like interactive voice or video is encapsulated in the UDP  packet structure. The data packet structure portion can be utilized by the link\/MAC layer  and\/or the Ethernet drivers .","The second layer, the device server layer, includes two different device servers, one for cellular transceiver B and one for MTA A. The cellular transceiver device server includes a radio resource management  component. Above the radio resource management  component is a mobility management  component. Call control component , message support component  and miscellaneous services component  are above mobility management component . Mobility management component , call control , message support  and miscellaneous services  are used in setting up of services between cellular transceiver B and the first base station system . The cellular transceiver device server is used to set up and tear down calls, and to support messaging and other advanced services. Additionally, cellular transceiver device server interfaces with the link\/MAC layer  and the data packet structure portion.","The second device server of the device server layer applies to MTA A. Device server  handles all the registration, management, signaling and other services required by MTA A and communicates with a call server at the cable hub. The call server at the cable hub determines specific properties of device server . MTA device server interfaces with the data packet structure portion. The third layer, the transparent media layer, provides a critical function of providing a seamless integration of cellular and cable functions in one unit such that MTA A and cellular transceiver B function as one unit. The transparent media layer includes a management component  which handles operations administration and maintenance (OAM), a transparent media handler  and a user interface control interface . OAM includes fault management, compression, dial plan, securities, authentication, and other services. The management component  interfaces with the cellular transceiver device server and MTA device server  and transparent media handler .","Transparent media handler  manages the functions of MTA-CT  before, during, and after the call set up and the media transfer and determines the medium through which data and signaling is transmitted. The transparent media handler  can also be used to negotiate CODEX, select different compression techniques, mix data streams, perform authentication, and various other features such as using resources, such as new compression techniques, dial plan, and the like, from the device server  in cellular transceiver stack device server and vice versa. Transparent media handler  interfaces the cellular transceiver stack, device server  and user interface control interface  and distal signal processor interface .","The user interface control interface  interfaces with serial interface , USB interface , display interface  and transparent media handler component .","The fourth layer, the application layer, is above the transparent media layer and interfaces with the device server layer. The application layer allows rapid development of applications for the MTA-CT  through the application programming interface (API) provided by the transparent media layer component . The APIs and the separation of details from the device server layer by the transparent media layer provide the necessary abstraction for new applications to take advantage of unique interface of the MTA-CT .","Signaling is normally done through cellular transceiver B and data is transmitted through MTA A in the RTOS layer. However, if management component  detects that the MTA's A link is down, then the transparent media layer  switches to transmitting the data through the cellular transceiver B. This switching is done without the knowledge of the application layer above. That is, the application layer does not need to care about the switch from transmitting data through MTA A to transmitting data to CT B. The transparent media handler component  allows the application layer control over starting, stopping and other features of media streams without providing the application layer any control over the transmission medium.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00061","num":"00061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["106","106","106","401","402","402","336","334","403","404","404","334","106","106","3"]},"Although various embodiments which incorporate the teachings of the present invention have been shown and described in detail herein, those skilled in the art can readily devise many other varied embodiments that still incorporate these teachings.
