{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60\/375,108 filed Apr. 24, 2002.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DE-FG02-99ER82735 awarded by the Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention is related generally to air conditioning systems, and more particularly to air conditioning systems assembled from modular components for cost effective fabrication.","Large amounts of energy are devoted in this country to processes related moisture removal. Such processes include agricultural and industrial applications wherein feedstocks and other final products need to be dried, and indoor air conditioning for maintaining low air moisture levels in indoor spaces. One method of removing moisture involves the use of desiccants. Desiccants have a high affinity for water vapor and readily absorb moisture present in the air. Dehumidifiers using desiccants to remove moisture operate chiefly on heat and can be readily adapted for use with solar thermal energy or waste heat sources. However, use of such dehumidifiers has been limited due to their large size and high installation and maintenance costs.","Desiccant-based dehumidifier systems may be used as a stand-alone system or in combination with conventional air-conditioning to improve the indoor air quality of all types of buildings. In these systems, a desiccant removes moisture from the process air, which releases heat and increases the air temperature. The dry process air may be cooled using either evaporative cooling or the cooling coils of a conventional air conditioner. The absorbed moisture in the desiccant is then removed (the desiccant is regenerated to its original dry state) using thermal energy supplied by natural gas, electricity, waste heat, or the sun. Commercially available desiccants include silica gel, activated alumina, natural and synthetic zeolites, titanium silicate, lithium chloride, and synthetic polymers.","Evaporatively cooled liquid desiccant dehumidifier systems have shown promising performance results. One type of evaporatively cooled liquid desiccant dehumidifying system includes a conditioner having a plurality of parallel spaced-apart plates. The plates are arranged in a manner to form first and second series of discrete alternating fluid passages. The plates further include a plurality of spacers which cooperate with adjacent plates to maintain the spaced apart arrangement therebetween.","Process air (i.e., air to be dehumidified) is passed through the first series of fluid passages and cooling air is passed through the second series of fluid passages. The moisture containing process air enters first series of fluid passages via a moist air inlet and dried process air exits the conditioner via a dried air outlet.","A liquid desiccant is typically sprayed onto the inside surfaces of the first fluid passages where it flows therealong in contact with the passing moisture containing process air. During dehumidification, heat is released as the water vapor condenses and mixes with the liquid desiccant. The process air heats from the latent heat of evaporation as the moisture is removed and also, to a lesser degree from the transfer of heat from the generally warmer desiccant. The water saturated desiccant is collected in a reservoir and pumped to a regenerator where it is heated to drive off the absorbed water as vapor. The regenerated desiccant, which is further heated up in this process, is pumped back to the conditioner for reuse. Since the water absorption process leads to heating of the air and the regeneration process heats the desiccant, substantial heating of the air takes place during the water absorption process.","To lower the enthalpy of the process air to produce a net cooling effect, the desiccant can be cooled as it flows down the inside surfaces of the first series of fluid passages. This can be accomplished by applying water to the inside surfaces of the second series of fluid passages and passing cooling air therethrough. The cooling air evaporates the water and cools the desiccant in the first series of fluid passages. As a result, the heat released by the absorption of moisture in the desiccant is transferred through the plates and the process air is dried while possessing a lower enthalpy than when it entered the conditioner.","Prior art evaporatively cooled liquid desiccant dehumidifier systems typically encounter several problems during operation. Due primarily to the high flow rates of liquids that are either sprayed or dripped on the inside surfaces of the fluid passages, the liquid desiccant and the cooling water has a tendency to span or bridge across the respective air streams along the inside surfaces of the first and second fluid passages, respectively. This produces higher flow resistance and pressure drops across the inlet and outlet of the air streams, and facilitates the formation of droplets which may become entrained within the air streams.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art of air conditioners to design an air conditioner that avoids the problems of the prior art while substantially reducing the costs associated with fabrication and operation. It would be further desirable to design an air conditioner preferably in the form of a liquid desiccant dehumidifier system exhibiting improved air flow and moisture removing capacity while minimizing undesirable entrainment of the liquid desiccant in the process air flow.","In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an air conditioner which comprises:\n\n","In one particular aspect of the present invention, there is provided an air conditioner which functions as a liquid desiccant dehumidifier system which utilizes a conditioner carrying a liquid desiccant to extract moisture from process air passed therethrough. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system is also designed to further extract heat from the liquid desiccant which contacts the moist process air entering the system. Thus, the system produces dry air from the starting moist process air which exits the system cooler that it would be in the absence of heat transfer. The system of the present invention is less complicated to fabricate and results in greater cost savings than conventional liquid desiccant dehumidifier systems.","The present invention is directed to air conditioning system which utilizes an air conditioner which may be adapted for performing various air treatment operations. Such air treatment operations may include, but is not limited to, changing the moisture and\/or heat content of the air being processed.","The air conditioner of the present invention includes a plurality of plates which are adapted to be joined to one another in a stacked configuration. The joined plates define a first and a second series of discrete alternating passages wherein a first air stream is passed through the first series of passages and a second air stream is passed through the second series of passages. The first and second air streams are maintained physically separate from one another, while maintaining thermal contact to allow heat to freely pass therebetween. The stacked plates are further adapted to form integrally therewith a liquid delivery system which operates to deliver from a source of liquid a sufficient quantity of a liquid to the inside surface of the first series of passages in a manner which provides a continuous flow of the liquid while in contact with the first air stream. With appropriate modifications such as the selection of the first and second air stream and the type of liquid, the air conditioner of the present invention may be used for various applications including, but not limited to, indirect evaporative cooling, liquid desiccant dehumidification and the like.","By way of example and reflecting a first embodiment of the present invention, there is shown in , a schematic representation of a liquid desiccant dehumidifier system generally designated by the reference numeral  for one application of the present invention. The dehumidifier system  generally comprises a conditioner  for dehumidifying air and a regenerator  for regenerating liquid desiccant.","Process air (e.g., air from a building) is fed into the conditioner  via a moist process air inlet  (e.g., from the building) and comes into contact with a liquid desiccant. The liquid desiccant is pumped from the regenerator  by a pump  through a liquid desiccant supply conduit  to a series of distribution or feeder tubes (not shown). The liquid desiccant is dispensed directly to the surface of the first series of fluid passages  within the conditioner  and comes into contact with the process air as will be further described in detail hereinafter. The dispensing of liquid desiccant is accomplished without the creation of droplets such as would occur through the use of sprays. The liquid desiccant flows slowly in continuous contact with the process air and collected in a reservoir (not shown).","Since the liquid desiccant is hygroscopic, it absorbs water vapor from the moist process air and drier air is expelled through a dried process air outlet  (e.g., return to building). The reservoir is located at the bottom of the conditioner  whereby the liquid desiccant delivered from the liquid desiccant supply conduit  flows downwardly into the reservoir.","The exhaust liquid desiccant discharged by the conditioner  passes through a drain conduit  to the regenerator . The exhaust liquid desiccant is regenerated in the regenerator  which may be in the form of a boiler. The regenerator  heats the liquid desiccant to drive off part of the water vapor it has removed, thus regenerating it. The regenerated liquid desiccant returns to the conditioner  to remove moisture. The liquid water or water vapor is discharged from the regenerator  through a water outlet .","The conditioner  is further configured to transfer heat released in the liquid desiccant as the water vapor is removed from the process air by bringing the liquid desiccant stream into thermal (but not physical) contact with a cooling water stream in combination with a cooling air flow. The cooling air entering the conditioner  via a cooling air inlet  evaporates the cooling water entering via a cooling water conduit , which lowers the temperature of the cooling water. This transfer of heat energy results in a reduced temperature of the liquid desiccant which causes the temperature of the air being dried to be lowered. The cooling air and the vaporized cooling water are expelled from the conditioner  via a cooling air outlet .","Referring to , the conditioner  is shown in greater detail to illustrate the cross flow interaction between the process air stream and the cooling air stream. The conditioner  comprises a plurality of spaced-apart plates  to yield a cross-flow arrangement. The arrangement permits two discrete fluid streams to flow therethrough. In this example, process air passes horizontally through the moisture process air inlets  into corresponding process fluid passages  and exits through the dried air outlets . Cooling air passes vertically upward through the cooling air inlets  into corresponding cooling fluid passages  and exits through the cooling air outlets . Although the process air and the cooling air flows are maintained physically separate from one another, they remain in thermal contact with one another. The plates  may be comprised of a heat conductive material including, but not limited to, thermoformed plastic or metals such as aluminum, copper and alloys thereof. Plates  formed from metals may be coated with a corrosion resistant layer.","The conditioner  is further adapted to permit the liquid desiccant to enter through the liquid desiccant supply conduits  extending longitudinally therethrough. The liquid desiccant supply conduits  dispenses the liquid desiccant at the top end of the plates  into the process fluid passages  where it flows downwardly along the inside surfaces thereof. The upper portions of the process fluid passages  narrow to a common junction line where a series of distribution or feeder tubes are disposed to feed the liquid desiccant directly onto the inside surfaces of the passages  without the formation of droplets thus ensuring uniform coverage and flow down the inside surface of the passages . In this manner, the process air is maintained in contact with the liquid desiccant as it passes through the respective process fluid passages . In a preferred embodiment, the liquid desiccant may be delivered through an injection system from which the liquid desiccant can be injected directly onto the surface of the process fluid passages . As the liquid desiccant flows to the bottom end of the process fluid passages , it is collected into a reservoir (not shown) and drained through the drain conduit .","In a preferred embodiment, the process fluid passages  may further be lined with a wicking substrate (not shown) comprising a porous fluid passing material. The wicking substrate may be about 10 to 15 mils thick. The porous fluid passing material may be in the form of a wettable fiber selected from acrylics, polyesters, cotton, nylon, rayon, fiberglass and the like. The liquid desiccant may be injected into the wicking substrate through, for example, feeder tubes disposed along the length of the plates  and supplied from the liquid desiccant supply conduit . The liquid desiccant flows through the feeder tubes and uniformly wets the wicking substrate. Other methods of wetting the wicking substrate would be known to those skilled in the art and any such method may be used in the practice of the invention. The wicking substrate provides enhanced wetting of the contact surface while slowing the flow rate of the liquid desiccant to maximize contact time with the passing process air and to minimize undesirable \u201cbridging\u201d of liquid desiccant across the process fluid passages . Bridging of liquid desiccant can generate increase resistance against the process air flow, and undesirably producing liquid desiccant droplets which can become entrained in the process air flow.","The cooling water conduit  supplies a cooling water stream  on the inside surfaces of the cooling fluid passages  as the cooling air flows upwardly. The cooling water flowing along the sides of the cooling fluid passages  evaporates in contact with the cooling air flow. This imparts an evaporative cooling effect through the plates  onto the liquid desiccant flowing on the other side of the plate  in the process fluid passage . Thereby, the evaporative cooling effect effectively reduces the temperature of the liquid desiccant which in turn reduces the temperature and the enthalpy of the process air flow.","The cooling water stream  may be sprayed, dripped, injected or directly delivered to the inside surfaces of the cooling fluid passages . In a preferred embodiment, the cooling water may be delivered through an injection system from which the cooling water can be injected directly onto the surface of the cooling fluid passages . The cooling fluid passages  may further be lined with a wicking substrate (not shown) comprising a porous fluid passing material. The wicking substrate may be about 10 to 15 mils thick. The porous fluid passing material may be in the form of a wettable fiber selected from acrylics, polyesters, cotton, nylon, rayon, fiberglass and the like. The cooling water may be dripped, sprayed or injected into the wicking substrate through, for example, feeder tubes or spray nozzles along the length of the conditioner  supplied from the cooling water supply conduit . The cooling water flows through the conduit  and uniformly wets the wicking substrate. Other methods of wetting the wicking substrate would be known to those skilled in the art and any such method may be used in the practice of the invention.","Referring to , a plate  forming part of the conditioner  is shown for one embodiment of the present invention. The plurality of plates  can be readily assembled and joined to fabricate the conditioner in a simple and cost effective manner. The plates  can be joined through any suitable means including, but not limited to, welding and gluing. The combination of assembled plates  forms the liquid desiccant supply conduits , the reservoir, and drain conduits  as an integral unitary structure. The size and air processing capacity of the conditioner  can be modified by selecting the number of plates  to be assembled. This modular form of fabrication provides greater cost savings and ease of production.","The plate  comprises a distribution region , a processing region  and a collection region . The surfaces of the distribution region  and the collection region  are stepped relative to the surface of the processing region . The process fluid passage  is formed by coupling two plates  with the distribution region  and collection region  of one plate  in abutting contact with the distribution region  and collection region  of the other plate . The joining of the individual plates  yields a coupled plate  (see ) as will be further described hereinafter. The cooling fluid passage  can thereafter be formed by joining a coupled plate  with another coupled plate  as will be further described hereinafter.","Referring back to , the distribution region  of the plate  includes a pair of liquid desiccant supply throughholes , a lateral channel  in communication between the liquid desiccant supply throughholes , and four feeder channels  in communication with the lateral channel . The processing region includes a plurality of spacers  which extends away from the surface of the processing region . The spacers  function to maintain the space within the process fluid passage  as will be described hereinafter. The processing region  further includes a plurality of depressions  within the surface thereof. Each of the depressions  extends below the plane of the processing region  and is located proximate to a corresponding spacer . Each depression  also functions as a spacer in the cooling fluid passage  which would be formed on the other side of the plate  (i.e., backside). The processing region  further includes a first slot  and a second slot  formed at an opposed end of the plate .","The processing region  further includes a pair of flow restricting blocks  located near the distribution region  and may be formed by stamping or thermoformed into the plate . The flow restricting blocks  are located proximate to the dispensing end of the feeder tubes  and functions to slow and spread the flow of the liquid desiccant discharged from the feeder tube  directly onto the inside surfaces of the process fluid passage . The flow restriction block  reduces the spacing in the passage  near the dispensing end of the feeder tube . The narrow spacing prevents the liquid desiccant from forming into a droplet, thus minimizing bridging of the liquid desiccant that may occur across the passage .","Each of the plates  further includes alignment tabs  which may be thermoformed or stamped into the plates . The alignment tabs  are protrusions that can fit into corresponding slots (not shown) located on an adjacent plate  for purposes of providing alignment of the plates  during assembly of the conditioner .","Referring to , a coupled plate  is formed by joining the two plates  at the distribution region  and collection region  of one plate  to the distribution region  and collection region of the other plate , respectively. The resulting joined liquid desiccant supply throughholes  form part of the corresponding liquid desiccant supply conduits . The joined feeder channels  form the corresponding feeder tubes  with the joined lateral channels  forming a lateral tube  to provide fluid communication between the liquid desiccant supply conduits  and the feeder tubes . The joined liquid desiccant drain throughholes  form part of the corresponding liquid desiccant drain conduits .","The processing regions  of the joined plates  form the process fluid passage  and a reservoir  at the lower end of the passage  which opens into the drain conduits  for allowing the liquid desiccant to pass out during the operation of the conditioner . The joined first slots  and the joined second slots  of the plates  form the corresponding moist process air inlet  and dried process air outlet .","The coupled plate  forms the basic structural unit of the conditioner . Additional coupled plates  may be assembled in the manner described above and then joined successively to one another to produce the conditioner  of the present invention as shown in FIG. . The coupled plates  may be joined by welding or gluing at corresponding flange portions  of the liquid desiccant supply conduits  and corresponding flange portions  of the liquid desiccant drain conduits  to form continuous fluid-tight conduits. Each of the conduits  and  are fitted with suitable inlet and outlet fittings for supplying and draining, respectively, the liquid desiccant. The joined coupled plates  define the cooling fluid passages  therebetween. Each of the coupled plates  includes edge portions  which extends slightly from the sides thereof. The edge portions  of the joined coupled plates  are also sealed or welded to the edge portions of the adjacent coupled plates  to enclose the cooling fluid passage  and prevent leakage of the cooling air flow therethrough.","Referring to , the conditioner  is shown assembled from a plurality of the coupled plates . The size and processing capacity of the conditioner  can be varied by selecting the number of coupled plates  to be attached as needed.","Referring to , an exploded cross sectional view of the coupled plate  is shown to provide greater detail of the functional aspects of the spacer  and the depression  located in the process fluid passage . In a coupled plate , the spacers  of the plate  each abut against the corresponding spacers  of the other plate  to maintain the space between the processing regions  of the plates , thus keeping the process fluid passage  open.","Applicants have observed that when the liquid desiccant encounters the spacer  a relatively thicker film of liquid desiccant forms around the spacer . The thicker film of liquid desiccant has a greater tendency to bridge across the process fluid passage  thus adversely affecting the flow of the process air. The bridging of the liquid desiccant can create a high pressure drop across the process fluid passage  and cause the formation of desiccant droplets which may become entrained in the process air flow. Applicants have further discovered that introducing depressions  within the plate  in proximity to the spacers  opposite from the liquid desiccant source of flow substantially reduces undesirable bridging of the liquid desiccant. It is believed that the depressions  increases the distance between the inside surfaces of the passage , thus minimizing the bridging of the liquid desiccant at the point where the liquid desiccant film is at its thickest. It will be understood that other suitable methods of preventing or at least substantially minimizing the bridging of liquid desiccant. The spacer  and the depression  can be formed by conventional thermoforming, stamping or embossing techniques. Alternatively, the spacer  can be a stud applied adhesively to the plate  or formed by a hardening adhesive.","Referring to , the plate  is shown for an alterative embodiment of the present invention. The plate  further comprises a wicking substrate  overlaying the processing region  thereof. The wicking substrate  is adapted to permit fluid passage of the liquid desiccant while in contact with the process air. The wicking substrate  is suitably contoured to match the surface of the plate  including the surface features of the spacers  and the depressions . The wicking substrate  may be further configured with a guiding edge  that directs the liquid desiccant away from the trailing edge of the plate  into the reservoir .","With appropriate modifications, the embodiment described in  can be applied to an indirect evaporative cooler. In the indirect evaporative cooler embodiment, a cooling air stream is passed through the first series of passages . The process air passes through the inlets  into the second series of passages , which is maintained dry. A stream of cooling water is delivered through the supply conduits  and dispensed into the first series of passages  where it flows downwardly along the inside surfaces thereof. The water evaporates into the cooling air stream and cools the inside surfaces of the first air passages which absorbs the heat from the process air flowing through the second series of passages , thus producing a indirect evaporative cooling effect.","An evaporatively cooled liquid desiccant dehumidifier system of the present invention was tested and compared to a water-cooled conditioner system. Both systems were operated to process outdoor air at a temperature of about 86\u00b0 F. and a humidity of about 0.0192 pound of moisture per 1 pound of dry air. The cooling water for the water-cooled conditioner system was supplied by a cooling tower. The liquid desiccant used was 43% lithium chloride solution. The process air was passed through both systems at a velocity of about 900 feet per minute using 12\u2033 wide plates with 0.1\u2033 gaps between plates.
