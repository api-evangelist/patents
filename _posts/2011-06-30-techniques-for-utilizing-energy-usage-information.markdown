More particularly, embodiments of the invention relate to techniques for utilization of energy usage information to support improved energy consumption.","Tracking energy usage is increasingly important in many settings. For example, many regulations require that commercial buildings conform to certain energy efficiency requirements. In order to monitor compliance, energy usage must me measured in some way. Typical measurement techniques are based on dedicated hardware monitors, which can be expensive and complex.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description.","Currently, in the commercial office environment, there are no numeric representations of the amount of energy an individual is consuming across a range of concurrent activities: computing, lighting, heating\/cooling, power strips, remote charging, etc. There is no analytical methodology to analyze the individual user's energy usage behavior in relation to his\/her building, floor, department, etc. Also, there is no feedback mechanism available for building occupants to express their comfort level regarding, for example, temperature, lighting, air quality, etc. Similar limitations apply to other environments as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Network  provides an interconnection between multiple electronic devices. Network  may provide communication with any number of remote devices not illustrated in . Network  may be, for example, the Internet.","Database (DB) server  may be coupled with network  and other systems. DB server  may also be coupled with building management system (BMS)  that may include information from, or access to (e.g., request certain actions or information), building systems (e.g., HVAC, electrical, hydraulic, automation) that may provide energy consumption data. DB server  may be coupled with BMS  via BMS interface , which may be one or more wired and\/or wireless interfaces.","DB server  includes database (DB) , which is used to store information retrieved by, sent to, or otherwise acquired by DB server . In one embodiment, DB  stores energy consumption information gathered from the components illustrated in  as well as any other components. External interface(s)  provides one or more wired and\/or wireless interfaces between DB server  and other sensors or components (not illustrated in ).","Statistics  may be statistics that are derived by DB server  or are provided to DB server . Statistics  may be used to provide energy consumption information and\/or to analyze and derive energy consumption information. Analytics  represent logic (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, any combination thereof) that provides analysis of the information stored by DB server . For example, analytics  may provide macro or micro analysis of energy consumption information as described herein. Server  provides services from DB server  to devices coupled with DB server .","Sensors  may be any sensors that provide information to any of the devices of . Sensors  may be any type of sensors, for example, temperature sensors, light sensors, wind sensors, etc. Sensors  may also include soft sensors, for example, a software agent that provides data in sensor format derived from other forms of data, such as a weather station report. Power meters  may be any power meters that provide power information to any of the devices of . Power meters  may be any type of power meters that monitor power, for example, at power outlets, light fixtures, or power consumption of any other electrical device.","Platform  represents any number of similar platforms that may be coupled with one or more networks interconnected with DB server  and\/or other devices of . Platform  may be, for example, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, or any other device that may be utilized to provide some or all of the information described herein.","In one embodiment, platform  includes one or more of the agents illustrated in  in addition to logical and computational components not illustrated in . Energy monitoring agent may  provide energy monitoring feedback and functionality to a user of platform . Temperature agent  may monitor temperature conditions in and\/or around platform . For example, temperature agent  may monitor the ambient temperature of the space in which platform  resides, or may monitor the temperature of platform .","Energy agent  monitors and\/or computes, or otherwise determines energy consumption of platform . Energy agent  may operate as described herein to determine energy consumption. Location agent  operates to determine the position of platform . Location agent  may use global positioning system (GPS) technology, or other techniques for determining the location of platform .","Light agent  monitors light levels around platform . Light agent  may include, for example, an ambient light sensor. Light agent  may also calculate or otherwise determine light conditions in and around platform .","Conceptually, the techniques described herein operate by tracking the time that the monitored system (e.g., platform ) spends in various operational states\u2014such as running, idle, off\u2014and by multiplying the time spent in each state with platform power drawn in each state to compute energy usage (energy=power\u00d7time). In one embodiment, there is provided (1) the ability to detect operational states of the monitored system and times spent in those operational states, and (2) information related to power consumption in each of the relevant operational states of the monitored system.","This principle may be applied to any electronic equipment or device (e.g., HVAC system) that has operational states with specific energy consumption, such as desktop computers or laptops, by providing a software agent to track platform power state occupancy using, for example, system calls, then compute energy usage by integrating over time state occupancy with power consumed in each state, thus yielding energy consumption in KWh. Non-electrical energy consumption can also be monitored, for example, a state of a heating system may be monitored and energy consumption may be determined by using the state of the heating system along with the amount of natural gas consumed in each state to determine an energy usage. This technique is applicable to other situations as well.","State-specific power usage of individual platforms required by this calculation may be measured by commercial instruments (one time bench\/lab measurement per supported platform) or provided as specifications by vendors through machine-readable methods, such as an online web service. Note that vendors already measure and report these kinds of values to standards and rating bodies, such as ECMA and EnergyStar.","The energy-tracking agent(s) may reside on the platform or elsewhere in the infrastructure (e,g, a cloud service or with one device acting as proxy for another\u2014PC for a printer). Currently energy measurement is performed via expensive external hardware power meters.","Described herein is an Eco Sensing Building (ESB) data model and analytical framework to provide data modeling and analytical implementations to accurately depict a holistic view of the energy consumption at the individual level, allow a user to express his\/her comfort in the environment, and analyze the collected data to predict future energy usage trending and to advise the user regarding possible actions to reduce energy consumption.
