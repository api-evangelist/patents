title: Constructing and maintaining web sites
abstract: Creation and maintenance of a web page can be facilitated using an interactive web application that runs in a browser at a client machine. The interactive web application can be provided to the client machine over a network by a development application at a server. Using the interactive web application, a user can configure various aspects of a web page, including but not limited to layout, colors, fonts, tools, live dynamic content, and the like, directly on the sever without knowledge of mark-up language coding or other techniques such as cascading style sheets.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/107,618, which was filed on Oct. 22, 2008 and entitled \u201cConstructing and Maintaining Web Sites,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The subject matter described herein relates to creation, construction, and\/or maintenance of web content and web sites.","Web site designers and programmers have historically used a variety of products to build the structure of a web site and a different set of tools to assist in maintenance and modification of content within the context of the structure. For example, building the structure of a web site can be accomplished by using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a style sheet language that describes the presentation of a document written in a markup language. A typical application of CSS is to style web pages written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML). The CSS can also be applied to various kinds of Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents, including Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and XML User Interface Language (XUL). Generating or modifying a web page that includes complex functionality can involve the use of multiple applications to prepare the necessary coding. In many instances, knowledge of coding languages and\/or other specialized applications or protocols can be necessary to competently prepare a modern web page. Additionally, typically available web page generation tools are typically executed at a local machine to prepare the code necessary to implement a web page. This code is then uploaded to a server to implement the web page for access over a network. When modifications to the web pager are required, the coding is modified and a new version is uploaded. This can lead to a frustrating cycle of uploading, testing, and re-uploading.","In one aspect, a computer-implemented method includes a development application executing on the server receiving, from a browser executing an interactive web application on a client machine, a series of instructions pertaining to creation or modification of a web page. The instructions are entered by a user of the client machine via interaction with a plurality of user interface elements displayed by the interactive web application in the browser. The instructions in the series of instructions relate to one or more of a layout including one or more divisions of the web page, one or more CSS properties for displaying one of the one or more divisions of the web page, one or more content feeds providing content to be displayed in one of the one or more divisions of the web page, a content tool to handle the one or more content feeds in the one of the one or more divisions of the web page, and a configuration of the content tool defining how the content tool handles the one or more content feeds. Upon receipt by the server of one or more of the series of instructions, the development application generates a mark-up language coding that modifies the layout and one or more functions of the web page based on the received one or more of the series of instructions. Upon receipt of a request entered by the user at the interactive web application, the development application transmits the mark-up language coding to the interactive web application for display in the browser as a real time preview of the web page. Upon receiving a request from the user to save changes to the web page from the interactive web application at the server, a final mark-up language coding for the web page is stored in a database accessible to the server.","In some variations one or more of the following can optionally be included. One or more content items can be assigned to a specific content feed and an identifier can be associated with the specific content feed at the server. The one or more content items can originate from a content provider external to the server. The series of instructions include the identifier, a designated division of the web page within which to display the specific content feed in the web page, and a selection and configuration of a specific content tool to handle the specific content feed. The server can provide the final mark-up language coding to a second browser that navigates to a web page address identifying the web page such that the second browser displays the web page with the specific content feed provided dynamically, with the properties of the designated division, and in accordance with the configuration of the specific content tool.","In further optional variations, the one or more content items can include one or more of text, image files, video files, and audio files. The specific content tool can be selected from ad server position tools, archive tools, blog\/feed tools, building block tools, calendar tools, contest tools, feed multi tools, feed slideshow tools, form module tools, forum\/message board tools, full text tools, gallery module tools, HTML code drop tools, keyword search box tools, landing pad tools, media player tools, log-in block tools, navigation tools, podcast feed and multi-tools, poll module tools, RSS feed pull tools, simple text tools, scheduled content tools, tab set tools, user generated content tools, and video blog\/feed tools. Prior to the providing of the interactive web application from the server, the server can receive from the client machine a request to initiate the instance of the development application at the server. The receiving of the request can include receiving indication from the browser application on the client machine that the user has directed the browser to navigate to a uniform resource locator (URL) designating the development application. The interactive web application can be delivered from the development application executing on the server to the browser executing on the client machine. The server can provide the final mark-up language coding to a second browser that navigates to a web page address identifying the web page such that the second browser displays the web page. The interactive web application can include an asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) application.","In still further optional variations, the series of instructions can include a web page layout selection that defines the layout for the web page including one or more divisions of the web page, a CSS properties selection that defines the CSS properties for one or more divisions of the web page, a content selection that designates one or more specific content feeds whose contents are to be displayed in one or more divisions of the web page, and\/or a content tool selection that identifies a content tool for inclusion in a division of the web page to provide content and a content tool configuration selection that defines how the content tool configures the content provided via the content tool. An administrative console accessible by navigating the browser to an administrative console URL can be provided by the development application. The administrative console can provide functionality for creating a new content tool or modifying default settings of an existing content tool.","In an interrelated aspect, a computer-implemented method includes activating a control console of an interactive web application executed in a browser on a client machine. The interactive web application is received over a network from a development application at a server implemented on one or more processors. A first modification of a web page CSS properties feature is received by the interactive web application by user interaction with a CSS properties feature user interface element provided in the browser upon selection by a user of a CSS properties feature option on the control console. A second modification of functionality of a specific tool to be displayed in the web page is received by the interactive web application by user interaction with a choose and configure tool user interface element provided in the browser upon selection by the user of a choose and configure tool option on the control console. A third modification of content to be provided within the web page is received by the interactive web application by user interaction with a content management user interface element provided in the browser upon selection by the user of a content management option on the control console. Instructions are relayed from the interactive web application to the development application based on the first modification, the second modification, and the third modification to the development application. The instructions cause the development application to generate a mark-up language coding that creates the web page based on the instructions. A preview of the web page is displayed in the browser upon selection by the user of a preview option on the control console. The displaying includes passing the mark-up language coding to the browser from the development application.","In optional variations, the browser can be directed to a uniform resource locator corresponding to an administrative console provided by the development application, and the administrative console can be interacted with via the browser to create or modify a content tool.","Articles are also described that comprise a tangibly embodied machine-readable medium operable to cause one or more machines (e.g., computers, etc.) to result in operations described herein. Similarly, computer systems are also described that may include one or more processors and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory may include one or more programs that cause the processor to perform one or more of the operations described herein.","The subject matter described herein can, among other possible benefits, provide improvements in several functional areas of web site development and deployment, including, but limited to, layout and presentation, functional implementation and content management. In this context, a web site can be accessible via the Internet or other networks, such as for example an organization's intranet, or even over a local area network. In some aspects, the current subject matter provides the capability to build and maintain a web property within the construct of single application. An extensible web development framework can be customized by an application developer and tailored to fit the needs of a particular individual or organization. A modern web site can be built and maintained to comply with Web 2.0 standards from within an application that is hosted on the server from which the web site is provided and that is accessible from any client machine via a standard web browser.","The details of one or more variations of the subject matter described herein are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages of the subject matter described herein will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","When practical, similar reference numbers denote similar structures, features, or elements.","The current subject matter includes a server-based development application that can be used to create new pages or modify existing pages for a web site. A interface provided by an interactive web application delivered to a browser on a client machine from the development application on the server can be used to create the layout of a web page by using a point and click methodology. The interface can use modules, or \u201ctools\u201d provided by programmatic elements. The programmatic elements can be added using point and click methodology. For example, programmatic tools can accept content based on user input or through third party content integration automation. Content can be edited using the same user interface, stored and repurposed throughout the web site or network of web sites. In some implementations, the programmatic functionality provided by various tools discussed herein can be added to the site without any code being written or uploaded by the user. Each tool can have its own console for controlling the various parameters and configuration options.","Maintenance and modification of web sites can be accomplished by using a content management systems (CMS), which is computer software that can be used to create, edit, manage, and publish content in a consistently organized fashion. A web content management system is a CMS designed to simplify the publication of content to web sites, in particular allowing content creators to submit content may or may not require technical knowledge of HTML or the uploading of files. Web site management tools such as those described herein can in some implementations be implemented using a solution stack based on the Linux operating system, Apache web server software, MySQL database management system or database server, PHP or other programming languages including but not limited to Perl and Python. These solutions are collectively referred to as LAMP. Other solutions can also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","104","106","104","102","110","112","104","112","102","110","110","116","114","106","120","102","104","118"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","110","102","114","116","112","116","112","116","114"]},"At , upon receipt by the server of each instruction, the development application  generates a mark-up language coding that modifies the web page layout based on the received instruction. A real time preview of the web page based on the mark-up language coding generated after receipt of each instruction is displayed via the browser  at . At , a final mark-up language coding for the web page is stored in a database  accessible to the server  upon receipt of a request from the user to save changes to the web page. The request is received from the interactive web application  at the development application at the server .","After creation or modification of the web page is completed and the user sends a request to save changes to the web page to the database , the server  can send the final mark-up language coding to a second browser  on a second client machine  that navigates to a web page address identifying the web page. Upon receipt of the final mark-up language coding, the second browser  displays the web page.","Optionally, one or more content items are assigned to a specific content feed. An identifier is associated with the specific content feed at the server . The one or more content items originate from a content provider external to the server . The series of instructions include the identifier and a designated division of the web page within which to display the specific content feed in the web page. The server provides the final mark-up language coding to a second browser  that navigates to a web page address identifying the web page. The second browser displays the web page with the specific content feed provided dynamically and with the properties of the designated division. The one or more content items can include one or more of text, image files, video files, and audio files.","In some implementations, authentication of the user to create or modify the web page can be required. Prior to the server  providing the interactive web application  to the browser , the user can request to initiate the instance of the development application at the server . When this request is received at the server  from the client machine , the server  delivers the interactive web application  from the development application  executing on the server  to the browser  executing on the client machine . The request can include an indication from the browser  on the client machine  that the user has directed the browser to navigate to a network address, for example a uniform resource locator (URL), designating the development application  and can further include authentication information, such as for example a log-in identification and a password.","In some implementations, the development application , in concert with the interactive web application  executing within the browser , can allow a user to develop web sites through the web browser  without requiring the user to understand mark-up language coding. Using this approach, a fully compliant CSS layout can be created without using any 3rd party software. Additionally, because the development application can automatically generate coding, for example CCS applications and the like, based on user selections entered via the user interface of the interactive web application  in the browser  on the client machine , a web site can be built without the need to transfer files from a desktop PC to a public web server. Rather, the web pages are created directly at the server  by the development application based on instructions provided from the interactive web application . A user can manipulate layout and presentation of the web site through an onscreen WYSIWYG model that requires no access to a server, files or code. For example, fully compliant and validated CSS markup code can be generated automatically through a point and click mechanism that can, in some variations, include a control console  as described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","116","114","300","300","300","300","300","302","304","306","310","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","304","402","300","404","406","410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","502","502","304","300","400","502","504","506","504","504","504","102","504","510","512","514","516","502","500","520","504"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","502","506","506","116","506","602","604","606","506","610","612","506","506","614"]},"In some implementations, when a user modifies the size of a division or a subdivides an existing division to create a new one, the development application can dynamically build an array that can be interpreted into a nested division structure. Once the divisions are made and new divisions are created, they can be manipulated, on page, in a manner consistent with the user interface provided in the browser  by the interactive web application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","114","116","704","702","400","704","704","702","506","400","704","706","704"]},"In some implementations, programmatic functions provided by the development application  can include navigational elements, links, calendars, forms, and galleries. Using the development environment provided by the interactive web application  at the browser  on a client machine  interacting with the development application  at the server , a web developer can write programs or scripts to extend the functionality of the development application . For example, scripts compatible with libraries available on the server  can be uploaded to a directory and become functions within the structure of the web site. The interactive web application  can also use the point and click methodology to apply programmatic functionality to a division  in the layout of a web page .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","400","704","306","802","802","704","704","116"]},"Example of content tools that can be accessed via the tool icons  after selection of the choose\/configure tool option , either in the division-specific control console user interface element  for a selected division  or the control console user interface element  for an undivided web page , include but are not limited to ad server position tools, archive tools, blog\/feed tools, building block tools, calendar tools, contest tools, feed multi tools, feed slideshow tools, form module tools, forum\/message board tools, full text tools, gallery module tools, HTML code drop tools, keyword search box tools, landing pad tools, media player tools, log-in block tools, navigation tools, podcast feed and multi-tools, poll module tools, RSS feed pull tools, simple text tools, scheduled content tools, tab set tools, user generated content tools, and video blog\/feed tools.","An ad server position tool can provide means for delivering ad campaigns to a single site, a group of sites, or a user network. Campaigns can be built with single or multiple flights. Targeting rules can be defined to allow maximum flexibility. Campaign delivery can be impression-based or based on run dates. Metrics can be provided per complete campaign or per flight segment, and can be broken down to the impression\/click per day. They can also be sorted by any time period.","An archive tool can provide a flexible way to present archived blogs, feeds, or podcasts. If the archive tool is placed on a web page  or a division  with a blog or feed it can create, among possible options, a calendar with clickable days and month headers to display blog\/feed postings from whichever is clicked or a monthly-based listing of blog\/feed headlines.","A blog\/feed tool can provide means for creating blogs or feeds that can be added to a single site or a network. For example, an unlimited number of blogs can be added. Content can be added and edited using an easy-to-use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) text editor. The editor can also upload and resize images, add rich media, and provide a toolbar for overriding or customizing font styles and text formatting. This module can automatically arrange and archive content according to parameters set by the user. The feed tool can be configured via a tool configuration console displayed in the interactive web application . For example, the tool configuration console can allows a user to select multiple display options for the feed content. The multiple display options can include, among other possible options, titles, summaries, or the full story of a news feed.","A building block tool can provide means to insert the same content on every web page on a web site and to update the content across the entire web site via a central control. Building blocks can be subsets of tools that can only be edited in a special layout. Changes to the building block tool can be reflected immediately on every web page that contains the building block tool. For example, a building block tool can be used for content that will be exactly the same across the site, for example mastheads, footers, and the like.","A calendar tool can provide means to insert one or more calendars on a site. Events can be added to the calendar using a WYSIWYG tool. Various style options can be available for formatting including a traditional numbered layout with clickable dates that opens a details page or an events list.","A contest tool can provide means to create contests and capture user registration data. Contests can be shared with a network, with a group of sites, configured for an individual site, or the like. Contest tools can be placed in any area of a web page  or division  or can be displayed as a list with links to a fully detailed web page.","A feed multi tool can provide means to place a combination of feeds from different sources into one list. Any number of configured feeds can be added to this area and treated like a single feed. A feed slideshow tool can provide means to display a number of feeds in a timed slideshow. The contents of several feeds, for example feeds containing images, can be displayed one after the other for a preset period of time. A feed slideshow tool can allow a user to display multiple headline stories in a compact area.","A media player tool can provide the ability to display or play media on the web page  or in a division . The media player tool can be embedded on the page or launched as a separate application. A podcast feed and multi-tool can allow audio or video clips to be added to the site as a feed. A user can also upload MP3 or WMV files. Audio or video clips can be organized like feeds and a really simple syndication (RSS) feed can be automatically generated. Alternatively, an audio or video clip can be directly downloaded from the web site by a web site visitor. The multi-tool can combine several feeds into one list. A RSS feed pull tool can provide the ability to display RSS feeds on the web site. For example, any RSS feed available on the Internet can be displayed as headlines or summaries. A video blog\/feed tool can allow users to add video to the site. For example, MOV, AVI, RAW, or MPEG files or the like can be uploaded using this tool. The files can be compressed for playback in a Flash player. The user can choose from a set of thumbnails, enter a caption and add any story details.","A form module tool can provide means to place customized forms on a web page  to collect user information from the web site. Form data can be saved to a database  and downloaded, for example in a CSV format file, emailed to a designated recipient, or the like. Forms can be placed anywhere on a web page  or division  and can be configured using a main administrative console similar to that described below and shown in . Using the administrative console, a user can define fields and input elements for a form, including but not limited to default appearance of the form (for example size of fields, fonts, colors, layout, etc.). When a user selects a form module tool via the interactive web application  for inclusion in a division of a web page, the tool configuration console for the form module tool can permit the user to create a custom configuration for the form module tool, for example by resizing text entry fields, deleting one or more of the default fields or user interface elements, assigning new text formatting or backgrounds, and the like.","A forum\/message board tool can provide means to place a message board, comment section, or other forum on a web page  or in a division  to allow visitors to the web site to comment on or discuss one or more topics. Forum data can be saved to the database . A forum or message board tool can be placed anywhere on a web page  or division . As with other tools, default settings for a forum\/message board tool can be set user the administrate console. Using the forum\/message board tool in the interactive web application , a user can modify the default settings for the forum\/message board tool using a tool configuration console.","A full text tool can allow for text and images to be added to a web page  or division . The full text tool can support, among other possible features, local style overrides, HTML-editing, tables, drag and drop image uploads, document uploads (such as PDFs or Word documents), hyperlinks, and the like.","A gallery module tool can display a series of images, for example in several different formats. In some implementations, a gallery module tool can display single photos with next and previous buttons, or thumbnails and larger images. It can also display a series of galleries with links to the photos or provide other similar features.","A HTML code drop tool can allow for custom scripts or HTML and can also optionally support copy and paste into a textbox. One or more types of scripts and\/or tags can be disallowed via input of user preferences due to security reasons.","A keyword search box tool can allow visitors to the web site to easily find content in blogs, text, podcasts, or other searchable content available on the web site or optionally over a larger network such as the Internet or World Wide Web. Keywords can be entered using the tools to add blogs, feeds, text, podcasts, and the like.","A landing pad tool can provide a place to display feed content, for example by allowing a user to create a special layout which can save time by generating a fully formatted web page for the content of a feed headline. The layout can be designed to match the look and feel of the rest of the web site, thereby creating a consistent and professional appearance. Each individual feed may not need a separate HTML page. The contents can simply be inserted into and displayed in the layout when a headline is clicked.","A log-in block tool can be provided to permit a web site visitor to log in to the site, in some examples for access to a discussion forum or to access premium content on the web site. This tool can display the visitor's name if the visitor is already logged in or remains logged in from a previous visit to the web site.","A navigation tool can provide a site-accessible navigation feature. Such a tool can be added to any layout within the web site once it is configured. Any modifications to the navigation set represented by the navigation tool can be made global. Specifically, with the help of a navigation tool, a user of the development application  may not have to access and individually update each web page at a web site. In some implementations, a navigation tool can automatically generate a new page layout based on its section when a link set to a non-existent page (other than the default URL) is clicked.","A poll module tool can provide the ability to collect responses and opinions to questions. Web site visitors can graphically see the results of the poll immediately, either upon casting a vote in the poll or by selecting an optional \u201cview results\u201d user interface element.","A simple text tool can provide the ability to add short segments of text, for example for a title or caption. Text can be set to global, making it easy to repeat titles over several pages of the web site or to a current page only, allowing for the reuse of sections for different pages.","A scheduled content tool can provide the ability to display content at certain times of the day, week, month, or other scheduled time. Content can contain text and images. The scheduled content tool can be used, for example, to display daily specials or what is playing or showing now. It can also show a default image during times when no scheduled events are to be displayed.","A tab set tool can allow more content to fit in a compact space. Tabs can be oriented horizontally or vertically. The tabs can contain images, for example one for each of an active or inactive state. The content of a tab can be either static or dynamic (such as feeds).","A user generated content tool can provide the ability to display information gathered from web site visitors, for example by a form, in a consistent and stylized format. This tool can arrange and format information collected from a form configured or designed using the form tool. It can also perform tasks such as resizing uploaded photos.","Using content tools and their associated tool configuration consoles as described herein can allow the addition of very sophisticated functionality to a web page or a web site without requiring the user to write or upload any code. A content tool can be built and its default settings established or modified using an administrative console provided by the development application  accessed directly via a browser  on a client machine . In this manner, technical programming requirements for creating a web site are removed. Web sites with very complex functionality can be created by a user via a very clear and uncomplicated user interface provided in a browser  by the interactive web application  which relays instructions entered by the user to the development application  at the server . The development application  prepares the necessary coding to implement the layout and functionality of a web page or web site in accordance with the relayed instructions.","When a user selects one of the tool icons , a tool configuration console can be displayed for the corresponding content tool.  shows a screenshot  illustrating a tab set tool configuration console  according to an implementation. The tab set tool configuration console  shown includes two tabs, one for defining tab parameters  and a second for setting tab styles . The setting tab styles tab  selected in the screenshot  includes several user interface elements via which a user can set or modify tab header styles , active tab header styles , and tab content styles. Other options can also be included. A tool-specific tool configuration console can be displayed upon selection by the user of the tool icon  corresponding to a specific type of tool. Each tool-specific tool configuration console can include user interface elements that correspond to features of that tool.","In some implementations, a content management feature can be provided that allows for the separation of the content of the web page  from the display of that content. In this manner, the content throughout the web site can be reformatted, repurposed, and displayed to a web site visitor with the stylistic properties of the layout within which the content appears and according to configurable settings of the content tool via which the content is provided in a division of the web page. Content can be repurposed through the web site when it is assigned to a feed. A feed can represent a series of content items that are associated with a particular identifier. The identifier, or feed ID, can be referenced by the user, again using a point and click methodology, to any content area. The content can appear dynamically and inherit the properties of the division within which it is displayed and the content tool that provides it when the web page is displayed to a web site visitor.","Feeds can be shared within the same web site or within a network of web sites. This is known as a content syndication. The current subject matter can offer a high degree of flexibility with regard to feeds. This flexibility allows for a unique method of allowing network-wide content to be shown in the context of a single web site with a \u201cpunch out\u201d for web site-specific content. More specifically, network shared content layout structures can be provided in which individual web sites can optionally insert unique modular content into the overall shared layout of a web site.","Feeds can contain text or rich media, for example images, video, and audio files, or any combination thereof.

These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and\/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which can be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.","These computer programs, which can also be referred to programs, software, software applications, applications, components, or code, include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and\/or object-oriented programming language, and\/or in assembly\/machine language. As used herein, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d refers to any computer program product, apparatus and\/or device, such as for example magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, and Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), used to provide machine instructions and\/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term \u201cmachine-readable signal\u201d refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and\/or data to a programmable processor.","To provide for interaction with a user, the subject matter described herein can be implemented on a computer having a display device, such as for example a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, such as for example a mouse or a trackball, by which the user may provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well. For example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, such as for example visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user may be received in any form, including, but not limited to, acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","The subject matter described herein can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, such as for example a data server, or that includes a middleware component, such as for example an application server, or that includes a front-end component, such as for example a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described herein, or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, such as for example a communication network. Examples of communication networks include, but are not limited to, a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), and the Internet.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","The implementations set forth in the foregoing description do not represent all implementations consistent with the subject matter described herein. Instead, they are merely some examples consistent with aspects related to the described subject matter. Although a few variations have been described in detail above, other modifications or additions are possible.
