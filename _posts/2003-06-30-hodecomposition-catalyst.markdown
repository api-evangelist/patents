title: HOdecomposition catalyst
abstract: An activated catalyst for the rapid decomposition of HOis provided wherein a porous high surface area catalyst base, e.g. a zeolite molecular sieve (ZMS) is impregnated or doped with a solution of metal cation salts and an ionic promoter, dried and calcined to form an activated catalyst. Such activated catalyst, in the form of a porous monolith or chunks, extrudate, pieces, pellets, or spheres, can be poured into and confined, in a tight pack, in a cavity of a rocket housing, downstream of a pressurized HOtank. The HOis flowed through the catalyst and undergoes rapid decomposition into steam and Oand flows out the propellant nozzle of such rocket. Advantages of such activated catalyst are that it can be employed to rapidly decompose HOto propel a) a mono-propellant rocket, b) a bipropellant rocket (having fuel and a combustion chamber) and c) a hybrid rocket (powered by HOand fuel grain) and can also be used for a starter cartridge decomposition catalyst, a gas generator decomposition catalyst and the like. Another benefit of the activated catalyst of the invention is its low weight which is highly suitable in small flightweight rocket systems.

No. 09\/761,064, filed 17 Jan. 2001, abandoned, itself a CIP of patent application Ser. No. 09\/255,531, filed 22 Feb. 1999, abandoned, in turn a Divisional of Ser. No. 08\/454,895, filed 31 May 1995, abandoned, of the same title and inventorship.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates to an activated catalyst for HOdecomposition, particularly a catalyst of high porosity and method for preparing same.","Conventionally, catalysts have been employed for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as applied to monopropelant thrusters, liquid rocket engines, hybrid rocket systems and the like. The products of decomposition of HOare steam and oxygen, which can then react with a conventional rocket fuel or a grain, in the case of a hybrid propulsion system.","In the prior art such catalysts have been in the form of catalyst packs made of layers of silver plated screens which have been activated with nitric acid or samarium salts. The major limitations are; 1) activity, where the surface area is low, thus more screens are needed which increases pressure drop; 2) poisoning, where any inhibitors present in the HOplate out on the silver screens, thereby reducing surface area and hence, activity and 3) cost, not only of materials but complex fabrication costs.","Examples of catalyst pack screens are found in the prior art, e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,257 (1991), U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,798 (1990) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,292,208 (1981), all to Baldi or Baldi et al. No improvement over the above catalyst screen packs has been noted in the prior art and there is need and market for a catalyst which is of low cost and low pressure drop and otherwise overcomes the above prior art shortcomings.","There has now been discovered an activated catalyst for HOdecomposition, which is of low cost, low weight and of low pressure drop, for, eg. mounting in a rocket propulsion system.","Broadly, the present invention provides an activated catalyst for the decomposition of HOcomprising,\n\n","The invention also provides method for preparation of an activated catalyst for the decomposition of HOcomprising,\n\n","The so formed activated catalyst is then packed into, e.g. the housing of a rocket-propelled craft as further discussed below.","Thus the catalyst can be in the form of a porous monolithic base or in the form of porous particles closely packed in a container, which has, at least, partly open ends, such as ends covered by inlet and outlet screens. The particles are thus packed closely together to act as a monolith.","That is, the essential catalyst base or bed can be thought of as a monolith. This can include a monolithic catalyst within the bed or defined catalyst particles closely packed to act as a monolithic bed. It is important that whichever the monolithic bed, the components be arranged as to not move about, e.g., in the high flow fields of a rocket, thereby attriting.","By \u201ccalcining\u201d as used herein, is meant, heating the doped catalyst base in an oxidizing or reducing atmosphere, e.g., in air, Hor N, without burning same, to form the activated catalyst of the invention. Thus Mn is suitably calcined in air, at, e.g. 450\u00b0 C.","The doped catalyst base is calcined, e.g. in air, to form metal oxides of the catalysts doped thereon, to cause HOto more readily decompose by lowering its activation energy,","Referring in more detail to the drawings,  shows a catalyst pack  embodying the invention in a rocket housing  and held closely in place between two end screens  and  in such housing.","The catalyst pack embodying the invention is made according to the following process per the invention:\n\n","The activated catalyst, e.g., as dried granules, is loaded by pouring into a cavity between an HOpressurized storage tank and a combustion chamber. Typically, the catalyst is contained in, e.g., a cylindrical cavity and held in securely or tightly in place by metallic end screens or by a basket as discussed below.","Referring to the method of the invention in more detail, the activated catalyst of the invention is suitably made by depositing certain catalytic agents on certain catalytic bases as follows:","Applicable catalyst bases:\n\n","2) Porous alumina, silica (including waterglass) or alumino-silicate extrudate, pieces, pellets or spheres, herein \u201cparticles\u201d, with size and pore size as listed in 1) above.","The above waterglass is an amorphous, high surface area, porous silica.\n\n","To the above catalyst bases can be added certain catalytic agents per the invention, as noted above i.e.:\n\n","Thus to enhance the activity of the cation metals, which reduce or oxidize on calcination thereof, as discussed above, one can add ionic promoters, including base promoters as noted above, e.g., of K. For example, to a cation such as Mn, one can add K+ in solution and pour same over a catalyst base, of, e.g. ZMS spheres of \u215b in. dia., to produce (per the above method of the invention) an activated catalyst. In the case of Ag as a catalyst metal, an ionic promoter may not be needed within the scope of the invention.","Per the invention, the amount of cation used per catalyst base is quantified with regard to the finished doped activated catalyst as follows. A desired loading of cation on catalyst base per the invention is 0.01 to 20.0 wt % of metals basis and preferably, 0.5 to 10.0 wt % thereof. For example, the above cation loading ranges include 1% w\/w of Ag or of Mn\/K. Thus where an ionic promoter is employed, it and the cation metal are combined in the wt % ranges given above. The above metal basis is employed though the above cation metals on calcination are converted to metal oxides.","The above cations are added to the catalyst base as a soluble salt as noted above. For examples, Mn is added as KMnO, Ag as AgNO, Ru as RuCl, Pb as Pb(NO), V as NHVO, Cr as (NH)CrOand Co as Co(NO).","The above are examples of cation salts employed in the present invention and various other soluble cation salts are included in the scope of the invention.","That is, the invention employs cations of certain defined valence states including the following:\n\n","Upon calcination, in an oxidizing atmosphere, the above cations form oxides respectively, including:","MnO, AgO, RuO, PbO, VO, CrOand COO.","Also per the invention, one can add a cation salt and a base promoter at the same time, e.g., KMnO, which upon calcination, in an oxidizing atmosphere, are oxidized to M\u00aeand KO, respectively.","The following example is intended to illustrate a method embodying the present invention and should not be construed in limitation thereof.","A sample of 1.823 grams of KMnOwas dissolved in 50 g. of distilled HO at 25\u00b0 C. Then 57.75 g. of 4 \u212b ZMS 1\/16 in. pellets (extrudate) was added to such solution and soaked for one hour.","The so soaked catalytic agent and catalyst base (ZMS) were then dried overnight at 60\u00b0 C. and then calcined in air at 350\u00b0 C., again overnight. Obtained was a quantity of porous ZMS spheres of high porosity with the above catalyst agent of MnOand base promoter of KO doped into the interstices thereof, which spheres could be poured into a catalyst pack of desired shape.","The so activated catalyst spheres were poured into a basket  per  (discussed below) and tested by flowing 100 cc of 90 mole % HOtherethrough. A violent reaction was noted at temperatures of about 1200\u00b0 F. with emissions of steam and O.","Thus the activated catalyst embodying the present invention is made of highly porous material doped with a desired catalytic agent per the invention, which facilitates the decomposition of HO. That is, HOis flowed through, e.g., a catalyst pack of the invention, which pack being highly porous and of high surface area, permits the flow of HOtherethrough with low pressure drop and high catalytic contact therewith. Accordingly, the activated catalyst of the present invention, causes rapid decomposition of HOaccording to the following reaction;\n\n2HO\u21922HO+O.\n\n","The catalyst pack embodying the invention can be employed in various systems including rocket propulsion systems as indicated in ,  and .","Thus as shown in , rocket  carries a pressurized tank of He , valve , pressurized tank  of HO, valve  and catalyst pack  in a monopropellant rocket system as shown.","In operation, opening valves  and , causes the helium to pressurize against the HOand the latter to flow through valve  and through the catalyst pack , which causes a rapid decomposition of HOand forms high temperature steam and oxygen, which flow into expansion chamber  and out of rear nozzle  in a jet stream , as shown in .","Thus in the example of , jet propulsion is obtained using the catalyst pack of the present invention without combustion of the reactants as indicated.","In a combustion example, a hybrid rocket , employing the catalyst pack of the invention, is shown in . Thus rocket  has pressurized helium tank , valve , pressurized HOtank , catalyst pack  and fuel grain tube , as shown in .","In operation, valves  and  are opened and pressurized helium flows against pressurized HOin tank , causing the latter to flow through catalyst pack  and decompose and flow down the interior of fuel grain tube , combusting with same (and eroding the interior thereof) forming a hybrid jet stream which flows through nozzle  and out of the rocket , to propel such rocket , as shown or indicated in . Advantageously, the jet of rocket  can be shut off by closing valve  and later restarted by opening such valve.","In the example of , rocket  has a tank  of pressurized helium, valve , a pressurized tank  of HO, flowline , valve  and catalyst pack  mounted adjacent combustion chamber , as shown. Rocket  also has a tank  of liquid fuel, which is connected, at its forward end, by line  and valve  to the tank  of helium and at its aft end, by fuel line  and valve  to fuel injectors , as shown in .","In operation, the respective valves  &  and  &  are opened causing the flow of HOthrough the catalyst pack  and the flow of liquid rocket fuel through the fuel injectors , where fuel and decomposing HOunite in powerful combustion, emitting a jet stream  out of the combustion chamber  through discharge nozzle , as shown in .","Thus various uses of the catalyst pack of the invention, in various shapes, in various rocket systems are indicated.","Referring back to , a more detailed catalyst pack is shown in . Thus catalyst pack , mounted in rocket housing , has basket , holding activated catalyst pellets  per the invention securely in place, as shown in . Inlet feed line  and valve , admit HOto the catalyst pack  as inlet jet , which jet flows through and by the pellets , causing vigorous decomposition of HOto steam and O. Such reaction results in, e.g. a 1000 to 1 increase in volume and a reaction temperature of, e.g. 1200\u00b0 F., such that a high pressure jet  emits from discharge nozzle  to propel, e.g. the rockets of , as indicated in , ,  and .","The catalyst pack of the invention can also be employed as a gas generator, e.g. as indicated in  hereof when the rocket is held in place.","Thus the present invention provides a high surface area catalyst pack employing a porous ceramic, high surface area base impregnated or doped with an active cation catalytic agent which is highly effective in the decomposition of HO.","In sum, the activated catalyst of the invention includes\n\n","The activated catalyst of the invention has significantly higher activity and lower pressure drop than the metal screen packs of the prior art. The catalyst pack of the invention is both disposable and recyclable with relatively low costs of fabrication and cleaning respectively. That is, the catalyst pack of the invention has high surface area and activity, high poisoning threshold (blockage) and is of relative low cost and can be expendable or reusable. Another benefit of the catalyst pack of the invention is its low weight which is of high advantage in small flightweight rocket systems.","In sum, the catalyst pack of the invention is suitable for use\n\n","The activated catalyst of the invention is desirably of low pressure drop, stable at high temperatures and permits restartable combustion as noted above per .","Thus the activated catalyst embodying the invention has several uses including as a decomposition catalyst for hybrid rockets, liquid rockets, starter cartridges and as a gas or steam generator."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will become more apparent from the following detailed specification and drawings in which;",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","b":["3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
