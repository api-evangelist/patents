Therefore, the described embodiments should not be taken to be limiting.","Described herein are new methods and systems for analyzing models of phenomena that change biomedical images. For purposes of example and explanation, the methods and systems described herein may be used to determine the value of at least one pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter that is indicative of a perfusion, permeability, flow, extracellular volume fraction, or other physiological parameter of a tissue of interest (e.g., a tumor, muscle, organ, or other tissue). The determined value of the PK parameter may then be used to, for example, diagnose how the tissue of interest is responding to treatment, evaluate an abnormal condition of blood perfusion, or prognosticate an outcome, among other uses. Other aspects, uses, and advantageous of the methods and systems described herein are described further below.","With reference to , an example method  for determining a value of a PK parameter is described. As shown in , initially at block , the method  includes determine, based on a set of biomedical images, a first concentration-activity curve and a second-concentration activity curve. At block , the method  includes determine a value of at least one pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter based on the first concentration-activity curve and the second concentration-activity curve. Determining the value of the at least one PK parameter may include determining a linear model that relates the first concentration-activity curve to the second concentration-activity curve at block , and at block , determining the value of the at least one PK parameter based on application of a linear least squares (LLSQ) algorithm to the linear model. At block , the method  includes cause a graphical display to provide a visual indication of the value of the at least one PK parameter. These steps are explained in the following subsections.","Generally, the methods and functions described herein may be carried out by a computing system, such as computing system  of  described further below. Again, however, it should be understood that the computing system  of  is set forth for purposes of example and explanation only, and should not be taken to be limiting. The present methods and functions may just as well be carried out in other systems having other arrangements.","a. Determine Concentration-Activity Curves","At block , the method  includes determine, based on a set of biomedical images, a first concentration-activity curve and a second concentration-activity curve. Each of the first concentration-activity curve and the second concentration-activity curve may indicate a concentration of a respective contrast agent within a respective region of tissue.","In one example, the set of biomedical images may be a temporally dynamic series of biomedical images. The set of biomedical images may include any type of biomedical images or biomedical image data. For example, the set of biomedical images may be any type of MR images (e.g., F-MRI, DCE-MRI, F-DCE-MRI images), optical images, ultrasound images, positron emission tomography (PET) images, Computed Tomography images, or X-ray images, among other possibilities.","The respective contrast agent may be a substance used to enhance the contrast of structures or fluids within a body for medical imaging. The particular type of contrast agent may vary depending on the type of biomedical imaging technique used to obtain the biomedical images. In one case, the biomedical images may be MRI images, and the respective contrast agent may be a paramagnetic contrast agent. In another case, the biomedical images may be optical images, and the respective contrast agent may be a colored dye. In still another case, the biomedical images may be F-MRI images, and the respective contrast agent may be a nanoemulsion, such as a nanoemulsion that includes perfluorocarbons. In yet another case, the contrast agent may be a substance that is responsive to a biomarker. For instance, the contrast agent may be responsive to zinc ions or enzyme activities. Other examples also exist.","A concentration-activity curve may generally be data that indicates the concentration of a respective contrast agent as a function of time within a respective region of tissue (e.g., a voxel or group of voxels). As described further below, depending on the particular example, the first concentration-activity curve may indicate the concentration of the same contrast agent or different respective contrast agents. Additionally, as described below, the concentration-activity curves may indicate the concentration of a contrast agent within the same region of tissue or different respective regions of tissue.","Before turning to a more detailed description of the determination of a concentration-activity curve, a brief overview of modeling the pharmacokinetics of a contrast agent is provided with reference to . Such a model of the pharmacokinetics of a contrast agent may ultimately be used to generate a concentration-activity curve.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200","sup":"trans","sub":["ep","p","e"]},"PK models often make two assumptions. A first assumption is that a human body may be represented by one or more compartments, into and out of which a contrast agent dynamically flows. A second assumption is that each compartment is well-mixed such that a contrast agent entering a compartment is immediately distributed uniformly throughout the compartment.","The model shown in  is a two-compartment model including a central compartment  and peripheral compartment . Intravascular extracellular volume fraction (plasma) is considered to be the central compartment  and EES volume fraction (tissue) is considered to the peripheral compartment .","According to the model, a contrast agent may be introduced into the vasculature and diffuses into the EES in a reversible process characterized by a distribution rate constant (K) and a redistribution rate constant (k=K\/v).

However, in some examples, ignoring the fraction of vascular space (v) may lead to erroneous results. Including vin the model increases accuracy and leads to the solution to Equation 1 shown by Equation 3:\n\n()=\u00b7\u222b()\u00b7\u2003\u2003(3)\n","In an example in which the biomedical images are DCE-MRI images, Equations 2 or 3 may be used to determine the first concentration-activity curve and the second concentration-activity curve. The concentration-activity curve for plasma, Cp(t), is referred to as the arterial input function (AIF), and may be challenging to determine Example approaches include taking arterial blood samples during acquisition of biomedical images or estimating the contrast agent concentration from biomedical imaging data when a large vessel is located in the same field of view of the analyzed tissue. A third example approach is to eliminate the need of measuring the AIF by using a second tissue, a reference region (RR), as a surrogate for the AIF. The third example approach, referred to as the RR model (RRM) is further described below.","In an example in which the biomedical images are optical images, the first concentration-activity curve and the second concentration-activity curve may be determined based on a pixel intensity value of a particular color or hue that corresponds to the color of a respective contrast agent. For instance, image processing may be used to determine the intensity of a particular color within a pixel or group of pixels within each image, and the intensity may be converted to a concentration of the contrast agent to determine a concentration-activity curve.","In an example in which a contrast agent is responsive to a biomarker, the first concentration-activity curve and the second concentration-activity curve may be determined based on changes in imaging signal, such as the MRI signal or the optical imaging signal, and whereby the biomarker-responsive agent changes the imaging signal at a different rate than the agent that is unresponsive to the biomarker but is responsive to the other conditions that also potentially affect the first biomarker.","b. Determine a Value of at Least One PK Parameter","At block , the method  includes determine a value of at least one PK parameter based on the first concentration-activity curve and the second concentration-activity curve. According to the method , determining the value of the at least one PK parameter may include determining a linear model that relates the first concentration-activity curve to the second concentration-activity curve at block , and at block , determining the value of the at least one PK parameter based on application of a linear least square fitting (LLSQ) algorithm to the model.","As described previously, the PK parameter may be a parameter that is indicative of perfusion, permeability, flow, extracellular volume fraction, or other physiological parameter of a tissue of interest. For instance, the PK parameter may include a volume transfer constant, an extravascular extracellular volume fraction, or a redistribution rate constant as described below, among other possibilities. Additionally, the PK parameter may be a parameter of a linear model that relates the first concentration-activity curve and the second concentration-activity curve. The characteristics and derivations of example linear models, including a linear reference region model (LRRM) and a reference agent model (RAM), are now described in detail.","The LRRM is one example of a linear model that may be determined at block .

Using the RRM, however, still involves previous knowledge or assumption of the volume transfer constant and extravascular extracellular volume, Kand vrespectively, of the reference region. In some examples, such estimation may introduce systematic error into the determination of other PK parameters.","Another limitation of the RRM involves the use of a non-linear least squares (NLSQ) to estimate Kand vof the tissue of interest by fitting experimental concentration-activity curves to the RRM. In some examples, NLSQ fittings perform poorly under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions that are typical in clinical studies. Further, NLSQ fittings are highly dependent on the initial estimates of the constants to be calculated. For example, for a heterogeneous tissue, the initial estimates may not apply to all regions of the tissue, which may lead to inaccurate fittings. Additionally, the time required to obtain a parametric map through voxel-wise calculations that use a NLSQ algorithm can often exceed one hour, which is impractical for most radiology clinics.","In order to overcome the limitations described above, a linear RRM (LRRM) that may be used with the current method  was developed. The LRRM is one example of a linear model that may be determined at block .","The RRM may be formulated in terms of ratios of Kto K(known as R), Kto v(known as k), and Kto v(known as k). Calculating R, k, and kby applying a linear least squares (LLSQ) fitting algorithm to a linear RRM removes the need for an initial estimate of parameters. Using LLSQ can typically produce parametric maps within seconds, which can greatly facilitate the practical use of these algorithms, for example, in clinical settings. Fitting concentration-activity curves to a LRRM also leads to better performance compared to a using a NLSQ algorithm to fit concentration-activity curves to a non-linear RRM (NRRM). Additionally, using the LRRM described herein provides for more precise and accurate results under conditions of low SNR and\/or slow temporal resolution than a NRRM.","Given the behavior of a

Exemplary tumor types that can be diagnosed using the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, pleural cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, colon cancer, anal cancer, bile duct cancer, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, esophageal cancer, gall bladder cancer, rectal cancer, appendix cancer, small intestine cancer, stomach (gastric) cancer, renal cancer, cancer of the central nervous system, skin cancer, choriocarcinomas; head and neck cancers, osteogenic sarcomas, B-cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, neuroblastoma, glioma, and melanoma. The subject may be any suitable subject, including a mammal such as a human. The subject may be any subject with one or more risk factors for cancer, or who is otherwise identified by an attending physician as in need of a test for diagnosing cancer. In one exemplary embodiment, a subject \u201cat risk of breast cancer\u201d is any subject considered to be in a risk group for breast cancer. In one embodiment, the subject is a woman. In other embodiments, the subject has one or more of a lump in their breast tissue, lymph nodes, or armpit; changes in breast size or shape; skin dimpling; nipple inversion; spontaneous single-nipple discharge; a family\/personal history of breast cancer; or is a carrier of a mutation in the BRCA or other gene that predisposes one to breast cancer. Based on the teachings herein and the level of skill in the art, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art how to identify subjects at risk of other cancers.","The methods of the invention may further be used, for example, to assess a response of a subject with cancer to a prescribed anti-cancer treatment, including but not limited to radiation therapy, chemotherapy (i.e., mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, ifosfamide, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, taxanes, vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, imatinib, gefitinib, etc.), anti-angiogenic therapy (ex: bevacizumab), hormonal therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy (trastuzumab, rituximab, etc.), and photodynamic therapy. In these embodiments, the methods are performed at a first time point (for example, prior to initiating therapy), and at a second time point (for example, after one or more rounds of treatment), and a change a PK parameter between the first and the second time point provides a measure of the subject's response to treatment. Based on the results of the methods in this embodiment, an attending physician may recommend, for example, (i) modifying the therapy to be administered to the subject (increased dosage, decreased dosage, increased frequency of administration, decreased frequency of administration, etc.), (ii) switching the subject to a different therapy, or (iii) maintaining a current course of therapy.","In other examples, treatment for ischemia, revascularization, inflammatory disease, infection, or other conditions may be evaluated using the method . For instance, a change in a PK parameter may correspond to an increased or decreased blood perfusion in a tissue, which may be used to determine whether the tissue is responding to a treatment for ischemia, revascularization, inflammation, infection, or other condition. By way of non-limiting example, \u201cinflammatory disease\u201d refers to a disease or disorder characterized or caused by inflammation. \u201cInflammation\u201d refers to a local response to cellular injury that is marked by capillary dilatation, leukocytic infiltration, redness, heat, and pain that serves as a mechanism initiating the elimination of noxious agents and of damaged tissue. The site of inflammation may include the lungs, the pleura, a tendon, a lymph node or gland, the uvula, the vagina, the brain, the spinal cord, nasal and pharyngeal mucous membranes, a muscle, the skin, bone or bony tissue, a joint, the urinary bladder, the retina, the cervix of the uterus, the canthus, the intestinal tract, the vertebrae, the rectum, the anus, a bursa, a follicle, and the like. Such inflammatory diseases include, but are not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), other arthritic diseases (e.g., acute arthritis, acute gouty arthritis, bacterial arthritis, chronic inflammatory arthritis, degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis), infectious arthritis, juvenile arthritis, mycotic arthritis, neuropathic arthritis, polyarthritis, proliferative arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, venereal arthritis, viral arthritis), fibrositis, pelvic inflammatory disease, acne, psoriasis, actinomycosis, dysentery, biliary cirrhosis, Lyme disease, heat rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, mumps, , and blastomycosis. Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract which include, without limitation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and indeterminate colitis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily of the joints, usually polyarticular, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures and by muscle atrophy and rarefaction of the bones.","The described systems and methods may also be used to aid in the prognosis of a subject suffering from cancer, ischemia, revascularization, inflammatory disease, infection, or other conditions. For example, the method , alone or in any combination with one or more of the blocks of method , may be used to determine a subject's prognosis when blood perfusion is abnormal (e.g., more than normal in the case of tumor angiogenesis, and less than normal in the case of ischemia, revascularization, or inflammation and infection). As used herein, \u201cprognosis\u201d may, for example, refer to a likelihood that the subject will or will not respond to a particular treatment regimen for the relevant indication.","Initially, at block , the method  includes compare a determined value of at least one PK parameter to a threshold or range. The determined value may be a value determined using the method , for example, or may be a value determined using other methods. In one example, the determined value may be a volume transfer constant, and the volume transfer constant may be compared to a volume transfer constant threshold or range. The comparison may determine, for instance, whether the determined value is within a predetermined range or a position of the determined value within the predetermined range (e.g., a percentile).","At block , the method  includes determine an effect of a therapy applied to an interest region of tissue based on the comparison. In one instance, the method  may be used to evaluate the early response of a therapy, within days or hours of starting the therapy, for example. This may be advantageous relative to waiting for longer periods of time to evaluate an effect, and then realizing that the therapy was ineffective.","In other examples, the described systems and methods may be used to predict the effect of a therapy applied to treat an abnormal condition of blood perfusion, before the therapy is initiated. In still other examples, the described systems and methods may be used to evaluate the blood perfusion of patients who are at risk for some diseases, such as cancer. For example, individuals who have had a condition in the past may be at risk of developing a particular disease that can be evaluated for. As another example, a female patient with strong genetic markers for breast cancer, who has dense breast tissue, smokes, and has a history of breast cancer in her family, may have enough risk factors to justify screening the female patient for breast cancer.","The described applications are not meant to be limiting, and other examples are also possible. For instance, it is contemplated that the LRRM can be applied to the study of other phenomena. The derivation of the RAM is one application of LRRM. In line with this strategy, the LRRM can also be applied to many other events which can also be characterized by coupled ordinary differential equations, for example, quantitative measurement of enzymatic activity using hyperpolarized MRI, receptor binding, and dynamic perfusion in non-biological systems.","In a further embodiment of all embodiments disclosed herein, the methods may further comprise treating the subject based on the results obtained through carrying out the methods of the invention. As used herein. \u201ctreating\u201d means accomplishing one or more of the following: (a) reducing or eliminating the relevant disorder, such as cancer, in the subject; (b) reducing the severity of one or more symptoms of the disorder; (c) limiting or preventing development of one or more symptoms of the disorder; (d) inhibiting worsening of one or more symptoms of the disorder; and (e) limiting or preventing recurrence of one or more symptoms of the disorder in subjects that were previously symptomatic for the relevant symptom. The specific treatment to be provided to the subject can be determined by an attending physician based on all factors, including the relevant condition, the subject's specific circumstances, and the results obtained using the methods of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"1600"},"As shown in , example system  may include a computing system  that is coupled to a display .
