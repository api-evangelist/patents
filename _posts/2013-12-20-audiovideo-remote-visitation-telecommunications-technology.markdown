VoIP stands for Voice over IP or voice over Internet Protocol. It encompasses the communication protocols, technologies, methodologies, and transmission techniques involved in the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet . Internet telephony refers to communications services\u2014voice, SMS, and\/or voice-messaging applications\u2014that are transported via the Internet, rather than the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The steps involved in originating an outgoing VoIP telephone call are signaling and media channel setup, digitization of the analog voice signal, encoding, packetization, and transmission as Internet Protocol (IP) packets over a packet-switched network. On the receiving or incoming side, similar steps (usually in the reverse order) such as reception of the IP packets, decoding of the packets and digital-to-analog conversion reproduce the original voice stream. Even though IP telephony and VoIP are used interchangeably, IP telephony refers to all use of IP protocols for voice communication by digital telephony systems, while VoIP is one technology used by IP telephony to transport phone calls. VoIP systems employ session control protocols to control the set-up and tear-down of calls as well as audio codecs which encode speech allowing transmission over an IP network as digital audio via an audio stream. The choice of codec varies between different implementations of VoIP depending on application requirements and network bandwidth: some implementations rely on narrowband and compressed speech, while others support high fidelity stereo codecs. Some popular codecs include u-law and a-law versions of G.711, G.722 which is a high-fidelity codec marketed as HD Voice by Polycom, a popular open source voice codec known as iLBC, a codec that only uses 8 Kbit\/s each way called G.729, and many others. VoIP is available on many smart phones and Internet devices so that users of portable devices that are not phones, may place calls or send SMS text messages over 3G or Wi-Fi.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["30","31","32","33","34","35"]},"The system  of the invention is described below first in terms of its telephone or phone aspects in Section 1 and  and then with respect to its audio-visual or video visitation aspects in Section 2 and .","1. Phone Features","Referring to , an embodiment of the phone system  of the invention comprises a Phone Server , a telephony switch which is connected to a Service Provider . The Service Provider  is any provider with Session Initiated Protocol (SIP) capability. The Phone Server  negotiates SIP communication between various SIP endpoints. It handles call permissions as well as charging, recording and monitoring. The Phone Server  is communicatively connected to a Monitoring Station  which requests recorded and live streams from the Phone Server . Based on a request, the monitoring station  has the ability to pause, fast forward and rewind the recorded stream as well as to stop a live call in progress. It also enables calling rules. The Phone Server  is also communicatively connected to an Account Manager Server . The account manager  provides a means for the telephones to know the details of the caller and the person or entity being called. A most preferred example of the account manager server  is a Team Server provided by Team Software of Hudson, Wis. USA. However, the account manager server  can be any server that handles TCP\/IP protocols over any IP network. The Phone Server  and Account Manager Server  are communicatively connected to the Inmate Kiosk(s)  or other devices inside the jail or other facility. Such other devices include traditional inmate telephones and mobile or hand held devices inside the secure facility or jail. The Phone Server  is also communicatively connected to the telephones and devices -outside the facility.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["40","41","10","15","45","16","44","19","46"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["40","41","10","41","47","41","47","19","44","48","49","49","10","10","10"],"i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":"FIG. 8A","b":["10","60","61","62","63","64","65","66","67","68","69","70","71","72","73"]},"Significantly, the system of the invention provides a means of receiving  an incoming call to the inmate in the facility from a person outside. Referring to , a preferred embodiment of an incoming call process of the invention involves first receiving a call request and then determining  whether the outside caller is requesting support. If so, then the call is transferred  to a help line. If not, the user is prompted  to dial or otherwise input an extension for the inmate. Users may first obtain an inmate extension as well as a PIN number by utilizing the inmatecantee.com process shown in . Next, the system determines  if the extension is valid. If not, then the caller has an opportunity to enter another extension by another prompt . If valid, the system inquires of the PIN and checks  whether it is valid. If the PIN is not entered correctly, the user again has an opportunity to correct. If the PIN is correct, the next step  is to find the Inmate's location and a list of phone devices in the inmate's POD (jail location). Phone devices may include, but are not limited to stand alone Kiosks, traditional hand held telephone devices and the like. The system then determines  whether the caller is a registered attorney. If the user is a registered attorney (again signed up at the inmatecanteen.com system of ), the conversation is private and a reduced rate may apply. If not, the system verifies  that the user has sufficient funds to place the call (funds are deposited via inmatecanteen.com). Maximum call time is calculated  based on caller funds, and at a predetermined time, for example the 1 minute 30 second remaining mark of the call, a blocking prompt is played warning the user that they are about to run out of call minutes. Initially or at any time later, inmate rules  may be processed. Such rules may include, but are not limited to inmate blacklisting, section\/pod blacklisting, email call notifications, and approved calling hours. If a call or call event or time fails a rule, the call is transferred  to a voicemail system. If all rules or some rules are met, a call record is created , recording begins (unless attorney or other call), and the registered device is dialed. Recordings are processed in GSM format. Both sides of the stream are included in the recording. The next step is to wait  for an answer. If the inmate answers, the attorney rule is checked  and if positive, the charging  process begins. If the inmate does not answer, the call may be transferred  to a voicemail system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 12-24","FIG. 12","FIG. 14","FIG. 16","FIG. 17","FIG. 18","FIG. 19","FIG. 20","FIGS. 22"],"b":["100","101","102","103","104","105","106","107","108","109","110","110","110","101","102","103","104","105","106","107","110","110","110","23","24"]},"Additional administrator control functions and user interfaces therefor are shown in .  illustrates a Close Inmate Account screen .  shows an Assign Inmate Smart Card screen .  discloses a Discipline Inmate Account interface .  illustrates an Edit Inmate Account screen .  shows an Inmate Requests\u2014Old screen .  shows a View Inmate Canteen Order screen .  shows a Bank Deposit interface .  shows a Deposit To Vendor screen .  shows a Pay Vendor user interface .  shows a Batch Order screen .  shows a Manage Site Canteen System interface .  shows a Manage Warehouse screen .  discloses a Manage Warehouse Order System user interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 38 to 50","FIG. 10","FIG. 38","FIG. 39","FIG. 40","FIG. 41","FIGS. 42 and 43","FIG. 45","FIG. 46","FIG. 47","FIG. 48","FIG. 49","FIG. 50"],"b":["130","131","132","133","134","135","136","137","138","139","140","141","142","143","144","145","131","132","133","134","135","136","137","138","44","139","140","141","143","144","145"],"i":"a\/b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIGS. 51-59","FIG. 51","FIG. 52","FIG. 53","FIG. 54","FIG. 55","FIG. 56","FIG. 57","FIG. 58","FIG. 59"],"b":["150","151","152","153","154","155","156","157","156","157","158","159","160","151","153","155","155","156","159","160","161","157"],"i":["a\/b ","a ","b"]},"2.
