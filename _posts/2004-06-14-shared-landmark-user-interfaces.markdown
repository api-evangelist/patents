title: Shared landmark user interfaces
abstract: A method, system, and computer program product provide access to user information, such as landmarks, without applications having to implement the needed user interface functionality on their own. In one embodiment, common landmark user interface components are offered with application programming interfaces (APIs) for controlling the user interfaces. By utilizing this kind of common user interface, all applications can utilize landmarks.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to computer software platform user interfaces. More particularly, the present invention relates to trusted user interfaces and user sensitive data.","Currently, software platforms offer interfaces to handle basic functionalities of landmarks and other types of private user information. For example, conventional platforms have interfaces for saving and searching for geographical location information, such as coordinates and\/or addresses. However, such interfaces are implemented by each application that uses landmarks separately. Further, common dialog interfaces used by various applications are limited to specific functions, such as saving and searching. Computer applications do not obtain information using a common interface for any function.","As a example, a software application that provides a map, such as a mapping program or a GPS program, can display standard landmarks on the map and allow a user to add additional, user-defined landmarks. Such user-defined landmarks can be considered private data. Conventional platforms that run such programs require that such the mapping software application request user-defined landmark information using a dialog user interface from the software application. Such dialog user interfaces may differ from software application to software application.","Thus, there is a need for shared landmark user interfaces. Further, there is a need for applications to be able to utilize user sensitive information with a common interface. Even further, there is a need to offer common dialogs for any information used by a computer application.","The present invention is directed to a method, system, and computer program product in which information, such as landmarks, is accessible by applications without an implementing functionality of its own. In one embodiment, common landmark user interface components are offered with application programming interfaces (APIs). By utilizing this kind of common user interface, all applications can utilize landmarks without implementing a landmark user interface of their own.","Briefly, one exemplary embodiment relates to a method for providing shared user interfaces. The method includes accessing information requested by the application, including a user interface application programming interface that selectively activates common user interface dialogs upon request by a client via the user interface application programming interface.","Another exemplary embodiment relates to a system having an application programming interface for controlling and activating common dialogs. The system includes a software application that performs operations on a device, a user interface application programming interface (API) stored on the device, and storage that maintains information accessible by the client via the user interface API. The user interface API selectively activates common user interface dialogs upon request by a client.","Yet another exemplary embodiment relates to a computer program product (e.g., a computer readable storage medium) having an application programming interface for controlling and activating common user interface dialogs presented on a device having the computer program product stored thereon. The computer program product includes a user interface application programming interface that selectively activates common user interface dialogs upon request by a client and computer code. The computer code accesses the user interface application programming interface, and accesses information requested by the application.","Other principle features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the following drawings, the detailed description, and the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","14","14","12","16","18","16","18"]},"The common UI dialogs  and the trusted application  can access landmark storage  using a storage application programming interface (API) . The landmark storage  can be, for example, a database which can reside anywhere, such as in a device or on a network server. The storage API  is a common API for accessing landmarks without the UI API . The storage API  hides the internal storage structure, allowing the internal structure to be changed without disruption to the user. Further, the storage API  checks whether the client is allowed to use the methods of the API.","The UI API  provides a common user interface, allowing developers to not have to implement landmark UI themselves. The UI API  also enhances the end user experience because the landmarks functionality looks and is always the same. If an application is un-trusted and landmarks are handled as private data, then UI API  enables access to landmarks for un-trusted applications without jeopardizing the end user's personal data because the end user can control access via common UI dialogs .","The common UI dialogs  provide a uniform access interface for both trusted and un-trusted applications to obtain a variety of data, such as user sensitive data. Landmarks are an example of sensitive data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","32","34","36","30","36","36"]},"The software application that provides map data, including the landmarks  and  may or may not be a trusted application. The software application can be a global positioning system (GPS) mapping program. To obtain information to locate a landmark, the software application interfaces with an application programming interface (API) that controls and activates common landmark dialogs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","38","38","30","38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","44"]},"In an operation , a common UI dialog is requested by the application. Example dialogs can include a dialog for browsing, selecting, creating, showing, and other various functions. After operation , an operation  is performed in which access to landmark storage is provided such that the landmark is available to the application. Landmarks can be physical locations, such as locations on a map. However, the operations of  can also apply to any user data. Landmarks are used as an example only.","This detailed description outlines exemplary embodiments of a method, device, and system for shared landmark user interfaces. In the foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the exemplary embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate description of the exemplary embodiments.","While the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the Figures and described above are presently preferred, it should be understood that these embodiments are offered by way of example only. Other embodiments may include, for example, different techniques for performing the same operations. The invention is not limited to a particular embodiment, but extends to various modifications, combinations, and permutations that nevertheless fall within the scope and spirit of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Exemplary embodiments will hereafter be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
