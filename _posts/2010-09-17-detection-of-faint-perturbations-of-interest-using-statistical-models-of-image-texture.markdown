title: Detection of faint perturbations of interest using statistical models of image texture
abstract: A system for detecting faint perturbations of interest in an image is described. The system includes a memory comprising the image, and a processor. The processor is configured to estimate a local mean and variance for each of a plurality of pixels in the image, analyze a local region of the image, an image mean, and an image variance using a filter bank, thereby generating a plurality of response vectors, determine a likelihood of a local perturbation in the image using a probability distribution based on the plurality of response vectors, and make a classification decision of the local perturbation. The probability distribution is calculated, for each of the plurality of response vectors, based on a response of each of the plurality of response vectors to the estimated local mean and variance for each of the plurality of pixels. Methods and machine-readable media are also described.

In this case, local noise may be determined experimentally, such as by determining expected local image noise experimentally. This will result in a mean value and variance value for each image coordinate.","In certain other systems, it is desirable that image noise be estimated empirically at run-time. In these systems, the process \u2032 of  may be used, which estimates image noise using population statistics. The process \u2032 of  begins in a loop of steps  through , where, for each incoming image, in step  the image is added to a buffer of images of size N+K in order to fill the buffer, where N is the number of samples for estimating the image statistics, greater than or equal to two, and K is the number of samples for estimating the current (probe) image, greater than or equal to one.
