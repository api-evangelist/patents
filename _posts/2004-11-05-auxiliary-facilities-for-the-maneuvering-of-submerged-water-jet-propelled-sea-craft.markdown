title: Auxiliary facilities for the maneuvering of submerged water jet propelled sea craft
abstract: The hull of a submerged sea craft adjacent its stern end is provided with auxiliary facilities for controlled maneuvering operations under low speed conditions, including steering, stopping and negative thrust backing performed independently of main propulsion of the craft. The auxiliary maneuvering control facilities include a curved channel pipe connected to two angularly related sub-channel pipe sections for selectively controlled outflow of fluid which is pressurized by a maneuvering control pump within the curved channel pipe before outflow through exit openings in the hull in different directions, as negative angle thrust jets and as steering control jets perpendicular to the hull centerline. By use of a sub-channel flow diverting flapper and gate valves at the inlet and exit outlet openings in the hull, all of the maneuvering operations may be performed under selective control.

No. 10\/781,957, filed Feb. 20, 2004, Navy Case No. 85,006, entitled \u201cManeuvering of Submerged Waterjet Propelled Sea Craft\u201d, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,932,013, and a continuation-in-part of U.S. Nonprovisional Application Ser. No. 10\/985,070, filed Nov. 5, 2004, Navy Case No. 96,179, entitled \u201cHigh Speed Braking of Submerged Propelled Sea Craft\u201d, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,983,710, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to the maneuvering of submerged sea craft having water jet propulsors or propulsion.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Heretofore the maneuvering of many water jet propelled sea vessels involved facilities not suitable for fully submerged sea craft. To avoid use of such maneuvering facilities, emergency water jet stoppage was proposed, involving diversion of jet outflow from a main propulsion unit. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide better maneuvering for such submerged sea craft without adverse impact on the main propulsion unit.","In accordance with the present invention, all maneuvering operations for a jet propelled craft are performed by selectively controlled inflow of pressurized fluid through auxiliary flow pipes for controlled outflow of thrust jets emerging from openings in a stern end portion of the hull in different directions. Outflow of the thrust jets in one direction perpendicular to the hull centerline is for vector steering purposes. By outflow of the thrust jets in another direction, at a negative thrust angle, maneuvering with backing and stopping under low speed conditions of the craft may be performed. Such directional outflow of jets emerging from the hull openings is selectively controlled by opening of closure gates under low craft speeds.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates an underwater sea craft  having an axis-symmetric shaped hull  according to one embodiment. The sea craft  is propelled in a forward direction by emergence of propelling water jets  from any number of main water outflow nozzles  such as four on a conical stern end portion  of the hull . Conventional rudders  project from the hull  adjacent the stern end portion , rearwardly spaced along a hull centerline  from a forward bow end portion  of the hull . Braking devices  as disclosed in the copending application Navy Case No. 96,179, Ser. No. 10\/985,070, filed Nov. 5, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,983,710, are positioned on the hull .","As shown in , pressurized seawater as the propulsion jets  is conducted toward each of the nozzles  from a main propulsion pump (not shown) respectively through a main channel  within the hull  to produce forward thrust, while seawater inflow  into the hull  enters at an angle (\u03b2i) inlet openings . Pressurized seawater emerges from the hull  as negative outflow jets  from exit outlets  at angles (\u03b2e) without any effect on the main propulsion jets . Such emergence of the negative outflow jets  provides for augmented maneuvering control under low speed conditions, involving the inflow  of the seawater through each of the inlets  and passage through a curved channel pipe section  within the hull  to an outlet pipe section  extending at a right angle to the hull centerline . The outlet pipe section  terminates at the exit outlet  and is connected to a curved turning elbow section  from which the negative outflow jet  emerges through the exit outlet  when opened as shown in . Guide vanes  and  are respectively positioned within the pipe sections  and  to smooth fluid flow therethrough under pressure imposed by blades of a maneuvering control pump  positioned within the pipe section  upstream of the guide vanes  for pressurizing such guided fluid flow. A flapper valve element  is pivotally hinged between the pipe sections  and  for angular displacement from the position shown in  closing the pipe section  to an opposite angular position closing the pipe section  as shown in . Valve elements  and  are pivotally hinged to the hull  adjacent to the stern end portion  for angular displacement from retracted positions opening the inlet  and exit outlet  as shown in , to closed positions as hereinafter explained.","The auxiliary maneuvering facilities illustrated in , also includes a pump motor  connected to the pump  so as to induce pressurized fluid flow of the inflowing seawater having a density (\u03c1) through the curved channel pipe section  from the opened inlet  at a flow rate (Q) under a velocity (Vi) while exit from the opened outlet  is under a velocity (Ve). The valve gates  and  at the inlet  and the exit outlet  are held in their open positions by actuators  and  connected thereto. A negative or reverse thrust (Tj) on the craft  is accordingly produced by emergence of the jet , wherein the negative thrust (Tj) may be determined by derivation through an equation:\n\n\u03c1(Cos \u03b2Cos \u03b2).\n","When the thrust vectoring flapper valve  is displaced to the position shown in , closing the pipe section  and opening the pipe section , the exit jet A emerges from the exit outlet  in a direction perpendicular to the centerline  to provide a larger side force and moment arm for more effective vector steering under low speed conditions.","As an alternative embodiment, the auxiliary low speed maneuvering facility as shown in  involves replacement of the pipe sections  and  with straight sub-channel pipe sections  and  connected at an angle to each other to the curved channel pipe section  hereinbefore described with respect to . The angularly related sub-channel pipe sections  and  respectively direct exit outflow from the hull  through separate axially spaced exit openings  and . Gate valves \u2032 and \u2032 are respectively hinged to the hull  at the exit openings  and . When the gate valve \u2032 opens the exit opening  and the gate valve \u2032 closes the exit opening  as shown in , the negative thrust jet  emerges from the exit opening  for low speed maneuvering control. When the gate valve \u2032 closes the exit opening  and the gate valve \u2032 opens the exit opening  as shown in , the steering jet A emerges from the exit opening  in a direction perpendicular to the hull centerline  to provide the large side force and moment arm for more effective vector steering under low speed conditions.","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that electrical energy from a power supply  as diagrammed in , may be fed through a maneuvering control system  under the influence of a craft operator input  and travel speed signals from a craft speed sensor , to selectively operate the braking devices , the pump motor  and the gate valves ,  and  (or , \u2032 and \u2032) for enhanced maneuvering of the craft  independently of its main propulsion system involving the jet nozzles . Accordingly, the maneuvering control system  selectively effects gate valve closure  or gate valve opening  through a jet gate control , and at the same time controls high speed braking  through the braking devices .","Under low speeds such as sea water travel of the craft  at less than 15 knots, the control system  through the gate control  effects positioning of the gate valves  and  by the actuators  and  or \u2032 through the gate opening control , and operation of the pump motor  through the pump motor control  for auxiliary generation of the negative thrust jets  to decelerate and stop the craft  as it is approaching zero speed. For steering purposes, the flapper  is displaced to the position shown in , or the valve \u2032 is displaced to the exit outlet open position shown in , by means of a steering thrust control  as diagrammed in . Also the control system  may be used to close all of the gate valves ,  and  or , \u2032 and \u2032 when craft maneuvering is not to be used.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1"],"b":["2","2","3","3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
