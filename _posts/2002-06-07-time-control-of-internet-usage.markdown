title: Time control of internet usage
abstract: An Internet use profile is created by a parent or guardian of an Internet user via a client-side software application at the user's computer. The use profile is submitted via the Internet to an intelligent network component. The use profile sets the duration for Internet use in general and sets the duration for access to particular Internet sites such as chat rooms, shopping sites, etc. The use profile is stored locally on the user's computer and remotely at the intelligent network component. When the user attempts to log on to the Internet via her Internet service provider, the client-side application verifies that the user computer has not already exceeded allowed Internet connection time in a previous Internet connection. If not, the connection to the Internet is allowed. After the connection is established, an Internet usage monitoring and controlling application at the intelligent network component monitors the time of connection between the user computer and the Internet. Once the allowed time of connection expires, the monitoring and controlling application instructs the client-side application to disconnect the user computer from the Internet service provider. Prior to disconnection from the Internet service provider, the client-side computer requests a password from the user. If the password equals a password included in the Internet use profile, then the user is allowed to continue the Internet connection. Also, the user is allowed to modify the use profile with the entry of a correct password to include adding additional access time.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to a method and system for controlling the amount of time a user is connected to the Internet in general or to a particular Internet site.","With the advent of the Internet, a common problem associated with Internet usage is an excessive amount of time spent by users surfing the Internet in general or particular Internet sites such as chat rooms, shopping sites, and the like. Often users connect to the Internet and simply lose track of the amount of time they have spent browsing various Internet sites or the amount of time they have spent connected to a particular Internet site. This problem is particularly bothersome for parents or guardians of children or young adults who are concerned with the amount of time spent by those users connected to the Internet.","Systems have been used for controlling the amount of time a user is connected to the Internet whereby the Internet browser application in use by the user \u201ctimes-out\u201d and prevents the user from connecting to the Internet after a prescribed amount of time. Unfortunately such systems are easily circumvented by the user such as when the user downloads a different Internet browser application not controlled by the timing control mechanism in place on the user's system.","There is a need in the art for a method and system for allowing control of the amount of time a user spends connected to the Internet or to particular Internet sites that may not be easily circumvented by the user. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","In accordance with the present invention, the above and other problems are solved by a method and system for allowing control of the amount of time a user spends connected to the Internet or to particular Internet sites. An Internet use profile is created by a parent or guardian of an Internet user via a client-side software application at the user's computer. The use profile is submitted via the Internet to an intelligent network component or application server. The use profile sets the duration for Internet use in general and sets the duration for access to particular Internet sites such as chat rooms, shopping sites, etc. The use profile is stored locally on the user's computer and remotely at an intelligent telecommunications network component.","When the user attempts to log on to the Internet via her Internet service provider, the client-side application verifies that the user computer has not already exceeded allowed Internet connection time in a previous Internet connection. If not, the connection to the Internet is allowed. After the connection is established, an Internet usage monitoring and controlling application at the intelligent network component monitors the time of connection between the user computer and the Internet. Once the allowed time of connection expires, the monitoring and controlling application instructs the client-side application to disconnect the user computer from the Internet service provider. Prior to disconnection from the Internet service provider, the client-side computer requests a password from the user. If the password equals a password included in the Internet use profile, then the user is allowed to continue the Internet connection. Also, the user is allowed to modify the use profile with the entry of a correct password to include adding additional access time. Control of access to specific Internet sites may be done by specifying in the use profile the URLs of the specific Internet sites and by providing a maximum connection time to those sites. Alternatively, Internet keywords associated with types of Internet sites may be specified along with allowable access time to those types of sites.","These and other features and advantages, which characterize the present invention, will be apparent from reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","The following description of an embodiment of the present invention is made with reference to the above-described drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts or components throughout the several figures. The present invention is directed to a method and system for controlling the amount of time the user is connected to the Internet in general or to a particular Internet site.","Referring to , an Internet use profile is created by a parent or guardian of an Internet user via a client software application  at the user's computer . The usage profile sets the duration for Internet use in general and sets the duration for access to particular Internet sites such as chat rooms, shopping sites, etc. The usage profile is stored locally on the user's computer  and remotely at an intelligent network component such as the service control point  of the telephone network  or at a remote application server . According to an embodiment of the present invention, the telephone network  through which the user's computer  connects to the Internet  monitors and controls the user's access to the Internet or to particular Internet sites to remove the ability of the user to circumvent the system locally at the user's computer .","When the user attempts to log on to the Internet  via her Internet service provider , a first check of the usage profile is performed by the client software application  before the user is allowed access to the Internet . If the usage profile shows that the user has remaining allotted time for access to the Internet  or for access to particular Internet sites, the user is allowed to connect to the Internet  via the Internet service provider . After connection to the Internet , the client software application  performs a second check of the usage profile by polling, an Internet usage monitoring and controlling application at the service control point  of the telephone network  to determine whether the user does in fact have remaining allotted time to connect to the Internet  in general or to connect to particular Internet sites. Alternatively, monitoring and control of Internet  access may be performed at an application server remotely located from the computer  via the Internet  or via an Intranet, such as the server , illustrated in  below. In this case, the monitoring and controlling application at the server  is polled to determine whether the user does in fact have remaining allotted time to connect to the Internet  in general or to connect to particular Internet sites. As should be understood, the user may have circumvented the client software application  on her computer  to make changes to the usage profile stored at the computer .","If the first check of the usage profile at the computer  or the second check of the usage profile at the service control point  or server  show that the user's time for Internet access or for access to particular Internet sites has elapsed, a prompt is displayed to the user via the client software application  that requests a password from the parent or guardian to allow additional access time to the Internet  or to particular Internet sites. If the parent or guardian enters the correct password and allows for additional Internet access time, the usage profile is updated at both the computer  and at the service control point  or server , and the user's Internet access is allowed to continue. On the other hand, if the correct password is not provided, an application at the service control point  or server  instructs the client software application  to disconnect the Internet connection between the computer  and the Internet service provider .","Advantageously, the parent or guardian may control the user's time of access to the Internet  in general or to particular Internet sites, and the parent or guardian may in fact control their own use of the Internet  by setting allowable Internet access duration. Utilization of intelligent network components such as the service control point  for monitoring and controlling the user's access to the Internet  via the user's Internet service provider  prevents the user from circumventing the parent or guardian's wishes by reprogramming the client software application  or by downloading a separate Internet browsing application.","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"A plurality of central offices are provided in a typical public switched telephone network. As shown in , each central office may include an electronic switch known to those skilled in the art as a service switching point (SSP). These are indicated in  as SSP switches  and . The terms \u201cSSP\u201d and \u201cswitch\u201d are used interchangeably hereinafter and are understood to refer to a telecommunications switch having AIN capability and which may be utilized for connecting voice channel circuits, including voice channel lines, such as the trunk circuit .","As shown in , central offices switches (SSP)  and  have a plurality of subscriber lines  and  connected thereto. Each of the subscriber lines  and  is connected to a terminating piece or pieces of customer premises equipment that are represented by telephone  and computer . SSP switches  and  are connected by a trunk circuit . These are the voice path trunks that interconnect the central offices  and  and over which calls are connected when completed.","Each piece of terminating equipment in the PSTN is preferably assigned a directory number. The term \u201cdirectory number\u201d is used herein in a manner consistent with its generally understood meaning of a number that is dialed or input by an originating party at an originating station to reach a terminating station associated with the directory number.","Much of the intelligence, and the basis for many of the enhanced features of the network, resides in local AIN service control points (SCP) , . As is known to those skilled in the art, AIN service control points, such as SCP , are physically implemented by relatively powerful fault tolerant computers. Among the functions performed by the service control points ,  is maintenance of network databases used in providing enhanced services. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the SCP  includes software applications and memory capacity for storing the Internet usage profile and for monitoring the usage of the Internet  or specific Internet sites or types of Internet sites by a user associated with the usage profile. Software applications at the SCP  may include a variety of modular software components, routines and application programming interfaces comprising an Internet usage monitoring and controlling application for monitoring and controlling Internet  use according to the usage profile and for interacting with the client software application  for controlling access to the Internet  according to the usage profile.","The SCP  is also connected to a caller name (CNAM) database . The CNAM database  comprises a plurality of directory numbers along with associated names for the directory numbers. The CNAM database  may be used to provide a look-up database to provide caller identification (ID) service. The CNAM database  may be comprised of directory numbers from wireline customers as well as wireless customers of a wireless network.","The modern Advanced Intelligent Network also includes service nodes (SN) such as service node . Those skilled in the art are familiar with service nodes, which are physically implemented by the same types of computers that embody the SCP . In addition to the computing capability and data base maintenance features, service nodes  use ISDN lines and may include DTMF signal recognition devices, tone generation devices, text to speech (TTS) voice synthesis devices and other voice or data resources.","The Internet  is well known to those skilled in the art as essentially a packet-switched network based on the family of protocols called Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), a family of networking protocols providing communication across interconnected networks between computers with diverse hardware architectures and between various computer operating systems. Operation of the Internet  and the TCP\/IP transmission protocols is well known to those skilled in the art. The Firewall  is preferably a combination of hardware and software that prevents or limits exposure of computers or network computers to unauthorized access or attack from outside the protected computer or network of computers. Accordingly to the present invention, the Firewall  prevents or limits access to a secure telecommunications network wherein the functionality of the present invention resides. That is, the Firewall  prevents or limits unauthorized access to the data, files, messages, and the like of subscribers to the services of the telecommunications provider. The secure AIN Intranet  preferably is a distributed telecommunications and computing network for providing services in accordance with the present invention. The Internet Gateway  provides access to the secure AIN Intranet  by the other components of the telecommunications network illustrated in . As is well known to those skilled in the art, a gateway may provide a number of functions including connectivity between incompatible communications networks.","The server  is a computer or collection of computers functionally connected to the user computer  via the telecommunications network . The server  may be connected to the user computer  via a distributed computing network via the Internet , or alternatively, the server  may be connected to the computer  via a local or wide area intranet system. According to an embodiment of the present invention monitoring and control of Internet usage may be done at the server  as an alternative to the SCP , discussed above. Like the SCP , the server  includes software applications and memory capacity for storing the Internet usage profile and for monitoring the usage of the Internet  or specific Internet sites or types of Internet sites by a user associated with the usage profile. Software applications at the server  may include a variety of modular software components, routines and application programming interfaces comprising an Internet usage monitoring and controlling application for monitoring and controlling Internet  use according to the usage profile and for interacting with the client software application  for controlling access to the Internet  according to the usage profile. Communication between the computer  and the server  may be done according to a variety of methods including Internet-protocol (IP) packet switching, file transfer protocol (FTP) and Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).","User Interfaces",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["24","23","43","10","23","50","110","100","50","50","50"]},"Referring to the dialog box  shown in , the user may enter the user's name, telephone number and the electronic mailing address . More importantly, the user enters a password  with which the user will be able to override the timing control mechanism of the present invention. The user may enter a general Internet usage duration  that will control the amount of time the user's computer  may be connected to the Internet  in general. As should be understood, the duration may be entered in minutes, hours or fractions of hours, and the like. The user may set the duration for particular Internet sites by entering the uniform resource locator (URL) of a particular Internet site  and a corresponding duration for allowing access to that particular URL. Alternatively, the user may enter an Internet keyword associated with a type of Internet site for controlling access to that type of Internet site. For example the user may set a time limit for all Internet sites associated with the keywords \u201csports\u201d or \u201cshopping.\u201d Or, if the user knows a particular keyword associated with an Internet site by the operator of that site, the user may enter that keyword to control access to that site. As illustrated in , the user may prescribe access duration for a number of different URLs for which the user desires to set a maximum amount of time of access. The URLs or keywords may be directed to chat rooms, shopping sites, games sites, and the like for which the user desires to set a maximum allowable access time.","Referring to , once the allotted time for access to the Internet  in general or for access to a specified URL has expired, a second dialog box  is presented to the user on the user's computer  to alert the user that her time has expired. For example, if the user's Internet access time has expired, a message  may be presented to the user to alert the user that her time has expired. A password box  is presented to the user to allow the user to override the timing control mechanism by entering a correct password. If the user's allotted time for access to a particular Internet site has expired, the user may be presented with a prompt  to alert the user that her time for connection to the particular URL has expired. A password box  is also provided to the user to allow the user to enter a correct password to override the timing control mechanism of the present invention.","Referring to , if the user enters a correct password in response to the prompts provided by the client software application  and illustrated in , a third dialog box  is presented to the user to allow the user to enter a new duration . That is, if the user is prompted that her access to either the Internet  in general or to a particular Internet site has expired, the user, upon entry of a correct password, may enter additional time for access to the Internet  in general or to a particular Internet site. As shown in , the user may enter a new duration time  or the user may enter a code such as \u201cI\u201d for indefinite duration , or the user may enter \u201c0\u201d to indicate zero duration which, of course, means that duration  for access to the Internet in general or to the particular Internet site is precluded.","Operation","Having described an exemplary operating environment and exemplary user interfaces with reference to , the following is a description of the logical call flow of a system and method of the present invention for controlling the amount of time a user has access to the Internet  in general and\/or particular Internet sites. Referring to , the method  begins at start step  and proceeds to step  where the user creates an Internet usage profile using the dialog box  presented by the client software application  illustrated in . As described above with reference to , the user may be the parent or guardian of a young Internet user, or the user may wish to control her own access to the Internet .","Utilizing the dialog box , the user enters the amount of time allowed for general Internet access , and the user enters any particular URLs or keywords and corresponding amounts of time during which the user may access those URLs or keywords. For purposes of the following description, entry of an URL by the user includes entry of an Internet keyword. At step , after the user has prepared the Internet usage profile, the user saves the profile locally at the user's computer  and submits the usage profile to the service control point  via the application . As should be understood, the usage profile may be submitted to the SCP  by logging onto an Internet Web site of the telecommunications service provider operating the telecommunications network  through which the user connects to the Internet service provider  and the Internet . If monitoring and control of the prescribed Internet usage is done at the server , then the usage profile is submitted to the server . For purposes of the following description, steps involving the SCP  may alternatively be performed at the server , as described above with reference to .","Alternatively, the user may submit the usage profile to the service control point  via non Internet-based methods. For example, the user may call in the usage profile through the SCP . For example, the user may select a star code such as \u201c*26\u201d on the keypad of the user's telephone . In response to entry of the star code, the user may be provided with an audible prompt that requests from the user the duration of access time to the Internet  for computers connected to the telecommunications network  from the user's line .","At step , the Internet usage profile is submitted to the service control point  where the user's access to the Internet  and\/or to particular Internet sites will be monitored. At step , a user of the computer  launches her Internet browser application and attempts to log on to the Internet  via the Internet service provider . At step , the client software application  detects the user's attempt to log on to the Internet service provider  and checks the usage profile submitted previously for the user's computer .","At step , the client software application  checks the Internet usage profile stored at the computer  to determine whether the user is authorized to access the Internet  and\/or particular Internet sites. That is, the client software application  determines whether the user has remaining allotted time for accessing the Internet  by comparing the expired time versus the originally allotted time entered during preparation of the Internet usage profile. If a determination is made that the user is not authorized additional access to the Internet  in general or additional access to particular Internet sites, the method proceeds to step , discussed in detail below. If the user has remaining time for accessing the Internet , the method proceeds to step  and the client software application  allows connection of the computer  with the Internet service provider  via the user's Internet browser.","At step , after connection with the Internet , the client software application  sends a request to the service control point  to check the Internet usage profile stored at the service control point . In order to send the request to the service control point , the request from the client software application is passed through the Internet , through the firewall , through the gateway  and to the SCP , as described above with reference to . At step , the service control point  checks the Internet usage profile to determine whether the user is in fact authorized to access the Internet . If the user has entered a specific Internet site URL during the user's log on to the Internet  at step , a check is also performed at the service control point  as to whether that particular URL is a URL prescribed in the Internet usage profile for a set amount of access time.","At step , a determination is made at the service control point  as to whether the general Internet use or access to the particular URL are authorized. If a determination is made that the user is not authorized additional access to the Internet  in general or additional access to particular Internet sites, the method proceeds to step , discussed in detail below. If access to the Internet  and\/or access to the particular URL requested by the user are authorized, the method proceeds to step  and the service control point  notifies the client software application . At step , the client software application  allows the access to the Internet  requested by the user to continue. Or, if the requested action is access to a particular URL, and allotted time is remaining, or if no limitations are placed on access to that URL, the client software  allows connection to the Internet site specified by that URL to continue.","At step , the service control point  monitors the Internet use by the user. In order to monitor the Internet use by the user, the client software application  monitors the user's activities by monitoring the user's Internet browser. Periodically, the client software application  forwards the elapsed time of Internet access and the elapsed time of access to particular Internet sites to the service control point . At step , a determination is made at the service control point  on a periodic basis whether the time allotted for Internet access or the time allotted for access to particular Internet sites has expired. If not, the method proceeds back to step  and the SCP  continues to monitor the user's access to the Internet . If at step , the SCP  determines that the user's allotted time for access to the Internet  in general or to a particular Internet site has expired, the method proceeds to step , and the service control point  notifies the client software application  that the user's time has expired.","At step , the client software application  presents the user the dialog box , illustrated in , to request a password from the user. As described above with reference to , the dialog box may present the user with a message  alerting the user that her Internet usage time has expired and requesting that the user enter her password to continue. Alternatively, if the user's time for access to the Internet  in general has not expired, but the user's time for access to a particular Internet site (URL) has expired, the user may be presented with a message  alerting the user that her time to connect to this particular Internet site has expired and requesting that the user enter her password to continue.","Referring now to , at step , a determination is made at the service control point  as to whether a correct password has been entered by the user via the dialog box . Prior to the determination, the software application  submits the password entered by the user to the service control point  via the Internet  as described above. If a correct password is not received at the service control point , the service control point  notifies the client software application  to disconnect the connection between the computer  and the Internet service provider . According to a preferred embodiment, in order to prevent the user from unauthorized tampering with the programming of the client software application  to avoid the timing control mechanism of the present invention, the service control point  will automatically disconnect the connection between the computer  and the Internet service provider  if the password entered by the user is incorrect after a set number of password entry attempts or if the data relating to the elapsed time of Internet access or elapsed time of access to a particular Internet site maintained at the service control point  differs from that data maintained by the client software application  at the computer . At step , the client software application  disconnects the connection between the computer  and the Internet service provider , and the method ends at step .","If a proper password is received by the service control  point at step , the method proceeds to step , and the service control point  notifies the client software application  to request additional Internet access time from the user. In response, the dialog box  illustrated in  is presented to the user on the computer screen  of the user's computer . If the user desires to access the Internet  for additional time, the user may enter additional time in minutes, hours, or fractions of hours as described above with reference to . Alternatively, the user may enter a code such as \u201cI\u201d to indicate that Internet access is for an indefinite duration. Alternatively, the user may enter \u201c0\u201d duration that indicates that no additional duration for access to the Internet  in general or for access to a particular Internet site is authorized.","At step , a determination is made at the client software application  as to whether additional duration time has been entered for general Internet access or for access to a particular Internet site. If additional time has been entered by the user at step , the method proceeds to step , and the client software application  sends an updated Internet usage profile to the service control point . At step , Internet usage by the user is allowed to continue, and the method proceeds back to step  where the service control point  monitors the user's access to the Internet  or to particular Internet sites in accordance with the updated Internet usage profile submitted to the service control point at step .","Referring back to step , if the user does not enter additional time for general Internet access or for access to particular Internet sites, the method proceeds to step , and the service control point  notifies the client software application  to disconnect the connection to the Internet service provider  as described above. Advantageously, utilization of intelligent network components such as the service control point  for monitoring and controlling the user's access to the Internet  via the user's Internet service provider  prevents the user from circumventing the parent or guardian's wishes by reprogramming the client software application  or by downloading a separate Internet browsing application.","As described, a method and system are provided for utilizing an intelligent telecommunications network component for controlling the amount of time a user has access to the Internet  in general or the amount of time a user has access to a particular Internet site. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications or variations may be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
