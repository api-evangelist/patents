title: Monitoring and enforcing price parity
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for monitoring and enforcing price parity. In one implementation, a computer-implemented method monitors price parity. The method includes generating, by a server, a task related to pricing of an item. The server receives, in response to the task, a first price and a second price of the item. The first price corresponds to an offering price of the item by a third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer and the second price corresponds to an offering price of the item by the third-party seller via a sales channel of the third-party seller. The server evaluates whether the second price violates a price parity rule, based on at least a comparison of the first price and the second price.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A retailer who sells items over the Internet may offer hundreds, thousands, or even millions of items for sale. The retailer's item listings, which include information identifying the items and prices of the items, are accessible over the Internet by customers through the retailer's site. In addition to offerings that are available for purchase and fulfillment from the retailer, the retailer may provide a service that allows independent, third-party sellers to offer items for sale through the retailer's site. Under such an arrangement, the retailer typically receives a commission for items that are sold by the third-party sellers through the retailer's site. For example, the commission may equal a portion of the purchase price. In addition, some of these third-party sellers may operate Internet sites themselves through which the third-party sellers also directly offer the same items for sale.","An agreement between a retailer and a third-party seller who offers items for sale through the retailer's site may restrict the third-party seller from selling items at a more expensive price on the retailer's site than through the third-party seller's own sales channels, such as its websites, physical stores, mail order catalogs, etc. This requirement is known as price parity. However, for various reasons, a third-party seller may disregard price parity rules. For example, a third-party seller may offer items for sale at a more expensive price on the retailer's site in an attempt to drive traffic to the third-party seller's site (i.e., as a form of advertising) or to lessen the impact of the retailer's commissions on the third-party seller's margins. When a third-party seller disregards price parity rules, customers who would otherwise visit the retailer's site might check the price of an item on the third-party seller's site first before making a purchasing decision on the retailer's site. Consequently, the retailer may lose customers and sales while bearing the expense of advertising and merchandising the third-party seller's items.","Monitoring and enforcing price parity is a challenge for a retailer who provides hosting services for third-party sellers. For example, to monitor and enforce price parity, a retailer would need to know the landed price of an item (i.e., the product price and the shipping price) at a third-party seller's site and the landed price of that same item at the retailer's own site. Furthermore, the price data from both sites would need to be obtained at substantially the same time, because prices may fluctuate from day to day or during the course of a day.","Due to the volume of product listings (e.g., thousands or even millions) and the differences that exist between sites of third-party sellers, it is a significant challenge to automatically gather the price data using a computer program. For example, a retailer could attempt to code a computer program that gathers price data, but the retailer would need to expend significant time and resources to create such a program. Accordingly, writing a computer program that would accurately gather pricing information from many sites with differing formats is simply not practical. Moreover, even if a retailer was able to obtain accurate price data for items that are sold through third-party sellers' sales channels, the retailer would like to enforce price parity and encourage third-party sellers to adhere to price parity rules. Therefore, there is a need for improved systems and methods for monitoring and enforcing price parity.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts. While several illustrative embodiments are described herein, modifications, adaptations and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions or modifications may be made to the components illustrated in the drawings, and the illustrative methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, removing, or adding blocks to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description is not limiting of the disclosed embodiments. Instead, the proper scope is defined by the appended claims.","Disclosed systems and methods monitor and enforce price parity using tasks that involve human review and collection of price data. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, price parity tasks are provided for human review in order to collect price data for an item being sold by a third-party seller through a sales channel of a retailer and price data for the same item being sold by the third-party seller through a sales channel of the third-party seller. As the term is used herein, a \u201csales channel\u201d may refer to any number of ways that a provider of goods or services may offer such goods and services for purchase, rental, download, licensing, leasing, or other forms of consumption. For example, such sales channels could be an Internet site\/website, an online store, an electronic auction, an auction, a physical store, a mail order catalog, a telephone based ordering system, a software application providing access to one or more items, among many other possibilities. For example, one or more items being sold by a third-party seller through a sales channel of a retailer and through a sales channel of the third-party seller are identified for monitoring. Price data is gathered and compared in order to determine whether the third-party seller has violating a price parity rule. Furthermore, disclosed systems and methods provide mechanisms for enforcing price party through measures that seek to encourage sellers who violate price parity to remedy the violations.","Consistent with a disclosed embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided for monitoring price parity. The method includes selecting, by a server, an item from a catalog comprising a plurality of items. The server further selects a third party-seller who offers the item for sale through a sales channel of a retailer and who also offers the item for sale through a sales channel of the third party seller. The method receives an identifier of the sales channel of the third-party seller. The server further generates a price parity task. The price parity task includes instructions for obtaining a first price of the item and instructions for obtaining a second price of the item. The first price corresponds to an offering price of the item by the third-party seller via the sales channel of the retailer and the second price corresponds to an offering price of the item by the third party seller via the sales channel of the third party seller. The server receives, in response to the price parity task, price data. The price data comprises the first price and the second price. The first price was obtained from the sales channel of the retailer and the second price was obtained from the sales channel of the third-party seller. The server evaluates whether the second price violates a price parity rule, based on at least a comparison of the first price and the second price.","Consistent with another disclosed embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided for monitoring price parity. The method includes generating, by a server, a task related to pricing of an item. The server further receives, in response to the task, a first price and a second price of the item. The first price corresponds to an offering price of the item by a third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer and the second price corresponds to an offering price of the item by the third party seller via a sales channel of the third party seller. The server evaluates whether the second price violates a price parity rule, based on at least a comparison of the first price and the second price.","Consistent with yet another disclosed embodiment, a system is provided for monitoring price parity. The system may include a processor for executing program instructions and a memory storing the program instructions. The program instructions, when executed by the processor, perform a process. The process includes generating a task related to pricing of an item and receiving, in response to the task, a first price and a second price of the item. The first price corresponds to an offering price of the item by a third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer and the second price corresponds to an offering price of the item by a third party seller via a sales channel of the third party seller. The server evaluates whether the second price violates a price parity rule, based on at least a comparison of the first price and the second price.","Consistent with yet another disclosed embodiment, a method is provided for monitoring price parity. The method includes generating, by a server, a task related to pricing of an item. The server receives, in response to the task, a first price of the item. The first price corresponds to an offering price of the item by a third party seller via a sales channel of the third party seller. The method further includes obtaining, from a data store, a second price of the item. The second price corresponds to an offering price of the item by the third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer. The server evaluates whether the second price violates a price parity rule, based on at least a comparison of the first price and the second price.","Consistent with other disclosed embodiments, computer-readable storage media may store program instructions, which when executed by a processor, perform any of the methods described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","140","160","170","190","130","100","110","120","110","120"]},"Network  provides communications between the various components in system , such as monitoring server , retail server , third-party servers -, and terminals -. In addition, monitoring server , retail server , third-party servers -, and\/or terminals - may access legacy systems (not shown) via network , or may directly access legacy systems, data stores, or other network applications. Network  may be a shared, public, or private network, may encompass a wide area or local area, and may be implemented through any suitable combination of wired and\/or wireless communication networks. Network  may further comprise an intranet or the Internet.","Monitoring server  may comprise a general purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer, network computer, server, or mainframe computer) having one or more processors that may be selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program. Monitoring server  may also be implemented in a distributed network. For example, monitoring server  may communicate via network  with one or more additional monitoring servers (not shown), which may enable monitoring server  to distribute processes for parallel execution by a plurality of monitoring servers. Alternatively, monitoring server  may be specially constructed for carrying-out methods consistent with disclosed embodiments.","Monitoring server  may include a processor  and a memory . Memory  may comprise one or more memory or storage devices that store data as well as software. Memory  may also comprise, for example, one or more of RAM, ROM, magnetic storage, or optical storage. Memory  may store program modules that, when executed by processor , perform one or more processes for monitoring and\/or enforcing price parity. For example, authentication server  may provide access to an Internet site or other application, as well as provide functionality for authenticating users and for transmitting data, such as one or more price parity tasks.","Retail server  may comprise a general purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer, network computer, server, or mainframe computer) having one or more processors that may be selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program.

Memory  may store program modules that, when executed by processor , perform one or more processes for providing content for one or more Internet sites or an application providing content that is viewable by one of terminals -. For example, retail server  may serve a document providing the content (e.g., an e-commerce site).","Retail server  may further include a data store . In one embodiment, data store  may constitute a catalog data store and may store data describing items (e.g., products and\/or services) being offered for sale. For example, data store  may store documents or pages that are displayable by a computer executing software, such as an Internet browser. Furthermore, data store  may store product and\/or service descriptions, prices, and media used in connection with the sale of the products and\/or services. Media may include any images, photographs, sounds, and\/or video clips that provide samples and\/or information pertaining to the products and\/or services.","Data store  may store unique identifiers (IDs) that identify the products and\/or services being offered for sale through retail server . For example, the IDs may include product names and\/or product numbers, UPCs (Universal Product Codes), ISBNs (International Standard Book Numbers), or any other identifier. Additionally, data store  may store metadata in association with the IDs. For example, the metadata may provide information describing and\/or classifying a product. Data store , although shown as being part of retail server , may instead be provided as part of a separate server (not shown) that may be in direct communication with retail server  or that may communicate with retail server  over network .","Users may access retail server  over network  through an Internet browser or a software application running on terminals -. For example, retail server  may transmit a document (e.g., a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document, an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document, or a web page) that is accessible by an Internet browser executing on one of terminals -. Because the Internet site may use a secure communication environment, such as an HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) environment to transfer data over network , data transfer is assumed to be secure.","Third-party servers - may each comprise a general purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer, network computer, server, or mainframe computer) having one or more processors that may be selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program. Third-party servers - may each communicate via network  with one or more additional servers (not shown), which may enable third-party servers - to distribute processes for parallel execution by a plurality of retail servers. Alternatively, third-party servers - may be specially constructed for carrying-out methods consistent with disclosed embodiments.","Third-party servers - may each include a processor (not shown) and a memory (not shown). For example, each of third-party servers - may provide content for an application or one or more Internet sites and may serve documents providing the content (e.g., e-commerce sites). Third-party servers - may each further include a data store (not shown) storing data describing items (e.g., products and\/or services) that are being offered for sale. As discussed above in connection with retail server , third-party servers - may each store documents or pages that are displayable by a computer executing software, such as an Internet browser, as well as may store product and\/or service descriptions, prices, and media used in connection with the sale of the products and\/or services. For example, similar to the discussion above in connection with retail server , third-party servers - may each store identifiers (IDs) that identify products and\/or services being offered for sale (e.g., the IDs may include product names and\/or product numbers, UPCs, ISBNs, or any other identifier). Furthermore, third-party servers - may each store metadata in association with the IDs (e.g., metadata providing information describing and\/or classifying a product).","Terminals - may be any type device for communicating with monitoring server , retail server , and\/or third-party servers - over network . For example, terminals - may be personal computers, handheld devices (e.g.; PDAs, cellular phones, electronic book readers, etc.), set top boxes, or any other appropriate computing platform or device capable of exchanging data with network . Terminals - may each include a processor and a memory (not shown). Furthermore, terminals - may execute program modules that provide one or more graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for interacting with network resources, such as monitoring server , retail server , and\/or third-party servers -.","For example, a user at one of terminals - may access monitoring server  and receive data pertaining to a price parity task. The price parity task may include instructions for conducting a human review of price data. For example, one of terminals - may receive a task identifying an item and a third-party seller. The user may then research the offering price of the item through a sales channel provided by retail server  (e.g., a site hosted by retail server ) and the offering price of the item through the sales channels of one or more of third-party servers - (e.g., sites hosted by one or more of third-party servers -). In some embodiments, the sales channel of the third-party seller is not hosted on retail server , such as if the sales channel is a mail order catalog or telephone ordering system. In such cases, the user can research the offering price by obtaining the mail order catalog or calling the telephone ordering system. The task also may request that the user obtain the shipping price of the item or a total price of the item including a shipping cost, promotional discount, and\/or a tax as offered through the third-party sales channel.","Although embodiments have been described in which a task worker obtains price information from both the retailer and the third-party sales channels, in some embodiments, a user may only need to obtain a price of an item (e.g., a price of the item or a total price) from a third-prty seller's sales channel as part of a price parity task. For example, in some embodiments, monitoring server  may be able to obtain the item information (e.g., price, etc.) from the retailer's sales channel such that it is not necessary for the task worker to manually obtain this information.","In order to obtain accurate price data, monitoring server  may require that the price data for an item being offered by a third-party via a retailer's sales channel (e.g., offered by the third-party via a site hosted by retail server ) and the price data for that same item being offered by the third-party's own sales channel (e.g., offered by the third-party via a site hosted by third-party server ) be obtained at substantially the same time. For example, price parity tasks typically should be completed with a certain time period (e.g., a minute, ten minutes, twenty minutes, an hour, etc.). Furthermore, when monitoring server  receives price data for a completed task (e.g., a price of an item being offered for sale through a third-party seller's sales channel), the data may include a time stamp indicating when the completed task was submitted to monitoring server . Monitoring server  may then use the time stamp information to look up the price of that same item being offered for sale by the third-party seller via a sales channel provided by retail server  (e.g., the price data may be retrieved from data store ).","The user may submit the price data from one of terminals - to monitoring server . In exchange for the user's time and effort to complete the task, the user may receive compensation (e.g., a monetary payment, a discount, a free gift, etc.). By obtaining the price data through the use of human review, system  may accurately obtain the product price (both through the retailer and the third-party seller's sales channels) and also may obtain the total price (e.g., including a shipping cost, promotional discount, and\/or tax) through the retailer's sales channel. Furthermore, by distributing the tasks amongst a plurality of users, the tasks may be completed efficiently and in a cost effective manner. Additional details describing systems and methods for performing human review of data are provided, for example, in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/020,469, filed Jan. 25, 2008, entitled \u201cManaging Performance of Human Review of Media Data,\u201d the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["114","110","110","110"]},"In one embodiment, memory  may store instructions of program , which when executed, perform one or more data processes (e.g., services) for monitoring and enforcing price parity. To do so, program  may include instructions in the form of one or more program modules -. Program modules -may include an selecting module , a task module , an evaluating module , and a notification module ","Selecting module may identify items (e.g., products and\/or services) that are offered for sale by third-party sellers via a sales channel provided by retail server  (e.g., a site hosted by retail server ) and that are also offered for sale by third-party sellers via sales channels provided by one or more of third-party servers - (e.g., sites hosted by one or more of third-party servers -). Selecting module may retrieve, for example, unique IDs that identify the products and\/or services being offered for sale through retail server  (e.g., UPCs, ISBNs, or any other identifier).","Selecting module may identify items based on any number of criteria. For example, selecting module may identify items that have high visibility (e.g., items that are viewed by many visitors) or are bestsellers (e.g., items that are overall best sellers, best sellers in a product category, etc.). For example, if an item listing of a third-party seller is viewed or accessed frequently through a sales channel provided by retail server , but the item is not sold frequently via retail server , this may indicate that the price being offered by a third-party seller via the sales channel provided by retailer server  is higher than the price of that same item being offered via the third-party seller's own sales channel.","Furthermore, selecting module may identify third-party sellers and the sales channels of third-party sellers. To identify a third-party seller, selecting module may determine one or more third-party sellers offering an item for sale having an identifier corresponding to an item of interest. To identify a third-party seller's sales channel, monitoring server  may retrieve from data store  of retail server  reflecting an account of the third-party seller, which may include an address (e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL) of the third-party seller's website, among other possibilities) and\/or an email address for a contact person for the third-party seller. Alternatively, selecting module may receive identification information over network  from, for example, one of terminals - as part of a separate task performed by human review.","Task module may generate a price parity task. For example, the price parity task may provide tasks details (e.g., a requestor, an expiration date for the task, and a reward for completing the task). Furthermore, the price parity task may include a price description, which may describe steps that need to be taken in order to complete the task (e.g., obtaining a price of an item being offered by a third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer and obtaining the price of the same item being offered by the third-party seller via the third-party seller's sales channel). The price parity task may require a person who performs the task to obtain a total price of a product, including a shipping cost, a promotional discount, and\/or a tax. Task module may further transmit the task to one or more of terminals - for human review. Additional details regarding price parity tasks are discussed below in connection with .","Evaluating module may receive price data from one of terminals - responsive to a task and then evaluate the price data. The price data may include a first price of an item, which corresponds to an offering price of the item by a third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer, and a second price of the item, which corresponds to an offering price of the item by the third-party seller via a sales channel of the third-party seller. Evaluating module may then evaluate whether a seller respects price parity for the item. For example, the evaluation may comprise comparing the first price and second price to determine whether the second price is greater than the first price.","As part of the evaluation, monitoring server  also may receive price data responsive to the same task from more than one person. For example, in some embodiments, monitoring server  may distribute the same task to two or more persons in order to verify whether the results are accurate. For example, evaluating module may compare results received from two or more persons for the same task and determine whether or not the results are accurate (e.g., if two of three persons have submitted the same price data, evaluating module may assume that the price data is accurate).","Evaluating module may further apply thresholds to determine whether or not a third-party seller has violated a price parity rule. For example, evaluating module may determine that a violation has occurred when a difference in price of an item through a third-party seller's sales channel differs more than a threshold amount or a predefined percentage (e.g., one percent, two percent, five percent, etc.) of the price of the same item being offered by the third-party seller via a sales channel provided by retailer server . In some embodiments, evaluating module may compare prices of an item without taking into account shipping costs. In other embodiments, evaluating module may compare the shipped prices of an item. In still yet other embodiments, evaluating module may take into account other factors, such as promotional discounts and\/or taxes.","Notification module may generate and transmit various notifications regarding results of evaluations executed by evaluation module . For example, if a third-party seller is determined by evaluation module to be in violation of price parity rules (e.g., the third-party seller offers an item at a higher price via a sales channel that is provided by retail server  than via its own sales channel), then notification module may generate and transmit a notification to a contact person associated with the third-party seller. The notification may provide notice to the third-party seller of the violation. The notification may be transmitted, for example, via email to an email address of the contact person obtained from, for example, data store . Notification module may further transmit a message to task module to schedule the same price parity task to be performed at a later date and\/or time (e.g., a hour later, a day later, a week later, etc.) in order to determine whether the violation has been remedied. If the violation has not been remedied when the results of the follow-up price parity task are evaluated, then notification module may generate and transmit another notification.","Notifications may escalate in levels of urgency. For example, a third-party seller having a first violation may receive a yellow notification (e.g., an initial warning), while a third-party seller having a second violation may receive a red notification (e.g., an urgent warning). If after a second violation, for example, a third evaluation may be performed, and the process may be escalated (e.g., notification module may transmit a notification to a representative of retailer  instructing the representative to contact the third-party seller by telephone). Various actions may be taken if the price is not corrected (e.g., retailer  may deny the third-party seller from completing a sale of the item, remove the third-party seller's item listing entirely, suspend the third-party seller's account, or terminate the third-party seller's account).","On the other hand, if evaluation module determines that a third-party seller has not violated price parity rules, notification module may generate and transmit to a contact person (e.g., via an email address) a notification (e.g., a positive notification) informing the third-party retailer of the positive result and\/or thanking the third-party seller for complying with price parity rules. Furthermore, in some embodiments, notification module may receive feedback from a third-party seller in response to the notifications (e.g., a third-party seller may complete a contact form and select a reason for the price discrepancy).","Notification module may further generate and transmit notifications based on aggregate results of price parity tasks. For example, notification module may determine that a notification need not be sent to a third-party seller that offers a high number of items (e.g., a hundred item listings) and who is found to only have a small number of price parity violations (e.g., one violation, fewer than five violations, etc.). On the other hand, a third-party seller having a large number of violations (e.g., fifty percent of the third-party seller's items that are being offered via the third-party seller's sales channel are being offered at prices that violate price parity) may receive a notification. Notification module may further generate reports summarizing results of price parity tasks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","170","190","300","110","120","120","140","300"]},"Price parity task  may include information pertaining to, for example, a requestor of the task, a expiration date of the task, and a reward for completing the task. Furthermore, price parity task  may provide instructions as part of a task description. For example, price parity task  instructs a user who completes the task that the user should obtain the prices for the same product from two sales channels (e.g., two sites). The task further instructs the person to obtain the prices for the product, which Third Party Seller Company offers on their own sales channel (e.g., a site hosted by third-party server ) and also the price of the same product, which Third Party Seller Company offers via a retailer's sales channel (e.g., a site hosted by retail server ).","A user who collects the identified price data and completes the task may enter a price of an item (e.g., a camera) that is being offered by Third Party Seller Company via retail server  using field  of a form. The user may further enter the price of the same product that is being offered by Third Party Seller Company via a sales channel provided by third-party server  via field . Furthermore, the user may enter or copy the URL of a product detail page (e.g., an item listing page) from third-party server  in field . In some embodiments, a subsequent task may incorporate the URL submitted by a user (e.g., the URL entered into field ). Finally, the user may enter the total price of the product, including shipping, that is found via a sales channel provided by third-party seller  in field .","In other embodiments, a task may include more than one item (e.g., a task may include five products per task). Furthermore, the format of the price parity task and the information that is requested by a price parity task may vary. For example, a price parity task may also instruct the user to submit information regarding shipping, promotional discounts, and\/or taxes. In other embodiments, a user may enter only the price of the item offered by a third-party seller's sales channel and monitoring server  may look up the price of that same item being offered for sale by the third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","110"]},"Prior to the start of routine , a user may be authenticated by, for example, monitoring server . For example, prior to the start of routine , monitoring server  may transmit a document (e.g., a web page) that is accessible by an Internet browser executing on, for example, terminal . The document may include options for a user to log onto a secure site or portal provided by monitoring server . The user may log on by supplying credentials, such as a username and a password. Once authenticated, routine  may begin.","In block , monitoring server  may select an item (e.g., a product or service) for a price parity task. For example, monitoring server  may select an item that is offered for sale by a third-party seller via a sales channel provided by retail server  (e.g., a site hosted by retail server , a physical store, etc.) and that is also offered for sale by the third-party seller via a sales channel provided by the third-party (e.g., a site hosted by third party server , a physical store, etc.). Items may be selected based on various criteria, as discussed above (e.g., high visibility items that are viewed by many visitors to the sales channel, items that are bestsellers overall or in a category, etc.). As part of block , monitoring server  may retrieve from data store  data reflecting an ID of the item (e.g., UPCs, ISBNs, or any other identifier).","In block , monitoring server  may select a third-party seller who offers the selected item for sale. For example, as part of block , monitoring server  may retrieve data from data store  of retail server  reflecting an identifier (e.g., a name, an address, a number, etc.) of the third-party seller. Furthermore, as part of block , monitoring server  may select multiple third-party sellers who sell the selected item.","In block ; monitoring server  may determine the third-party seller's sales channel. For example, monitoring server  may retrieve data from data store  of retail server  storing account information for the third-party seller, which may include an address (e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL) of the third-party seller's website). Monitoring server  may further retrieve an email address for a contact person associated with the third-party seller's sales channel. Alternatively, in block , monitoring server  may receive identification information (e.g., an identifier such as a URL) over network  from one of terminals -. For example, obtaining the identification information may have been part of a separate task that was performed by human review via one or more of terminals -.","In block , monitoring server  may generate a price parity task. For example, the price parity task may provide tasks details (e.g., a requestor, an expiration date for the task, and a reward for completing the task). The price parity task may include a task description, which may describe steps of the task (e.g., obtaining a price of an item being offered by a third-party retailer via a sales channel of retailer  and obtaining the price of the same item being offered by the third-party retailer via a sales channel of the third-party retailer). A task also may require a person who undertakes the task to have certain qualifications (e.g., language skills, a minimum level of experience, expertise in a particular field, etc.). These qualifications may be enforced through qualification mechanisms, such as a test that a person who wishes to perform a task must first pass. Furthermore, the price parity task may require a person who performs the task to obtain a total price of a product, including shipping and\/or tax. In other embodiments, monitoring server  may look up the price of the item via a sales channel provided by a retailer and, consequently, the price parity task may only require obtaining the offering price of the item through the sales channel of the third-party seller. As part of block , monitoring server  may further transmit the task to one or more of terminals - for human review.","In block , monitoring server  may receive price data from one or more of terminals - responsive to a task. For example, the price data may include a first price of an item, which corresponds to an offering price of the item by a third-party seller via a sales channel of a retailer (e.g., via a site, electronic catalog, among other possibilities), and a second price of the item, which corresponds to an offering price of the item by the third-party seller via a sales channel of the third-party seller (e.g., via a site, electronic catalog, among other possibilities).","In block , monitoring server  may evaluate whether a seller is compliant with price parity for the item. For example, the evaluation may comprise comparing the first price and second price to determine whether the second price is greater than the first price. If monitoring server  determines that a violation has occurred in block , then routine  may proceed to block . If monitoring server  determines that a violation has not occurred in block , then routine  may proceed to block .","As part of block , monitoring server  may apply thresholds to determine whether or not a third-party seller has violated price parity rules. As discussed above, monitoring server  may determine that a violation occurs when a difference in price of an item via a third-party seller's sales channel differs more than a threshold amount or a predefined percentage (e.g., one percent, two percent, five percent, etc.) of an amount of the price of the same item being offered by the third-party seller via retailer server . In some embodiments, the evaluation may compare prices of an item without taking into account shipping costs. In other embodiments, the evaluation may take into consideration the shipped price of an item. In still yet other embodiments, evaluating module may take into account other factors, such as promotional discounts and\/or taxes.","In order to make an evaluation in block , monitoring server  also may receive price data responsive to the same task from one or more persons. For example, monitoring server  may compare results received from two or more persons for the same task and determine whether or not the results are accurate (e.g., if two of three persons have submitted the same price data, monitoring server  may consider the price data to be accurate).","In block , monitoring server  may generate and transmit a notification. For example, if the third-party seller is in violation of price parity rules (e.g., the third-party seller offers an item at a higher price via a sales channel of retail server  than via its own sales channel or exceeds a threshold), then monitoring server  may generate and transmit a notification to a contact person associated with the third-party seller providing notice to the third-part seller of the violation. The notification may be transmitted, for example, via email to an email address of the contact person obtained from, for example, data store . Routine  may then return to block .","In block , monitoring server  may generate and transmit a positive notification to inform the third-party retailer that the third-party seller is compliant with price parity rules. This notification may encourage the third-party seller to continue to comply and may also serve to inform the third-party seller that price parity is being monitoring and enforced.","As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, one or more of blocks - may be optional and may be omitted from implementations in certain embodiments.
