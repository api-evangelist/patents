Although the drawings represent some possible approaches, the drawings are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be exaggerated, removed, or partially sectioned to better illustrate and explain the present invention. Further, the descriptions set forth herein are not intended to be exhaustive or otherwise limit or restrict the claims to the precise forms and configurations shown in the drawings and disclosed in the following detailed description.","The drawings and the following detailed description relate generally relates to substance communicating devices and coupling systems for connecting substance communicating devices. The following definitions apply to terms that may be used in the specification and the claims, unless otherwise noted.","As used herein, a \u201csubstance\u201d is a material that may be communicated from one device to another. A substance may include a gas, a liquid, or a solid, or any combination thereof. Examples of substances include, but are not limited to, liquid soap, powdered soap, compressed air, tablets, caplets, water, ice cubes, and a beverage.","As used herein, \u201csubstance communication\u201d or a \u201csubstance communication service\u201d is a useful provision of a substance from one device to another device. Communicating a substance includes supplying or receiving a substance. As used herein, communication of substance includes both uni-directional and multi-directional communication between any two devices, either directly or through an adapter, as defined herein. Substance communication may be provided in quanta, such as capsules or other doses of substances, batches of discrete items such as tablets, or consumable components.","The term \u201cconsumable\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, includes any substance that may be consumed by a host, an accessory device, or a user person, such as food, cosmetics, or medicine. The consumable may, for example, be a substance that is used up and must be replenished for subsequent cycles of operation. For a clothes washer, a consumable might be a detergent and\/or a softener. For a clothes dryer, a consumable might be an anti-static cloth. For a cooking or refrigeration appliance, the consumable may actually be the article on which the appliance performs its cycle of operation, as in the case of food, later to be consumed by a person. More specific examples of the use of a consumable in appliances include dispensing additives for clothes washers, clothes dryers, or combination washer\/dryer appliances. The additives may include, but are not limited to, normal detergents, gentle detergents, dark clothing detergents, cold water detergents, fabric softeners, chlorine bleaches, color-safe bleaches, and fabric enhancement chemistry. Non-limiting examples of fabric enhancers are additives to provide stain resistance, wrinkle resistance, water repellency, insect repellency, color fastness, fragrances, and anti-microbials. Another example of a consumable contemplated is the filters used by an appliance. Refrigerators, dryers, washers, and dishwashers are all known to use filters that are consumed in the sense that they wear out and must be replaced.","The term \u201csubstance consumer\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, is any useful device that employs, uses, stores, or dispenses a substance in connection with performing a physical or virtual function. A substance consumer may be, for example, a smart utensil, an appliance, a resource controller, such as a water controller, a dispenser, a filter, a water filter, an air filter, a detergent dispenser, a drink dispenser, a detergent cartridge, or a substance holder, such as a bottle or jug.","The term \u201csubstance provider\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, is any device that is capable of providing or supplying a substance to another device.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstance holder\u201d is anything that holds or contains a substance, which may include, but is not limited to, a container, a dispenser, a cartridge, a dish, a bag, a carton, or a conduit.","As used herein, the term \u201cconsumable holder\u201d is any substance holder that holds or contains a consumable.","An attribute of a substance is any information about a substance, including measurable and non-measurable information about the substance that can be stored for later retrieval, including, but not limited to, the physical or chemical properties of the substance, the impact of the substance upon its environment, and the amount of substance.","Non-measurable attributes are attributes about the substance that may be stored with the substance or with the substance holder of the substance, whether the attributes would or would not have been measurable by an appropriate sensor. Examples of non-measurable attributes include quantity of consumable pieces, quantity by volume or by weight, date of manufacture, manufacturer, data about its transit from manufacturer, distributor, market, consumer, data about the temperature during transit, nutritional information like calories, fat grams, daily allowance of essential vitamins and minerals, a list of medical conditions under which the substance should not be consumed, data about the relationship between the substance and known diets and\/or known medical conditions, and known reactions to the substance, and the like.","Attributes may be determined by a single measurement or may be derived from multiple measurements, such as measurements of multiple types, measurements taken at multiple locations or measurements taken at multiple times, and may reflect static conditions, such as temperature or quantity, or dynamic conditions such as change, rate of change, or change in rate of change.","Amount attributes are attributes directly reflecting the amount of the substance available for future use, including weight, volume, mass, height, and count. An attribute indicative of the amount is an attribute that may be used or processed to infer or calculate the amount of substance, such as the vapor pressure in a substance holder, the light transmissivity or electrical inductance, capacitance, resistance, reactance, or impedance of the substance. An attribute of the environment is any characteristic of the environment inside of the substance holder, the environment outside of the substance holder, or of the substance holder itself.","As used herein with respect to the attributes of a substance, information or data includes any stored information, such as genealogical and life cycle information relating to the substance, the substance holder, the manufacturer, the environment, and the user(s). Information may be measurable or non-measurable, event based, historical, and\/or identifier information.","Since there can be a plurality of substance holders, each with a substance, there may need to be a unique identifier identifying each substance holder or each substance that may be paired with an attribute measurement of a substance so that the value of the measurement can be uniquely identified per its meaning at a later time and by subsequent intelligent processes. The identifier may be associated with the substance, the substance holder, the sensor, or the transmitter and such association may occur at the time of creation or assembly of the components, the time of first adding substance to the substance holder, or the time of introducing the substance holder to a system using a plurality of substance holders. The identifier may also be dynamically generated, for example, from one or more measurable and non-measurable attributes.","Similarly, since there may be a plurality of attributes applicable to a substance, attributes may need to be uniquely identifiable. Attributes may each have a value that is either stored or transmitted, and each respective value may be paired with its attribute identifier so that the value can be uniquely identified per its meaning at a later time and by a subsequent intelligent process. In the simplest case where there is only an amount attribute, the system may assume that all values are amount values with an inherent attribute identifier with the meaning of amount.","As used herein, the terms \u201csubstance communication coupling system\u201d or \u201csubstance service connector system\u201d refer to any connector system having at least two separate substance communication coupling system components, each of which is associated with a useful device.

However, the device may alternatively or additionally provide another substance that originates with the device, such as an additive stored in a reservoir.","The term \u201creceive\u201d and any variation thereof, is used herein to denote receipt of the substance or an electromagnetic service relative to the device providing the substance or electromagnetic service. The term is not limited to the ultimate consumer of the substance or electromagnetic service. The term \u201creceive\u201d is applicable as well to a device that may simply be passing on the substance or electromagnetic service from the source, such as an appliance, to a device that will consume, as hereinafter defined, the substance or electromagnetic service. The device which receives a substance or electromagnetic service is not necessarily the end consumer of the substance or electromagnetic service.","The term \u201cconsume\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, denotes the act of employing or dispensing at least a portion of the substance or electromagnetic service received in connection with performing a function.","The term \u201ccoupled\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, includes any type of connection that permits transfer of a substance or an electromagnetic service between two devices. The term \u201ccoupled\u201d does not require a physical connection between the two devices, so long as the coupling permits transfer of a substance or an electromagnetic service. The term \u201ccoupled\u201d includes both fixed and removable coupling, as well as both continuous and intermittent coupling.","The term \u201cuseful device\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, is a device that is capable of performing a useful physical or virtual function either alone or in combination with another device.","As used herein, the term \u201chost\u201d is an apparatus that has a primary function independent of providing or receiving a substance. A host may be a substance provider, a substance consumer, or both. For example, the host may be an appliance and the primary function may be performing a series of steps to conduct a useful cycle of operation. The appliance may be a conventional household appliance, such as a refrigerator performing a cooling cycle or an ice making cycle. Other examples of appliances that may be hosts include, but are not limited to, a freezer, a conventional oven, a microwave oven, a dishwashing machine, a stove, a range, an air conditioner, a dehumidifier, a clothes washing machine, a clothes dryer, a clothes refreshing machine, and a non-aqueous washing apparatus, or any combination thereof. Alternatively, the host may be a fixture such as a water softener, a water heater, a furnace, pool water treatment equipment, or an HVAC system. The host may be a small device such as a thermostat, a blender, a mixer, a toaster, a coffee maker, a trash compactor, an air purifier, an iron, a vacuum cleaner, or a robot. The host may alternatively comprise a structural feature of a building, such as a wall, a cabinet, or a door. The host may also provide other services, such as electrical power, electronic data, mechanical power, illumination, heat, or sound.","As used herein, the terms \u201caccessory\u201d or an \u201caccessory device\u201d refer to any useful device which may be coupled to a host and communicate a substance to or from the host. An accessory device may be used primarily in conjunction with a host to enhance, supplement the functionality of the host or may have independent functionality and utility. An accessory device may be a substance provider, a substance consumer, or both. Examples of an accessory device include, but are not limited to, a paper product dispenser, a dry goods dispenser, a bottle opener, a liquid dispenser, and a pill dispenser. An accessory or accessory device may also communicate electromagnetic service with the host.","A \u201cproximity target\u201d is any component or device which may be detected when positioned within a predetermined distance of an associated proximity sensor, defined below. A proximity target may be passive, such as visual target or a magnetic target formed of magnetic or magnetic responsive material. Other examples of passive proximity targets may include a conductive component or surface capable of cooperating with a magnetic field, a current, or a voltage provided by a proximity sensor. A proximity target may alternatively be active or powered such as an electromagnet a generator of a magnetic field, a current, a voltage or an acoustic wave. An active proximity target may alternatively provide a powered readable display or dispense a detectable chemical.","A \u201cproximity sensor\u201d is any component or device which may detect an associated proximity target when the proximity target is within a predetermined distance of the proximity sensor. A proximity sensor may detect, for example, a change in an electromagnetic field, an electromagnetic wave, an acoustic wave, a visual target a chemical component, an electrical signal, a change in voltage, a change in current, a change in frequency, a change in resistance, a change in inductance, a change in capacitance, a mechanical signal, a change in pressure, a displacement, a vibration, and the presence of a chemical.

For example, magnetic flux can be used as the signaling mechanism between a contactless proximity sensor and a contactless proximity target.","As used herein, the term \u201cproximity system\u201d is a system that uses a \u201cproximity switch\u201d operated by a plurality of \u201cproximity coupling components,\u201d each associated with a different parent device, for determining that the parent devices are in proximity with each other. Parent devices are usually paired, examples of which include a service provide and a service consumer, a host and an accessory device, and a host and an adapter. Proximity coupling components may include a proximity target associated with one parent device to actively or passively provide an indication of the presence of the one parent device and a proximity sensor associated with the other parent device that is responsive to the presence of the proximity target to activate the proximity switch. The proximity switch may be used to provide a signal or message indicative of the proximity of two parent devices or may directly or indirectly regulate the flow of a service along a service line. The proximity systems disclosed herein employ contactless proximity systems wherein the proximity target and proximity switch use contactless or wireless means to detect the proximity of the two parent devices. In the context of a proximity switch, a proximity target may be considered a \u201cproximity actuator\u201d in the sense that it causes actuation of the proximity switch.","A \u201cplug\u201d as used herein is a generally male electromagnetic service connection component.","A \u201creceptacle\u201d as used herein is a generally female electromagnetic service connection component.","An \u201cadapter\u201d as used herein is an intermediate device that may be provided between a first and second useful device, such as between a host and an accessory, to facilitate the communication of services between the first and second useful devices. An adapter may receive a service from the first useful device and provide a modified version of the service to the second useful device, for example, by providing an electrical power service using a different voltage or providing a data service using a different data structure or signal type. In some applications, multiple adapters may be interposed between two accessory devices. In other applications, three or more devices may be coupled to a single adapter, such as between a host and two accessories. In some applications, the adapter may itself be an accessory device providing a useful function not provided by the accessory devices coupled to it. An adapter may optionally include a transformative component that transforms a service from a service provider to a different service, which is supplied to a service consumer. This may be useful when the service from the service provider is not compatible with the service consumer. The transformative component can be configured to transform the service into a compatible form for the service consumer. Examples of transformative components are protocol converters, power transformers, or other devices that convert substance, energy, or data from a first form to a second form.","A \u201csoftware component\u201d as used herein means any software, algorithm, or logic directly or indirectly associated with the operational cycle of an appliance. Generally, all logic provides indirect access to the control of a device, but the meaning can extend to include any non-device oriented software like fragmentation algorithms, algorithms, transfer function evaluations, network traffic handling, user instructions, network authentication services, and the like.","Referring to , a substance handling system  is illustrated in schematic form and has a first substance communicating device , such as an appliance, with a smart process control apparatus , and a second substance communicating device , such as a consumable holder. Second substance communicating device  may be disposed inside or outside or on the first substance communicating device . It may be installed during manufacture and sold with first substance communicating device , or it may be made and sold separately as an upgrade or addition. Second substance communicating device  may optionally have its own process control apparatus , which may be in communication with smart process control apparatus  of first substance communicating device  or may operate independently. Process control apparatus  and  may provide at least a portion of the system software architecture and electronics  for substance handling system . Process control apparatus  and  may include sensors, actuators, wiring, and other components normally found in an electro-mechanical or mechanical control system. Either process control apparatus  or  may be able to control itself in limited ways through mechanical techniques. More typically and as illustrated herein, electronics , shown in , are connected to the process control apparatus  providing additional functionality. Process control apparatus  and electronics  may be considered in combination as a smart process control apparatus. Smart process control apparatus  may also include electronics which interact with the process control apparatus  in order to make control decisions based on inputs from sensors or networks and execute those decisions either by network message or the control of actuators within the process control apparatus, but the electronics are not illustrated herein.","First substance communicating device  may communicate, through one or more interfaces , a substance with second substance communicating device  and may as well communicate one or more additional services, such as a data service or a power service. An interface or such as service connector system , may include one or more service couplers, such as A and B for enabling the communication of a one or more services, such as, for example, multiple substance services or a substance service and an electromagnetic service. For example, first substance communicating device  may be an automatic clothes washer acting as a host for the second substance communicating device , and second substance communicating device  may be an additive dispensing accessory capable of dispensing one or more fabric treatment chemicals, such as detergent, bleach or softener, for use by the automatic clothes washer in the processing of a fabric load. As another example, first substance communicating device  may be a refrigeration appliance having a water supply and acting as a host for the second substance communicating device , and second substance communicating device  may be a flavoring dispensing accessory capable of dispensing one or more food flavoring chemicals, such as fruit flavored drink powder, for use by the refrigeration in providing consumers with a flavored drink. As still another example, first substance communicating device  may be a refrigeration appliance having a water supply and acting as a host for the second substance communicating device , and second substance communicating device  may be a drink dispensing accessory holding one or more food flavoring chemicals, such as fruit flavored drink powder, and capable of receiving cooled water from the refrigeration appliance, mixing it with a food flavoring chemical, and dispensing a drink to a consumer. These and other examples are discussed below in more detail.","In general, first substance communicating device  may be configured to perform an operation on a physical article , such as clothing or food, using a resource such as water, temperature-controlled air (hot or cold), steam, gas, or electricity, provided to first substance communicating device  by interfaces, not shown, with a utility, not shown, supplying the resource. Examples of appliances that perform an operation on a physical article include a wide range of device types, including but not limited to, washers, dryers, ovens, ranges, steam cookers, ice makers, refrigerators, drink makers and the like. Articles  are the objects upon which a user intends the appliance to perform its cycle of operation. Typical examples as mentioned above would include food and clothing.","Smart process control apparatus  is configured to implement and control a cycle comprising at least one operation. Smart process control apparatus  may comprise one or more components, not shown, such as electronic control boards, wiring and wiring harnesses, power-supplies, sensors integrated with the electronics as digital or analog inputs, and actuators like valves, relays, heaters, and the like, any or all of which may integrate with the electronics as digital or analog outputs.","Exemplary second substance communicating device  is configured to hold, carry, supply, communicate with, or otherwise interact directly with a consumable . When performing a cycle of operation on an article , first substance communicating device  will often use at least one consumable . A consumable  in one sense comprises a substance, device, or other product that would be at least partially consumed or transformed by first substance communicating device  during a cycle of operation on an article , such that consumable  may be periodically replaced or replenished. The period after which consumable  may be replaced or replenished may be, but is not limited to, a single cycle of operation, multiple cycles of operation, an amount of time, or a number of uses. For example, many common washing machines require that a user place a single dose of detergent in a dispenser prior to initiating a cycle of operation. For each subsequent cycle of operation, the user must again place a single dose in the dispenser, as a single dose of detergent is consumed by the washing machine during each cycle of operation.","In some cases, the consumable  may be the article , on which the first substance communicating device  performs the cycle of operation, and the consumable may be subsequently consumed by a user. A consumable  may, for example, be anything that would be consumed or otherwise used by a person, such as food, beverages, cosmetics, or medicine. For example, in a cooking or refrigeration appliance, the consumable may be a food item communicated from a dispenser to an appliance, and the cycle of operation performed by the appliance may be heating or cooling the food.","Consumables are to be distinguished from resources, although resources may in some circumstances be \u201cconsumed\u201d during a cycle of operation. Resources are commodities that are continuously available to an appliance, and used by the appliance in its cycles of operation on articles  that are supplied by external utilities, such as a residential water, power, data or natural gas distribution system, or are available from the ambient environment, such as air. In some cases, a material resource, such as air and water, may also be considered an article  as in a refrigerator that chills and dispenses water. That is, water in that instance is a resource (continuously available to the refrigerator from a residential utility), but also an article  (intended by the user for the refrigerator to act upon). The cycles of operation performed by the refrigerator would include the chilling and dispensing. Things that hold or supply resources, such as water supply lines or air conduits are not considered consumable holders . They would be \u201cresource holders\u201d, which may be supplied by resource providers. In a refrigerator, for example, water supplied to the first substance communicating device  would be considered a resource and\/or an article . If flavoring is mixed with the water supplied to first substance communicating device , the flavoring may be considered a consumable , and whatever holds\/supplies the flavoring is then considered to be second substance communicating device .","Consumables are also to be distinguished from parts in an appliance, although parts wear out and need to be replaced or replenished as do consumables. Parts are devices, without which a cycle of operation by the appliance or a principal function of the appliance would be hampered. Examples include valves, actuators, switches, tubes, lamps, wiring, motors, pumps, seals, gears and the like. Consumables, on the other hand, are typically not critical to the operation of the appliance, although they provide a benefit to a user of the appliance. An appliance may typically still operate on an article  in some fashion without a consumable, though not necessarily as effectively or efficiently.","Second substance communicating device  comprises a device that holds or contains consumable . Typically, consumable  is contained by a consumable holder. In some cases, second substance communicating device  may be nested within one or more other consumable holders. For example, a cartridge holding a consumable may be disposed in a dispenser.","In some cases articles  on which the appliance operates may not be contained by a consumable holder, and may not be consumables in the sense herein defined. Rather, articles  may be enabled to perform at least some of the functionalities of a consumable and\/or a substance communicating device. An example of an article  with substance communicating device capabilities is a shirt having a bar code thereon containing information that is directly readable by first substance communicating device . The bar code may be, for example, on a performance tag. First substance communicating device  may use data and\/or information represented by the bar code for use in creating, configuring and selecting the cycle of operation of the appliance. The bar code may be read by first substance communicating device  while the shirt is being operated contemporaneously with the cycle of operation.","A performance tag is an information holder either integrally formed or selectively attached to an article  and adapted to maintain its integrity over the life of the article . For example, a performance tag for clothing would be adapted to maintain its integrity throughout the repeated processes of washing in a washing machine appliance, drying in a dryer, being cleaned at a dry cleaners, being ironed, being left in the sun, and being subjected to the impacts sustained during usage. Examples of impacts sustained during usage for a shirt are those that might occur during a soccer match where the shirt impacts the earth and other players at considerable speeds and forces repeatedly. Likewise, performance tags for dishes would be subjected to similar impacts, and similar wash and dry cycles from a dishwasher. Performance tags integrally formed with fabric items might be sewn in, glued in, woven in, stamped on, or printed on during the manufacturing of the article  or by a home machine adapted to integrate the article  and the tag. Performance tags integrally formed with dishware might be glued, stamped, printed, embossed, cast, molded, or otherwise formed during the manufacturing of the article  or by a home machine adapted to integrate the article  and the tag. Performance tags that are selectively attached to an article  could be attached by sewing, gluing, pining, sticking, printing, embossing, or other like methods in the home environment for articles  not specifically adapted for receiving a performance tag. Performance tags are constructed of any suitable material which may be used to hold encoded information about a cycle structure, or information about a consumable, the description of which is contained herein. Examples of materials for holding the information include magnetic strips, bar codes, and images of encoded data including color patterns, shape patterns, plain texts, numeric identifiers, and the like. An appliance having a cycle architecture and being in communication with a performance tag (as for example by using a consumable reader) may optimize the cycle of operation in the appliance for the article  in response to the cycle structure, data about a cycle structure, and\/or data about a consumable held by the performance tag. Performance tags may either hold information or hold other information about how to find the information. An example of a performance tag that holds other information is a performance tag holding a URL wherein the data returned when invoking the URL is the information. Further, the appliance may alter or optimize the user experience further by providing information on a user interface in response to the cycle structure, data about a cycle structure, and\/or data about a consumable.","Other examples further illustrate the foregoing distinctions. Consider using an oven to cook a turkey in a roasting pan where there is a steam dispenser with a basting cartridge for automatic basting. The turkey is the article  upon which the appliance (the oven) performs its cycle of operation (cooking). But the turkey is also a consumable in the sense that it is a food item to be consumed by the user. The basting cartridge would be a consumable holder and its contents a consumable. The water used to generate the steam is a resource, making the steam a changed resource. The roasting pan would be a second consumable holder, holding the turkey. The appliance or the roasting pan or some other device (such as a performance tag described below) may also hold information about the turkey or how to cook a turkey or how to cook a turkey in different kinds of ovens. Such information would be considered information about a consumable and information about a cycle structure.","Consider also a powdered detergent box with a performance tag configured to communicate with an appliance contemporaneously with the dispensing of the detergent to a washer. The washer is the appliance, the detergent is a consumable, and the box is a consumable holder. The performance tag may hold information about the chemistry of the powder, information about cycle structures, and data about cycle structures wherein the information and data are associated with other information comprising appliance types, fabric types, stain types, and the like so that the data and information may be used alone or combined with the other information to create a cycle of operation in response to the data and the information and in response to the user and the user preferences about the cycle of operation, the data, the information, and the other information.","Consider also a detergent pellet with an etched or embossed or imprinted cycle structure enabled to communicate with an appliance contemporaneously with being introduced into a washing machine before or during a wash cycle. Here, the washing machine is an appliance and the detergent pellet is a consumable. There is no separate consumable holder. The cycle structure is intended to effect the cycle of operation (washing). Consider also a detergent pellet having a data pod. The detergent pellet is a consumable, but the data pod is a form of performance tag that could communicate with an appliance contemporaneously with being introduced into the use environment for the purpose of effecting the cycle of operation.","A consumable or a consumable holder or a performance tag or data pod or anything that may hold and convey information (consumable information holder) might comprise one or more cycle structures. A first cycle structure may be associated with a first appliance or first appliance type and a second cycle structure may be associated with a second appliance or a second appliance type such that the appropriate cycle structures are introduced to the appropriate appliance or appliance type when the consumable or consumable holder is in useful communication with the appliances. For example, a frozen food (a consumable) or a package of frozen food (a consumable holder) might have cycle instructions for freezing, defrosting, or preserving cycles in a refrigerator or freezer appliance, and also might have cycle instructions for defrosting, cooking, or warming cycles for a cooking appliance like an oven or microwave.","A consumable information holder may comprise one or more user interface data sets, with or without cycle structures, which may be communicated to a user interface, such as might be on the appliance. User interface data is considered to include anything that may be rendered to be responsive to a user's senses, such as visual displays, audible sounds, and tactile displays. A first user interface data set may be associated with a first appliance or first appliance type and a second user interface data set may be associated with a second appliance or a second appliance type such that the appropriate user interface data are conveyed to a user interface associated with the appropriate appliance or appliance type when the consumable or consumable holder is in useful communication with the appliances. For example, a frozen food (a consumable) or a package of frozen food (a consumable holder) might convey to a refrigerator an expiration date to be rendered on a user interface on the refrigerator. The frozen food or its package might also convey to an oven serving suggestions to be rendered on a user interface on the oven.","Consumables, consumable holders, performance tags, data pods and the like (consumable information holders) may be enabled not only to provide data, but also may be configured to receive and store information associated with the consumable. Exemplary information includes data about a consumable, a cycle structure, data about a cycle structure, tracking the number of times a shirt or a dish is washed, the number of cycles and the parameters thereof which have been executed by or in combination with an appliance and consumable holder. It may also include the types of consumables introduced into the use environment, information entered into an appliance user interface including cycle selections, usage patterns, user information, user identification, other data associated with the cycle of operation of an appliance, and any data held by a data source in communication with the holder, tag, or pod which either the data source writes to the holder, tag, or pod, or any data or the holder, tag, and pod reads from the data source. Such information may be sequentially added to a database on the consumable information holder for later retrieval. For example, a shirt with a performance tag may keep data about how many times it has been washed, about different wash cycles it has been through, and the specific machines it has been washed in.","More specific examples of consumables  for use with or by substance communicating device  include dispensing additives for laundry washers, dryers, or combination washer\/dryer appliances. Other additive examples are provided in the definition of consumables above.","An additive dispenser in this case would be second substance communicating device  and may be a single load dispenser that dispenses all of additive contained therein during a single cycle or a bulk dispenser that dispenses only some of the additive contained therein during a single cycle. An appliance comprising a bulk dispenser may meter and dispense the correct amount of additive for each particular load and provide information to the user regarding the remaining amount of additive in the bulk dispenser after dispensing.","Because each additive may have different parameters associated with its use, information about each consumable may be provided with each consumable . This information may be provided on the packaging of consumable  (i.e. the consumable holder), in consumable , or by any other suitable means (performance tag, data pod, user interface, etc.). For example, different additives may have different concentrations, and the amount of a given additive needed for a particular load will vary depending on the concentration of that additive. The amount of a particular additive needed to complete a cycle of operation will also depend on the amount and type of laundry being treated, as well as the condition of the laundry (e.g. soil and stain level). The amount, type, and condition of the laundry may be determined utilizing information supplied by the user, information gathered by sensors associated with the appliance, or information otherwise obtained during the operation of the first substance communicating device .","Additional information provided with the consumable may also be used to tailor the cycle of operation to that consumable . In a laundry application, the additive will have to be dispensed at the right time during the cycle, such as before, during, or after wash, rinse, spin, or drying. Particular additives may also require that they are dispensed under certain conditions, such as at a given water temperature or air temperature. Additionally, particular additives might require at least one additional step in a cycle for optimal performance. For example, the presence of a particular additive might require that the cycle structure be augmented by inserting an additional ordered collection of steps such as filling at a new temperatures to a new level after spinning, then soaking for an amount of time, then draining, then spinning for a new amount of time at a new spin speed between the original step in the cycle and the last step in the cycle.","The smart process control apparatus  or electronics  may determine parameters to be used for the cycle of operation or the structure of the appropriate cycle of operation or changes to an existing cycle of operation for different operations based on the information provided with consumable , user input, and information obtained by sensors associated with first substance communicating device .

Refrigerators, dryers, washers, and dishwashers are all known to use filters that are consumed in the sense that they must be replaced after a certain amount of time or usage due to wear and dirtying of the filter. Filters, in particular, depending on the embodiment may be construed as a consumable, a consumable holder, or both. For example, if there is a filter assembly holding a filtering material, then the filter assembly may be considered a consumable holder and the filtering material may be considered a consumable because it is disposed of after it usability is consumed; its life and the life of the consumable holder are significantly different. On the other hand, the filter assembly and the filter material may be integrally formed and introduced and removed from the use environment as a unit. In this case, the assembly and the filter material would be considered both a consumable holder and consumable because the assembly and the filter material comprise functionality and attributes of both consumable holders and consumables.","Consumables may also include food, as mentioned above, and articles of clothing. Such consumables may or may not be contained by a consumable holder. However, non-contained consumables may still have consumable holder functionality in that they may comprise information about the consumable that is retrievable by the appliance. For example, a food item may carry information about itself that is contained in edible ink printed on the surface of the food item.","Returning to the drawings, service connector system  may be an internal or external interface configured to couple second substance communicating device  and first substance communicating device . Substance handling system  may also be provided with an interface  for removably connecting one or more additional accessory devices ,  or .

Any service communicated through service couplers A-F may be consumed, returned, stored, or passed on to a third device by the device receiving the service. The service may be used to trigger or enable an event, such as to trigger a dispensing event, modify data, or affect a cycle of operation. For example, a mechanical, electrical or data service from first substance communicating device  may trigger an actuator in second substance communicating device . A substance communicated across a service connector system may be a consumable, a resource or non-consumable substance. Substance and mechanical communication between second substance communicating device  and first substance communicating device  will normally require a physical coupling. Data, power, illumination, thermal or acoustic communication may require a physical coupling or may occur through a contactless or wireless connection.","In one embodiment, a changed substance is communicated through service coupler F. The substance may initially be a resource or a consumable and will have been changed by one of the substance communicating devices prior to being communicated to the other substance communicating device. A changed substance may be one whose properties have been changed by a chemical, thermal, electrical, or other type of process. For example a changed substance may be one that has been heated, cleaned, cooled, mixed with a consumable, or generally treated in such a way that it has at least one property with a different value.","As mentioned above, service coupler E may include a power service connector component. A power service connector component may deliver power to a second substance communicating device  or it may deliver power to smart process control apparatus .

The cycle architecture  differs from conventional operational cycle execution software. Conventional operational cycle execution software is determined wholly from compiled source code that cannot easily be separated into constituent parts or portions. The cycle architecture  is software that has two distinct portions, a cycle structure  and a cycle engine . The cycle structure  is a data or cycle structure portion representing a plurality of elements or components comprising an ordered collection of steps, separated from each other by transition conditions, with the actions to be taken during each step. Each element or component can have an identifier to enable replacement or merging of elements or components. The transition conditions are the conditions under which a selected step should transition to a next step in the ordered collection of steps. Transition conditions comprise arbitrarily complex logic expressions that must be resolvable to a Boolean value. In one embodiment, the logic of a transition condition is a composition of structures comprising operators connected to functions, other operators, variables, or constants and functions connected to other functions, operators, variables, or constants wherein the composition forms a composite which can be resolved to a Boolean during the cycle of operation. For example, a logic expression could start with a structure representing an \u201cAND\u201d wherein the \u201cAND\u201d is connected to one \u201cOR\u201d structure and a function \u201cfoo\u201d. The \u201cOR\u201d structure is then connected to a function \u201cbar\u201d and a function \u201cdomo\u201d. During the cycle of operation where a first step was separated from a second step by the transition condition, the first step would de-activate and transition to the second step when function \u201cfoo\u201d returned a value of true and either function \u201cbar\u201d or function \u201cdomo\u201d returned a value of true. Compositions of structures representing logic can be represented in data, which can be converted into the composition of structures during or before the cycle of operation. Likewise, existing compositions can be modified with additional data. Using this data technique or another technique providing the same flexibility, cycle architecture  comprising cycle structure  further comprising a plurality of step transition logic expressions can be authored by an authoring tool, transmitted via network, encoded into consumable  or consumable holder , and used by cycle engine  to execute a cycle of operation. The cycle engine  is software that can be combined with at least one cycle structure  in the controller  for the execution of an operational cycle.","One advantage of having the cycle architecture  partitioned into two components is that the cycle engine  can reside in a plurality of different appliance types, thereby reducing the cost and increasing the quality of the appliance types. A second advantage is that new appliance models or types can be developed using the cycle engine , thus avoiding the development time and cost of conventional operational cycle execution software, which is typically and historically developed specifically for each new appliance model and type.","Another advantage of cycle architecture  is that the cycle architecture  can be in communication with cycle structure  over a network or within a runtime environment. This allows the logical architecture of the appliance  to vary independently from the physical architecture of the appliance .","Another advantage of cycle architecture  using cycle structure  and a separate cycle engine  is that the cycle structure  is portable, which allows it to be delivered to the cycle architecture  over a network, from a remote data source, from a local data source like flash memory, EE memory, or Read-Only Memory, or from an accessory, from a user interface configured to create a cycle structure, or from any source of information about a cycle structure or data about a cycle structure including data about a consumable. One example for delivering a cycle structure  is by the use of the operation cycle component . This advantage provides upgradeability to the appliance operational execution software in a less obtrusive approach than that of conventional operational cycle execution software in that the operational execution software can be changed in whole or in part without a complete re-downloading of the whole execution software running on the controller .","Another advantage of cycle architecture  using cycle structure  and a separate cycle engine  is that the cycle structure  can be altered to any degree even after the appliance  is installed and in use. This type of upgradeability can be delivered to the user in a variety of methods such as by authoring tools, cycle accessories, consumables with encoded cycle structures, network downloads, appliance user interface configured data, software patches and the like, or even by the operation cycle component . Conventional operational cycle execution software cannot be changed without a complete re-downloading of the whole execution software of controller . Further, conventional operational cycle execution software is configured to accept only parameters that vary the magnitudes of time, temperature, speed, and the like, or modify fixed actions within a fixed ordered collection of steps. By contrast, the cycle architecture  according to the invention is fully modifiable, allowing for new steps, re-ordered steps, new actions, new or modified transition conditions and the like.","The cycle structure  can be represented directly or indirectly. A direct representation of a cycle structure will provide an ordered collection of steps, transition conditions and actions, either logically or in an instruction set that can be interpreted by a cycle engine . An indirect representation of a cycle structure  will provide a set of instructions that will enable a creator, a converter, a compiler, or the cycle engine  itself to build an ordered collection of steps, transition conditions and actions.","Whether direct or indirect, the cycle structure  can be represented in a plurality of data structures such as key-value pairs, Extensible Markup Language (XML), relational data tables, comma separated variable files, a hierarchical composite tree or graph, byte arrays, data packets, command objects, binary encoded data, data encoded as a programming language such as a C header file, text, scripts, serialized objects, and messages. Regardless of the data structure of the cycle structure , the essential meaning and functionality will be interpreted to accomplish the same operational cycle execution on the controller . It is envisioned that cycle structure  may be transcribed from one data structure to another as appropriate during the authoring, distribution, and delivery of the cycle structure to the cycle architecture  on controller  without loss of meaning or functionality. It will be understood that data structure of cycle structure  are transferable between and can be resident in a plurality of memory types including RAM, ROM, and Read-Write types like Flash, EE, RW CDs, floppy disks, hard drives, portable memory thumb drives, external hard drives, and the like.","For an indirect representation of the cycle structure , a cycle structure creator can read a set of instructional messages, for example, and interpret them to build or create the cycle structure . Such instructional messages can be in the form of data packets for messages. For example, the data packets can have routing information such as an enabling identifier, one example of which can be a functional identifier representing things like a cycle structure creator, a state, a transition condition, or an action. As well, the data packets could have a collection of command identifiers that are supported via a collection of operation codes.","In an additional form of indirect representation, cycle structure  can be the source data for automatically generated compilable source code, or the cycle structure itself may be formatted such that it is directly compilable by a compiler configured to create an executable program appropriate for the controller .","Yet another form of indirect representation of the cycle structure  can be a plurality of cycle parameters like time temperature, speed, fill amount and the like wherein the cycle engine or an arbitrary software component would receive the cycle parameters and convert them to a direct representation of the cycle structure  or portion thereof.","In another form of indirect representation, cycle structure  can be represented as a script that is either compilable for the controller  or interpretable by a cycle structure creator or converter. A script can be created by a script authoring tool for introduction into the use environment in any of the disclosed embodiments. The script in communication with cycle architecture  is able to affect and change the state of the appliance control system as described herein.","For a direct representation of the cycle structure  where a data packet is used to deliver information about the cycle structure , the data packet can comprise routing information and a direct representation of the cycle structure . The direct representation could be encoded into a byte array. The byte array could then be operated on directly from cycle engine  configured to interpret the byte array by decoding the byte array during the interpretation such that the data in the byte array could be interpreted as an ordered collection of steps separated by transition conditions having transition logic wherein each step comprises a plurality of actions.","It is contemplated that cycle architecture  can have multiple sources of information about and\/or representing a whole, a part of, or a modification to cycle structure  and that each source may either be a direct or indirect representation and that each source may be embodied in a variety of memory types. Accordingly, the information about the cycle structure  can be used to change the cycle structure  in the appliance  and thereby change an operation cycle of the appliance . The term \u201cchange the cycle structure\u201d is contemplated to include creating a cycle structure, modifying a cycle structure, or accessing a whole or part of a cycle structure or a representation of a cycle structure.","It is further contemplated that the cycle architecture  may publish data about itself, its progress and information about the progress. For example, cycle architecture  can publish its current active step, conditions about the transition logic, elapsed time per step, total elapsed time, or sub-states of the steps, or sub-states of an ordered-collection of steps such as fault state, normal state, transitioning state, idle state, etc. The cycle architecture  may implement additional functionalities such as a software or network API allowing cycle architecture observers to register for notifications to receive the published data.","The cycle architecture  can be communicated, as well as be configured to communicate with a client to receive and send messages by routing information such as an enabling identifier, one example of which can be a functional identifier representing things like a cycle structure creator, a state, a transition condition, or an action. As well, the messages could have a collection of command identifiers that are supported via a collection of operation codes. Preferably, the cycle architecture  of any embodiment will receive messages from a client allowing for changes to the cycle structure . Changes to the cycle structure  may, for example, include the insertion or deletion of steps, additions or deletions to the actions of each step, or changes to the transitional logic between any two given steps. To accomplish such changes, identifiers must be associated with the components of the cycle structure such that the client messages can fully specify the exact desired modifications to the cycle structure.","The actions of the cycle architecture  cause the state of the appliance control system to change including, inter alia, changes to the appliance process control apparatus , a user interface, appliance software, and other components of the appliance like the screens on an appliance graphical user interface or some graphical component thereon. Other exemplary actions include changing the state of electro-mechanical actuators like relays, valves, and fans, and changing the state of user interface indicators like LEDs, buzzers, light rings, segmented displays, or graphics on a graphical LCD. Additionally actions of the cycle architecture  further comprise effects including hiding or making available user interface screens, making elements of screens visible, invisible, enabled, or disabled; changes to fonts, colors, size, or other attribute values of screen elements, changes to menu so that items could be enabled, disabled, added, and deleted, and the like. The devices to which the actions will apply may be represented as identifiable functions with a known controllable interface.","Routing information comprises identifiers (IDs) allowing a sender to send a message to a receiver. Examples of IDs which enable routing are network node IDs which identify the address of either the sending or receiving node on any given network. Another example of an ID which enables routing is a network ID uniquely identifying each network within a plurality of networks such that a sender could uniquely identify the destination (or receiver) of a message by with a network ID and a network node ID thereby allowing the network node IDs on each network vary independently while maintaining unique addressability by the combination of network ID and network node ID. Another example of an ID which enables routing is an object ID and method ID or an API ID and Op Code. These IDs provide routing from the sending node to the receiving software module or object within the receiving node. These IDs provide unique addressability within the software operating environment of a node. A routing table comprising a plurality of rows can be constructed having a combination of routing information IDs in each row where each row represents a route. An additional unique ID (a route ID) can be added to each row identifying each route thereby providing the sender a convenient mechanism for sending information. An example of a routing table is shown here:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0171"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Routing ID","API ID","Sub-Net ID","Sub-Net Node ID"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"4","35","1","1"]},{"entry":[{},"5","46","2","2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Software can be constructed allowing the sender to send information to a route ID whereby the software with convert the route ID to the appropriate routing IDs such that the information is sent to the appropriate network and to the appropriate node on the network and to the appropriate receiving software module. In a further example wherein a sender on a first node communicates to a receiver on a third node via a second node, the second node can have a routing table linking, for example, the object ID to another route ID so that the message sent by the first node is appropriately propagated and routed to the third node by software on the second node using the routing table of the second node. Routing tables can be populated with routing information using the techniques described herein.","The operation cycle component  can store additional operation cycles, changes not originally provided with the appliance , or other information upon which a cycle of operation can be changed, and communicate with the appliance  such that the appliance can implement new, changed or additional operational cycles. An operation cycle stored by the operation cycle component  can also or alternatively include an updated operation cycle. The operation cycle component  can be any type of component, such as a hardware device that can plug into the appliance .","It is to be noted that the operational cycle component  can have other elements that are not the aforementioned operation cycles or constituent data and complied portions. For example, the operational cycle component  can include software code to configure the cycle engine  for communication and other functions or code to put software architecture into an alternate mode for the purpose of diagnostics or changing memory.","An appliance cycle of operation performed by the process control apparatus  can be optimized by information associated with the consumable  on which the process control apparatus  is operating. For example, the cycle structure  could be built specifically to accommodate some properties or attributes of the consumable  or to accommodate some properties or attributes of the consumable holder . The body or bodies that comprise information, identifiers of functionalities, properties, attributes, and property and attribute values related to consumable  can be referred to as sources of information about a consumable or \u201cconsumable information holders.\u201d","The information related to the consumable  can include at least one step for activating a user interface component, preparing an article, a substance communicating device, a substance or consumable, an object relating to the process of using the substance or consumable, or the appliance for the operation cycle, handling any of the above during the operation cycle, or handling any of the above after the operation cycle. The information can be at least partially derived from the consumable information holder. The information is adapted to be perceived by the consumable reader , which enabled to exchange data with a user interface, such as user interface . In this manner, when the consumable reader  obtains the information from the consumable information holder and the user interface  displays relevant data from the consumable reader , a user can utilize the information from the user interface in preparing for, handling during, and handling after the cycle of operation.","Examples of preparation steps include pre-wash for dishes, pre-treatment for clothes stains, defrosting frozen foods, applying ingredients like spices, oils, or condiments to food, shaking a liquid additive like a turkey baste solution, boiling a pot of water, removing a food item from a package and placing it in a micro-wave sleeve, mixing an egg with the contents of a box, checking inventory of needed ingredients, ordering ingredients, shopping for ingredients pushing certain buttons, making a selection on a user interface, rearranging articles in the appliance, checking the appliance, and the like.","Examples of handling steps during a cycle of operation include removing the article from the appliance for stirring, turning, flipping, applying ingredients like spices, oils, or condiments, and the like, adding a consumable or ingredient to the appliance, pushing certain buttons, making a selection on a user interface, rearranging articles in the appliance, closing and opening doors or lids, and the like.","Examples of steps to be taken after the cycle of operation is complete include cooling, applying ingredients like spices, oils, frostings or condiments, mixing with other foodstuffs, hanging up, hanging out, ironing, folding, initiating new preparation steps for another cycle of operation of an appliance for the article, consuming the article, arranging the article, drying the article, appropriately storing the article or preserving the article (as in refrigerating or freezing within an appropriate container for an appropriate amount of time), examining the article, replacing the article, replenishing the article or purchasing a new article, replenishing, ordering, or purchasing the consumables used in association with the article, subscribing to subscriptions associated with the article or the consumables used in association with the article, pushing certain buttons, making a selection on a user interface, rearranging articles in the appliance, cleaning surfaces, and the like.","Examples of consumable information holders include the consumable  itself, a data pod, the consumable holder , a user interface, and a tag. For example, the consumable holder  can be a sensing consumable information holder that uses a lid sensor  for sensing attributes about the consumable  contained therein. These attributes could then be used by the electronics  to further refine operation of the consumable holder . In use, if the consumable holder  needs to dispense two ounces of the consumable , a lid sensor  could be configured with an analog circuit coupled to the electronics  to provide a level or volume feedback so that the electronics  can dispense exactly two ounces rather than a time-based approximation.","Information associated with the consumable  can include amount and\/or composition or other attributes that would characterize the magnitude of the usefulness of the consumable. In this case, the cycle architecture  may adapt itself based on the information. For example, if the consumable  were a dishwashing rinse aid and the consumable holder  had only 90% of the standard dose, the cycle architecture  may adapt itself to this condition by increasing the time of the rinse phase to compensate for the lack of rinse aid. Information associated with the consumable  can also include parameters of an operating cycle such as personal preferences of a user (e.g., doneness or crispiness preferences), and data about the consumable holder , the appliance , or other accessories or components thereof.","In a laundry-specific example, the process control apparatus  may provide information to the cycle architecture  about process variables like soil level, load size, soil type, etc. Based on the information associated with the consumable , including the process variable information, the cycle architecture  or an arbitrary software component in conjunction with a cycle engine  can reconfigure the cycle structure  to adapt to the process variable information. The consumable holder  may comprise the arbitrary software component and be able to reconfigure the cycle structure  to adapt to the process variable information. Reconfiguration can be accomplished in at least two ways. In one way, the arbitrary software component can read the cycle structure  and communicate with the cycle engine . In a second way, arbitrary software component can be preconfigured and communicate that configuration to or instruct the cycle engine  about the configuration.","One example of commands associated with an operating cycle is a collection of key value pairs. Keys comprise parameter names having a meaning, wherein the meaning is known by the cycle engine  such that values associated with the keys are thereby associated with the meanings. This enables the values to be used in the contexts of the meanings to modify and\/or control the cycle of operation of the appliance .","The consumable holder , therefore, can contain all the functionality of and participate in all the embodiments that an operational cycle accessory in communication with the appliance  having the cycle architecture  can. Therefore in one embodiment, a consumable holder  is an operation cycle accessory that further physically contains and may also further be enabled to directly actuate the introduction of the consumable  into the appliance .","Looking again at , the consumable reader  is any device capable of retrieving data or information associated with the consumable  directly from a consumable information holder and exchanging data concerning the information by sending and receiving data. For example, the consumable reader  can inform memory in the consumable holder  of the type of consumable  being held therein.","Information associated with consumable , such as an operating cycle, a cycle structure, data about a cycle structure, data that can create or be interpreted to create a cycle structure, usage directions, cooking instructions, preparation instructions, dosage information, nutritional information, promotional and sale information, information about replenishment, offers for replenishment, reminders for replenishment, images and messages for user interface screens, and washing\/drying instructions can persist, for example, within the consumable itself, in the packaging for the consumable , or in auxiliary materials, such as user manuals and performance tags, provided with the consumable . The consumable reader  is a component that can accept the information associated with the consumable  and transmit it elsewhere, such as to the controller  of the appliance . The consumable reader  can be a device integrated with the appliance  or with the consumable holder , or a separate device that can be coupled, either by a hardwire connection or wireless connection, to the appliance  or consumable holder  for communication. Examples of consumable readers  include, but are not limited to, bar code scanners, radio frequency identification (RFID) tag readers, imaging systems, cameras, intelligent vision systems, devices capable of NFC (near field communications), and magnetic strip readers enabled to send and receive data.","The consumable reader  communicates the information associated with the consumable  to the appliance  so that the appliance  can optimize its performance for the consumable . An example of employing the consumable  and consumable reader  is provided in the schematic illustration of . In this example, a consumable provider  determines the cycle structure  for the consumable . As illustrated, the consumable provider  is a food provider that determines cooking instructions (a cycle structure ) for the consumable , which is in the form of a frozen meal, and encodes the consumable holder , which is the packaging for the frozen meal, with the cooking instructions. A user can place the consumable holder  in the vicinity of the appliance , which in this instance is an oven, and the consumable reader  of the appliance  reads the encoded cooking instructions from the consumable holder  and communicates the cooking instructions directly to the appliance . The cycle architecture  in the appliance  can then either execute the cooking instructions for preparing the frozen meal directly, or create a new or modify an existing cycle structure (i.e. an existing set of cooking instructions) in the appliance  without need for additional information from another source and without need for consumable-related lookup tables. The information associated with the consumable  can be self-executing.","The aforementioned example is not limited to the consumable provider  being a food provider. Any consumable provider with an authoring tool should be able to develop information about a consumable, preferably in a form appropriate for the creation of an optimum cycle structure  and user interaction with the appliance user interface, and encode the information into the consumable or onto the consumable holder so that when the consumable is introduced into the use environment, the optimum cycle structure and the optimal user interaction can be created within the cycle architecture  so the user will have an optimum experience. An authoring tool can comprise a computer with appropriate software, an appliance with software architecture, a network connecting the computer to the appliance for communication, or a data store for storing information about a consumable, preferably comprising information about a cycle structure and information for use on a user interface and preferably with at least one identifier identifying at least one appliance.","It is contemplated that information associated with the consumable  will be available from a data source that contains or can acquire the information associated with consumables. The information can include at least one cycle structure  corresponding to a preferred operating cycle for the consumable . In the case of a food item, the cycle structure  might be used to realize a complete cooking cycle definition for the food item. In this embodiment, the appliance , which is a cooking appliance, can comprise at least one instance of the cycle architecture  so that the introduction of the cycle structure  into the vicinity of the appliance  results in the creation or modification of the cycle structure , and initiation of a preferred operating cycle corresponding to the particular combination of the food item (consumable ), the appliance , and other attributes, such as the geographic location and\/or altitude of the appliance . Moreover, the consumable provider  may also encode cycle information comprising a sound, graphics, ring tone or other licensable information enabling the cycle architecture  to render the licensable information visually or audibly on behalf of the consumable provider .","It will be understood that information associated with consumable  can comprise data about the consumable, such as identifiers of functionalities, properties, attributes, and property and attribute values that describe or characterize something about the consumable  or its consumable holder . The data about the consumable can manifest itself in any type of data structure appropriate for useful storage and retrieval. Examples of appropriate data structures are given above. The data about the consumable may reside entirely within or upon the sources of information about the consumable  or consumable holder . Alternatively, the data about the consumable may be created by a second arbitrary software component using a combination of the cycle structure  and information associated with consumable . In either case, the data about the consumable is constructed from information associated with the consumable  or consumable holder  retrieved from a source of information about the consumable  or consumable holder .","Information associated with consumable  can also comprise user preferences that further refine the creation or modification of the cycle structure  to correspond to the preference of the user of the appliance . The consumable  and\/or consumable holder  can also be enabled to identify the appliance  and provide an appliance-specific operating cycle. One manner of implementing this is for the consumable  and\/or consumable holder  to have operating cycles corresponding to a particular appliance or class of appliance. The appliance  with which the consumable  and\/or consumable holder  is used identifies and implements the relevant operating cycle. Another manner of implementation is for the consumable  and\/or consumable holder  to have an identifier, and the appliance  to have access to a database or table of operating cycles for different consumables  and\/or consumable holders . The appliance  takes the consumable identifier and looks up the corresponding operating cycle for the consumable.","Information associated with consumable  can be in any suitable form. In one embodiment, the information can be a communication packet that can be directly transmitted to the software architecture , thereby eliminating a need for a central storage of consumables data. In another embodiment, the information can be a key that can be used to direct the appliance  to stored consumables data.","The consumable  can be supplied by a third-party provider, as in the case of store-bought frozen meals and wash aids for laundry appliances and\/or dishwashers, or provided by the user. Leftovers and other prepared food are examples of a consumable  that can be provided by the user. The prepared food can be placed in a storage container, which functions as a consumable holder  that is encoded with information related to the prepared food. For example, the information can include re-heat or cooking instructions and an expiration date (i.e., a throw-away date). When the information includes the expiration date, the appliance , such as the oven or microwave oven, can refuse to re-heat or cook the food if the current date is past the expiration date. Optionally, the appliance  can be configured to receive an override command from the user when the user desires to re-heat or cook the food despite the expiration date.","Any suitable material can be used to encode the information on the storage container, and examples include, but are not limited to, plastic wrap, aluminum foil, pots, pans, microwave-safe containers, container lids, and an adhesive or magnetic strip that can be placed on the storage container. The information can be configured by the person who originally prepared the food and encoded using any suitable means, such as a personal computer, a magnetic strip writer, or a handheld encoding device. With this configuration, the user can configure the information on the consumable  as desired. In this manner, the consumable holder  facilitates the acquisition of the data associated with consumables  from a data source.","Referring to , a consumable reader  is configured to obtain information associated with consumables . One or more consumable(s)  may be contained in one or more consumable holder(s)  similar to the aforementioned consumable holder . As discussed previously, the consumable  can be an article. In one embodiment, the appliance  comprises at least one instance of a cycle architecture, such as cycle architecture  of , and an optional cycle operations accessory or functional component . Typically, an appliance  similar to appliance  comprises the functional component . The information  by the consumable reader  can thus include not only data about a consumable A, but also a cycle structure B, data for a response to a query message from a functional component C, and indirect representations of a cycle structure D. Any or all of the data can optionally be in the form of at least one well formed message according to a packet structure or a portion thereof. As mentioned earlier, data about a cycle structure D can include direct commands to the functional component  or parameters about operating cycles, including user preferences or environmental parameters.","More examples of information  include the quantity of consumable pieces, quantity by volume or by weight, date of manufacture, manufacturer, data about its transit from manufacture, distributor, market, and consumer, data about the temperature during transit, nutritional information like calories, fat grams, percent daily allowance of essential vitamins and minerals, a list of medical conditions under which a consumable should not be consumed, data about the relationship between the consumable and known diets, known medical conditions, and known reactions to known medications, and the like. The information  can further include appliance or component identifier data in accord with the messaging protocol of the software architecture. Yet further, the information  can include condition of the consumable, initial conditions for the consumable, data relating to a fill process for the consumable holder, an attribute of the consumable, an attribute of a sensor, an attribute of the consumable holder, a notification trigger rule associated with the consumable, historical information about the consumable, usage instruction relating to the consumable, dietary and allergenic information relating to the consumable, purchasing information, advertising information, recipe information, supply chain information, ingredient information, usage information relating to the consumable, country of origin for at least one of a plurality of ingredients in a consumable, energy consumption attributed to the making and delivering, information relating to carbon emissions in the making and delivering, information relating to the un-natural agents used in the making and delivering, information relating to the environmentally friendly agents used in the making and delivering, information about the treatment of animals in the making and delivering, information relating to the working conditions used in the making and delivering, and information relating to the toxic agents used in the making and delivering. Information about un-natural agents associated with a consumable can include such things as data about pesticides, steroids, and fertilizers associated with the manufacture, delivery or composition of the consumable.","As mentioned earlier, the information  will be in a consumable information holder  that will typically be a memory location, which can be in the consumable holder , or on a surface on a consumable holder . Information can be stored on a removably coupled article comprising memory attached to the surface of the consumable holder . Information can also reside on the consumable  itself, such as by etching, embossing, or imprinting, as long as the consumable  is enabled to store retrievable information. An example of a consumable  enabled to store retrievable information would be food with information directly printed on or etched into the food using edible ink. Another option is a consumable data pod , which is an article comprising memory enabled to store retrievable information about a consumable. An example of the consumable data pod  is an article containing data about a consumable potentially further comprising consumable meta data. Consumable meta data can be such data as quantity of consumable pieces, quantity by volume or by weight, date of manufacture, manufacturer, data about its transit from manufacture, distributor, market, and consumer, data about the temperature during transit, nutritional information like calories, fat grams, percent daily allowance of essential vitamins and minerals, a list of medical conditions under which a consumable should not be consumed, data about the relationship between the consumable meta data and known diets, known medical conditions, known reactions to known medications, and the like. The consumable data pod  is preferably consumed by the appliance cycle of operation that also operates on the consumable  without degradation to the consumable  or to the overall objective of the process operating on the consumable. Information can also reside on a performance tag  attached or affixed to an article, as in the case of an RFID tag applied to the consumable holder  or an article to which the consumable  is intended to be applied.","As well, information can be stored in any other memory location , such as memory within a node in the appliance  or within the consumable reader  itself. The information associated with consumables  can be stored in removably coupled memory within the consumable reader . It should be understood that, in all cases, information associated with consumables  can further include appliance identifier data enabling the functional component to receive the most appropriate data about a consumable according to the connected appliance .","In one example, the functional component  detects the coupling of the consumable reader , queries the consumable reader for information associated with consumables , and a cycle structure  (see ) is created according to the data about the consumable.","In another example, the consumable reader  is given or infers a \u2018start command\u2019 in which it selectively retrieves data about an operating cycle, changes the mode of a software operating layer of the appliance, and commands an alternate software layer of the appliance according to the data about an operating cycle. The consumable reader  can then retrieve data about an operating cycle, establish communication with the functional component , and create a cycle structure.","The consumable reader  can further comprise an arbitrary software component  which creates the cycle structure by communication with the API of the cycle engine.","In certain embodiments, at least one cycle structure is present in the memory of the consumable reader , and at least one cycle structure is present in the memory of at least one appliance functional component . The cycle structures can be functionally aggregated such that the cycle architecture is disposed to selectively operate in response to either cycle data structure. In this case, a user interface can be used to aggregate information about an appliance operating cycle from more than one component for display, modification, or selection by a user.","The functional component  can selectively detect the coupling of the consumable reader  to an appliance , and the consumable reader  is given or infers a \u2018start command\u2019. Upon the selected event, the cycle of operation of the appliance  can obtain and communicate with the information associated with consumables . This direct communication with the information associated with consumables  is facilitated by the consumable reader  acting as a smart coupler.","A consumable information holder associated with any of a consumable, a consumable holder, an article, or an article holder could comprise data associated with proper steps of preparation, regulation, and post regulation (steps after the cycle of operation is complete) to take in accordance with the article or the use of at least one consumable with an article. The data could be practically rendered on a user interface in communication with the consumable information holder. An article could have more than one consumable information holder, and multiple articles, each having one ore more consumable information holders, can be operated on by an appliance at the same time. A device such as consumable reader can perceive the information from the consumable information holders and render the information to a user interface. The user interface can be interactive so that the user can be guided by the user interface to perform an ordered collection of steps comprising one or more preparation steps, handling steps and post handling steps. On an interactive user interface, the user can enter data affecting the ordered collection, including acknowledgement of the completion of steps, changing steps, actions and transition conditions in a cycle of operation, seeking help, asking inquiries, and the like.","With regard to the processes, systems, methods, etc. described herein, it should be understood that, although the steps of such processes, etc. have been described as occurring according to a certain ordered sequence, such processes could be practiced with the described steps performed in an order other than the order described herein.
