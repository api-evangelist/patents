title: Dual jet emerging lift augmentation system for airfoils and hydrofoils
abstract: Separate upper and lower plenums within an aircraft airfoil or a sea hydrofoil conduct fluid under different pressures to nozzle slots from which jets emerge to augment lift in accordance with different travel conditions. Lift is induced by nozzle slot emergence of a primary jet from one of the plenums along a reverse flow path relative to secondary jet outflow from the other plenum. This capability involves angularly adjusted deflection of the primary jet outflow along forward, reverse or vertical directional flow paths from the trailing end of the airfoil or hydrofoil under zero and other different speed conditions by emergence of the secondary wall jet.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates generally to wing or hydrofoil lift augmentation by use of powered blowing jets.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Airfoil or hydrofoil lift augmentation by use of various arrangements of slot emerging jets are already well known in the art as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,885,160, 4,457,480 and 4,682,746. The condition of the emerging jets is characterized by the jet flow momentum coefficient, which is essentially the ratio of jet momentum to the flow momentum of the foil travel speed. Such emerging jet arrangements involve: (1) a Coanda-effect tangential wall jet suitable for lift augmentation in one operational mode under higher travel speed conditions where the jet momentum coefficient is of low to moderate value; or (2) a jet ejected from the foil trailing edge at an angle to produce a jet-flap operational mode especially suitable for lift augmentation at low speed where the available jet momentum coefficient is high; or (3) a directable nozzle for vectoring of jet reaction control forces at zero speed conditions. Each one of the foregoing three operational modes is limited in suitability for force augmentation to a single range of either available momentum coefficient or speed as referred to. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for extended lift augmentation under all conditions of speed and\/or available jet momentum coefficient by means of a single trailing edge wall jet configuration under selective switching between different operational modes to thereby extend lift augmentation under all speed conditions between zero and high speed for the airfoil or hydrofoil.","Pursuant to the present invention, an airfoil or hydrofoil of an aircraft or sea vessel is internally provided with two separate plenum chambers from which pressurized fluid may emerge as jets through trailing edge nozzle slots. The jets are selectively controlled so as to switch between different operational modes so that the most effective mode for lift augmentation is used depending on travel speed. Thus under higher travel speed conditions a single plenum is pressurized to cause emergence of a single primary wall jet which remains attached to the rounded Coanda trailing edge for some distance of turning angle, thereby increasing circulatory lift. Due to the speed of the vehicle the momentum coefficient in this mode is only low to moderate, thereby providing for satisfactory operation with only the single jet which performs primarily a boundary layer control function. As the speed is reduced thereby increasing the available jet momentum coefficient, the second plenum is also pressurized, but at a much lower level, so that the outflow from the secondary nozzle slot precludes detrimentally excessive turning of the primary slot outflow by permitting entry into a jet-flap mode of operation. In the jet-flap mode, the primary wall jet is forced by the secondary jet to leave the trailing edge while still with excess momentum and at an acceptable angle to the direction of travel. Under these low speed conditions, the augmented lift achieved in the jet-flap mode is superior to that which would be obtained in the single slot mode which suffers from the excessive jet turning angle at high values of jet momentum. At or very near zero vehicle speed, the merged primary and secondary jets provide maneuvering force control in any desired direction, including thrust reversal, by changing the relative pressure ratio between the two jets.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a cross-sectionally profiled fluid dynamic surface controlled airfoil wing  of an aircraft having a leading edge  and a trailing end . The cross-section profile of the wing  is not necessarily symmetrical. Internal structural support posts  interconnect an upper surface portion  and a lower surface portion  of the wing  with a support plate , which extends from the leading edge  toward a Coanda surface shaped formation  connected to the plate  at the trailing end . Upper and lower plenums  and  are separated from each other by extensions of the support plate  between the leading end  and the trailing end . Upper and lower fluid inlets  and  are formed adjacent the forward end of plenums  and , to which pressurized fluids from ambient operating media, such as air, is supplied. The air supplied to the inlets  and  is derived from a pressurized air source  under control of a maneuvering control system  through valves  and  according to one embodiment as diagrammed in .","According to another embodiment, a cross-bleed port  is positioned within the support plate  between the upper and lower plenums  and  for nozzle flow control purposes. The cross-bleed port  has an orifice through which a small portion of a singularly pressurized flow is metered between the plenums  and  to thereby delay excessive turning of a primary outflow jet from the upper plenum  under conditions of moderately high jet momentum coefficient. The port  may be utilized as a substitute for the valve , emplacing and activating secondary control of the system  in certain travel speed ranges, because the orifice of the port  is sized to prevent secondary jet outflow from the lower plenum  from being detrimental in any mode of operation while allowing sufficient beneficial flow.","As shown in , nozzle slots  and  are respectively established between the surface formation  and each of the upper and lower wing surface portions  and  at the trailing ends of the plenums  and . Outflow of pressurized fluid such as air as the primary and secondary nozzle jets from the wing  is thereby effected by emergence thereof from the nozzle slots  and  as hereinafter pointed out with respect to , for aircraft maneuvering and control purposes at any speed including zero.","Referring now to , outflow of pressurized air confined to the upper plenum  emerges through the slot  as a jet A which turns about the trailing end  and excessively moves forward toward the leading end  during low speed travel of the aircraft because of the relatively low momentum of the oncoming external air flow  over all surfaces of the wing . Such jet A accordingly imposes local reduction in pressure that produces rearward drag on the wing  as well as to reduce its lift performance. Pursuant to the present invention, high momentum outflow from the slot  is controllably redirected by emergence of a low momentum secondary jet outflow from the lower plenum  through the slot , so as to prevent excessive turning of a resulting primary jet (B) to thereby enhance wing Coanda lift performance. The lower level outflow from the slot  is achieved by controlling fluid pressurizations within the plenums  and  through the aforementioned maneuvering control system  according one embodiment diagrammed in . Alternate implementation to simplify the valving system according to another embodiment, is to provide the cross-bleed port , sufficing to always provide a portion of the secondary slot outflow suitable for certain non inclusive operating conditions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["44","48","52","46","44"]},"Directional control over thrust may also be provided for, under conditions of no oncoming flow or a zero transitional speed as illustrated in , by controlled outflow from the slot  relative to the outflow from the slot  to produce a free planar jet C at any jet thrust angle  between 0\u00b0 and +180\u00b0 or \u2212180\u00b0. Thus, the outflow from the slot  may also control the thrust angle  in a reverse direction under zero flight speed conditions pursuant to the present invention.","Prior art arrangements do not use or recognize the benefit of a secondary slot flow to prevent the adverse effect of an excessively turned wall jet angle on a circulation control foil, as shown by contrast in  and , with reference to  illustrating the desired flow path of the primary jet. Also the foregoing described operational modes involving primary and secondary outflows from the two slots  and  as illustrated in , contrast sharply with prior art arrangements wherein static thrusting under zero speed with no oncoming flow  is limited to emergence of a jet in only one travel direction from a single slot. A jet providing forward thrust under zero speed conditions is produced by equal outflows from both of the slots  and , while an omni-directional thrust jet emerges from both of the slots  and  under the zero speed conditions at an angle determined by the ratio of pressures in the plenums  and .","The pressure control valves  and  are used to set the difference in pressure between the plenums  and , so as to selectively confine use of the jet emerging from the slot  as a control influence on the behavior of the other jet C emerging from the slot  as depicted in . Changes between different optimized modes of operation is thereby effected, involving the captured wall jet B in a circulation control mode as shown in  and the jet C in the free planar jet mode as shown in .","An optional arrangement of the present invention is to exclusively use only the control valve  and rely upon the cross-bleed port  as means to establish a fixed difference in pressure ratio between the plenums  and .","The aircraft wing configuration and operationally controlled emergence of jets therefrom as hereinbefore described with respect to aircraft, may be applied to the control surfaces of other types of fluid propelled vehicles such as a stern end hull portion  of a submerged seawater vessel as shown in . Thus, the configuration heretofore described for the airfoil wing  may be utilized to form a pair of all moveable or fixed horizontal hydrofoils  extending laterally from the vessel hull portion  at right angles to a pair of all moveable and\/or fixed hydrofoil rudders  or to a sail\/conning tower  extending from the hull portion  as shown in . The different previously described embodiments of the present invention are applicable hereto for enhancing Coanda or circulation control and maneuvering of such as the submerged vessel as well as to other vehicles such as surface ships.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIGS. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2E","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
