title: Nanoscale electronic latch
abstract: In one embodiment of the present invention, a nanoscale latch is implemented by interconnecting an enable line, two control lines, and a pull-down line, when needed, to a signal line carrying encoded binary values to be latched and subsequently output. The enable line is interconnected with the signal line through a field-effect-transistor-like nanoscale junction. Both control lines are interconnected with the signal line through asymmetric-switch nanoscale junctions of like polarities. The pull-down line, when needed, is interconnected with the signal line through a resistive nanoscale junction. Inputting a sequence of signals to the enable and control lines allows a value input from the signal line to be stored and subsequently output to the signal line. In various additional embodiments, an array of nanoscale latches can be implemented by overlaying enable and control lines, and a pull-down line when needed, over a set of parallel nanowires.

Because electronic latches are fundamental components of electronic circuits and devices, nanoscale electronic latches are needed for nanoelectronic circuits and devices created by emerging molecular-electronics-fabrication techniques. A number of different types of nanoscale latches have been proposed. However, the previously proposed nanoscale latches employed asymmetric switches of opposing polarities. Fabricating a single nanoscale device with asymmetric switches of opposing polarities may difficult and expensive. Researchers, developers, and manufacturers of nanoscale electronic devices have all recognized the need for devising new types of nanoscale latches with properties and characteristics conducive to high-volume manufacture for commercial applications.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a nanoscale latch is implemented by interconnecting an enable line, two control lines, and a pull-down line, when needed, to a signal line carrying encoded binary values to be latched and subsequently output.

First, as shown in the NEL representation , the voltage applied to the enable line  is decreased below Vto open the FET-like nanoscale junction . Then, a large positive voltage Vis applied to control line B  to open the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction . Next, as shown in NEL-representation , a large negative voltage greater or equal in magnitude than Vis applied to control line A  in order to close asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction . Next, as shown in NEL representation  in , the FET-like nanoscale junction  is closed by application of a voltage greater than Vto the enable line . Thus, the current signal input via the signal line  is passed through the NEL. Then, in the NEL representation  in , a voltage V less than Vbut greater than Vis applied to control A . If the signal line is high, then the voltage applied across the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  is below V, and the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction remains closed. However, if the signal line is low, then the voltage applied across the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  is greater than V, and the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  is opened by the applied voltage. As discussed above with reference to , the symbol-filled disk  represents the fact that the state of the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction depends on the signal latched by application of the voltage V to control A . Next, as shown in NEL representation  in , the FET-like nanoscale junction  is disabled by application of a voltage less than Vto the enable line . Next, as shown in NEL representation  in , a relatively large negative voltage \u2212(V) is applied to control A . If asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  is closed, then the output signal line  has a low voltage. If, on the other hand, the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  is open, then the output signal line  is at ground. Thus, application of the negative voltage \u2212(V) to the control-A signal line inverts the latched input signal. Next, as shown in NEL representation  in , the negative voltage Vis applied to control D , placing the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  in an open state, when the latched signal S is high, and placing the asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  in a closed state when the latched signal S is low. Thus, the state of the second asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction  is opposite from the state of the first asymmetric-switch nanoscale junction . This completes latching of the signal S input into the NEL in the step discussed with reference to NEL representation  in .","In order to output the latched binary value, as shown in NEL representation  in , the positive voltage Vis applied to the control-A signal line  and the negative voltage Vis applied to the control-B signal line . When the latched signal value S is high, a large positive voltage Vis output, while when the latched signal value S is low, the negative voltage Vis output . Output of the inverted latched value can be accomplished by reversing the voltages applied to the control-A and control-B signal lines, as shown in NEL representation  in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["1002","1004","1006","1008","1010","1002"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 10"],"b":["1102","1104","1102","1106","1108","1110","1112","1102","704","1012","1102","1114"]},"Although the present invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments, it is not intended that the invention be limited to these embodiments.
