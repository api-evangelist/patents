title: Configuration for improving bonding and corrosion resistance of reinforcement material
abstract: A coating for a reinforcing material, such as metal rebar, that increases the adhesion between the reinforcing material and a matrix, such as a cement-based mortar or concrete, in which the reinforcing material is embedded. The coating may comprise a glass frit mixed with a refractory material, such as dry Type I-II portland cement. The coating is bonded, typically by heat, to the surface of the reinforcing material. The reaction of the refractory component, e.g., portland cement, when the reinforcement, e.g., metal re-bar, is embedded in a matrix, e.g., fresh mortar or concrete, prevents the formation of soft precipitates at the interface of the matrix and its reinforcement. One coating comprises portland cement Type I-II combined with a commercial alkali-resistant glass frit. This coating is applied to a steel rebar and fired to bond to the rebar. The frit-refractory coating produces a strong bond between the metal rebar and concrete and may eliminate or significantly reduce the potential for corrosion of the rebar.

No. 11\/234,184, Publication No. 2007\/0264527 A1, System and Method for Increasing the Bond Strength Between a Structural Material and Its Reinforcement, by Sykes et al., filed Sep. 26, 2005 and incorporated herein by reference. This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/793,799, Configuration for Increasing the Bond Strength Between a Structural Material and Its Reinforcement, by Sykes et al., filed Jun. 4, 2010.","Under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, the conditions under which this invention was made entitle the Government of the United States, as represented by the Secretary of the Army, to an undivided interest therein on any patent granted thereon by the United States. This and related patents are available for licensing to qualified licensees.","Metals embedded in concrete typically form very poor bonds with the contacting cement because there are no coupling compounds that form between the cement and the metal. In select embodiments of the present invention, nickel and cobalt-rich glass frits bond to steel and the glass frits on the steel bond to bulk construction materials embedded in the glass frits on the steel. These bulk materials may comprise portland cement clinker, mica, quartz, aluminum silicate, other refractory inorganic compounds, and the like. A configuration comprising one or more of these bulk materials bound in the surface of a glass frit effects a tight bond to the calcium silicate hydrate that forms as the portland cement in the concrete hydrates.","Adding material of a non-melting mineral type, i.e., refractory material, to a low-melting temperature glass frit; combining the two as a coating; coating some reinforcing steel rods with the resultant combination and firing the resultant coating (or glaze) increases the strength of the bond to concrete as compared to uncoated (or unglazed) steel rods, such as uncoated rebar used to reinforce concrete. In select embodiments of the present invention, steel rods are coated with a coating (or glaze) combining a commercial powdered glass frit and particles of one or more refractory materials such as mica, glass slag, portland cement clinkers and the like. In select embodiments of the present invention, the frit and refractory material are suspended in a liquid carrier, such as water. Refractory materials are those materials that do not melt at temperatures that fuse (solidify) frits used in making the coatings used in select embodiments of the present invention.","In select embodiments of the present invention, coatings or glazes (\u201cenameling\u201d) of a rough finish texture are fired on metal structure. The resultant \u201crough-enamel\u201d coating is employed to improve the bonding of a variety of cement-based mortars or concretes to a variety of metals, such as steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper and the like, or items plated with these metals.","In select embodiments of the present invention, flowable frit mixtures, preferably in a liquid carrier mixed with a thickener added to the liquid, are combined with a refractory additive of appropriate dimension to yield a rough or \u201cbumpy\u201d enameled surface after firing. In select embodiments of the present invention, the refractory additives may be one or more of the following types: dry portland cement, mica, slag, and the like. These refractory additives are combined with one or more suitable frits and applied as one or more coatings (or glazes) on reinforcing materials such as steel rebar, metal fibers, and the like. In select embodiments of the present invention, a reinforcement coated with one or more of the above \u201cfrit-bonding\u201d mixtures (or rough glazes) appropriately fired on the reinforcing material, e.g., rebar, is added as reinforcement to structural material during its flowable stage (such stage as may be present in a portland cement-based mortar paste or concrete paste) and then permitted to cure.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the selected frit in the combination coating (or glaze) needs to bond to steel. Thus, the frit contains a transition metal, e.g., nickel, cobalt, and the like, to facilitate this bond. Bonding of the \u201ccoated (or glazed) and fired\u201d steel to an embedding matrix, such as concrete in its paste form, is most likely not improved by applying multiple coats of a \u201cfrit-bonding\u201d mixture. Thus, with steel rebar for example, it is proper to use a combination of a suitable bonding frit and a refractory material. A suitable bonding frit for steel is a groundcoat enamel that bonds directly to the steel, not to another enamel. In select embodiments of the present invention, the coating (or glaze) is produced by suspending in the groundcoat enamel one or more high melting point (refractory) materials, such as a ceramic of portland cement clinkers, mica flakes, slag glass and the like. The composition of a typical alkali-resistant groundcoat enamel for steel is shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Composition of a typical alkali-resistant groundcoat enamel for steel"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Amount"]},{"entry":[{},"Constituent","(%)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Silicon dioxide (SiO)","42.02"]},{"entry":[{},"Boron oxide (BO)","18.41"]},{"entry":[{},"Sodium oxide (NaO)","15.05"]},{"entry":[{},"Potassium oxide (KO)","2.71"]},{"entry":[{},"Lithium oxide (LiO)","1.06"]},{"entry":[{},"Calcium oxide (CaO)","4.47"]},{"entry":[{},"Aluminum oxide (AlO)","4.38"]},{"entry":[{},"Zirconium oxide (ZrO)","5.04"]},{"entry":[{},"Copper oxide (CuO)","0.07"]},{"entry":[{},"Manganese dioxide (MnO)","1.39"]},{"entry":[{},"Nickel oxide (NiO)","1.04"]},{"entry":[{},"Cobalt Oxide (CoO)","0.93"]},{"entry":[{},"Phosphorous Pentoxide (PO)","0.68"]},{"entry":[{},"Fluorine (F)","2.75"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In select embodiments of the present invention, a method for improving a bond between reinforcing material and a matrix incorporating the reinforcing material, comprises: selecting one or more flowable fits, such as an alkali-resistant groundcoat enamel, the fits compatible with the matrix and reinforcing material;

When low-carbon decarburized steel is enameled in a direct operation, the steel is etched to remove 11-22 g\/mof surface metal and receives a surface deposit of 0.9-1.3 g\/mof nickel. A ferric sulfate etching solution is sometimes used with decarburized steel.","In select embodiments of the present invention, coatings (or glazes) are applied via a method selected from the group consisting of: spraying, dipping, brushing, flowing on, electrostatic spraying, rolling, and combinations thereof.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the temperature regime involves inserting the coated (or glazed) reinforcing material into an oven pre-heated to the final temperature of said firing. In select embodiments of the present invention, the final temperature of firing the coating (or glaze) is from about 500\u00b0 C. to about 900\u00b0 C., and preferably from about 800\u00b0 C. to about 875\u00b0 C.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the time regime is that time after inserting the coated (or glazed) reinforcing material into an oven pre-heated to the final temperature of firing until removal of the fired reinforcing material from the oven. In select embodiments of the present invention, the time of firing is selected to be from about two minutes to about 45 minutes and preferably from about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes.","In select embodiments of the present invention, cooling of the fired reinforcing material is done by removing the fired reinforcing material from the oven and permitting the reinforcing material to reach ambient temperature in ambient air.","In select embodiments of the present invention, portland cement is employed as both the refractory material to be combined with a frit and at least part of the composition of the matrix to be reinforced. Portland cement-based concrete begins as a strong alkaline paste. This paste varies in pH from about the pH of calcium hydroxide (12.5) to almost 14 depending on the amount of sodium present. This high alkalinity dictates selection of a frit that is alkali-resistant. Typically, alkali-resistant glass is made by adding zirconium to the basic silica-sodium-borate composition. Further, when a highly alkaline paste attacks glass, it typically forms a gel that tends to swell unless the gel is stabilized with a lithium compound. Existing alkali-resistant glass fits are made with both zirconium and lithium, thus, for a portland cement-based matrix, fits are selected from among existing (commercial) alkali-resistant frits. Some examples include \u201cCermet\u201d from Thompson Enamel Co., Bellevue, Ky.; \u201cFrit 2680 Transparent,\u201d also from Thompson; and \u201cF-579 Frit\u201d from Fusion Ceramics, Inc., Carrollton, Ohio.","In select embodiments of the present invention, one or more flowable frits are combined with one or more refractory materials (i.e., those inorganic materials having a melting point higher than that of the frits) such as portland cement clinkers, mica flakes, and the like. The resultant combination is compatible with an embedding matrix, such as a portland cement-based mortar, in which the enhanced reinforcing material is to be inserted. In addition to improving the bond between the base reinforcing material and the matrix, the \u201cfrit-bonding\u201d coating (or glazing) may eliminate or reduce the rate of corrosion of metal or metal-plated reinforcement coated with it in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","In select embodiments of the present invention, at least three approaches exist for establishing an improved bond of a matrix to reinforcement material embedded in the matrix. First, the embedding matrix, such as a portland cement-based concrete or mortar paste, may be designed to etch, and thus bond with a particular established glass coating (or enamel) on a reinforcement, such as rebar. Second, the glass (or enamel) coating on the reinforcement material may be abraded to form a rough (more chemically active) surface and a dry \u201cpowdered\u201d refractory material, such as portland cement or glass slag and the like, applied to the roughened surface to enhance the bond of the reinforcement to a structural matrix, such as portland cement-based mortar or concrete. Third, a preferred approach of select embodiments of the present invention, flowable frit materials may be combined with a refractory material to yield a coating mixture (or glaze) that is subsequently applied to the surface of a base reinforcement material and fired. The resultant coated (or glazed) reinforcement material is permitted to cool and then inserted in an initially flowable matrix, such as a paste of a portland cement-based mortar or concrete.","In select embodiments of the present invention, equal volumes of a ground glass frit, preferably an alkali-resistant frit, and portland cement are combined to prepare a mixture to be used as a \u201cbonding-frit\u201d coating (or glaze). In select embodiments of the present invention, the glass may be a combination of glass types such as are available from a recycling plant. More than 50% by volume portland cement may be used. In select embodiments of the present invention, up to about 70% by volume of the \u201cbonding-frit coating\u201d (or glaze) may be portland cement. In select embodiments of the present invention, the texture of the resultant bonding-frit coating (or glaze) may range from a fine sand, such as a quartz sand, to a fine powder, such as portland cement.","In select embodiments of the present invention, a \u201cground glass\u201d bonding-frit coating (or glaze) is applied by making a slurry of the mixture of ground glass and portland cement using water or water mixed with a thickener or adhesive, such as methyl cellulose. The base reinforcing item, such as a steel rebar, may be coated by dipping, spraying, brushing, rolling or flow coating the slurry onto the surface. The resultant wet coating is typically air-dried prior to firing. In select embodiments of the present invention, the bonding-fit coating may be applied in its dry state by electro-static spray such as any of the methods used in commercial powder coating.","Further, the method may be used to strongly bond two pieces of material each incorporating a rough (bumpy) enameled surface, prepared in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, at the interface to be joined. The two pieces may be joined by applying a suitable matrix, such as a portland cement-based grout, as an adhesive.","In select embodiments of the present invention, a method of enhancing bonding between surfaces of materials comprises: selecting one or more first and one or more second surfaces to be bonded; selecting one or more first flowable frits compatible with materials comprising the first surfaces; selecting first refractory material compatible with the first surfaces and the first fits; mixing the first refractory material with the first frits to yield one or more first coatings; preparing the first surfaces; applying one or more first coatings to the first surfaces; selecting one or more second flowable frits compatible with the materials comprising the second surfaces; selecting second refractory material compatible with the second surfaces and the second fits; mixing the second refractory material with the second fits to yield one or more second coatings; preparing the second surfaces; applying the second coatings to the second surfaces; selecting one or more temperature regimes for firing each of the first and second coatings onto the first and second surfaces, respectively; selecting a time regime for conducting each of the firings of the first and second coatings; firing the first and second coatings onto the first and second surfaces respectively at the selected temperature regimes for the duration of the selected time regimes; cooling the fired first and second surfaces; applying one or more grouts to one or more of the first and second fired surfaces; bringing one or more of the grouted surfaces in contact with one or more of the ungrouted surfaces to effect a bond between the first and second surfaces; and curing the grout.","In laboratory tests, the bonding-frit coating (glaze) was prepared by combining about 50% by volume of a portland cement type I-II with a 50% by volume of a commercial alkali-resistant ground coat enamel to yield a frit-bonding liquid coating. In select testing, this coating was applied to the experimental rods and fired at temperatures from about 805-870\u00b0 C. At this temperature range, heat exposure ranged from about 2-12 minutes. The goal was to produce a final coating (or glaze) that is about 50-100 \u03bcm (2-4 mils) thick, including the refractory material embedded therein. Thin spots were corrected by applying more bonding-fit coating (or glaze) at the thin areas and firing a second time.","Two sets of smooth (un-deformed) AISI C1018 steel rods, 72 mm in length and 6.35 mm in diameter, were treated in accordance with a method of an embodiment of the present invention. Unmodified rods were threaded at one end and used as a control. These control rods (threaded version not shown separately) were cleaned with oxalic acid and water, rinsed with tap water, rinsed with dilute sulfuric acid, rinsed with distilled water, and given a final rinse of alcohol and allowed to air dry.","The surfaces of experimental steel rods \u201cenhanced\u201d in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention were prepared by: cleaning with an alkali-based solution; water rinsing preferably with warm water (in a range of about 45-60\u00b0 C.); water rinsing, preferably with cold water (ambient, i.e., about 15-25\u00b0 C.); acid-etching in a sulfuric acid solution of about 6-8%; cold rinsing with a dilute sulfuric acid solution of pH of about 3.0-3.5; nickel deposition at about 0.02 to 0.06 g\/mas described above from ; cold rinsing in a dilute sulfuric acid solution of pH about 3.0-3.5; and final rinsing in a sodium carbonate\/sodium borate solution.","Refer to  describing the control and experimental rods used, where L=65 mm, L=72 mm and D=6.5 mm. All rods  were threaded for about 7 mm (L\u2212L) of their length, L, similar to threading  of . The rods  were threaded to facilitate \u201cpull out\u201d testing.","Refer to  depicting a photograph of one of the coated (or glazed) and fired experimental rods . None of the experimental rods  were abraded in test described herein. The experimental rods were dipped into a water-based suspension of commercial glass frit (VitrearcTransparent Prussian Blue Cat. No. 2680, Thompson-Enamel Co., Bellevue, Ky.), portland cement Type I-II, and methyl cellulose thickener (Klyr-Fire #A-1, Thompson-Enamel Co., Bellevue, Ky.). After coating (or glazing) with the \u201cfrit-bonding\u201d suspension, the experimental rods  were permitted to air-dry and then fired in an electric furnace, resulting in a finished product  as represented in . After firing, the experimental rods  were allowed to air cool. Portions of the resultant fired frit-bonded coating (or glaze)  are portland cement embedded in the surface of a cobalt-doped blue glass and appear as light-colored areas  in the \u201cfrit-bonding\u201d coating (or glaze) . The furnace temperature for the rod  photographed in  was 816\u00b0 C., maintained for 30 minutes.

The standard mortar described in the ASTM C 109 section on proportioning was used to prepare the mortar cylinders . After the rods ,  were inserted in the mortar paste; each cylinder  was consolidated by vibrating the mortar paste for thirty seconds. All cylinders  were moist-cured for seven days.","Refer to , a photograph of a section of a typical cylinder  split lengthwise along one side of the inserted rod . In this photo, the rod  has been extracted in the direction of the arrow  only a short distance as indicated at the arrow  to show a small portion of the void  resultant from extraction.  also shows how the experimental rod  was stripped completely of its coating (or glaze) .","Refer to , a view of the cross section of the cylinder  of  with the rod  removed completely. The darkened area is the entire void  showing the fired coating (or glaze)  remaining attached within the cylinder  after the experimental rod  was pulled out, i.e., the bond of the fired frit-bonding coating (or glaze)  to the mortar cylinder  was stronger than the bond of the coating (or glaze)  to the steel rod .","After moist curing, the adhesion between the mortar cylinder  and the rods ,  was determined by measuring the peak load required to pull the rods ,  free from the mortar cylinder  such that peak load equaled break load. The results of the testing are presented in Table 3. The load required for pull-out was measured by using an MTS Material Testing System (Minneapolis Minn.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Results of Pull-out Test of Steel Rods in Moist-Cured Mortar"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Break Load"]},{"entry":[{},"Specimen","(lbf)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Control #1","735.9"]},{"entry":[{},"Control #2","136.8"]},{"entry":[{},"Control #3","749.4"]},{"entry":[{},"Control #4","929.7"]},{"entry":[{},"Mean","638.0"]},{"entry":[{},"Std Deviation","345.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Frit #1 w\/PC (700\u00b0 C.)","1927.0"]},{"entry":[{},"Frit #2 w\/PC (700\u00b0 C.)","1936.3"]},{"entry":[{},"Frit #3 w\/PC (700\u00b0 C.)","1441.5"]},{"entry":[{},"Mean","1768.3"]},{"entry":[{},"Std Deviation","283.0"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Results for the control rods  were similar to those obtained with earlier tests with similar uncoated rods. The greatest adhesion between the experimental rods  and the mortar cylinder  was noted with the experimental rods  that were treated with a coating (or glaze) containing a frit-bonding combination of a glass frit and portland cement, i.e., a coating (or glaze), that was fired on the rod . Coating with the \u201cfrit-bonding\u201d coating (or glaze) of Type I-II portland cement and glass frit and firing the resultant coating (or glaze) produced adhesion that was nearly three times greater than that measured for the control rods  alone.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the fit-bonding coating (or glaze) combining a commercial glass frit and Type I-II portland cement performs better than the fusing of Type I-II portland cement to an established enamel or abrading the enamel and fusing the Type I-II portland cement thereto, the latter two described above as approaches one and two, respectively.","In summary, investigation proved that it is possible to bond grains of Type I-II portland cement in mortar paste to portland cement grains, or any refractory mineral phases such as mica or quartz, that are bonded to steel via a \u201cfrit-bonding\u201d coating (or glaze) employing a commercial glass frit to establish a bond with the steel. The bond thus achieved between the mortar and the steel significantly improves the steel reinforcement of conventional concrete structures such as roadways, bridge decks, foundations, and the like.","The abstract of the disclosure is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract that will allow a searcher to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure of any patent issued from this disclosure. 37 CFR \u00a71.72(b). Any advantages and benefits described may not apply to all embodiments of the invention.","While the invention has been described in terms of some of its embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for improving the bond of reinforcement in cement-based matrices, it may apply to any number of applications including structure that may not employ a cement-based matrix but that does utilize reinforcement bonded thereto. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures. Thus, it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting, and the invention should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
