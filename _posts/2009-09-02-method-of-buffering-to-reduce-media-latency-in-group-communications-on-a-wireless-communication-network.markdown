No. 09\/518,776, filed Mar. 3, 2000, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to wireless telecommunication networks. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for buffering initial data for direct group communications, such as Push-to-Talk group communications, in a wireless telecommunication network to reduce latency.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a wireless network, the users of wireless communication devices communicate over an air-interface to a central computer. This may be done directly, as in the case of a wireless LAN in an office environment, or it may be done through cellular infrastructure equipment, as in the case of a wireless telephone application. One type of personal communication system is a push-to-talk (PTT) system between mobile wireless communication devices. A PTT communication connection is typically initiated by a single button-push on the wireless device that activates a half-duplex link between the speaker and each member device of the group and once the button is released, the device can receive incoming PTT transmissions once the button is released. In some arrangements, the PTT speaker will have the \u201cfloor\u201d where no other group member can speak while the speaker is speaking. Once the speaker releases the PTT button, any other individual member of the group can engage their PTT button and they will have the floor. A specific PTT group of recipient devices for the communicating wireless device is commonly set up by the carrier and the wireless devices themselves do not allow the modification of the group, i.e. to include or drop individuals from the group, or to purposely direct a communication to be received by any fewer members than the entire group.","To set up the PTT call, communication to begins with the press of the PTT button on the handset, as opposed to a standard cellular call, and the infrastructure forms a call by combining separate point-to-point connections between each endpoint at a managing entity, such as a server, deployed on the network carrier infrastructure. For purposes of validating the connection, pressing the PTT button originates provides the person with information indicating the availability (presence) of the target user. If the target user is available, the originator receives an immediate indication (such as an audible tone) that the target user is available and the originator can begin speaking. The call originator's voice is then sent through the carrier's network to the target's handset.","One problem arises in a push to talk system in that the person desiring to speak may press the PTT button and have to wait for an acknowledgement that the wireless telecommunication device can send out the group communication. In a common configuration, the device will not send any message until the active dedicated traffic channel is established, which typically means that communication with the appropriate communication equipment has been established, and at least one member of the target group of wireless devices is available to receive the group communication. If the latency delay to set up the dedicated traffic channel is significant, the person will notice the delay. It is thus to such a system and method of reducing latency for the setup of a PTT or direct group communication that the present invention is primarily directed.","Briefly described, the present invention is a system and method for minimizing latency for direct group communications, such as push-to-talk (PTT) calls, among a group of wireless telecommunication devices on a wireless telecommunication network. The wireless telecommunication device has a dormant state without an open dedicated traffic channel for communications therefrom and an active state in which the wireless devices opens a dedicated traffic channel for an outgoing communication from the wireless telecommunication device, to include a direct communication stream. Either the wireless telecommunication device or an intermittent communication server for group communication streams can buffer the initial communication data of a group communication stream while the wireless telecommunication device changes from a dormant state to an active state with an open dedicated traffic channel.","The system and method provides for media buffering prior to or during transmission within a group communication system, the buffering occurring either at the wireless telecommunication device or at a group communication server. The buffering is used to hide delays from the talker associated with bringing up wireless device traffic channels during dormancy wakeup. In particular, client-based media buffering is used to hide the delay associated with bringing up the talker's traffic channel during dormancy wakeup while media buffering is used to hide the delay associated with bringing up the listeners' traffic channels during dormancy wakeup.","In general, the buffering of real-time media in a traditional voice over packet-data application can also be used to smooth network jitter. In one embodiment, the wireless device can implement a media play-out buffer to compensate for network jitter or other set up problems.","In one embodiment, a wireless telecommunication device is able to direct a single group communication stream to a designated group of the plurality of wireless telecommunication devices across wireless telecommunication network, the wireless telecommunication device having a dormant state without an open dedicated traffic channel for communications therefrom, and an active state in which the wireless device opens a dedicated traffic channel for an outgoing communication from the wireless telecommunication device, to include a direct communication stream from that wireless telecommunication device. The wireless telecommunication device further includes a data store for the selectively buffering the initial communication data of a group communication stream at least while the wireless telecommunication device changes from a dormant state to an active state with an open dedicated traffic channel.","In one embodiment, the system for buffering initial group communication data from a wireless telecommunication device on a wireless telecommunication network includes a plurality of wireless telecommunication devices, wherein at least one wireless device able to direct a single group communication stream to a designated group of the plurality of wireless telecommunication devices across the wireless telecommunication network, the wireless telecommunication device having a dormant state without an open dedicated traffic channel for communications therefrom, and an active state in which the wireless device opens a dedicated traffic channel for an outgoing communication from the wireless telecommunication device, to include a direct communication stream from that wireless telecommunication device. The system also includes a communication server that selectively receives incoming group communication streams of data and sends group communication data to other members of the target group for the group communication stream, with the communication server further including a data store for selectively buffering the communication data of a group communication stream intended for a dormant wireless telecommunication device, and at least some communication data is buffered while a dedicated traffic channel is opened to a dormant wireless telecommunication device.","In one embodiment, the method for buffering initial group communication data from a wireless telecommunication device on a wireless telecommunication network includes the steps of starting a single group communication stream from a sending wireless telecommunication device to a designated group of the plurality of wireless telecommunication devices across the wireless telecommunication network through a communication server, the sending wireless telecommunication device having a dormant state without an open dedicated traffic channel for communications therefrom, and an active state in which the wireless devices has opened a dedicated traffic channel for an outgoing communication from the wireless telecommunication device, and the communication server selectively receiving incoming group communication streams of data and sending group communication data to other members of the target group for the group communication stream, then buffering communication data of a group communication stream in a data store, either at wireless device or communication server, from or to a dormant wireless telecommunication device, the initial communication data buffered at least while a dedicated traffic channel is opened to the dormant wireless telecommunication device, and then transmitting the buffered initial communication data from the data store to the target group after an active channel is opened to the sending or receiving wireless telecommunication device.","The system and method can therefore provide a push-to-talk system wherein the talker does not have to wait for an acknowledgement that the wireless telecommunication device has established a full active dedicated traffic channel so that the talker can send out the group communication. Through the use of data being sent over a signaling channel, the initial group communication data can be buffered transparently to the talker at a communication server while channels are opened to target devices. Furthermore, the buffering of the data can done at the client device and be implemented on a existing wireless telecommunication system having a group communication capability.","Other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and the claims.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates one embodiment of a wireless telecommunication system  between a group of wireless telecommunication devices (target set ) on a wireless network . Here, the one or more wireless telecommunication devices are in a PTT group, such as the wireless telephone , smart pager  and personal digital assistant (PDA) , with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network . In the system , each wireless telecommunication device ,, is capable of selectively directly communicating across the wireless communication network  with a target set  of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices with the plurality. For example, the target set for cellular telephone  can all devices in the target set  or a subset thereof, such as pager  and PDA .","In particular, the system  can deliver media, such as voice data, multimedia, or other applicants, to very large push-to-talk (or other similar services) calls defined in ad-hoc fashion. These PTT calls can involve a very large number of call participants (several hundred) who can be scattered across an operator's wireless network  or who may all be located in a small number of sectors on the same network resources. Furthermore, the target set  (or group) can include only one target wireless device. In such instance, the PTT communication will only travel from one wireless device to another via the PTT system.","In one embodiment, a group communication server  selectively receives requests to bridge direct communications between the communicating wireless telecommunication devices ,, and the one or more other wireless telecommunication devices in the target set  designated for the communicating wireless telecommunication device. The communication server  then selectively bridges the requested direct communication, such as a PTT voice communication. The identity of the target set  is selectively available to the group communication server , such as being resident on the group communication server  or in a connected database , or possibly on another computer device, such as packet flow-control server  (as is common in network infrastructure).","The system  minimizes latency for direct group communications among a group of wireless telecommunication devices (set ) on a wireless network . Each wireless telecommunication device ,, is able to direct a single group communication stream to a designated group (such as all devices of set ) of the plurality of wireless telecommunication devices, and as further described herein, each wireless telecommunication device ,, selectively requests and then receiving an open dedicated broadcast channel for an outgoing communication from the wireless telecommunication device, which can include a direct communication stream. The communication server  that receives the single communication stream from a communicating wireless device typically creates a group communication to all wireless telecommunication devices ,, of the designated group.","The wireless telecommunication device ,, has a dormant state without an open dedicated traffic channel for communications therefrom, and an active state in which the wireless devices opens a dedicated traffic channel for an outgoing communication, to include a direct communication stream such as a PTT communication wherein the wireless telecommunication device further including a data store (such as local database  or memory  on the wireless device ) for the selectively buffering the initial communication data of a group communication stream, the initial communication data buffered at least while the wireless telecommunication device ,, changes from a dormant state to an active state with an open dedicated traffic channel. The wireless telecommunication device ,, sends the buffered initial group communication data after a predetermined period of time has elapsed, or can sends the buffered initial group communication data after an active dedicated traffic channel is opened. The data store (located at either the wireless device or the communication server ) further purges the buffered initial communication data upon interruption of the group communication stream, as described further below. Unless otherwise stated, the term \u201cbuffering\u201d in this application refers to buffering prior to transmission (as opposed to buffering prior to play-out or presentation at a vocoder).","There are typically one or more intermittent communication devices that bridge communication streams between the communication server  and the group of wireless telecommunication devices , as is shown in , and the communication server  can further determine which member wireless telecommunication devices are able to determine the best mode of communication with the wireless devices ,,. The communication server  will then direct the one or more intermittent communication devices to send data packets to those wireless telecommunication devices of the set .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["32","70","72","74","76","20","32","50","32"]},"The group communication server(s)  are connected to a wireless service providers packet data service node (PDSN) such as PSDN , shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PSDN  can interface with a base station controller  of a base station  through a packet control function (PCF) . The PCF  is typically located in the base station . The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a messaging service controller (\u201cMSC\u201d) . The carrier network  communicates with the MSC  by a network, the Internet and\/or POTS (\u201cplain ordinary telephone system\u201d). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the MSC  transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC  can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the branch-to-source (BTS)  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones ,,,, by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods known in the art.","In wireless devices that have designated a set  of group members, the wireless device can directly connect with the other member of the set and engage in voice and data communication. However, all such direct communications will occur through, or at the control of, the group communication server . All data packets of the devices do not necessarily have to travel through the group communication server  itself, but the server  must be able to ultimately control the communication because it will typically be the only server-side LAN  component that is aware of and\/or can retrieve the identity of the members of the set , or direct the identity of the members of the set  to another computer device.","In a PTT embodiment, the wireless system  allows a dispatch voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructure (CDMA, FDMA, GSM, etc.). In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (wireless devices ,,) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is broadcast to one or more \u201clisteners\u201d. A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a \u201cdispatch call.\u201d A call is an instantiation of a \u201cgroup,\u201d which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group ID. In the absence of a wireless multicast channel, each group is formed by the combination of separate point-to-point connections between each endpoint and group communication server(s)  assigned to manage the call.","Each region of the PTT infrastructure is deployed over a specific portion of the carrier packet data network. The group communication server(s)  within the region may be routing traffic between one or more PDSNs  in the carrier network . A \u201cdirect call\u201d is a call in which there are only two members, a call originator and a call target, that still use the PTT system. For this call type, the most challenging scenario for meeting performance requirements is the case when the direct call is placed with both the originator and target handset have dormant packet-data connections, i.e. the wireless devices ,, do not have an open dedicated channel. Conversely, the originator's and\/or the target's packet-data connection can be in the active state and dedicated traffic channels are available at the time the direct call is placed. The dormant-to-dormant scenario is the one that provides the greatest challenge in meeting performance requirements and preventing significant latency in call set up, as it more fully described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","78","12","14","80","14","14","82","20","80","84","84","84","86","84","88"]},"As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , with a graphics display, but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform as known in the art, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager with a graphics display, or even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local database  for storage of software applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk. The local database  or memory can comprise a data store for buffered direct group communication data. The wireless telephone typically will open a full duplex channel for telecommunication, and in some instances, will communicate via a half-duplex channel, only being able to talk or receive a voice stream.","In this embodiment of the wireless device , the computer platform  also includes a communication interface  that includes a direct communication interface  that can open the direct communication channel from the wireless device. The direct communication interface  can also be part of the standard communication interface for the wireless device which ordinarily carries the voice and data transmitted to and from the wireless device.

If the PTX Dormancy Response Timer is set to zero, the CM responds (essentially) immediately to the PTT request and the talker client experiences no additional delay as a result of dormancy wakeup other than the delay in re-establishing the talker's own traffic channel.","Nominally, in a typical PTT system, when a group is not dormant, the talker client receives a response to its PTT request within approximately 300 msec. However, on some systems during dormancy recovery, the PTT request cannot be sent until after the talker client's traffic channel is re-established. In such systems, there is typically a three second delay associated with re-establishing a dormant packet-data service option. Unless media is buffered at the talker client or communication server , the (talker) user experiences this delay as PTT latency.","To provide the user with essentially the same PTT latency experienced when a group is not dormant, in this embodiment, the talker client (such as wireless device ) buffers media when the user presses PTT in a dormant group and the client's packet data service is dormant. If the group is dormant but the client already has an active packet-data traffic channel when the user presses PTT, the client can immediately send the PTT grant and wait for a PTX response without buffering media. Media buffering might still take place at the CM, depending on the group's configuration. Here, the diagram assumes that the group is dormant and a traffic channel is not allocated. As shown in , at , the User presses PTT, and at , the client begins process of re-establishing a packet data traffic channel. At , the client alerts the user that the floor has been granted and begins buffering media. The alert should occur within approximately 300-500 msec of the user action. At , a dedicated traffic channel is formally re-established. The client the transmits the PTT request to a communication server . At , the client receives a PTX grant response from the communication server . At , the client begins streaming buffered media to the communication server . At , the talker client receives a PTX grant, alerts user, and begins streaming media to the communication server . At , the user releases the PTT button . At , the client finishes streaming buffered media to the communication server  and transmits PTT release to the communication server . At , the client receives a PTX confirm response from the communication server , thus indicating the end of the talk spurt.","Given that the group is dormant, the talker client will be denied the floor only if the talker user has listen-only privileges, a higher priority user interrupts before the PTX Dormancy Response Timer expires, or the talker user is the only user remaining as an active participant in the group. If the client has the capability to query the communication server  for a \u201clisten-only\u201d condition upon joining a group, the client could deny the user's PTT request locally without signaling the communication server  or attempting to re-establish a traffic channel.","It is possible for a user to have talker-privileges in a dormant group and press PTT expecting to be granted the floor only to eventually be denied the floor as a result of a higher-priority user being granted the floor before the group's PTX Dormancy Response Timer expires. This type of interruption can only occur if the PTX Dormancy Response Timer is non-zero. If PTT latency during dormancy wakeup is a concern, the PTX Dormancy Response Timer should be configured to zero to take full advantage of communication server  media buffering and this case can be avoided.","If the user releases PTT before a PTX response is received from the communication server , the talker client must hold the buffered talk-spurt until a PTX response is received or the request fails. If a PTX grant response is received, the talk-spurt is streamed to the communication server  normally. If such request fails or a PTX deny is received after the user's release, the talk-spurt must be aborted. Talker clients must be prepared to handle various exceptional events while the user believes s\/he has control of the group's floor. A talker client can receive an asynchronous PTX which ends an in-progress talk-spurt (after a PTX grant has been received) typically in at least two circumstances: The talker holds the floor past the group's Failsafe Timer, or the talker is interrupted by a higher-priority user. In these cases, the talker client must abort the talk-spurt by alerting the user of the exceptional condition, stop streaming media to the communication server , and transition back to the dormant state.","It should be noted that buffering media at the talker client introduces the potential for a talk-spurt to be aborted prior to or without ever receiving a PTX grant. If the talker user is talking when the abort occurs, the talker client can alert the user via the same or similar mechanism used when media is not being buffered. The user experience is similar to being interrupted, although the user might have the expectation that all of the speech spoken prior to the alert has been distributed to the group, when in fact a smaller portion (and possibly none) of the talk-spurt might have been distributed.","Talk-spurt aborts occurring prior to receipt of a PTX grant should be rare. It is very unlikely that clients will buffer enough media to extend a talk-spurt past the group's Failsafe Timer. In fact, it is possible to avoid this situation entirely by configuring the group's Failsafe Timer to a value that exceeds the client's buffering capacity. This assumes that clients transmit buffered media at the same rate at which it was collected. In practicality, media buffers will mostly be relatively small compared to the anticipated length of the maximum allowed talk-spurt. However, it is possible that if two or more users begin a talk-spurt at approximately the same time when a group is dormant, and if the users do not have equal priority and the lower priority user is initially granted the floor, the lower-priority user could experience a talk-spurt abort as described above.","Nominally, clients deliver media for transmission at the same rate at which media is collected; in other words, one packet containing 20 b msec vocoder frames is transmitted every 20 msec. Clients should transmit buffered media at this same rate. Due to the presence of signaling traffic and other delays, it is possible that clients will introduce some jitter to the media at transmission. When a variable-rate vocoder is used, it is also possible that clients transfer media at sustained rates that are faster than one frame every 20 msec since the variable-rate media data-rate (with aggregated headers) is lower than the capacity of the corresponding traffic channel. To avoid overwhelming listener client traffic channels and play-out buffers, talker clients should not make sustained media transmissions at rates faster than the nominal one frame every 20 msec frame-rate. Similarly, the communication server  should rebroadcast media at the same rate at which it was received, on average.","In one embodiment, the client memory  must be reserved to implement media buffering. The maximum size of this buffer determines the maximum amount of time the client can buffer media while waiting to receive a PTX grant. For example, if the client encapsulates five vocoder frames per UDP datagram every 100 msec, the client encapsulates vocoder frames using RTP, each UDP payload would be comprised of five half-rate vocoder frames (85 bytes total, 17 bytes each), a media header (1 byte), one RTP header (12 bytes), for a total of 98 bytes every 100 msec. Thus, if the client buffered an RTP header with each RTP media payload, a buffering data rate of 980 bytes\/sec or 7840 bps would be generated. To survive an anticipated worst-case delay of 10 seconds between prompting the user to talk and receiving a PTX response from the CM, a buffer of 9800 bytes would be required at the client. Further savings in buffer memory can be achieved if the client does not buffer RTP and media headers with the vocoder frames, at the expense of a slightly more complex client implementation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["88","78","120","122","88","124","14","16","18","126"]},"A determination is then made as to whether the active traffic channel has been opened to the wireless device ,,, as shown at decision .
