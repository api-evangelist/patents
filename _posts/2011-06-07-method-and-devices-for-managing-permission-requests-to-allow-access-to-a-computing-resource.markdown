{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Embodiments described herein relate generally to controlling access to computing resources by applications executing on a computing device.","When executing an application on a computing device, the application may access functionality provided by a computing resource on the computing device. For example, a computing resource may include a camera with which photographic operations may be performed, or a Global Positioning System (GPS) subsystem which may indicate the physical location of the computing device. To prevent unauthorized access to certain computing resources on the computing device by, for example, third-party applications, the device may be configured to request permission to access the computing resources from a user before allowing an application to access the computing resource.","An application developer may disclose the computing resources that the developer's application may access when the application is executed on a computing device, by identifying those computing resources in an installation manifest. This installation manifest can then be provided to computing devices upon which the application is to be installed. The installation manifest may be read when the application is being installed at a given computing device, so that, for each of one or more of the computing resources identified in the installation manifest, a permission request to access the computing resource can be displayed to the user before the application is executed.","An application may request access to numerous computing resources. In turn, this may cause numerous permission requests for access to the computing resources to be displayed to the user. A user may feel frustrated or confused with the many permission requests presented to them.","When installing an application that accesses many computing resources, a user may be presented with a large number of permission requests. To process these requests, the user may have to assess the potential security risk involved with permitting the application access to each of the requested resources. The user may, as a result, have to spend time to understand and investigate the type of computing resource that access is being requested for. This may overwhelm and frustrate a user.","In an attempt to quicken the installation process, in some instances, the user may simply choose to allow access to all the requested computing resources. Such a decision may pose security concerns, as some applications might access a computing resource for nefarious purposes.","For at least this reason, it may be desirable to highlight or distinguish permission requests that are atypical in some way (and therefore, may present a higher security risk), so that extra attention can be drawn to these permission requests.","In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, there are provided methods and devices for identifying computer resources that are commonly accessed for an application category that an application belongs to. When an application then requests access to resources that are not common to the application category, these permission requests may then be flagged for the user so it can be scrutinized by the user with more care.","In one broad aspect, there is provided a method of managing permission requests to allow access to computing resources on a computing device, the method comprising: for an application to be installed on the computing device, determining an application category that the application is associated with, and retrieving a common permissions list for the application category, wherein the common permissions list identifies at least one computing resource that applications associated with the application category are configured to access; during an installation of the application on the computing device, determining, using data from a source other than the common permissions list, one or more computing resources on the computing device that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device; determining which computing resources, of the one or more computing resources on the computing device that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device, are not identified in the common permissions list; and for each computing resource that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device that is not identified in the common permissions list, providing, in a user interface of the computing device, a first permission request to allow the application to access the computing resource.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises: for each computing resource that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device that is identified in the common permissions list, providing, in the user interface of the computing device, a second permission request to allow the application to access the computing resource; wherein the first permission request is visually distinguishable, when displayed in the user interface of the computing device, from the second permission request.","In some embodiments, the first permission request is displayed more prominently than the second permission request. In some embodiments, at least one of highlighting, warning language, or markings, is applied to the first permission request but not to the second permission request, so that the first permission request is displayed more prominently than the second permission request in the user interface.","In some embodiments, the source other than the common permissions list comprises an installation manifest associated with the application, wherein the installation manifest identifies the one or more computing resources on the computing device that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises: downloading the installation manifest to the computing device.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises downloading, to the computing device, the application to be installed on the computing device.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises, for each computing resource that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device that is not identified in the common permissions list, allowing the application to access the computing resource if the first permission request for the computing resource is accepted.","In some embodiments, the determining an application category that the application is associated with comprises receiving a user-assigned application category as input via the user interface of the computing device.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises receiving data from an application server to determine the application category that the application is associated with.","In some embodiments, the common permissions list is retrieved from an application server.","In some embodiments, the application category is used by the application server as a basis for organizing applications available for purchase in an application store, and wherein the application category that the application is associated with is determined based on a categorization of the application in the application store.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises: determining that the application is associated with a user-assigned application category on the computing device; and transmitting data to the application server, wherein the data notifies the application server that the application has been associated with the user-assigned application category on the computing device.","In some embodiments, the common permissions list is retrieved from an enterprise server.","In some embodiments, the common permissions list is provided in a security policy.","In another broad aspect, there is provided a computing device configured to manage permission requests to allow access to computing resources on the computing device, wherein the computing device comprises a processor configured to: for an application to be installed on the computing device, determine an application category that the application is associated with, and retrieve a common permissions list for the application category, wherein the common permissions list identifies at least one computing resource that applications associated with the application category are configured to access; during an installation of the application on the computing device, determine, using data from a source other than the common permissions list, one or more computing resources on the computing device that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device; determine which computing resources, of the one or more computing resources on the computing device that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device, are not identified in the common permissions list; and for each computing resource that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device that is not identified in the common permissions list, provide, in a user interface of the computing device, a first permission request to allow the application to access the computing resource.","In some embodiments, the computing device comprises a mobile device.","In another broad aspect, there is provided a computer-readable medium comprising instructions which, when executed by a processor of a computing device, cause the processor to perform a method of managing permission requests to allow access to computing resources on the computing device, an wherein the method comprises: for an application to be installed on the computing device, determining an application category that the application is associated with, and retrieving a common permissions list for the application category, wherein the common permissions list identifies at least one computing resource that applications associated with the application category are configured to access;

and for each computing resource that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device that is not identified in the common permissions list, providing, in a user interface of the computing device, a first permission request to allow the application to access the computing resource.","In another broad aspect, there is provided a method of identifying at least one computing resource that applications associated with an application category are configured to access on a computing device, the method comprising: determining a plurality of applications associated with the application category; for each of the plurality of applications associated with the application category, determining, using data from a source other than a common permissions list for the application category, which computing resources the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device; for each of at least one computing resource, computing how many of the plurality of applications associated with the application category are configured to access the computing resource, and identifying the computing resource in the common permissions list for the application category if the number exceeds a predefined threshold.","In some embodiments, the method is performed at an application server.","In some embodiments, the application category is used by the application server as a basis for organizing applications that are available for purchase in an application store, and wherein for each of the plurality of applications associated with the application category, the application category that the application is associated with is determined based on a categorization of the application in the application store.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises transmitting the common permissions list for the application category to the computing device.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises, for at least one of the plurality of applications, transmitting, to the computing device, data usable by the computing device to determine the application category that the application is associated with.","In some embodiments, for each of the plurality of applications associated with the application category, the source other than the common permissions list comprises an installation manifest associated with the application, wherein the installation manifest identifies the plurality of computing resources on the computing device that the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises: for each of a plurality of computing devices, receiving, from each computing device, data indicating that an identified application of the plurality of applications has been associated with a user-assigned application category on the computing device; and changing an association of the identified application to the user-assigned application category, if data indicating that the identified application of the plurality of applications has been associated with the user-assigned application category is received from at least a predefined number of computing devices.","In another broad aspect, there is provided a computing device configured to identify at least one computing resource that applications associated with an application category are configured to access on a computing device, the computing device comprising a processor configured to: determine a plurality of applications associated with the application category; for each of the plurality of applications associated with the application category, determine, using data from a source other than a common permissions list for the application category, which computing resources the application is configured to access when the application is executed on the computing device; for each of at least one computing resource, compute how many of the plurality of applications associated with the application category are configured to access the computing resource, and identify the computing resource in the common permissions list for the application category if the number exceeds a predefined threshold.","In another broad aspect, there is provided a computer-readable medium comprising instructions which, when executed by a processor of a computing device, cause the processor to perform a method of identifying at least one computing resource that applications associated with an application category are configured to access on a computing device, the method comprising: determining a plurality of applications associated with the application category;

The mobile device (sometimes referred to alternatively as a \u201cmobile station\u201d or \u201cportable electronic device\u201d) may comprise a two-way communication device with advanced data communication capabilities having the capability to communicate with other computer systems and devices. The mobile device may include the capability for voice communications, data communications or a combination of the two. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device, it may be referred to as a smartphone, a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a media player (such as an MP3 player), an electronic book reader or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). Although a mobile device is described herein by way of illustration, embodiments described herein may be applicable to other computing devices other than mobile devices. For example, embodiments described herein may be applied to other computing platforms that guard resources with permission access requests in variant implementations.","Referring now to  specifically, a block diagram of a mobile device  in one example implementation is shown generally. Mobile device  comprises a number of components, the controlling component being microprocessor . Microprocessor  controls the overall operation of mobile device . In some embodiments, certain communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through communication subsystem . Communication subsystem  receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network .","In this example implementation of mobile device , communication subsystem  may be configured for cellular communication in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards. The GSM\/GPRS wireless network is used worldwide and it is expected that other standards such as Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) may be employed. These standards are mentioned as examples only, and other standards may be employed on computing devices to which embodiments described herein are applied.","New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the described embodiments are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting communication subsystem  with network  represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM\/GPRS communications. With newer network protocols, these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.","The wireless network associated with mobile device  may comprise a GSM\/GPRS wireless network in one example implementation of mobile device ; however, other wireless networks may also be associated with mobile device  in variant implementations. Different types of wireless networks that may be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks, GSM\/GPRS networks (as mentioned above), and n-generation (e.g. 2.5G, 3G, 3.5G, 4G, etc.) networks like EDGE, UMTS, High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA), and Long Term Evolution (LTE), etc. Some older examples of data-centric networks include the Mobitex\u2122 Radio Network and the DataTAC\u2122 Radio Network. Examples of older voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems.","Microprocessor  also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) , flash memory , display , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystem , serial port , keyboard , one or more speakers , microphone , short-range communication subsystem  and other device subsystems .","Some of the subsystems of mobile device  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. By way of example, display  and keyboard  may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over network , and device-resident functions such as a calculator, media player or task list. Operating system software used by microprocessor  is typically stored in a persistent store such as flash memory , which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system, specific device applications (illustrated as applications  in , below), or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as RAM .","In some embodiments, mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over network  after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of a mobile device . To identify a subscriber, mobile device  may require a Subscriber Identity Module or \u201cSIM\u201d card  to be inserted in a SIM interface  in order to communicate with a network. SIM  is one type of a conventional \u201csmart card\u201d used to identify a subscriber of mobile device  and to personalize the mobile device , among other things. Without SIM , mobile device  is not fully operational for communication with network .","By inserting SIM  into SIM interface , a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services could include: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voice mail, Short Message Service (SMS), media transfers (such as music downloading or streaming), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More advanced services may include: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. SIM  includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once SIM  is inserted in SIM interface , it is coupled to microprocessor . In order to identify the subscriber, SIM  contains some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). An advantage of using SIM  is that subscribers are not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. SIM  may store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information. In certain embodiments SIM  may be a different type of user identifier and may be integral to mobile device  or not present at all. By way of further examples, a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), eUICC (Embedded UICC), Removable User Identify Module (R-UIM), CDMA Subscriber Identify Module (CSIM), or Universal Subscriber Identify Module (USIM) may be employed.","Mobile device  includes a power pack that supplies power to electronic components and that supports portability. The power pack may be of any type, but for clarity it will be assumed that mobile device  is a battery-powered device and includes a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . Battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists battery  in providing power V+ to mobile device . Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells may provide the power to mobile device .","Microprocessor , in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software applications on mobile device . A set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed in flash memory  (or other non-volatile storage) on mobile device  during its manufacture.","Additional applications may also be loaded onto mobile device  through network , auxiliary I\/O subsystem , serial port , short-range communications subsystem , or the other device subsystems . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using mobile device . Numerous other types of applications may be loaded onto mobile device  or other computing devices, including without limitation, messaging applications (e.g. e-mail, text, instant, video, etc.), voice communication applications, calendar applications, address book applications, utility applications, browser application, media player (e.g. audio, video, etc.) applications, social network applications, camera applications, gaming applications, productivity applications, etc.","Serial port  enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to mobile device  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto mobile device  through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication.","It should be noted that the term \u201cdownload\u201d and forms thereof as used herein, in the specification and in the claims, are used generally to describe a transfer of data from one system to another, and is not intended to be limiting with regards to the origin or destination of the transfer, for example. Accordingly, where the term \u201cdownload\u201d and forms thereof are used in the specification and in the claims, it is intended to encompass other forms of transfers including, for example, an \u201cupload\u201d or a \u201csideload\u201d of data (e.g. a Universal Serial Bus (USB) sideload).","Short-range communications subsystem  provides for wireless device connections to enable communication between mobile device  and different systems or devices, without the use of network . For example, subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short range communication would include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth, and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.","In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by communication subsystem  and input to microprocessor . Microprocessor  will then process the received signal for output to display  or alternatively to auxiliary I\/O subsystem . A subscriber may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using keyboard  in conjunction with display  and possibly auxiliary I\/O subsystem . Auxiliary I\/O subsystem  may include devices such as: a touch screen, mouse, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller wheel with a dynamic button pressing capability. Further, auxiliary I\/O subsystem  may comprise a two-dimensional navigation (or scrolling) component, such as a track ball, a joystick or a directional pad, each optionally with a dynamic button pressing capability. Keyboard  is an alphanumeric keyboard and\/or telephone-type keypad. A composed item may be transmitted over network  through communication subsystem .","For voice communications, the overall operation of mobile device  is substantially similar, except that the received signals would be output to the one or more speakers , and signals for transmission would be generated by microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on mobile device . Although voice or other audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the one or more speakers , display  may also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. Microphone  can receive a supply of power, in the form of a bias voltage and bias current, from the rechargeable battery . Different types and configurations of microphone  can be incorporated into the mobile device .","Referring now to  specifically, a block diagram of the communication subsystem  of  is shown. Communication subsystem  comprises a receiver , a transmitter , one or more embedded or internal antenna elements , , Local Oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) .","The particular design of communication subsystem  is dependent upon the network  in which mobile device  is intended to operate, thus it should be understood that the design illustrated in  serves only as one example. Signals received by antenna  through network  are input to receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, by DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over network  via antenna . DSP  not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in receiver  and transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in DSP .","The wireless link between mobile device  and a network  may contain one or more different channels, typically different RF channels, and associated protocols used between mobile device  and network . A RF channel is a limited resource that must be conserved, typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of mobile device .","When mobile device  is fully operational, transmitter  is typically keyed or turned on only when it is sending to network  and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly, receiver  is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated time periods.","Referring now to  specifically, a block diagram of a node of a wireless network is shown as . In practice, network  comprises one or more nodes . Mobile device  communicates with a node  within wireless network . In the example implementation of , node  is configured in accordance with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) technologies. Node  includes a base station controller (BSC)  with an associated tower station , a Packet Control Unit (PCU)  added for GPRS support in GSM, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) , a Home Location Register (HLR) , a Visitor Location Registry (VLR) , a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) , a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) , and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) . This list of components is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the components of every node  within a GSM\/GPRS network, but rather a list of components that are commonly used in communications through network .","In a GSM network, MSC  is coupled to BSC  and to a landline network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through PCU , SGSN  and GGSN  to the public or private network (Internet)  (also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure) represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities, BSC  also contains a Packet Control Unit (PCU)  that connects to SGSN  to control segmentation, radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track mobile device location and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management, HLR  is shared between MSC  and SGSN . Access to VLR  is controlled by MSC .","Station  is a fixed transceiver station. Station  and BSC  together form the fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a \u201ccell\u201d. The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell via station . The fixed transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encoding and\/or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the mobile device in accordance with particular, usually predetermined, communication protocols and parameters, under control of its controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts, if necessary, any communication signals received from mobile device  within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters may vary between different nodes. For example, one node may employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.","For all mobile devices  registered with a specific network, permanent configuration data such as a user profile is stored in HLR . HLR  also contains location information for each registered mobile device and can be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. MSC  is responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of the mobile devices currently in its area of responsibility in VLR . Further VLR  also contains information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in VLR  includes part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from HLR  to VLR  for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote HLR  node to VLR , the amount of traffic between these nodes can be reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response times and at the same time requiring less use of computing resources.","SGSN  and GGSN  are elements added for GPRS support; namely packet switched data support, within GSM. SGSN  and MSC  have similar responsibilities within wireless network  by keeping track of the location of each mobile device . SGSN  also performs security functions and access control for data traffic on network . GGSN  provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSN's  via an Internet Protocol (IP) backbone network operated within the network . During normal operations, a given mobile device  must perform a \u201cGPRS Attach\u201d to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This requirement is not present in circuit switched voice channels as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently, all GPRS capable networks use private, dynamically assigned IP addresses, thus requiring a DHCP server  connected to the GGSN . There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP assignment, including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server and DHCP server.","Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a logical connection is established from a mobile device , through PCU , and SGSN  to an Access Point Node (APN) within GGSN . The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN also represents a security mechanism for network , insofar as each mobile device  must be assigned to one or more APNs and mobile devices  cannot exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN may be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as \u201cmyconnection.wireless.com\u201d.","Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a tunnel is created and all traffic is exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case with some IPSecurity (IPsec) connections used with Virtual Private Networks (VPN). These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol (PDP) Contexts and there are a limited number of these available in the network . To maximize use of the PDP Contexts, network  will run an idle timer for each PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a mobile device  is not using its PDP Context, the PDP Context can be deallocated and the IP address returned to the IP address pool managed by DHCP server .","The public or private network  may also provide access to a host system .","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating components of a host system in one example configuration is shown. Host system  will typically be a corporate office or other local area network (LAN), but may instead be a home office computer or some other private system, for example, in variant implementations. In this example shown in , host system  is depicted as a LAN of an organization to which a user of mobile device  belongs.","LAN  comprises a number of network components connected to each other by LAN connections . For instance, a user's desktop computer with an accompanying cradle  for the user's mobile device  is situated on LAN . Cradle  for mobile device  may be coupled to computer by a serial or a USB connection, for example. Other user computers are also situated on LAN , and each may or may not be equipped with an accompanying cradle  for a mobile device. Cradle  facilitates the loading of information (e.g. PIM data, private symmetric encryption keys to facilitate secure communications between mobile device  and LAN ) from user computer to mobile device , and may be particularly useful for bulk information updates often performed in initializing mobile device  for use. The information downloaded to mobile device  may include certificates used in the exchange of messages. It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that user computers , will typically be also connected to other peripheral devices not explicitly shown in .","Embodiments described herein relate generally to control of applications (e.g. ). Accordingly, only a subset of network components of LAN  are shown in  for ease of exposition, and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that LAN  will comprise additional components not explicitly shown in , for this example configuration. More generally, LAN  may represent a smaller part of a larger network [not shown] of the organization, and may comprise different components and\/or be arranged in different topologies than that shown in the example of .","In this example, mobile device  communicates with LAN  through a node  of wireless network  and a shared network infrastructure  such as a service provider network or the public Internet. Access to LAN  may be provided through one or more routers [not shown], and computing devices of LAN  may operate from behind a firewall or proxy server .","In a variant implementation, LAN  comprises a wireless VPN router [not shown] to facilitate data exchange between the LAN  and mobile device . The concept of a wireless VPN router is new in the wireless industry and implies that a VPN connection can be established directly through a specific wireless network to mobile device . The possibility of using a wireless VPN router has only recently been available and could be used when the new Internet Protocol (IP) Version 6 (IPV6) arrives into IP-based wireless networks. This new protocol will provide enough IP addresses to dedicate an IP address to every mobile device, making it possible to push information to a mobile device at any time. An advantage of using a wireless VPN router is that it could be an off-the-shelf VPN component, not requiring a separate wireless gateway and separate wireless infrastructure to be used. A VPN connection would preferably be a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/IP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/IP connection to deliver the messages directly to mobile device  in this variant implementation.","Secure communication protocols rely on public and private encryption keys to provide confidentiality and integrity, and on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to communicate information that provides authentication and authorization. Data encrypted using a private key of a private key\/public key pair can only be decrypted using the corresponding public key of the pair, and vice-versa. Private key information is never made public, whereas public key information is shared.","For example, if a sender wishes to send a message to a recipient in encrypted form, the recipient's public key is used to encrypt a message, which can then be decrypted only using the recipient's private key. Alternatively, in some encoding techniques, a one-time session key is generated and used to encrypt the body of a message, typically with a symmetric encryption technique (e.g. Triple DES). The session key is then encrypted using the recipient's public key (e.g. with a public key encryption algorithm such as RSA), which can then be decrypted only using the recipient's private key. The decrypted session key can then be used to decrypt the message body. The message header may be used to specify the particular encryption scheme that must be used to decrypt the message. Other encryption techniques based on public key cryptography may be used in variant implementations. However, in each of these cases, only the recipient's private key may be used to facilitate decryption of the message, and in this way, the confidentiality of messages can be maintained.","As a further example, a sender may sign a message using a digital signature. A digital signature is a digest of the message (e.g. a hash of the message) encrypted using the sender's private key, which can then be appended to the outgoing message. To verify the signature of the message when received, the recipient uses the same technique as the sender (e.g. using the same standard hash algorithm) to obtain a digest of the received message. The recipient also uses the sender's public key to decrypt the digital signature, in order to obtain what should be a matching digest for the received message. If the digests of the received message do not match, this suggests that either the message content was changed during transport and\/or the message did not originate from the sender whose public key was used for verification. By verifying a digital signature in this way, authentication of the sender and message integrity can be maintained.","An encoded message may be encrypted, signed, or both encrypted and signed. The authenticity of public keys used in these operations is validated using certificates. A certificate is a digital document issued by a certificate authority (CA). Certificates are used to authenticate the association between users and their public keys, and essentially, provides a level of trust in the authenticity of the users' public keys. Certificates contain information about the certificate holder, with certificate contents typically formatted in accordance with an accepted standard (e.g. X.509).","For a public key to be trusted, its issuing organization must be trusted. The relationship between a trusted CA and a user's public key can be represented by a series of related certificates, also referred to as a certificate chain. The certificate chain can be followed to determine the validity of a certificate.","Certificate servers store information about certificates and lists identifying certificates that have been revoked. These certificate servers can be accessed to obtain certificates and to verify certificate authenticity and revocation status. For example, a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server may be used to obtain certificates, and an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server may be used to verify certificate revocation status.","User computers , can obtain certificates from a number of sources, for storage on computers , and\/or mobile devices (e.g. mobile device ). These certificate sources may be private (e.g. dedicated for use within an organization) or public, may reside locally or remotely, and may be accessible from within an organization's private network or through the Internet, for example. In the example shown in , multiple PKI servers  associated with the organization reside on LAN . PKI servers  include a CA server  for issuing certificates, an LDAP server  used to search for and download certificates (e.g. for individuals within the organization), and an OCSP server  used to verify the revocation status of certificates.","Certificates may be retrieved from LDAP server  by a user computer , for example, to be downloaded to mobile device  via cradle . However, in a variant implementation, LDAP server  may be accessed directly (i.e. \u201cover the air\u201d in this context) by mobile device , and mobile device  may search for and retrieve individual certificates through a mobile data server . Similarly, mobile data server  may be adapted to allow mobile device  to directly query OCSP server  to verify the revocation status of certificates.","In variant implementations, only selected PKI servers  may be made accessible to mobile devices (e.g. allowing certificates to be downloaded only from a user's computer , , while allowing the revocation status of certificates to be checked from mobile device ).","In variant implementations, certain PKI servers  may be made accessible only to mobile devices registered to particular users, as specified by an IT administrator, possibly in accordance with an IT policy, for example.","Other sources of certificates [not shown] may include a Windows certificate store, another secure certificate store on or outside LAN , and smart cards, for example.","Applications  executable on a mobile device  may be stored on an application server . Application server  may have an application database [not shown] that stores applications  for download and execution on the mobile device . To have access to the applications  stored on the application server , each user may have a user account managed by the application server . Access to the application server  may be provided via a client application operating on mobile device , although in variant embodiments, access to the application server may be provided through a web browser, for example.","As illustrated, the application server  may comprise an internal network server of the host system  used to store applications  to be deployed to the organization's mobile devices . In a variant embodiment, the application server  may additionally or alternatively provide an application store or application market that is accessible from the mobile device . The application store may allow users of a mobile device  to search for, purchase, and download applications  to their mobile device . In some embodiments, the application server  may reside outside of the host system , on a remote system accessible via the public or private network , for example.","For ease of understanding the described embodiments related to application control,  further illustrates a simplified view of a subset of components of the mobile device  described above. The mobile device  may run software applications  (sometimes referred to simply as \u201capps\u201d) that access computing resources on the mobile device . Applications may be stored in the flash memory  of the mobile device  or other persistent store, and may access computing resources available on the mobile device  when executed. Access may be in the form of the applications invoking application programming interfaces (APIs) made available by the OS to access the computing resources, for example.","Computing resources may be associated with a hardware component (e.g., sensors, radios, or peripherals described above) or software module (e.g., ones that provide access to data or communication buses described above), and may be made accessible to the application  via an API provided by the operating system (OS) of the mobile device . For example, the mobile device  may allow applications to access a GPS subsystem  that is capable of determining the physical location of the mobile device , or a camera subsystem  that is capable of capturing photographs or video. Other accessible resources may include access to software functionality (e.g., encryption services) or data (e.g., phone book entries) available on the mobile device , for example.","An installation manifest [not explicitly shown in ] that identifies the computing resources that an application  may access when the application is executed on mobile device , may be associated with the application . Accordingly, when a given computing resource is identified in an installation manifest associated with an application, the application is configured to access the computing resource, and the user can expect that computing resource to be accessed by the application, though not necessarily in every single instance when the application executes. Conversely, when the installation manifest associated with the application fails to identify the computing resource as a resource that the application will access on the computing device when the application is executed, then the application is not configured to access the computing resource.","The installation manifest may be uploaded with the application  to the application server  from a developer device by the application developer. The installation manifest may be stored with the application  on the application server , and subsequently provided with an application being downloaded to mobile device .","A software or application developer creating the application may include the installation manifest in an application manifest that describes the application , and may be specifically formatted for the operating system (OS) that the application  is intended to be executed on. For example, the application manifest may be a property list (plist) file for the iOS operating system, or an AndroidManifest.xml file in the Android operating system in some implementations. The application manifest may be stored in an XML format.","Referring to , a flowchart diagram illustrating the interaction and sequence of events between an application server and a mobile device, in accordance with at least one embodiment, is shown generally as . For convenience, embodiments herein are described in the context of the mobile device  shown in .","To more clearly illustrate the acts of , an example scenario of installing an application entitled \u2018CycleNation\u2019 on a mobile device: \u2018Bob's device\u2019 will be discussed. Reference will simultaneously be made to , which show examples of visual output involving this example scenario.","At , the application server  determines a plurality of applications  associated with an application category.","In some embodiments, the applications  may be assigned to an application category by a system administrator of the organization. As a part of the system administrator's duties to keep devices and users safe, the administrator may desire to group applications together so as to be able to administer their security privileges together.","Additionally or alternatively, the application category may be used by the application server  as a basis for organizing applications  that are available for purchase in an application store. In this case, the plurality of applications  associated with the application category is determined based on a categorization of the application in the application store. For example, the application store may provide application categories for \u2018Productivity\u2019, \u2018Games\u2019, or \u2018Leisure\u2019, so that users of the mobile device  will be able to more easily find applications that perform the functionality that they are seeking.","Accordingly, in at least one embodiment, applications are associated with application categories at  in advance of the download of those applications to computing devices (e.g. mobile device ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["630","402","620","402","402","402","402"],"i":["a","b. "]},"Referring again to , at , the application server  may determine which computing resources each application  associated with an application category is configured to access when the application  is executed on the mobile device . In at least one embodiment, this determination will be performed using data from a source other than the common permissions list for the application category (which, as discussed below, is a list, generated in accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, of computing resources that are commonly accessed for applications associated with the application category).","For example, in some embodiments, the source of data for determining which computing resources each application  belonging to the application category is configured to access may be the installation manifest associated with the respective application . As noted above, the installation manifest may indicate the computing resources that an application  is configured to access when the application  is executed, and may be provided by an application developer, when uploading an application  to the application server , for example.","At , for each of at least one computing resource identified as being configured to be accessed by an application belonging to the application category, the application server  may compute how many of a plurality of applications  associated with the application category are configured to access the computing resource. This may involve the application server  maintaining a counter of the number of applications that have indicated (e.g., through their respective installation manifests) that they may access the computing resource during execution.","At , the application server  may identify computing resources in a \u201ccommon permissions list\u201d for the application category. The common permissions list is generated (e.g. by the application server ), after identifying the computing resources that are accessed by multiple applications associated with a particular application category, to indicate those computing resources that are commonly accessed by the applications associated with the application category. In some embodiments, a particular computing resource will only be added to the common permissions list if a minimum number of applications  in the application category is determined to be configured to access that computing resource (e.g. based on the installation manifests for those applications ). A determination may be made to verify that the number of applications  in the application category that is determined to be configured to access that computing resource meets or exceeds a predefined threshold. The threshold value may be dynamic\u2014i.e., in addition to setting a threshold that is a static value, the threshold may be based on a minimum percentage or frequency of the applications  associated with the application category, in some embodiments.","In the example scenario, the application server  may determine that a large number of applications  in the \u2018Leisure\u2019 application category  access the \u2018web-browsing\u2019 and the \u2018location-based services\u2019 computing resources. This may be the case, for example, because a minimum threshold number of applications in the \u2018Leisure\u2019 category access the website of their application developers, and require the physical location of the mobile device . These two resources may then be identified on a common permission list to be generated and associated with the \u2018Leisure\u2019 application category , to indicate that these two resources are commonly accessed by applications  in that application category.","It should be noted that in some cases (e.g., when the application server  provides an application store), the number of applications  associated with an application category may not be static. For example, new applications  may get uploaded to the application server , existing applications  may get updated with new functionality that access new computing resources, and\/or applications  may be re-categorized under a different application category. Therefore, in some embodiments, the acts performed by the application server  may periodically be repeated to update the common permission list for an application category, to better ensure that the common permission list is an accurate representation of the common computing resources accessed by applications in an application category at any given time.","In some embodiments, no computing resources may be added to a common permissions list unless there are a sufficient number of applications in the application category (e.g., the total number of applications  being considered and are associated with an application category meets or exceeds a pre-defined threshold number).","Once the common permissions list for an application category has been generated, the common permissions list can be transmitted by the application server  to the mobile device  so that it can be used by the mobile device  to identify uncommon or atypical permission requests for applications  associated with that application category.","The actions performed at the mobile device  in accordance with at least one embodiment, will now be discussed in greater detail.","Referring again to , at , the mobile device  may download an application  from the application server , the application  being transmitted to the mobile device  at .","At , the mobile device  may download the installation manifest associated with application  from the application server , the installation manifest being transmitted to the mobile device  at . In some embodiments, the installation manifest and the application  may be downloaded together (e.g. in a bundled package). As previously noted, the installation manifest may identify one or more computing resources on the mobile device  that the application is configured to access when the application  is executed on the mobile device .","For example, continuing with the example scenario described earlier, the user \u2018Bob\u2019 viewing the number of applications  in the \u2018Leisure\u2019 category (see ) may decide to select the \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 application for download to his mobile device .","At , the mobile device  may download data from the application server  that is used to determine an application category that the application  is associated with, the data being transmitted by the application server  at .","For example, this data may form part of the earlier-described application manifest describing the application  that may also be downloaded to the mobile device  (act not explicitly shown). An application manifest may indicate the application category for an application  to indicate where the application  should appear in an application store.","In another embodiment, the data usable by the mobile device  to determine the application category of an application  may be provided in a security policy provided by an administrator desiring to provide permissions for groups of applications .","In another embodiment, a user-assigned application category may be defined at the mobile device  by the user, through the user interface. For example, the user-assigned application category may comprise the folder or categorization (e.g., a tab in a home screen providing multiple tabs to categorize applications  on a mobile device ) that a user associates the downloaded application with. The mobile device  may then prompt the user when downloading the application  to determine how to categorize the downloaded application (e.g., prompting the user with the question, \u201cwhere would you like to save this application?\u201d). In this embodiment, data need not be received from the application server at , or the user may choose to receive a category suggestion based on received data at  and then override the category suggestion with a user-assigned application category.","At , the mobile device  may use the data downloaded at , for example, (or alternatively, a user-assigned application category) to determine an application category that the application is associated with.","In the example scenario, an application manifest associated with the \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 application provides data that indicates that the \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 application belongs to the \u2018Leisure\u2019 category, and this data is used by the mobile device  to determine that the \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 application is associated with the \u2018Leisure\u2019 category.","At , the mobile device  retrieves a common permissions list for the application category determined at  from the application server , the common permissions list being transmitted by the application server  to the mobile device  at . The common permissions list may identify at least one computing resource that applications associated with the determined application category are configured to access. The common permission list may be provided, for example, in a file that is downloaded to the mobile device . In another embodiment, data in the common permission list may form part of some other data transmitted from the application server  to the mobile device . The common permission list may be received at the mobile device  with the application downloaded at , the installation manifest downloaded at , and\/or the data downloaded at  in some embodiments. The common permission list may be received at the mobile device  in advance of the application being downloaded to the mobile device  and stored at the mobile device  for future use, in variant embodiments.","In the example scenario, the common permissions list for the \u2018Leisure\u2019 category may be transmitted from the application server  to \u2018Bob's device\u2019 .","In some embodiments, the common permissions list may be retrieved from a different server unrelated to the application server . This different server may comprise an enterprise server or a third-party server, for example.","In variant embodiments, the common permissions list may be provided for in a security policy. This may be the case, for example, if the applications  associated with the application category are identified by a system administrator.","In variant embodiments, the common permission list may periodically be updated at the application server  to reflect a current makeup of the applications  associated with the application category. The application server  may periodically transmit the updated common permission list to the mobile device  (not shown in FIG. ). This may increase the likelihood that uncommon permission requests for computing resources by applications associated with a given category will be correctly identified at a given time.","At , when installing the application  at the mobile device , the mobile device  may determine one or more computing resources on the computing device that the application  is configured to access when the application  is executed on the computing device. For example, the installation manifest associated with the application  may be read to determine what the application developer indicates as a resource that is configured to be accessed by the application. Persons skilled in the art will understand that this act is to be performed using data from a source other than the common permissions list, as the data is used as basis for comparison with data in the common permissions list.","In the example scenario, this may involve the installation manifest being read by \u2018Bob's device\u2019  to determine that the \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 application is configured to access the \u2018web-browsing\u2019, \u2018location-based services\u2019 and \u2018audio recorder\u2019 computing resources.","At , the mobile device  may determine which computing resources, of the computing resources on the computing device that the application is configured to access (e.g., computing resources that appear on the installation manifest), are not identified in the common permissions list.","As noted earlier with respect to the example scenario, the common permissions list for the \u2018Leisure\u2019 category identified two computing resources: \u2018web-browsing\u2019 and \u2018location-based services\u2019. Therefore, at , \u2018Bob's device\u2019  may identify the \u2018audio recorder\u2019 computing resource as not being identified on the common permissions list.","At , for each computing resource that the application is configured to access that is not identified in the common permissions list (e.g., a computing resource that may be listed in the installation manifest, but is not commonly accessed for applications from that application category), the mobile device  may display, in a user interface, a first permission request to allow the application to access the computing resource.","In accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, by identifying computing resources that are configured to be accessed by an application  but are not identified on the common permissions list (and thus, are not commonly accessed for applications  belonging to the application category for the application ), the mobile device  can determine the computing resources for which permission requests should be highlighted to the user.","Particularly, because applications  are typically be grouped into categories according to the functionality they provide (e.g., \u2018Games\u2019, \u2018News\u2019, or \u2018Productivity\u2019 application categories), it may be inferred that applications belonging to the application category may access a similar set of computing resources, such that permission requests for computing resources not in the common set of computing resources should warrant extra attention from the user. For example, it may be common that applications  in the \u2018News\u2019 application category access computer resources that access the Internet to retrieve news information, but it would be uncommon if a news application requests access to the audio recorder. The uncommon permission request may thus be drawn to the attention of the user.","At , optionally, for each computing resource that the application is configured to access that is identified in the common permissions list (e.g., computing resources that are both listed in the installation manifest and the common permissions list), the mobile device  may display, in a user interface, a second permission request to allow the application to access to the computing resource.","Since the first permission requests are for requests to computing resources that are atypical or uncommon for applications in that application category, these requests may be visually distinguishable from any second permission requests when displayed at the mobile device , if second permission requests are displayed at . For example, the first permission request may be visually distinguished from other permission requests using an asterisk, red or other colored text or highlighting, warning language, or other formatting or markings.","Referring to , a visual output  is provided by way of example, illustrating first and second permission requests displayed when installing the application \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 on \u2018Bob's device\u2019  in the example scenario discussed above. In particular, the \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 may list the \u2018web-browsing\u2019 , \u2018location-based services\u2019 and \u2018audio recorder\u2019 computing resources as those the application is configured to access when executed (as determined, e.g., by reading the installation manifest for the \u2018Cycle Nation\u2019 application).","Since the \u2018web-browsing\u2019 and location-based services' computing resources are identified on the common permissions list as being common for applications in the \u2018Leisure\u2019 category, the second permission requests for these two computing resources are presented to the user and are not highlighted (i.e., not visually distinguished for the purposes of being drawn to the attention of the user).","The \u2018audio recorder\u2019 computing resource, however, has been determined to be atypical because of its absence from the common permissions list, and as such, is visually distinguished from the other two permission requests. Particularly, a box around the \u2018audio recorder\u2019 permission request, an asterisk, and an accompanying note indicating that the \u201cpermission request is uncommon for applications in the leisure category\u201d are shown, in this example. It will be understood that other ways of distinguishing the uncommon permission request from other permission requests are possible in variant implementations.","At , for each computing resource that the application  is configured to access (e.g., as may be listed in the installation manifest for the application ) that is not identified in the common permissions list, the mobile device  may allow the application  to access the computing resource if the first permission request for the computing resource is accepted.","Furthermore, if a second permission request to access a computing resource has been displayed at , then the mobile device  may allow the application  to access the computing resource if the second permission request for the computing resource is accepted.","In the example scenario of , the mobile device  may allow or deny access to each requested resource depending on the input from the user.","In some scenarios (e.g., when the application server  is an application store), it may be possible that applications are miscategorized. As a result, the common permissions list associated with the application  downloaded to the mobile device  may provide an inaccurate list of computing resources that is commonly accessed for that application category. This may cause computing resources to be erroneously flagged when displaying permission requests to the user. Acts , , , and  address this situation in one variant embodiment, and are optional.","User of mobile device  may have assigned an application category to the application downloaded at , either prior to installation (e.g. at , ), during installation, or after installation. For example, this may have been done based on input in a user interface provided during the installation of an application . Alternatively, this may be performed implicitly based on a category or folder that the user has associated with the application on their mobile device . At , the mobile device  receives the user-assigned application category as input via the user interface of the computing device, identifying an application category that the application  is associated with.","At , the mobile device  transmits data to the application server , to notify the application server  that the application  has been associated with the user-assigned application category on the computing device. This data is received by the application server  at .","At , the application server  may change an association of the identified application  to the user-assigned application category. To help ensure that the newly received user-assigned application category is appropriate, the association of the identified application  with the application category may only be changed (i.e., the application  is re-categorized) at , if the data requesting the change is received by the application server  from at least a predefined number of computing devices.","In a variant embodiment, the application server  may cause the above-described second permission requests for commonly requested computing resources to be displayed at the mobile device  before downloading the application.
