title: Passive boundary layer control elements
abstract: Sub-boundary-layer-scale ramp-like vortex generators that can be mounted on any surface such as the wing of an airplane, the inlet to a propulsion system, the hull of a ship, or any other surface over which a fluid moves, when the objective is to minimize drag, irreversibility losses, or other performance penalties that can occur for reasons such as boundary layer separation or other undesirable boundary layer properties. The disclosed devices acts to passively induce streamwise vortices in the boundary layer, thereby transferring high-momentum fluid toward the surface in such a way as to alter the shape of the velocity profile within the boundary layer and thereby avoid or delay separation or alter other properties of the boundary layer.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/164,699, filed on Mar. 30, 2009 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/211,540, filed on Mar. 31, 2009. The entire disclosure of each of the above applications is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. FA8650-06-2-2625 awarded by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present disclosure relates to vortex generators and, more particularly, relates to passive boundary layer control elements having a pair of cooperating micro ramps inducing vortices in a fluid that remain adjacent to a surface in response to their mutual Biot-Savart induced interaction.","This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art. This section also provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.","Micro ramps have been proposed as passive boundary layer control features to reduce the boundary layer thickening and separation that are typical in a wide range of boundary layer control applications. Such features can produce vortices whose axes of rotation are aligned with the streamwise direction and pull high energy fluid from the free stream deep into the boundary layer to avoid separation and other unwanted effects. The more energetic boundary layer that results has a reduced shape factor and is less susceptible to thickening and separation produced by an adverse pressure gradient.","The standard micro ramp design, generally referred to at , was introduced by Anderson et al. and consists of triangular features as shown in . The flow, U, is initially deflected by the micro ramp  before it passes over angled dumps  on each side of the feature. As seen in , a counter-rotating vortex pair , is produced, the size and strength of which depends on the height of the feature h () and the half-angle of the triangle A.","Still referring to , these counter-rotating vortices , are illustrated from a downstream location, looking in the upstream direction at the rearward faces of the micro ramp . Of critical importance is the behavior of these streamwise vortices , as they propagate downstream. Note that the effect, F, of vortex on vortex is to push vortex in the upward direction, and that the same is true for the effect, F, of vortex on vortex . The effect of the wall  on the vortex pair , will be the same as the effect from an \u201cimage\u201d vortex pair, which is a reflection of the real vortices across the wall. The image vortex pair is shown by the dotted lines in . It can then be seen that the effect of the wall  is to pull the vortex pair toward each other, which has the detrimental effect of causing the opposite-signed vorticity in the streamwise vortices , to interdiffuse and cancel, thereby reducing the vortex strengths as they propagate downstream.","Thus the effect of the vortex-vortex interaction in a conventional design is to drive the vortex pair , up out of the boundary layer, and the effect of the wall  is to pull the vortex pair together. Since the initially separate vortices are counter-rotating, the strength of vortex cancels the strength of vortex as the pair is drawn together. As the vortex pair propagates downstream, then, they are located in an undesirable position above or within the boundary layer with their strength diminished. It would be desirable for exactly the opposite interactions to take place as the vortices move downstream; the vortex pair should remain separated, remain close to the wall , and preferably remain within the boundary layer.","In other words, each individual micro ramp  creates a pair of streamwise vortices , that cause the resulting vortex pair to naturally lift upward as a consequence of the mutual Biot-Savart induced interaction between the two vortices. This in turn causes the vortices to quickly lift out of the boundary layer, reducing their efficacy in controlling the boundary layer. Moreover, the effect of the wall on the resulting streamwise vortices is a further Biot-Savart induced interaction with their image vortices that causes the vortices , to move toward each other and thereby reduce their strengths through interdiffusion, thus further reducing their efficacy in controlling the boundary layer. It is both these aspects of such prior art embedded passive boundary layer control devices that limit their efficacy, and that the disclosed new devices are able to overcome to achieve substantially greater efficacy.","According to the principles of the present teachings, in some embodiments, ramp-like vortex generators are provided that can be mounted on any surface such as the wing of an airplane, the inlet to a propulsion system, the hull of a ship, or any other surface over which a fluid moves, when the objective is to minimize drag, irreversibility losses, or other performance penalties that can occur for reasons such as boundary layer separation or other undesirable boundary layer properties. The disclosed devices act to passively induce streamwise vortices in the boundary layer, thereby transferring high-momentum fluid toward the surface in such a way as to alter the shape of the velocity profile within the boundary layer and thereby avoid or delay separation or alter other properties of the boundary layer. Moreover, the disclosed devices can achieve these beneficial effects with lower performance penalties than prior art devices can.","Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein.

They provide means for passively controlling various aspects of boundary layers in a wide range of applications, including shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLI) and numerous others. Among such vortex generators, micro ramp designs of the prior art () are particularly noteworthy for their structural robustness, which provides notable advantages over other more fragile or complicated boundary layer control concepts. However, the beneficial effects of such micro ramp designs and other prior art vortex generators are comparatively modest, and they produce various detrimental effects that may make them unacceptable for certain applications. For these reasons, prior art vortex generators in general, and especially micro ramp vortex generators of the prior art, require substantial improvement of their efficiency and effectiveness.","The present teachings provide an alternative micro ramp design that produces a stream-wise vortex pair whose sense of rotation is opposite that of the standard micro ramp  (that is, counter-rotating vortices rotating opposite of the aforementioned standard design), and that preserves the appealing simplicity and robustness of the standard design. The new design is suitably termed the inverse micro ramp and generally designated at reference . Empirical results are provided, with a number of metrics suggesting considerably improved performance.","With particular reference to , the inverse micro ramp design  of the present teachings is illustrated schematically from a perspective view () and a downstream vantage looking upstream at the rearward angled faces of the feature (). Inverse micro ramp design  comprises a pair of ramp-like features  that together are used to achieve the advantages of the present teachings. Each of the pair of ramp-like features  is symmetrical and in mirrored relationship to the other.","Similar to the standard design, the incoming boundary layer U is initially deflected by ramp-like features  before passing over two angled dumps . In some embodiments, the faces  on the outward boundaries of the ramp-like features  are parallel with the streamwise flow velocity U, and the two angled dumps  form a \u201cV\u201d in the interior of the geometry. Note that the appealing characteristics of the standard ramps , particularly their simple and robust design, remain intact.","In some embodiments, each ramp-like feature  of inverse micro ramp  comprises a ramp face  being generally planar and extending from a first edge  at a height generally flush with wall  to a second edge or point  downstream of first edge  and inclined a height h above wall . Second edge or point  can be generally parallel to the plane of wall  (when in the form of an edge) and offset therefrom the height h. Although ramp face  is illustrated and described as being planar, it should be appreciated that other shapes are anticipated.","Angled dumps  and faces  of ramp-like feature  downwardly extend from ramp face  to wall . Angled dumps  and faces  are generally illustrated as being orthogonal to ramp face  (and, in some embodiments, wall ). However, it should also be appreciated that in some embodiments angled dumps  and faces  may form an angle other than 90\u00b0 relative to ramp face  or wall .","Still referring to , in some embodiments, ramp-like features  each further defines a trailing edge or surface  formed by the joining of angled dump  and the associated face .","Turning now to the behavior of the streamwise vortex pair as it propagates downstream using the inverse micro ramp design  of the present teachings, and in particular how the vortex-vortex interactions affect this path, attention should be directed to . It should be recognized that the vortex-vortex interaction of the present teachings produces a downwardly combining streamwise vortex pair opposite of the prior art design. Specifically, the effect of vortex on vortex , F, is to push vortex in the downward direction, and the same is true for the effect of vortex on vortex , F. The effect of the wall  on the vortex pair , is deduced by considering an image vortex pair, which is a reflection of the real vortices across the wall, and shown in dotted lines in . These image vortices produce a further Biot-Savart induced interaction that causes the vortices , to move away from each other, thereby increasing the spacing between them. This effect in turn reduces the interdiffusion of the oppositely-signed vorticity that comprises these streamwise vortices , and in so doing acts to preserve their strengths as measured by their respective circulation. Both the direct effect produced by the Biot-Savart induced interaction between vortices and , and the indirect wall effect produced by Biot-Savart induced interaction of each of vortices and with its respective image vortex, act to increase the efficacy of the resulting streamwise vortices , in controlling the boundary layer.","In other words, the vortex pair , produced by these angled dumps  is shown schematically in . As a result of their sense of rotation, the vortex-vortex interaction and the effect of the wall force the vortices to remain separated from each other and to remain in close proximity to the wall. Thus such a design enables the vortex strength to persist further downstream of the features, with the spanwise region controlled by the individual features being larger than with the standard design. Therefore, not only do the inverse micro ramps  perform their desired function better than the standard ramps , but they do so with fewer individual elements because of their improved effectiveness downstream. Ultimately, this can be translated into reduced drag-related losses, reduced thermodynamic performance losses, and reduced fabrication expenses for the same or greater beneficial effect on controlling the boundary layer.","The nomenclature used for the defining dimensions of the inverse micro ramp  is shown in , and is analogous to that used for the standard micro ramp design . Each half of the inverse micro ramp  has hypotenuse c, interior angle A, height h, and inter-feature spacing s.","Comparison of Inverse Micro Ramp Design to Conventional Structures","To assist in providing relevant comparisons to the previously described standard micro ramp, while also illustrating certain elements of an optimal configuration, the following further nonlimiting illustration is provided. For the sake of this illustration, we maintain three of the defining dimensions constant in the inverse micro ramp design , that is, the nominal flow deflection angle, the ratio c\/h, and the upstream location x.

The evolution of the resulting streamwise velocity fields \u016b(y,z) are shown in spanwise planes in  for the \u03b8=7.75\u2212deg, 10.0\u2212deg, and 12.0\u2212deg deflection angles, respectively. The powerful vortex-induced downwash along the centerline convects high velocity air deep into the boundary layer, and enables a core of such high-energy fluid to pass through the interaction relatively unaffected by the shock. Conversely, in the vortex-induced upwash regions which occur at larger |z| values, the low velocity fluid originally in the boundary layer is convected toward the free stream. One might note, at least qualitatively, that while the effect on the streamwise velocity in the downwash region is considerably greater in the present case as compared to the standard micro ramps , the effect in the upwash regions appear comparable.","Further insight into this regard is provided through inspection of the streamwise velocity profiles, offered in  for all three shock strengths. As is known for standard micro ramp cases, the centerline and off-centerline profiles have equal velocities at large y\/\u03b4values, deviate in the central region of the boundary layer, and then approach equal values in the near wall region. Owing to the two-fold increase in vortex strength, the deviations in the present case are substantially larger than for the standard micro ramps.","Comparison between the two controlled boundary layers and the uncontrolled boundary layer is offered in  at the x\/\u03b4=\u22121.1 location in the \u03b8=10.0\u2212deg interaction. Caution is encouraged when comparing the vortex-induced upwash regions, denoted by the circular points, since in the case of the inverse micro ramps  the full degree of upwash has not been resolved. The flow is relatively unaffected by the method of control for y\/\u03b4\u22730.75, with large variation being observed closer to the wall. Using the standard micro ramps , the benefit provided by the vortex-induced downwash region is approximately equal to the loss produced by the corresponding upwash region. With much larger vorticity magnitude, as produced by the inverse micro ramps , the gain in the downwash region of the vortex pair significantly outweighs any loss in the presently resolved upwash region.","Comparison of Mean Integral Relations","These observations are seen more completely through the spanwise measurements of the modified shape factors H*.  show these measurements for the uncontrolled and controlled boundary layers in locations upstream (,  and ) and downstream (,  and ) of the interaction for all three shock strengths. Recall that in general a smaller shape factor is indicative of high momentum being located close to the wall and therefore represents a boundary layer that is less susceptible to detachment. Note also that H*=1 is the lower bound, and describes the case of a uniform velocity profile everywhere equal to the free stream velocity u. Finally, one should recall that due to the lack of a uniform free stream in the presence of an incident shockwave, the numerical values of H* are rendered somewhat moot and therefore comparison between figures is irrelevant. Instead, accurate inferences can only be made through comparisons contained within each individual figure.","With these precautions in mind, the effect of the inverse micro ramps  is substantial for all shock strengths. The effects on the boundary layer upstream of the present teachings are comparable to the effects of the standard micro ramp design . Downstream of the interaction, however, the inverse micro ramps  provide a substantial reduction in the shape factor within the available field of view. Additionally, while the standard micro ramp design  provides little or no benefit to the shape factor for the \u03b8=10.0\u2212deg and 12.0\u2212deg interactions, the inverse micro ramps  provide substantial benefit even in these stronger interactions.","Comparison of Net Displacement Thicknesses","One quantification of the net effect of the micro ramps  is the spanwise-averaged displacement thickness \u03b4*, which can be investigated as a function of the streamwise coordinate. For all incident shock strengths, it has been found that the net displacement thickness is reduced by the inverse micro ramps  at all streamwise locations, further demonstrating the potential utility of the design. Table 2 shows the maximum net displacement thickness for each interaction together with the percent reduction provided by the two boundary layer control techniques. The results suggest the inverse micro ramp design  effectively reduces the peak boundary layer thickness through the SBLI by as much as 34% over the uncontrolled interaction. Even in the strongest interaction a 17% reduction is achieved, demonstrating a four-fold improvement over the reduction produced by the standard micro ramp design .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Maximum displacement thicknesses through each interaction,"},{"entry":"showing also the net reductions produced by the"},{"entry":"standard and inverse micro ramps."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u03b8 = 7.75-deg","\u03b8 = 10.0-deg","\u03b8 = 12.0-deg"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Blank","2.8 \u2014","3.9 \u2014","4.3 \u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"S.

Thus, extrapolating this result across a large span, the vortex generator arrays will produce an SBLI with alternating regions of fully attached flow in the vortex-induced downwash regions and intermittent recirculating or detached flow in the vortex-induced upwash regions. By extension, then, the potentially large recirculation structure, which has been demonstrated experimentally many times, should be divided into much smaller cells, and it would be expected that the downstream dimension of such cells would be on the order of their spanwise dimension. Similarly, the previously large-scale oscillations associated with the large recirculation zone should be reduced to localized effects with correspondingly reduced amplitudes.","Interpretation of Results","As previously noted, vortex generator arrays will produce regions of alternating vortex-induced upwash and downwash across the span. Using shock boundary layer interactions as one of many flow-fields suited for passive control by micro-ramps, the discussion herein, and particularly  and , showed that the vortex-induced downwash produced by suitably designed micro ramp vortex generators can dramatically improve the boundary layer profile as it evolves through regions of strong adverse pressure gradients. In the complementary upwash regions, meanwhile, the effects of the vortex generators are not significantly worse than in an uncontrolled scenario. When these effects are integrated across the span, the net effects of the incident shock on the boundary layer can be considerably reduced. Table 2 summarizes this quantitatively.","Effects of the micro ramp vortex generators on the stability of shock-boundary layer interaction can also be inferred.  indicate that the fluctuations of the interaction are dramatically reduced in the presence of a sufficiently strong downwash. In the upwash regions the turbulence levels are comparable in size and scope to those from the uncontrolled interactions, but in the downwash regions the fluctuation levels are reduced. The low fluctuation levels in the downwash regions result from elimination of any instantaneous recirculation bubbles that might appear in the interaction and thus the otherwise free shear layer is constrained at the bottom wall boundary, thus reducing large-scale oscillations of the interaction.","Accordingly, it should be appreciated that the present teachings provide numerous beneficial aspects, including approximately two-fold improvements over the standard design in several key metrics\u2014namely the maximum vorticity, total circulation, spanwise separation, and the wall normal location. The resulting effects on the flow field make the inverse micro ramps  strong candidates for augmenting or eliminating active boundary layer control techniques and for achieving the same or greater beneficial effects in passively controlling a boundary layer with lower performance penalties while maintaining other practical considerations than is possible with prior art passive vortex generators.","The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.
