No. FR 0856169, filed Sep. 12, 2008, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates the realization of a finite-element model and, more particularly, to a method and a device allowing property data to be applied independently of the granularity of a finite-element model.","Modeling by finite elements is nowadays an established technique. Such modeling allows numerically calculating the behavior of objects, which may be very complex. Modeling by finite elements is based on a space division according to a grid made up of finite elements. In addition, during the creation of a finite-element model, a property data set of a modeled entity is generally directly linked with elements of the finite-element model. The property data can define, for example, physical properties of the modeled entity. Such linking of the property data with the finite-element model makes the property data dependant on the granularity on the finite-element model.","In addition, the use of finite-element models is current for the design of complex units, such as aircrafts. Such units require handling complex finite-element models. For example, the finite-element model of an aircraft section, such as the fuselage center section, can comprise more than 33,000 finite elements. Given that a property data set is generally associated with each finite element, it follows that important volumes of property data must be handled for the finite-element model in its entirety.","Traditionally, the design of complex units, such as aircrafts, is made in an iterative way, by successively increasing the granularity of the finite-element model. In other words, the number of finite elements of the finite-element model is modified with each stage of the design. For example, the granularity of the finite-element model is modified as a function of calculations that need to be made, of construction materials and of construction principles used. Consequently, the property data, which are directly dependant on a particular granularity of the finite-element model, must entirely be recreated with each change of the granularity of the finite-element model. A data property set must be created even if the new property data linked to a new finite-element model are identical to the property data linked to a finite-element model on which the new finite-element model is based. This constraint is due to the fact that the property data are linked to the finite-element model by means of a number. This number will be different if the granularity of the model by elements changes, making that there is no possibility of establishing a link between different sets of property data.","Insofar as the property data can be very voluminous, and that, moreover, the creation of the property data requires human intervention at several stages, there will be important constraints, which are reencountered with each iteration of the design, making it impossible to modify the level of granularity of the finite-element model at any time, and accentuating delays in the design process.","There exists a need to create finite-element models in a relatively fast and flexible way.","The present invention allows solving at least one of the problems identified hereinbefore.","An object of the invention is thus a method for the realization of a finite-element model by means of a computer, the finite-element model including at least an element and modeling a geometrical entity, wherein the method comprises the steps of:","acquiring at least one property data and at least one positioning identifier by means of an interface of said computer in order to store said at least one property data and said at least one positioning identifier in a memory of said computer, said at least one positioning identifier allowing identifying a position of said at least one property data on said geometrical entity; and","establishing a correspondence between said at least one positioning identifier and at least one element of said finite-element model in said memory of said computer.","Such a method allows making the creation of property data independent of the granularity of a finite-element model. The method also allows preserving property data information throughout a process of improving a finite-element model.","In a particular embodiment, the method further comprises a step of linking said at least one property data with said at least one element of said finite-element model for which a correspondence with said positioning identifier of said at least one property data was established in said memory of said computer.","In a particular embodiment, the method further comprises the step of modifying by means of said computer said at least one property data and\/or said positioning identifier according to a rule of correspondence.","In another particular embodiment, the method further comprises the step of generating by means of said computer at least one property data and\/or a positioning identifier according to a rule of correspondence.","In a particular embodiment, said rule of correspondence is determined by a user by means of said interface of said computer.","In another particular embodiment, said rule of correspondence is selected among a group comprising: an interpolation, a logarithmic interpolation, an average, a weighted average, a calculation thickness based on a voluminal expression of a predetermined zone and an average in proportion to distances between two values.","In a particular embodiment, a modification of said at least one element of said finite-element model modifies said at least one property data and\/or said positioning identifier according to a rule of correspondence.","In another particular embodiment, a modification of said at least one element of said finite-element model generates at least one property data and\/or a positioning identifier according to a rule of correspondence.","In a particular embodiment, a creation of an element of the finite-element model generates at least a property data and\/or a positioning identifier.","In a particular embodiment, the step of acquiring said at least one property data by means of said interface of said computer is carried out starting from a finite-element model.","In a particular embodiment, said geometrical entity is selected among a group comprising: a one-dimensional element and a two-dimensional element.","In a particular embodiment, said at least one property data is selected among a group comprising: a normal section, an inertia, a sheared section, a torque, a thickness and a surface value.","The invention also concerns a device comprising means adapted to implement each step of the method described hereinbefore.","The invention also concerns a computer program comprising code instructions for executing the steps described hereinbefore, when said program is executed by a computer.","In a particular embodiment, the program is in the form of a product recorded on a support readable by a computer system, including elements of program code.","The invention relates to the realization of finite-element models and, more particularly, a method allowing the creation of property data to be independent of the granularity of a finite-element model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Preferably, the apparatus  comprises a communication bus  to which are connected: a central processing unit  such as a microprocessor; a read-only memory , which may comprise one or more programs \u201cProg\u201d, \u201cProg\u201d and \u201cProg\u201d; a random access memory , which comprises registers adapted to memorize variables and parameters created and modified during the execution of the above mentioned programs; and a communication interface  connected to a distributed communication network , for example the Internet or an Intranet network, the interface being able to transmit and receive data.","The apparatus  can optionally comprise at least one of the following devices: a screen  for visualizing data and\/or for use as graphic interface with a user who will be able to interact with the programs according to the invention by means of a keyboard  or by means of another device, such as, for example, a mouse ; a hard drive  which can comprise programs and\/or data, in particular processed data or data to be processed according to the invention; a reader of removable memory supports  adapted to receive a removable memory support  and to read there from processed data or to write thereon data processed according to the invention.","The communication bus allows communication and interoperability between the various elements that form part of the apparatus  or that are connected thereto. The representation of the bus is not restrictive and, in particular, the central processing unit may communicate instructions to any element of the apparatus , either directly or via another element of apparatus .","The executable code of the programs allowing apparatus  to implement the processes according to the invention can be stored, for example, in the hard drive  or in the read-only memory .","In a variant, the removable memory support , can contain data as well as the executable code of the above mentioned programs which, once read by the apparatus , can be stored in the hard drive .","Alternatively, the executable code of the programs can be received via the communication network , via the interface , so as to be stored in a way as described hereinbefore.","The removable memory support can be, for example, a diskette, a compact disc (CD-ROM), or a memory card. Generally, an information storage means, readable by a computer or a microprocessor, integrated or not into the apparatus, possibly removable, and adapted to store one or more programs whose execution allows the implementation of the method according to the invention.","More generally, the programs could be stored in one of the storage means of the apparatus  before being executed.","The central processing unit  controls execution of the instructions or portions of software code of the programs according to the invention, instructions which are stored in the hard drive , in the read-only memory  or in the other storage elements mentioned hereinbefore. During the powering, the programs that are stored in a nonvolatile memory, for example in the hard drive  or the read-only memory , are transferred to the random access memory  (RAM), which then contains the executable code of the programs according to the invention, as well as to registers for storing the variables and the parameters necessary for implementing the invention.","It should be noted that the apparatus comprising the device according to the invention can also be a programmed apparatus. The instructions of the programs implementing the invention can be implemented in, for example, an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","200","208","208","204"]},"In order to do so, the property data  are linked to the geometrical entity  by means of at least one positioning identifier  for the property data. The positioning identifier  allows identifying the position of at least one property data  on the geometrical entity . In this example, the property data  are a set of values representing the normal section of a one-dimensional element. It should be noted that the property data  may comprise information concerning the physical characteristics of an element, or data useful for the creation of a grid, for example, data facilitating the implementation of a topological classification, or facilitating the study by any device (optimization, vibration, heat, etc), or facilitating traceability (source of the physical data: section in solid, interpolation, specific study, assumption, validation of a plane, etc). Such information can be, for example, the normal section, inertia, the sheared section, a torque or a thickness. In addition, the geometrical entity  can be any entity that can be modeled, in particular by means of geometrical coordinates. As example, the geometrical entity  can represent an element of simple complexity, with one or two dimensions, such as a beam or a surface, or even an element of greater complexity, made up of, for example, a combination of elements of simple complexity, such as a section of aircraft.","During the realization of the finite-element model , an acquisition of the property data  and of a positioning identifier  is carried out. The positioning identifiers  identify the position of the property data  on the geometrical entity  on the basis of which a finite-element model  is realized. Thus, the property data  are independent of the finite-element model , insofar as the positioning of the property data  is established with regard to the geometrical entity , by means of at least one positioning identifier .","The property data  are linked to the elements of the finite-element model  by resorting to the positioning identifier  in order to identify the elements of the finite-element model  to which the property data  are to be linked. Thus, a correspondence is established between the positioning identifier  of the geometrical entity  and the elements of the finite-element model  of the geometrical entity . Once the correspondence between the positioning identifiers  and the elements of the finite-element model  has been established, the property data  are linked with the elements of the finite-element model  for which a correspondence with the positioning identifiers  of the property data  was established.","In addition, during the establishment of the correspondence between the positioning identifiers  and the elements of the finite-element model , a rule of correspondence  can be used. The rule of correspondence allows modifying or creating a new value of property data, which is then linked with the finite-element model . Moreover, the rule of correspondence  also allows modifying or creating a positioning identifier for the value of the property data modified or created. Thus, by modifying or creating the positioning identifier, the rule of correspondence  can update the property data with respect to the geometrical entity . The rule of correspondence  can modify or create one or more new values of property data by using the values of already known property data . Various calculation methods can be applied to the values of already known property data  in order to modify or create the new values of property data. As example, these calculation methods can be a linear interpolation, a logarithmic interpolation, an average or a weighted average.","In this example, the property data  comprise three values representing the normal section of an element and a positioning identifier  allowing identifying the part of the geometrical entity  to which the property data  are linked. A correspondence between the positioning identifier  and the elements of the finite-element model  is then established in order to identify with which or to which elements of the finite-element model  the property data  are to be linked. In this example, the three values of the normal section of the geometrical entity , respectively 0, 0.5 and 1 are linked to elements at positions P, P and P, respectively, of the finite-element model . The positions of the elements P to P are positions resulting from a grid refinement. In addition, in this example, the rule of correspondence  is used in order to generate property data which are linked to elements with the positions P, P, P and P of the finite-element model .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","318","300"]},"The property data can be stored directly in the CAD or CAE software or on an external database. It can be simpler to use the property data in case these data are stored in an external database, particularly if property data is voluminous. Such an external database can be accessible, for example, through an API (Application Programming Interface) thus allowing to build on an open data-processing architecture.","The property data can also be linked to a real geometry or an image of the geometry. Certain CAD or CAE software integrates a module allowing reading a geometry and thus creating an intermediate image of geometry.","The recovery of the property data can be realized by a first recovery method  or a second recovery method . The first recovery method  allows importation  of property data contained in an XML file . The use of the XML format allows building on a standard organization of data, however other file formats could be employed, like, for example, the CVS format. The second recovery method  allows the recovery of property data starting from an existing finite-element model. A preceding data property file  is then captured by a property data capturing module . Once captured, the property data are then built by a property data construction module .","The modification of the property data can be realized, according to a first alternative, by a property data modifying module via the graphic interface . The modified property data are then provided to the property data module . According to a second alternative, an external file  can be used. Using an external file  allows providing the property data module  with property data created by a property data creation module. As example, this module can be an optimization module, a dimensioning module, or a CAD-calculation linking module or a CAE-calculation linking module. The interaction between the property data creation module and the property data module  is done via an XML file , which can be modified by an export module . An update module  allows updating the property data module  in order to reflect the modifications applied to the XML file  by a property data creation module.","The application of the property data  on a finite-element model  is carried out by a property data correspondence and linking module . The property data correspondence and linking module  links the property data of the property data module  with the finite-element model . The property data correspondence and linking module  can use at least one rule of correspondence if, for example, the granularity of the property data of the property data module  is different from the granularity of the finite-element model .","The finite-element model  to which the property data have been linked is modifiable via a finite-element modification module arranged to modify elements of the finite-element model . A new data property file  is then created. In addition, the modifications are captured by the property data capturing module . The new property data are built by the property data construction module  which updates the property data module .","In addition, the capture of the property data by module  can be carried out starting from a patch construction module  on the basis of definitions of patches . The concept of patch will be detailed somewhat further in this document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400","sub":["u=0 ","u=1"]},"A rule of correspondence  is used during the establishment of a correspondence between the two positioning identifiers, U=0 and U=1, and the elements of a finite-element model . However, the granularity of the finite-element model, i.e. the number of elements constituting the finite-element model, being higher than the number of values of the property data, a rule of correspondence  is used in order to generate new geometry data values to be linked to the finite-element model . In this example, the five bars, positioned between the two bars positioned with each end, represent normal section values interpolated according to a rule of correspondence  using a linear interpolation. Thus, a value of normal section is linked to each element of the finite-element model .","A grid refinement , i.e. an increase amongst elements of a finite-element model , is carried out, resulting in the creation of a new element and of a new property data value linked to the new element. In addition, the creation of the new element also modifies values linked to related elements. In this case, a rule of correspondence is used in order to generate the new data value of the new element. An update of the values of the property data linked to the related elements, which are modified as a consequence of the creation of the new element, is also carried out. Thus, the property data are updated with each modification or creation of elements of the finite-element model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"510","sub":["u=0","u=0.6 ","u=1"]},"A rule of correspondence  is used for establishing a correspondence between the three positioning identifiers U=0, U=0.6 and U=1, and the elements of a finite-element model . However, in this example, the positioning identifier U=0.6 does not correspond to an element of the finite-element model . A choice is then proposed to the user, although it can be considered that this choice can be carried out automatically by the rule of correspondence . A new property data value linked to an element of the finite-element model  can then be created following a first choice. The value can be established according to the rule of correspondence and starting from the value SN. Following a second choice, no new property data is created.","A modification of property data  is carried out resulting in the modification from a property data value linked to an element of the finite element model . In addition, the update of property data  leads to the creation of a new property data value and to a positioning identifier of the new value on the geometrical entity . Thus, the property data can be updated with regard to the geometrical entity, with each modification or creation of property data value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"In this example, a geometrical entity  is an oriented geometrical line having curvilinear coordinates U=0 at the beginning of line and U=1 at the end of the line. In this example, the behavior of the geometrical line in the finite-element model is a bar. The bar is characterized, in this example, by a normal section. Thus, the property data linked to the geometrical entity contain normal section values positioned at various places of the geometrical entity. In this example, four normal section values form the property data. The positions of these values on the geometrical entity are identified by three positioning identifiers, U=0, U=0.6 and U=1, as well as a positioning identifier U=I positioned at the intersection of the external element with the geometrical line. The four normal section values, SN, SN, SNand SN, are positioned at U=0, U=0.6, U=1 and U=i, respectively. In this example, the normal section value is represented by a vertical bar of which the length is proportional to the value. In addition, the intersection of the external element with the geometrical line can model, for example, a crossing between a vertical stay and a horizontal stiffener of a stiffened panel.","A rule of correspondence  is used for establishing a correspondence between the positioning identifiers and the elements of a finite-element model , according to the example of application describes previously with reference to .","A modification of the geometrical entity  results in a modification of the length of the geometrical line and leads to the geometrical entity . The three normal section values SN, SNand SNthen preserve their relative positioning defined by their curvilinear coordinates, U=0, U=0.6 and U=1, respectively. However, the relative positioning of the value of normal section SNand thus the coordinate U=i of the value of normal section is modified.","A finite-element model  is then generated, in which the update of the property data  is reflected. The update of the property data  results in the establishment of a new correspondence between the positioning identifiers U=0, U=0.6, U=1 and U=I and the elements of the finite-element model . However, the granularity of the finite-element model  being higher than the number of values of the updated property data, a rule of correspondence is used in order to generate new geometry data values to be linked to the finite-element model , according to the example of application described previously with reference to .","In the example of , the modification of the geometrical entity  concerns the modification of the length of the geometrical line. However, the update of the property data  would be carried out in a similar way if the modification of the geometrical entity  related to a modification of the positioning of the external element.

In order to do so, it is appropriate to first identify the portion of surface  on which the property data of a surface point  are, through the positioning identifier based on the intersection  of a line GEawith a line GEb. The positioning of the property data of the surface point  is then established on this portion of surface through a two-dimensional coordinate system (u, v), where 0\u2266u\u22661 and 0\u2266v\u22661 in this example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","804","800","802","800"]},"In this example, the behavior of the geometrical surface as finite-element model is a plate.
