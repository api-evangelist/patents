{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to a navigation system, and more particularly to a navigation system with a point of interest harvesting mechanism.","Modern portable consumer and industrial electronics, especially client devices such as navigation systems, cellular phones, portable digital assistants, and combination devices, are providing increasing levels of functionality to support modern life including location-based information services. Research and development in the existing technologies can take a myriad of different directions.","As users become more empowered with the growth of mobile location based service devices, new and old paradigms begin to take advantage of this new device space. There are many technological solutions to take advantage of this new device location opportunity. One existing approach is to use location information to provide navigation services such as a global positioning system (GPS) for a car or on a mobile device such as a cell phone, portable navigation device (PND) or a personal digital assistant (PDA).","Location based services allow users to create, transfer, store, and\/or consume information in order for users to create, transfer, store, and consume in the \u201creal world\u201d. One such use of location based services is to efficiently transfer or route users to the desired destination or service.","Navigation systems and location based services enabled systems have been incorporated in automobiles, notebooks, handheld devices, and other portable products. Today, these systems aid users by incorporating available, real-time relevant information, such as maps, directions, local businesses, or other points of interest (POI). The real-time information provides invaluable relevant information. This real-time information can be extracted from pool of documents, such as from the World Wide Web or the Internet. However, a failure to extract all the fields and align the fields from one document to another document continues to be a paramount concern for the consumer.","Thus, a need still remains for a navigation system with point of interest harvesting mechanism to collect POI information from different fields in different document pages. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.","Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.","The present invention provides a method of operation of a navigation system including: generating an extraction job including a crawl task based on a location of a point of interest and a web form type of a website for harvesting the point of interest from the website; receiving a heartbeat from a distributed cache for determining when a client device is available to execute the extraction job; generating an assignment schedule of the extraction job based on the heartbeat for distributing the extraction job to the client device to retrieve a location-based field; and receiving the location-based field associated with the point of interest for displaying on a monitor device.","The present invention provides a navigation system including: a job generation module, for generating an extraction job including a crawl task based on a location of a point of interest and a web form type of a website for harvesting the point of interest from the website; a cache communication module, coupled to the job generation module, for receiving a heartbeat from a distributed cache for determining when a client device is available to execute the extraction job; a job distribution module, coupled to the cache communication module, for generating an assignment schedule of the extraction job based on the heartbeat for distributing the extraction job to the client device to retrieve a location-based field; and a compiler module, coupled to the job distribution module, for receiving the location-based field associated with the point of interest for displaying on a monitor device.","Certain embodiments of the invention have other steps or elements in addition to or in place of those mentioned above. The steps or element will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.","The following embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make and use the invention. It is to be understood that other embodiments would be evident based on the present disclosure, and that system, process, or mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known circuits, system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail.","The drawings showing embodiments of the system are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown exaggerated in the drawing FIGs. Similarly, although the views in the drawings for ease of description generally show similar orientations, this depiction in the FIGs. is arbitrary for the most part. Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation. The embodiments have been numbered first embodiment, second embodiment, etc. As a matter of descriptive convenience and are not intended to have any other significance or provide limitations for the present invention.","One skilled in the art would appreciate that the format with which navigation information is expressed is not critical to some embodiments of the invention. For example, in some embodiments, navigation information is presented in the format of (X, Y), where X and Y are two coordinates that define the geographic location, i.e., a position of a user.","In an alternative embodiment, navigation information is presented by longitude and latitude related information. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the navigation information also includes a velocity element including a speed component and a heading component.","The term \u201cnavigation-related information\u201d or \u201crelevant information\u201d referred to herein includes the navigation information described as well as information relating to points of interest to the user, such as local business, hours of businesses, types of businesses, advertised specials, traffic information, maps, local events, and nearby community or personal information.","The term \u201cmodule\u201d referred to herein can include software, hardware, or a combination thereof in the present invention in accordance with the context in which the term is used. For example, the software can be machine code, firmware, embedded code, and application software. Also for example, the hardware can be circuitry, processor, computer, integrated circuit, integrated circuit cores, a pressure sensor, an inertial sensor, a microelectromechanical system (MEMS), passive devices, or a combination thereof.","Referring now to , therein is shown a navigation system  with point of interest harvesting mechanism in an embodiment of the present invention. The navigation system  includes a server device , such as a desktop computer or a dedicated server. The server device  can be connected to a client device , such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, or a client computing device, with a communication channel , such as a wireless or wired network. The client device  can be connected to a cache management device , such as java messaging service server, via the communication channel . The cache management device  is defined as a device capable of relaying messages between two or more of the client device . The server device  can be connected to the cache management device  via the communication channel .","A monitor device  can be connected to the server device , the client device , and the cache management device  via the communication channel . The monitor device , for example, can be a desktop computer, a portable navigation device, or a cell phone.","For example, the server device  can be of any of a variety of devices, such as a notebook computer, a desktop computer, a specialized computer for running computational task on behalf of the client device . The server device  can be a standalone device, or can be incorporated in a cluster. The server device  can couple to the communication channel  to communicate with the client device , the cache management device , or the monitor device .","In another example, the server device  can be a particularized machine, such as a mainframe, a server, a cluster server, rack mounted server, or a blade server, or as more specific examples, an IBM System z10\u2122 Business Class mainframe or a HP ProLiant ML\u2122 server. Yet another example, the client device  can be a particularized machine, such as a portable computing device, a thin client, a notebook, a netbook, a smartphone, personal digital assistant, or a cellular phone, and as specific examples, an Apple iPhone\u2122, Palm Centro\u2122, or Moto Q Global\u2122.","For illustrative purposes, the navigation system  is described with the server device  as a server device, although it is understood that the server device  can be different types of computing devices. For example, the server device  can also be a client device, such as a node on a cloud computing network, a cloud computing network, or a laptop computer.","The client device  can be any of a variety of centralized or decentralized computing devices. For example, the client device  can be a computer, grid computing resources, a virtualized computer resource, cloud computing resource, routers, switches, peer-to-peer distributed computing devices, or a combination thereof. The client device  can be centralized in a single computer room, distributed across different rooms, distributed across different geographical locations, embedded within a telecommunications network. The client device  can have a means for coupling with the communication channel  to communicate with the server device , the cache management device , or the monitor device . The client device  can also be a server type device as described for the server device .","The cache management device  can be any of a variety of centralized or decentralized computing devices. For example, the cache management device  can be a computer, grid computing resources, a virtualized computer resource, cloud computing resource, routers, switches, peer-to-peer distributed computing devices, or a combination thereof. The cache management device  can be centralized in a single computer room, distributed across different rooms, distributed across different geographical locations, embedded within a telecommunications network. The cache management device  can have a means for coupling with the communication channel  to communicate with the server device , the client device , or the monitor device .","The cache management device  can manage a distributed cache . The distributed cache  is defined as a shared and network-accessible memory stored on a cluster of devices. The distributed cache  allows caching to span across multiple computing devices including the client device , the server device , or the monitor device .","For example, the client device  can be part of the cluster of the devices of the distributed cache . Every node in the distributed cache  can contain a node cache portion , which is synchronized using the cache management device . The node cache portion  can keep all the required information about the neighboring nodes. The node cache portion  of the distributed cache  can contain all the status information in the associated node, including running job list, assigned job list, or a combination thereof.","When the server device  attempts to request access to the distributed cache , the server device  can make the request to the cache management device , and the cache management device  can then relay the request to the client device  containing a specific portion of the distributed cache  that needs to be accessed.","Applications connected to the communication channel  can access the distributed cache , including reading and writing to the distributed cache . For example, all of the underlying communication of the nodes of the distributed cache  can be hidden from the server device , the client device , and the monitor device . When an object is store into the distributed cache  in one node of the distributed cache , the object can be retrieved at any node within the distributed cache .","For example, when the client device  starts, the client device  can periodically put a heartbeat  into a heartbeat cache portion  of the distributed cache . The client device  can also place a node load  of the client device  into the distributed cache . The heartbeat  is defined as a message associated with the client device  indicating the health state of the client device  at a particular time. The heartbeat  can contain a node identification, node type, node status, a timestamp, or a combination thereof. The node load  is defined as a message associated with the client device  indicating a workload state of the client device .","The cache management device  can include a database . The database  is defined as non-transitory storage to save and retrieve information related to the navigation system . The cache management device  can first update the distributed cache  when new entries are entered, and then update the database  if necessary.","Although it is illustrated that the database  resides on the cache management device , it is understood that the database  can also reside on other devices in the navigation system . For example, the database  can reside on an instance of the client device . For another example, the database  can reside on the server device . The database  can contain all or a portion of the distributed cache . Alternatively, the distributed cache  can contain all or a portion of the database .","When the distributed cache  is used on top of the database , the database  can have its load significantly reduced. The distributed cache  can improve the overall system stability of the navigation system  because it can be used for transparent client-server cluster maintenance and data sharing.","The cache management device  can provide underlying communication for the distributed cache . For example, the cache management device  can be a Java Message Service (JMS) server. The cache management device  can bypass network firewalls by using JMS.","The monitor device  can be of any of a variety of devices with a display interface, such as a laptop computer, cellular phone, personal digital assistant, a notebook computer, a desktop computer, a specialized device to display location-based information, or other multi-functional communication or entertainment device. The monitor device  can be a standalone device, or can be incorporated with a vehicle, for example a car, truck, bus, or train. The monitor device  can couple to the communication channel  to communicate with the distributed cache , the client device , the cache management device , or the monitor device .","For illustrative purposes, the navigation system  is described with the server device , the client device , the cache management device , the monitor device  as single computing devices, although it is understood that these devices can be a cluster of computing devices. For example, the cache management device  and the server device  can be a cluster of computing servers. For another example, the monitor device  can be both a mobile navigation device and a monitoring desktop, each performing a separate function of the monitor device .","Also for illustrative purposes, the navigation system  is shown with the server device , the client device , the cache management device , and the monitor device  as end points of the communication channel , although it is understood that the navigation system  can have a different partition between the server device , the client device , and the communication channel . For example, the server device , the client device , the cache management device , or a combination thereof can also function as part of the communication channel .","The communication channel  can be a variety of networks. For example, the communication channel  can include wireless communication, wired communication, optical, ultrasonic, or the combination thereof. Satellite communication, cellular communication, Bluetooth, Infrared Data Association standard (IrDA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) are examples of wireless communication that can be included in the communication channel . Ethernet, digital subscriber line (DSL), fiber to the home (FTTH), and plain old telephone service (POTS) are examples of wired communication that can be included in the communication channel .","Further, the communication channel  can traverse a number of network topologies and distances. For example, the communication channel  can include direct connection, personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN) or any combination thereof.","The server device  can maintain client-server cluster. The server device  can communicate with the client device  and vice versa via the distributed cache  managed by the cache management device .","Referring now to , therein is shown an exemplary block diagram of the navigation system  of .
