title: All-optical methods and systems
abstract: An all-optical modulation format converter for converting optical data signals modulated in an on-off-keying (OOK) format to a phase-shift-keying (PSK) format. The OOK-to-PSK converter can be coupled to a delay-line interferometer to provide an all-optical wavelength converter for differential PSK (DPSK). The OOK-to-PSK converter can also be used in all-optical implementations of various functions, including, for example, exclusive-OR (XOR/NXOR) and OR logic, shift registers, and pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generators. Several variants of all-optical devices are described.

No. 12\/497,959, filed Jul. 6, 2009, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes into this application, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. No. 7,558,486, issued Jul. 7, 2009.","The United States Government has certain interests in the present invention.","The present invention relates to the field of high-speed optical data communications, and in particular, to all-optical methods and systems.","All-optical signal processing is a key to enabling all-optical networking All-optical wavelength conversion (AOWC), for example, can be used to perform wavelength routing and contention resolution in transparent optical data networks. As a promising alternative to optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversion, AOWC can reduce cost and power consumption in high-bit-rate core optical networks.","All-optical format conversion is another functionality needed in all-optical networks composed of multiple modulation formats. For example, all-optical on-off-keying (OOK) to phase-shift-keying (PSK) converters can seamlessly integrate OOK networks and PSK networks. All-optical OOK-to-PSK converters also can be beneficially used in all-optical pattern recognition circuits, as PSK is preferred for passive pattern recognition using all-optical correlators. Because of the constant intensity pattern of PSK formatted signals, PSK is preferable where semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are used as optical amplifiers.","All-optical logic operations, such as XOR, AND, OR, are an integral part in building all-optical data networks, where packet routing, data buffering, and wavelength conversion are expected to be processed in the optical plane. The XOR operation, for example, is particularly useful for label recognition and swapping, pattern generation, and parity checking The XOR logic element is a key building block for pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generators and optical half adders, for example.","Integrated semiconductor optical device technology is maturing and much research has been done in optical signal processing using the nonlinear optics in SOAs. However, the pattern dependence of SOAs owing to slow carrier recovery has been a key factor limiting the speed of all-optical logic operation based on semiconductor optical devices. Existing all-optical signal processing methods based on semiconductor optical devices, however, are better suited for OOK than PSK, as the dominant optical nonlinearity, such as cross gain modulation (XGM) or cross phase modulation (XPM), is mediated by intensity modulation and insensitive to the optical phase.","Efficient, all-optical signal processing methods that are applicable to multiple modulation formats, and that have reduced pattern dependence are desirable. For example, because of its superior performance in comparison to OOK, differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) is increasingly recognized as a promising modulation format for high-bit-rate (e.g., \u226710 Gb\/s) optical transmission. Given the importance of DPSK for high-speed optical networks, an efficient method of AOWC for DPSK is highly desired. In contrast to the several methods of AOWC demonstrated for OOK, the few AOWC methods demonstrated for DPSK are based on four-wave mixing (FWM) in optical fibers or in a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). Intensity-dependent optical nonlinearities, such as cross gain modulation (XGM) and cross phase modulation (XPM), are usually considered inapplicable for AOWC of DPSK because of their phase insensitivity. FWM is highly polarization sensitive, however, and its conversion efficiency is typically less than the conversion efficiencies that have been achieved with XGM or XPM in SOAs. In addition, FWM in SOA also suffers from high OSNR degradation owing to the relatively high level of amplified spontaneous emission.","In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a method and system for the all-optical conversion of on-off-keying (OOK) formatted signals to phase-shift-keying (PSK) formatted signals. An exemplary embodiment of an OOK-to-PSK converter uses cross gain modulation (XGM) and cross phase modulation (XPM) in a differentially driven semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI).","In a further embodiment of the present invention, the exemplary OOK-to-PSK converter is used in an all-optical wavelength conversion (AOWC) system for differential phase shift keying (DPSK). An exemplary embodiment of a wavelength converter in accordance with the present invention comprises a silica planar lightwave circuit (PLC) delay-line interferometer (DI) front end that demodulates the input DPSK signal into an OOK binary data stream and its complement which differentially drive the OOK-to-PSK converter. All of the optical devices can be fabricated on an integrated platform.","In further embodiments of the present invention, an OOK-to-PSK converter is used to implement a variety of all-optical logic functions, including, for example, all-optical OR and exclusive OR (XOR) functions. Several variants of all-optical devices are disclosed.","The present invention also enjoys reduced pattern dependence making it better suited than known approaches for use with semiconductor optical devices for applications requiring high bit-rate operation.","An exemplary embodiment of an all-optical on-off-keying (OOK) to phase-shift keying (PSK) converter  is schematically illustrated in . The converter  comprises a differential input stage  which is driven by an OOK format signal A and its complement (\u0100). A first output of the differential input stage  is coupled to a first semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)  and a second output of the input stage  is coupled to a second SOA . The SOAs  and  are driven with the same continuous wave (CW) laser. The output of the second SOA  is coupled to a phase shifter  which provides a nominal phase shift of \u03c0 radians. The output of the phase shifter  and the output of the first SOA  are combined by a combiner  to provide the output of the converter .","In the exemplary embodiment, the SOA-MZI is implemented as a hybrid device fabricated by butt-coupling a bar of InP SOA arrays with input and output silica PLC waveguides. The differential input stage  can be implemented conventionally using fiber delay lines. Alternatively, a monolithically integrated device can be implemented in which the SOA-MZI and the differential input stage are fabricated on an InP device. The SOAs , , phase shifter  and combiner  can also be implemented using conventional components. These components can also be made integrated elements as well.","Note that although a continuous wave (CW) signal is shown as being provided to the SOAs, other periodic signals can be used as well, such as a train of optical pulses.","The operation of the OOK-to-PSK converter  will now be described with reference to . When A=1, there will be a pulse at the A input and no pulse at the complementary input \u0100. The pulse at A is split and differentially delayed by the differential input stage  so that the pulse that is applied to the input of the second SOA  is delayed relative to the pulse that is applied to the first SOA . The differential delay (\u03c4) is substantially the same as the nominal width of an OOK pulse. For 40 Gb\/s return-to-zero (RZ) OOK, for instance, an exemplary value for the differential delay is approximately 8 ps. The resultant amplitude of the electric field at the output of the first SOA  is shown in  as , whereas the resultant amplitude of the electric field at the output of the phase shifter  is shown in  as . The signal  has a phase \u03c6 whereas the signal  has a phase \u03c6+\u03c0. The phase \u03c6 is a non-linear phase shift due to cross-phase modulation (XPM) in SOAs. Due to the \u03c0-radian phase difference and the \u03c4 time difference between the signals  and , they are destructively combined by the combiner  to yield the output signal  (i.e., the amplitude of the electrical field at the output) shown in . The resultant output signal  has a pulse duration of approximately \u03c4 and a phase \u03c6.","When A=0, there will be a pulse at the complementary input \u0100 of the converter  and no pulse at the input A. The pulse at \u0100 is split and differentially delayed by the differential input stage  so that the pulse that is applied to the input of the first SOA  is delayed relative to the pulse that is applied to the second SOA . The resultant amplitude of the electric field at the output of the first SOA  is shown in  as , whereas the resultant amplitude of the electric field at the output of the phase shifter  is shown in  as . The signal  has a phase \u03c6 whereas the signal  has a phase \u03c6+\u03c0. Due to the \u03c0-radian phase difference and the \u03c4 time difference between the signals  and , they are destructively combined by the combiner  to yield the output signal  shown in . In this case, the resultant output signal  has a pulse duration of approximately \u03c4 and a phase \u03c6+\u03c0.","As such, when A=1 at the OOK input of the converter , the output of the converter  has a phase \u03c6, whereas when A=0 at the OOK input, the output has a phase \u03c6+\u03c0. The OOK formatted input is thus converted to a PSK formatted output.","As is well known, the input signals A, \u0100 will propagate through the SOAs and appear at the outputs of the SOAs. As such, the OOK input signals at the input of the converter  will appear to some extent at the output of the converter. One approach for addressing this feeding-forward of the input signals is to use a CW laser for the SOAs ,  of a different wavelength (\u03bb2) than that of the input OOK signal (\u03bb1). An optical band pass filter (OBPF)  can be placed at the output to pass the PSK output modulated at the second wavelength \u03bb2 while blocking the OOK input signals at the first wavelength \u03bb1. In such an implementation, in addition to converting OOK to PSK, the converter  also acts as a wavelength converter (i.e., from \u03bb1 to \u03bb2). If wavelength conversion is not desired, other known techniques for eliminating the feeding forward of the input signals can be employed, such as using a CW laser of a different polarization, reversing the CW inputs and signal outputs of the SOAs, or using two cascaded wavelength converters, with the second wavelength converter recovering the original signal wavelength.","In a further exemplary embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the phase shifter  can be eliminated and the phase shift introduced by applying different bias currents and\/or temperatures to the SOAs , . Alternatively, as can be appreciated, a phase shifter can be coupled in-line with the outputs of either or both SOA , , so long as the desired phase difference between the signals into the inputs of combiner  is provided.","In yet a further exemplary embodiment, the SOAs can be replaced by other nonlinear optical elements (NOEs), including, for example, nonlinear optical glass or absorptive devices such as electro-absorption modulators.","An advantageous feature of the OOK-to-PSK converter of the present invention is its insensitivity to pattern dependence typically experienced by SOAs. As described above, both of the SOAs  and  receive an OOK pulse during each bit period, with the only variation between bit periods being the relative timing of the pulses. As such, pattern dependence is less of a concern in the OOK-to-PSK converter of the present invention thereby obviating the need to use faster SOAs that would be less prone to pattern dependence.","The OOK-to-PSK converter of the present invention can be used in a variety of applications. In a further aspect of the present invention, an all-optical wavelength converter (AOWC) is provided based on the OOK-to-PSK converter of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","310"]},"When a DPSK formatted signal is applied to the input of the DI , it is converted to complementary OOK formatted signals at the output of the DI. The DI  thus acts as a DPSK-to-OOK converter. The complementary OOK outputs of the DI  then drive the OOK-to-PSK converter , which operates as described above to convert the OOK signals to PSK at its output. Wavelength conversion is carried out with the converter  by using a continuous wave (CW) in the OOK-to-PSK converter  of a wavelength \u03bb2 that is different from the wavelength \u03bb1 of the input DPSK signal. A conversion is thus carried out from a DPSK-modulated carrier of wavelength \u03bb1 to a PSK-modulated carrier of wavelength \u03bb2. Furthermore, as described above, the OOK-to-PSK converter  may include an OBPF at its output which passes the PSK signal modulated at the wavelength \u03bb2 while blocking the OOK signals, which are modulated at the wavelength \u03bb1. The two wavelengths are preferably selected to be within the gain bandwidth of the SOAs, and the OBPF should be selected so that the two wavelengths can be sufficiently separated. For example, 100 GHz separation would be sufficient to distinguish two 40-Gb\/s signals of 8-ps RZ pulses. Precise separation will depend on how much linear cross talk can be tolerated in the transmission. The OBPF can be implemented in known ways.","As mentioned, the encoding of the data is altered by the wavelength converter  from DPSK to PSK. The data sequence Pn of the input DPSK signal and the data sequence Pn\u2032 of the wavelength converted output PSK signal are related as follows:\n\n, where \u2295=XOR.\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Equivalently, if D\u2032 is the data sequence that is ultimately derived from P\u2032, the following relationship applies:\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Equation 2 thus shows how a DPSK formatted data stream should be pre-coded so that when it is processed by the converter , it will yield the desired data sequence at the receiver.","More generally, if N is the number of wavelength conversions expected between the transmitter and the receiver, the initial data sequence Pat the transmitter and the data Dn that is to be sent to the receiver are related as follows:\n\n\u2003\u2003(3)\n","The change in data encoding can be addressed by either pre-coding, as described, or by post detection data processing.","In a further aspect of the present invention, the OOK-to-PSK converter of the present invention can be used to implement all-optical logic, such as an all-optical exclusive OR (XOR) function.  shows an exemplary embodiment of an all-optical XOR gate  comprising first and second optical signal processing blocks  and , each implemented with an OOK-to-PSK converter such as described above with reference to . The optical signal processing blocks ,  are driven by a common CW signal so that their outputs are coherent, with the same wavelength (i.e., the wavelength of the CW signal). It should be noted that blocks  and  can be driven by different periodic signals with different wavelengths, so long as the signals are coherent.","A \u03c0-radian phase shifter  is coupled to the output of one of the optical signal processing blocks, in this case . The outputs of block  and of phase shifter  are combined by a combiner . The combiner  has a destructive output port  and a constructive output port . The provision of complementary output ports provides for the ready cascadability of multiple logic blocks implemented as shown. Complementary inputs and outputs can also be obtained using inverters.","When both data inputs A and B have the same value, the PSK outputs of blocks  and  will have the same phase. When combined by the combiner , the outputs of block  and \u03c0-radian phase shifter  will therefore destructively interfere, leading to no output pulse at the constructive port  and an optical pulse at the destructive port . Conversely, when the data inputs A and B have different values, the phases of the PSK outputs of blocks  and  will have a \u03c0 radian difference. When combined by the combiner , the outputs of block  and \u03c0-radian phase shifter  will therefore constructively interfere, leading to an output pulse at the constructive port  and no optical pulse at the destructive port . As a result, A\u2295B is output via port  and its complement (NXOR) is output via port .","In order to prevent the feed-forward of the input OOK signals A, \u0100 and B, , the OOK-to-PSK converters of blocks ,  can be driven by a CW laser having a wavelength that differs from that with which the input signals are modulated. An OBPF for blocking the input signals while passing the output signals can be placed at the output of each converter ,  or after the combiner . In the alternative, the other techniques mentioned above can also be employed.","It is well known in the art that the XOR function is a key logic element for many functionalities, including pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generation, parity checking, and half addition, among others.","Optical PRBS can be generated using a linear optical shift register and feeding back the XOR result of the output at the end of the shift register and at least one tap point. An all-optical implementation of PRBS generation is described in A. J. Poustie, et al., \u201cAll-optical pseudorandom number generator,\u201d Optics Communication 159 (1999), pp. 208-214, where OOK XOR logic is implemented using SOA-based switching gates. However, no optical PRBS generator for other than OOK has been proposed before. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a multiple format (e.g., OOK and PSK) PRBS generator that enjoys reduced pattern dependence and hence the potential for a higher speed of operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","520","550","510","550","540","520"]},"The length of the shift register loop (shown in  as a dashed path) is equivalent to N bits and the temporal delay of the DI  is m bits. For example, N=15 and m=1 would generate a PRBS of length 2\u22121.","The XOR operation between the output at the end of the feedback loop and the tap point of the tap delay is accomplished at the directional coupler at the output of the DI . Note that this XOR is a special case of the general XOR operation described above in connection with . In , XOR between two independent data signals A and B is accomplished by interfering two converted PSK signals eand e. In the PRBS generator , the XOR is between two elements Aand Aof the same data sequence A. Hence, only one OOK-to-PSK converter  and a delay line interferometer  suffice to accomplish the operation.","The PRBS generator  may self-start from noise build-up within the circuit and generate non-maximal length (other than 2\u22121) or maximal length (2\u22121) PRBS. Alternatively, the generator  may be forced to produce maximal length PRBS by applying a properly timed trigger pulse. A possible point for applying such a trigger pulse is the non-inverted input of the OOK-to-PSK converter , as shown in .","The output of the DI  is coupled to an OOK wavelength converter block , which is in turn coupled to the input of the OOK-to-PSK converter . The wavelength converter block  comprises a first all-optical OOK wavelength converter (WC)  coupled to the non-inverted output A of the DI  and a second all-optical WC  coupled to the complementary output \u0100 of the DI . The outputs of the WCs  and  are in turn, coupled to optical band pass filters (OBPF)  and , respectively.","The WCs  and  are driven by a CW laser of a first wavelength \u03bb, whereas the OOK-to-PSK converter  is driven by a CW laser of a second wavelength \u03bb. A PSK-formatted signal generated by the OOK-to-PSK converter  and fed-back via the feedback loop  to the DI  will have a wavelength of \u03bb. The complementary OOK outputs A, \u0100 of the DI  will also have a wavelength of \u03bb. The wavelength converters ,  generate OOK formatted signals A, \u0100 modulated at the wavelength \u03bb. Because the original signals A, \u0100 modulated at the wavelength \u03bbcan feed-forward through the WCs , , the OBPFs  and  are included to pass the \u03bb-modulated OOK signals A, \u0100 while blocking the \u03bb-modulated OOK signals A, \u0100. Likewise, because the OOK signals A, \u0100 modulated at the wavelength \u03bbcan feed-forward through the SOAs of the OOK-to-PSK converter , the OBPF  is provided to pass the \u03bb-modulated PSK signal while blocking the \u03bb-modulated OOK signals A, \u0100.","Note that an advantageous feature of the PRBS generator of the present invention is the ability to provide an output in either an OOK or a DPSK\/PSK format. Points in the generator  from which OOK and PSK signals can be output are shown in . As such, the PRBS generator of the present invention can be referred to as a dual format all-optical PRBS generator.","The principles of the present invention can also be applied to implement an all-optical OR operation. As illustrated in , vector summation of the electric fields (E) of two OOK signals which are coherent and have the same wavelength, with a relative phase offset of 120\u00b0 (2\u03c0\/3 radians) achieves a binary OR operation of the intensity (I) or power of the two signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["700","700","701","702","701","702","711","712","721","722","711","712","100","721","722","735","721","722","722","721","735","743"]},"Alternatively, the filters ,  can be placed after the combiner .

Further filtering can be provided after the combiner  (by at least one of the aforementioned filters or an additional filter) to clean-up the output waveform if need be.","Note that changing the phase shift introduced by phase shifter  to 180\u00b0 (\u03c0radians) would yield an XOR function at the output of combiner .

The filer  can be implemented using an optical bandpass filter, for example. Note that like the embodiment of , filtering to block the input signals may be provided before the combiner .","Note that the embodiment of  is preferably used for applications in which the data rate of the signals combined is commensurate with the recovery speed of the NOEs; the faster the recovery speed of the NOEs, the higher the data rate. If that is not the case, however, the embodiment of  is better suited. Also, as with the other devices described, although a continuous wave (CW) signal is shown in  as being provided to the NOEs, other periodic signals can be used as well, such as a train of optical pulses.","The maximum speed at which all-optical OR operation can be performed is a function of the recovery speeds of the gain and phase of the nonlinear optical elements used. As discussed, the nonlinear optical elements could be nonlinear optical glass, whose response time is effectively instantaneous, or semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), whose response time is on the order of 10-100 ps. For nonlinear optical elements having practically instantaneous response times, an arrangement similar to that shown in  should suffice for performing optical OR operations satisfactorily at speeds only limited by the response speed.","The impact of the non-instantaneous response times of the nonlinear optical elements manifests itself as pattern-dependent distortion of the logic circuit output signal. The distortion is more severe if the input data consists of long streams of logic 1's followed by long streams of logic 0's, or vice versa. The pattern-dependent penalties can be mitigated either by applying optical equalizer filters to the output of the logic circuit, or by rearranging the input to the logic circuit. One example of such strategies is shown in  in which a replica of an input data signal is time-delayed and modulates a SOA which is substantially identical to the SOA modulated by the non-delayed input data. The splitting ratio and the temporal delays between the two replicas can be adjusted depending on the response speed of the SOAs and the data rate. This configuration is functionally equivalent to a one-tap equalizer filter, or a delay-line interferometer, whose power splitting ratio and delay are identical to those of the differential input stage. The mitigation scheme shown in  is effective when the data rate is roughly similar to the inverse of the SOA response time.","When the data rate is substantially higher than the inverse of the response time of the nonlinear elements, other exemplary configurations, such as those shown in  can be employed to mitigate any pattern-dependent penalties. Like the embodiment of , the OR gate configurations shown in  entail vector addition of two coherent optical fields having a relative optical phase difference of 120\u00b0 (27\u03c0\/3 radians). Unlike the embodiment of , the embodiments of  include input ports for accepting complementary input data signals \u0100 and . With such an arrangement, each SOA receives a nearly constant stream of pulses except for the slight temporal shifts depending on whether the pulse in the bit slot is the A (or B) data signal or its complement \u0100 (or ).","As shown in , device  is implemented similarly to device  of , as described above, except that the complement of each data signal is also provided as an input. In device , the complement of each data signal is combined with the CW signal and the combined signal is coupled into the input ports of the SOAs in SOA-MZI structures ,  of optical signal processing blocks , . Preferably, the intensity of each data signal and its complement are comparable at the SOA inputs. This arrangement serves to reduce the fluctuations of the optical powers coupled into the SOAs. As a result, patterning effects are minimized.","As with device  of , device  shown in  employs complementary input data to reduce pattern-dependent signal distortion. Optical signal processing blocks  and  of device  include OOK-to-PSK converters , , respectively, which receive the complementary OOK input data signals and generate coherent PSK modulated output signals. As in devices  and , the coherent signals are then filtered by filters , , a relative optical phase difference of 120\u00b0 (27\u03c0\/3 radians) is introduced by phase shifter  and the signals are combined by combiner . Additionally, as described below, the output of combiner  is further combined at combiner  with a 60\u00b0 (\u03c0\/3 radians) phase shifted clock signal (CLK) to yield the final output.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A through 11E","FIG. 10","FIG. 11C","FIG. 11D","FIG. 11C","FIG. 11E"],"b":["1000","1000","1045","1043","1000","1011","1012"]},"As can be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, there may be several equivalent topologies for implementing the various devices described above.
