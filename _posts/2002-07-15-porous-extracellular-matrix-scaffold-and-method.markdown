One such extracellular matrix is small intestine submucosa (SIS). SIS has been used to repair, support, and stabilize a wide variety of anatomical defects and traumatic injuries. Commercially-available SIS material is derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa that remodels to the qualities of its host when implanted in human soft tissues. Further, it is taught that the SIS material provides a natural matrix with a three-dimensional microstructure and biochemical composition that facilitates host cell proliferation and supports tissue remodeling. Indeed, SIS has been shown to contain biological molecules, such as growth factors and glycosaminoglycans that aid in the repair of soft tissue of the human body. The SIS material currently being used in the orthopaedic field is provided in a dried and layered configuration in the form of a patch to repair or regenerate soft tissue such as tendons, ligaments and rotator cuffs.","While small intestine submucosa is readily available, other sources of ECM are known to be effective for tissue remodeling. These sources include, but are not limited to, stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory, or genital submucosa, or liver basement membrane. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,379,710, 6,171,344; 6,099,567; and 5,554,389, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Further, while SIS is most often porcine derived, it is known that various submucosa materials may also be derived from non-porcine sources, including bovine and ovine sources. Additionally, the ECM material may also include partial layers of laminar muscularis mucosa, muscularis mucosa, lamina propria, stratum compactum and\/or other such tissue materials depending upon factors such as the source from which the ECM material was derived and the delamination procedure.","As used herein, it is within the definition of a naturally occurring extracellular matrix to clean, delaminate, and\/or comminute the extracellular matrix, or to cross-link the collagen or other components within the extracellular matrix. It is also within the definition of naturally occurring extracellular matrix to fully or partially remove one or more components or subcomponents of the naturally occurring matrix. However, it is not within the definition of a naturally occurring extracellular matrix to separate and purify the natural components or subcomponents and reform a matrix material from purified natural components or subcomponents. Thus, while reference is made to SIS, it is understood that other naturally occurring extracellular matrices (e.g. stomach, bladder, alimentary, respiratory, and genital submucosa, and liver basement membrane), whatever the source (e.g. bovine, porcine, ovine) are within the scope of this disclosure. Thus, in this application, the terms \u201cnaturally occurring extracellular matrix\u201d or \u201cnaturally occurring ECM\u201d are intended to refer to extracellular matrix material that has been cleaned, processed, sterilized, and optionally crosslinked. The following patents, hereby incorporated by reference, disclose the use of ECMs for the regeneration and repair of various tissues: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,379,710; 6,187,039; 6,176,880; 6,126,686; 6,099,567; 6,096,347; 5,997,575; 5,993,844; 5,968,096; 5,955,110; 5,922,028; 5,885,619; 5,788,625; 5,762,966; 5,755,791; 5,753,267; 5,733,337; 5,711,969; 5,645,860; 5,641,518; 5,554,389; 5,516,533; 5,460,962; 5,445,833; 5,372,821; 5,352,463; 5,281,422; and 5,275,826.","The manipulation of scaffold pore size, porosity, and interconnectivity is an important science contributing to the field of tissue engineering (Ma and Zhang, 2001, J Biomed Mater Res, 56(4):469-477; Ma and Choi, 2001 Tissue Eng, 7(1):23-33) because it is believed that the consideration of scaffold pore size and density\/porosity influences the behavior of cells and the quality of tissue regenerated. In fact, several researchers have shown that different pore sizes influence the behavior of cells in porous three-dimensional matrices. For example, it has been demonstrated in the art that for adequate bone regeneration to occur scaffold pore size needs to be at least 100 microns (Klawitter et al., 1976, J Biomed Mater Res, 10(2):311-323). For pore sizes and interconnectivity less than that, poor quality bone is regenerated and if pore size is between 10-40 microns bone cells are able to form only soft fibro-vascular tissue (White and Shors, 1991, Dent Clin North Am, 30:49-67). The consensus of research for bone regeneration indicates that the requisite pore size for bone regeneration is 100-600 microns (Shors, 1999, Orthop Clin North Am, 30(4):599-613; Wang, 1990, Nippon Seikeigeka Gakki Zasshi, 64(9):847-859). It is generally known in the art that optimal bone regeneration occurs for pore sizes between 300-600 microns.","Similarly, for the regeneration of soft orthopaedic tissues, such as ligament, tendon, cartilage, and fibro-cartilage, scaffold pore size is believed to have a substantial effect. For example, basic research has shown that cartilage cells (chondrocytes) exhibit appropriate protein expression (type II collagen) in scaffolds with pore sizes of the order of 20 microns and tend to dedifferentiate to produce type I collagen in scaffolds with nominal porosity of about 80 microns (Nehrer et al., 1997, Biomaterials, 18(11):769-776). More recently, it has been shown that cells that form ligaments, tendons, and blood vessels (fibroblasts and endothelial cells) exhibit significantly different activity when cultured on scaffolds with differing pore sizes ranging from 5 to 90 microns (Salem et al., 2002, J Biomed Mater Res, 61(2):212-217).","According to one illustrative embodiment, there is provided a method of making an implantable scaffold for repairing damaged or diseased tissue. The method includes the step of suspending, mixing, or otherwise placing pieces of a naturally occurring extracellular matrix material in a liquid. The naturally occurring extracellular matrix material and the liquid are formed into a mass. The liquid is subsequently driven off so as to form interstices in the mass. In one specific implementation of this exemplary embodiment, the liquid is driven off by freeze drying the naturally occurring extracellular matrix material and the liquid in which it is suspended. In such a manner, the liquid is sublimed thereby forming the interstices in the mass.","The material density and pore size of the scaffold may be varied by controlling the rate of freezing of the suspension. The amount of water into which the pieces of naturally occurring extracellular matrix material is suspended may also be varied to control the material density and pore size of the resultant scaffold.","In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, there is provided an implantable scaffold for repairing or regenerating tissue which is prepared by the process described above.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides an implantable scaffold for repairing or regenerating body tissue. The scaffold comprises a porous body of naturally occurring extracellular matrix pieces that are interconnected to define an interior surface of the body. The interior surface has a three-dimensional topography of irregular shape.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides an implantable device for repairing or regenerating body tissue. The device comprises a three-dimensional reticulated foam comprising a plurality of interconnected pores. The interconnected pores define three-dimensional interconnected passageways having irregular shapes. At least part of the reticulated foam comprises naturally occurring extracellular matrix.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of making an implantable device for repairing or regenerating body tissue. The method comprises the steps of providing a naturally occurring extracellular matrix material in a raw form, comminuting the raw naturally occurring extracellular matrix in the presence of a liquid to form a slurry of naturally occurring extracellular matrix, and lyophilizing the slurry of naturally occurring extracellular matrix to form a reticulated foam of naturally occurring extracellular matrix.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of making an implantable scaffold for repairing or regenerating body tissue. The method comprises the steps of providing a naturally occurring extracellular matrix material in a raw form, comminuting the raw naturally occurring extracellular matrix to form cohesive pieces of naturally occurring extracellular matrix, and lyophilizing the cohesive pieces of naturally occurring extracellular matrix to form a reticulated foam of naturally occurring extracellular matrix.","The implantable devices disclosed herein are three dimensional, porous scaffolds of ECMs like SIS. As such, it is evident that an implant based on the teachings of the present disclosure will have the dual advantage of having not only the appropriate biochemistry (collagens, growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, etc. naturally found in such ECMs) but also the appropriate physical microstructure to enable desired cellular activity upon implantation. These implantable devices are likely to find therapeutic use in the orthopaedic field, for devices used in the treatment of diseased or damaged fibro-cartilage such as the meniscus, diseased or damaged articular cartilage, and diseased or damaged bone.","The above and other features of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following description and the attached drawings.","The present disclosure relates to a porous scaffold for implanting into the body of a patient to repair or regenerate damaged or diseased tissue. The porous scaffold is constructed from a naturally occurring extracellular material. For example, the scaffold may be constructed from SIS. As will be discussed herein in greater detail, both the material density and the pore size of the porous scaffold may be varied to fit the needs of a given scaffold design.","Such porous scaffolds may be fabricated by suspending pieces of an extracellular matrix material in a liquid. As used herein, the term \u201cpiece\u201d is intended to mean any fiber, strip, ribbon, sliver, filament, shred, bit, fragment, part, flake, slice, cut, chunk, or other portion of solid or solid-like material. Also, as used herein, the term \u201csuspending\u201d is intended to include any placement of a solid (e.g., pieces of ECM) in a liquid whether or not an actual suspension is created. As such, the term \u201csuspending\u201d is intended to include any mixing of a solid in a liquid or any other placement of a solid in a liquid. As a result, the term \u201csuspension\u201d is likewise not intended to be limited to suspensions, but rather is intended to mean any mass having a solid present in a liquid.","In any event, the suspension of the pieces of extracellular matrix material and the liquid forms a mass in the form of, for example, a \u201cslurry\u201d. The liquid may then be subsequently driven off of the mass so as to form interstices therein. The liquid may be driven off in a number of different manners. For example, as will herein be described in greater detail, the liquid may be driven off via sublimation in a freeze drying process. Alternatively, the liquid may also be driven off by subjecting the suspension to either an unheated vacuum process or a vacuum under a controlled heating process. The liquid may also be driven off from the suspension ultrasonically. Microwave energy, RF energy, UV energy, or any other type of energy (or combination thereof) may also be utilized to drive the liquid off of the suspension. Liquid may also be driven off of the suspension by forcing or drawing air through the suspension. The suspension may be centrifuged to drive off the liquid. Moreover, the liquid may include a water-soluble filler which is driven off, for example, by use of an alcohol. In short, the present disclosure contemplates the driving off of the liquid from the suspension by any liquid removal process.","As alluded to above, while any of the aforementioned processes for driving off the liquid from the suspension may be utilized, along with any other process known by one skilled in the art, the processes of the present disclosure will herein be exemplary described in regard to a lyophilization process (i.e., freeze drying). However, it should be understood that such a description is merely exemplary in nature and that any one or more of the aforedescribed processes for driving off the liquid from the suspension may be utilized to fit the needs of a given scaffold design or process design.","As alluded to above, one useful process for fabricating the porous scaffolds of the present disclosure is by lyophilization. In this case, pieces of an extracellular matrix material are suspended in a liquid. The suspension is then frozen and subsequently lyophilized. Freezing the suspension causes the liquid to be turned to ice crystals. These ice crystals are then sublimed under vacuum during the lyophilization process thereby leaving interstices in the material in the spaces previously occupied by the ice crystals. The material density and pore size of the resultant scaffold may be varied by controlling, amongst other things, the rate of freezing of the suspension and\/or the amount of water in which the extracellular matrix material is suspended in at the on-set of the freezing process.","As a specific example of this process, fabrication of a porous SIS scaffold by lyophilization will be described in detail. However, it should be appreciated that although the example is herein described in regard to an SIS scaffold, fabrication of a scaffold constructed from other extracellular matrix materials may also be performed in a similar manner.","The first step in fabricating a porous scaffold with a desired pore size and density is the procurement of comminuted SIS. Illustratively, scissor-cut SIS runners (\u02dc6\u2033 long) are positioned in a 1700 series Comitrol\u2122 machine, commercially available from Urschel Laboratories (Valparaiso, Ind.). The SIS material is processed in the presence of a liquid and thereafter collected in a receptacle at the output of the machine. The material is then processed through the machine a second time under similar conditions. In one exemplary process, a liquid (e.g., water) is introduced into the input of the machine contemporaneously with the SIS material. The resultant material is a \u201cslurry\u201d of SIS material (thin, long SIS fibers \u02dc200 microns thick\u00d71-5 mm long) suspended in a substantially uniform manner in water. Although the suspension is herein described as being formed as a byproduct of the comminuting process, it should be appreciated that the pieces of SIS may be suspended in the liquid (i.e., water) in other manners known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, while other methods are known for comminuting SIS, it is understood that for the purposes of the present disclosure, comminuted SIS comprises, ribbon-like or string-like fibers wherein at least some of the individual pieces of ECM and SIS material have lengths greater than their widths and thicknesses. Such fibers may be interlaced to provide a felt-like material, if desired.","Process parameters can be varied using the above-identified 1700 series Comitrol\u2122 machine, including the choice of blade used, whether water is used, the amount of water used, the speed at which the blades turn, and the number of times the material is passed through the machine. As an example, cutting head 140084-10 and a Vericut, sealed impeller from Urschel Laboratories may be used, with a flow of water of about two (2) gallons per minute, with the blade running at a constant speed of about 9300 rpm. A first pass through the machine at these parameters will produce fibrous SIS material of varying sizes, and a second pass will produce SIS fibers of a more uniform size. By way of example, the comminuted material may be tested to determine if it has the consistency of that which is desired for use in regard to the illustrative embodiments described herein by the following process: the comminuted SIS suspension or slurry is centrifuged, excess water is poured off and the remaining slurry is poured into a dish. By hand, a small amount of the comminuted SIS material in the dish is pinched between the thumb and index finger and gently lifted from the dish. Illustratively, at least a small amount of additional SIS, beyond the portion pinched between the thumb and index finger, will lift along with the material that has been pinched (\u201cpinch test\u201d). This additional comminuted SIS material lifts with the material that is between the thumb and index finger because the individual pieces of comminuted SIS material are commingled or intertwined.","The terms \u201ccohesive ECM\u201d, \u201ccohesive SIS\u201d, \u201ccohesive ECM pieces\u201d and \u201ccohesive SIS pieces\u201d are used herein to respectively denote ECM or SIS material that has been comminuted or otherwise physically processed to produce ECM or SIS pieces that are capable of comingling or intertwining (in the wet or dry state) to form a mass of discrete pieces of ECM or SIS that remain massed together under some conditions (such as under gravity), regardless of the shape or shapes of the individual ECM or SIS pieces. One method of demonstrating that the ECM or SIS material comprises cohesive pieces is the \u201cpinch test\u201d described in the preceding paragraph. Examination of the final ECM or SIS product produced may also provide evidence that the base material comprised cohesive ECM or SIS pieces. Illustratively, the ECM or SIS pieces are sufficiently cohesive to each other (or to other pieces in the mix or slurry) that they remain unified throughout the process used to produce the foam structure. Examples of cohesive SIS pieces are shown in the scanning electron microscopic images of .","Thereafter, the comminuted SIS suspension is frozen and lyophilized (i.e., freeze dried). In particular, the SIS suspension is frozen at a controlled rate of temperature drop to control the size of the formed ice crystals. Once frozen, and without allowing the material to thaw, the lyophilization process sublimes the ice crystals directly to a vapor under vacuum and low temperatures. This leaves voids or interstices in the spaces previously occupied by the ice crystals.","Any commercially available freezer for freezing the suspension to a desired temperature may be used. Likewise, any commercially available lyophilizer may be used for the lyophilization process. One exemplary machine for performing the lyophilization process is a Virtis Genesis\u2122 Series lyophilizer which is commercially available from SP Industries, Inc. of Gardiner, N.Y.","The process parameters of the aforedescribed fabrication process may be varied to produce scaffolds of varying pore sizes and material densities. For example, the rate at which the suspension is frozen, the amount of water present in the suspension, or the compactness of the extracellular matrix material may be varied to produce scaffolds of varying pore sizes and material densities.","For instance, to produce scaffolds having a relatively large pore size and a relatively low material density, the extracellular matrix suspension may be frozen at a slow, controlled rate (e.g., \u22121\u00b0 C.\/min or less) to a temperature of about \u221220\u00b0 C., followed by lyophilization of the resultant mass. To produce scaffolds having a relatively small pore size and a relatively high material density, the extracellular matrix material may be tightly compacted by centrifuging the material to remove a portion of the liquid (e.g., water) in a substantially uniform manner prior to freezing. Thereafter, the resultant mass of extracellular matrix material is flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen followed by lyophilization of the mass. To produce scaffolds having a moderate pore size and a moderate material density, the extracellular matrix material is first tightly compacted by centrifuging the material to remove a portion of the liquid (e.g., water) in a substantially uniform manner prior to freezing. Thereafter, the resultant mass of extracellular matrix material is frozen at a relatively fast rate (e.g., >\u22121\u00b0 C.\/min) to a temperature of about \u221280\u00b0 C. followed by lyophilization of the mass.","Example 1 demonstrates the fabrication of a porous SIS scaffold having a relatively large pore size and a relatively low material density. Such scaffolds are obtained by freezing a comminuted SIS suspension at a slow, controlled rate (\u22121\u00b0 C.\/min or less) to \u221220\u00b0 C., followed by lyophilization. The procedure is as follows. First, comminuted SIS is fabricated as described above. Specifically, scissor-cut SIS runners (\u02dc6\u2033 long) are placed in a suitable comminuting machine such as the Urschel Comitrol machine described above. The comminuted SIS is collected in a receptacle at the output of the machine. The collected material is then processed through the machine a second time, under the same conditions as before. The resultant mass is a \u201cslurry\u201d of SIS material (thin, long SIS fibers \u02dc200 microns thick\u00d71-5 mm long) suspended relatively uniformly in water.","Next, a slow-freeze ethanol bath is prepared as follows. Pour enough ethanol to obtain about a 1 centimeter head in a flat-bottomed plastic container large enough to hold four 24-well culture plates. Place the container in a \u221220\u00b0 C. freezer. The mass of each of four empty twenty-four well plates is then recorded. Under a sterile hood using sterile conditions, an approximately 3 ml aliquot of the comminuted SIS material is placed in each well of the tissue culture plates. The mass of each full plate of material is then recorded. The four culture plates are then placed into the ethanol freeze bath and allowed to freeze overnight.","The frozen plates are then removed from the ethanol bath and placed in a suitable lyophilization machine such as the Virtis Genesis Series lyophilizer described above. Without allowing the frozen SIS material to thaw, the process of lyophilization sublimes ice crystals directly to vapor under vacuum and low temperatures. This leaves voids or interstices in the spaces previously occupied by the ice crystals. In this case, the parameters used in the lyophilization process include a first period at a primary drying temperature of \u221213\u00b0 C. for 8 hours, followed by a second period at a secondary drying temperature of 35\u00b0 C. for 4 hours.","After the lyophilization cycle is complete, the plates are removed from the lyophilization machine and the mass of each plate is determined and recorded. The results from this process are summarized in the following table:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Average Volume","Average Mass","Average Density"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1.249 ml","0.007396 g","0.006 (g\/cc)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"A scanning electron image of the surface of the samples was taken to visualize the relative pore sizes. These pore sizes are about 600 microns to about 700 microns. An image indicative of the samples prepared in accordance with Example 1 is shown in .","Pore sizes can be determined from scanning electron microscope images of the exterior surface of the foam, as in  and , and of cross-sections of the foam, as in . These images may be used in conjunction with standard commercially available image analysis software to determine the ranges of pore sizes.  illustrate the results of using suitable commercially-available software to measure or estimate the pore sizes in the foam. This technique was used to determine that the Example 1 foam had pores in the range of 600-700 microns. The sample may also include smaller pores.","Example 2 demonstrates the fabrication of a porous SIS scaffold having a relatively moderate pore size and a relatively moderate material density. Such scaffolds are obtained by compacting the comminuted SIS material by centrifugation, freezing at a faster rate (relative to Example 1) and to a lower temperature (i.e., to \u221280\u00b0 C.), followed by lyophilization of the resultant mass. The procedure is as follows. First, comminuted SIS is fabricated as described above in regard to Example 1. Specifically, scissor-cut SIS runners (\u02dc6\u2033 long) is comminuted by two passes through a suitable comminuting machine to produce a \u201cslurry\u201d of SIS material (thin, long SIS fibers \u02dc200 microns thick\u00d71-5 mm long) suspended relatively uniformly in water.","Next, the mass of each of four empty twenty-four well plates is recorded. Under a sterile hood using sterile conditions, an approximately 3 ml aliquot of the comminuted SIS material is placed in each well of the tissue culture plates. The mass of each plate full of material is then recorded.","The plates are then balanced for centrifuging by use of the following technique. The two plates are placed on the balance, and RO water is added to the area in between the wells of the lighter plate until the two plates are balanced. The two plates are then placed across from one another in the centrifuge, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for seven minutes. Once done, the plates are removed from the centrifuge, and the water is emptied therefrom. The mass of each of the plates is then recorded. The centrifuging and mass measurement process is then repeated for the remaining plates.","The plates are then placed in a \u221280\u00b0 C. freezer until the specimen is fully frozen. Depending upon the bulk of the material, the time for full freezing can vary from about 1 to about 30 minutes, for example. The frozen plates are then removed from the freezer and placed in a suitable lyophilization machine and lyophilized under similar parameters to as described above in regard to Example 1 (i.e., for a first period at a primary drying temperature of \u221213\u00b0 C. for 8 hours, followed by a second period at a secondary drying temperature of 35\u00b0 C. for 4 hours).","After the lyophilization cycle is complete, the plates are removed from the lyophilization machine and the mass of each plate is determined and recorded. The results from this process are summarized in the following table:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Average Volume","Average Mass","Average Density"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0.285 ml","0.010104 g","0.035 (g\/cc)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As with the samples of Example 1, a scanning electron image of the surface of each of the samples prepared in accordance with Example 2 was taken to visualize the relative pore sizes. An image indicative of the samples prepared in accordance with Example 2 is shown in . Using the technique described above for determining pore size, this sample was found to have pores in the range of about 100-150 microns.","Example 3 demonstrates the fabrication of a porous SIS scaffold having a relatively small pore size and a relatively high material density. Such scaffolds are obtained by compacting the comminuted SIS material to an even higher density than in Example 2, flash-freezing the samples using liquid nitrogen, followed by lyophilization. The procedure is as follows. First, comminuted SIS is fabricated as described above in regard to Examples 1 and 2. Specifically, scissor-cut SIS runners (\u02dc6\u2033 long) is comminuted by two passes through a suitable comminuting machine to produce a \u201cslurry\u201d of SIS material (thin, long SIS fibers \u02dc200 microns thick \u00d71-5 mm long) suspended relatively uniformly in water. Once done, the resultant mass is centrifuged under a dead-weight. The dead weights are prepared as follows. Forty-eight strips of 3 M\u2122 COBAN\u2122 Self-Adherent Wrap (commercially available from 3 M\u2122 of St. Paul, MN) are cut into pieces that measure 50 mm in length and 5mm in width (unstretched). COBAN\u2122 Self-Adherent Wrap is a laminate of nonwoven material and elastic fibers placed lengthwise to provide elasticity. The elastic wrap contains a cohesive material that makes it stick to itself but not to other materials or skin. Thereafter, the pieces are stretched and wrapped around the outer edges of a polyethylene disk measuring 1 cm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness. Each strip is trimmed, if need be, so that the COBAN\u2122 Self-Adherent Wrap strips wrap around the disk two times.","Next, the mass of each of four empty twenty-four well plates is recorded. Under a sterile hood using sterile conditions, an approximately 3 ml aliquot of the comminuted SIS material is placed in each well of the tissue culture plates. The mass of each full plate of material is then recorded. The plates are then balanced and centrifuged as described above in regard to Example 2. Thereafter, the water is drained from the plates, and the mass of each of the centrifuged plates is recorded.","Once this is completed, the wells of the plates are combined at a ratio of 2:1 thereby reducing the number of plates from four to two. An attempt is made to combine low material wells with high material wells in order to have a somewhat consistent amount of SIS material in each well. The mass of each full plate is then recorded. The polyethylene disks wrapped with COBAN\u2122 Self-Adherent Wrap are then placed into each well. The two plates are then balanced using the technique described above in regard to Example 2. The plates are then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for five minutes. Thereafter, the plates are removed from the centrifuge, the water is emptied therefrom, and the polyethylene disks are also removed. The mass of each plate is again recorded. The two plates are balanced once again (in a manner similar to as described above in regard to Example 2), and the plates are again centrifuged at 3000 rpm for seven minutes. Once done, the water is emptied again from each of the plates, and the mass of each plate is again recorded.","Contemporaneously with the centrifuging process, a liquid nitrogen bath is prepared by pouring liquid nitrogen into a wide-mouthed liquid nitrogen container. The plates are kept in the centrifuge until the bath is ready. Thereafter, each plate is dipped into the bath and held in the liquid for approximately 15 seconds. Upon removal from the nitrogen bath, the plates are immediately placed in a \u221280\u00b0 C. freezer to prevent thawing. The frozen plates are then removed from the freezer and placed in a suitable lyophilization machine and lyophilized under similar parameters to as described above in regard to Examples 1 and 2 (i.e., for a first period at a primary drying temperature of \u221213\u00b0 C. for 8 hours, followed by a second period at a secondary drying temperature of 35\u00b0 C. for 4 hours).","After the lyophilization cycle is complete, the plates are removed from the lyophilization machine and the mass of each plate is determined and recorded. The results from this process are summarized in the following table:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Average Volume","Average Mass","Average Density"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0.786 ml","0.071563 g","0.091 (g\/cc)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As with the samples of Examples 1 and 2, a scanning electron image of the surface of each of the samples prepared in accordance with Example 3 was taken to visualize the relative pore sizes. An image indicative of the samples prepared in accordance with Example 3 is shown in . Using the technique described above for determining pore size, this sample was found to have pores in the range of about 40-60 microns. Such pore sizes are illustrated in , indicated by the arrows.","As shown in the scanning electron microscope images of , each of the illustrated ECM foams comprises a three-dimensional network of reticulated naturally occurring ECM defining a plurality of interconnected pores. The foam has these pores throughout its height, width, and thickness. The pores are open and interconnected to define a plurality of irregularly-shaped interconnected passageways leading from the exterior surface of the foam (see  and ) into the interior of the foam (see cross-sections ). These interconnected passageways are three-dimensional. As discussed above, the sizes of the pores, and therefore the maximum size for the interconnected passageways, can be controlled by controlling the manufacturing process as described above.","These interconnected passageways facilitate cell migration through the implant and enable efficient nutrient exchange in vivo. These interconnected passageways also provide a means of transmitting bioactive agents, biologically derived substances (e.g. stimulants), cells and\/or biological lubricants, biocompatible inorganic materials, synthetic polymers and biopolymers (e.g. collagen) throughout the length, width and thickness of the ECM prior to implantation. The interconnected passageways defined by the pores also serve as passageways for materials used during the manufacturing process, such as compounds used for chemically cross-linking the foam. These interconnected passageways as well as the outer surfaces of the foam may also serve as sites on which the above materials are carried.","As shown in the above examples, the process parameters can be varied to produce an ECM foam that has the desired porosity for the particular application. For example, it may be desirable to produce a foam with lower density (and higher porosity) for applications involving osteocytes and to produce a foam with higher density (and lower porosity) for applications involving chondrocytes.","Moreover, the ECM foams described herein may be crosslinked. Specifically, the ECM foams described herein may be either chemically or physically crosslinked.","As can be seen in the scanning electron microscopic images of , each of the illustrated ECM foams comprises interconnected pieces of naturally occurring extracellular matrix. As shown in the scanning electron microscope images of cross-sections of the ECM foams of , these interconnected pieces of naturally occurring extracellular matrix provide the foam with an interior surface having an three-dimensional topography of irregular shape. As shown in the scanning electron microscope images of the surfaces of the ECM foam, these interconnected pieces of naturally occurring extracellular matrix provide the foam with exterior surfaces having three-dimensional topographies of irregular shapes. With these irregular three-dimensional topographies and the interconnected passageways, the ECM foams of the present disclosure provide a relatively large surface area of naturally occurring ECM. Such a large surface area of naturally occurring ECM can be advantageous in providing a relatively large surface area to which biological agents, biologically derived agents, cells, biocompatible polymers and biocompatible inorganic materials can be affixed pre-implantation. In addition, the illustrated ECM foams provide a relatively large surface of area of naturally occurring ECM to which cells may attach in vivo.","ECM foam products can be made with substantially lower densities than those of other ECM products. For comparison, the density of the commercially available RESTORE\u00ae product (DePuy Orthopaedics. Inc. in Warsaw. Ind), an ECM laminate, is 0.466+\/\u22120.074 g\/cc. The DePuy product is described for use during rotator cuff surgery. and is provided as a resorbable framework that allows the rotator cuff tendon to regenerate itself. The RESTORE\u00ae Implant is derived from porcine small intestine submucosa that has been cleaned. disinfected, and sterilized. An ECM product consisting of comminuted and hardened SIS as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,719 entitled \u201cDevices from Naturally Occurring Biologically Derived Materials\u201d, has been made with a density of can be 0.74+\/\u22120.059 g\/cc. And, an ECM product consisting of toughened SIS laminate as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/195,794 entitled \u201cMeniscus Regeneration Device and Method\u201d has been made with a density of 0.933+\/\u22120.061 g\/cc.","As discussed above, the ECM foams of the present disclosure may be combined with bioactive agents, biologically derived substances, cells and\/or stimulants, biocompatible inorganic materials and\/or biocompatible polymers (e.g. biocompatible synthetic polymers and biopolymers) and combinations of two or more of these materials at the time of manufacture. Illustratively, cells can be seeded throughout the three-dimensional volume of the ECM foam; the biological materials can be dried on the ECM foam at manufacture; the biological materials and the ECM foam can be co-lyophilized; and the biological materials can be covalently linked to the ECM foam. It is contemplated to bond, cross-link, or otherwise incorporate one or more of these materials to the raw ECM material prior to formation of the ECM foam. Alternatively, the materials could be bonded, cross-linked, or otherwise incorporated to the final ECM foam after lyophilization. Finally, combinations of the above methods may be used. For example, an implant of covalently linked ECM foam and biological lubricant can be implanted and additional intra-articular injections of the same or different biological lubricants can be made at surgery, post-operatively, or both at surgery and post-operatively.","\u201cBioactive agents\u201d include one or more of the following: chemotactic agents; therapeutic agents (e.g. antibiotics, steroidal and non-steroidal analgesics and anti-inflammatories, anti-rejection agents such as immunosuppressants and anti-cancer drugs); various proteins (e.g. short chain peptides, bone morphogenic proteins, glycoprotein and lipoprotein); cell attachment mediators; biologically active ligands; integrin binding sequence; ligands; various growth and\/or differentiation agents (e.g. epidermal growth factor, IGF-I, IGF-II, TGF-\u03b2 I-III, growth and differentiation factors, vascular endothelial growth factors, fibroblast growth factors, platelet derived growth factors, insulin derived growth factor and transforming growth factors, parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone related peptide, bFGF; TGF superfamily factors; BMP-2; BMP-4; BMP-6; BMP-12; sonic hedgehog; GDF5; GDF6; GDF8; PDGF); small molecules that affect the upregulation of specific growth factors; tenascin-C; hyaluronic acid; chondroitin sulfate; fibronectin; decorin; thromboelastin; thrombin-derived peptides; heparin-binding domains; heparin; heparan sulfate; DNA fragments and DNA plasmids.

For example, the concepts of the present disclosure provide for the fabrication of a porous implantable scaffold which may have varying mechanical properties to fit the needs of a given scaffold design. For instance, the pore size and the material density may be varied to produce a scaffold having a desired mechanical configuration. In particular, such variation of the pore size and the material density of the scaffold is particularly useful when designing a scaffold which provides for a desired amount of cellular migration therethrough, while also providing a desired amount of structural rigidity. In addition, according to the concepts of the present disclosure, implantable devices can be produced that not only have the appropriate physical microstructure to enable desired cellular activity upon implantation, but also has the biochemistry (collagens, growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, etc.) naturally found in such ECMs.","Although it is believed that naturally occurring extracellular matrix provides advantages over purified extracellular matrix, it is contemplated that the teachings of the present disclosure can be applied to purified extracellular matrix as well. Thus, it is expected that the naturally occurring extracellular matrix could be purified prior to physically comminuting the extracellular matrix. This purification could comprise treating the naturally occurring extracellular matrix to remove substantially all materials other than collagen prior to physically comminuting the extracellular matrix. The purification could be carried out to substantially remove glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, lipids, non-collagenous proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).","While the disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and has herein be described in detail.
