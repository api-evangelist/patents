title: System and method for allocating a conditional purchase offer for a travel related services reservation to one of a plurality of entities in a buyer driven electronic commerce system
abstract: A system and method of allocating a conditional purchase offer for a product or service to one of a plurality of entities in a buyer-driven system. The conditional purchase offer for the product or service in a specified relevant market area is received and at least one of the plurality of entities capable of satisfying the conditional purchase offer are identified. A first-look opportunity to accept the conditional purchase offer is allocated to one of the identified entities and, if it is determined that that entity cannot accept the conditional purchase offer, then a second-look opportunity to accept the conditional purchase offer is provided to one of the remaining entities. The opportunity to accept the offer is provided to each entity according to the allocation until an entity accepts the conditional purchase offer or no eligible entities remain.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Hotel Product Allocation System","Automobile Rental Allocation System"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/179,008, filed Jan. 28, 2000.","The present application relates generally to a system for processing the sale of goods and services and, more particularly, to a system and method for the allocation of conditional purchase offers (\u201cCPOs\u201d) for travel related services reservations among multiple entities or sellers within a buyer-driven commerce system.","Most systems for processing the sale of products are seller-driven, whereby the seller prices, packages, configures and offers the product for sale, and the buyer decides whether or not to accept the seller's offer. In a buyer-driven system, however, the buyer dictates the terms of the offer and one or more sellers decide whether or not to accept the offer. A \u201chelp wanted\u201d advertisement, for example, is a buyer-driven inquiry since the employer is looking to locate and buy the services of a qualified employee. The inquiry is advertised to a large number of potential employees, who may respond by submitting their resumes to the prospective employer.","Priceline.com Incorporated of Norwalk, Conn. is a merchant that has successfully implemented a buyer-driven system for the sale of products such as airline tickets, hotel rooms and automobiles. Priceline.com utilizes a Conditional Purchase Offer Management System, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,207, U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/889,319, filed Jul. 8, 1997, and International Application No. PCT\/US97\/15492 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference), that processes CPO's received from individual consumers. These CPO's contain one or more buyer-defined conditions for the purchase of goods or services, at a buyer-defined price. The CPO's are typically guaranteed by a general-purpose account, such as a debit or credit account, and thereby provide sellers with a mechanism for enforcing any agreement that may be reached with the consumer. The CPO's are provided by the CPO management system to sellers, either directly or using seller-supplied rules, for individual sellers to either accept or reject. If a seller accepts a CPO, the CPO management system binds the buyer on behalf of the accepting seller, to form a legally binding contract.","Thus, the CPO management system empowers individual consumers to obtain goods and services at a price set by the consumer. The CPO management system provides numerous commercial advantages to sellers as well. For example, the CPO management system permits individual sellers to effectively sell excess capacity when actual demand fails to meet forecasted demand. In particular, the CPO management system provides an effective mechanism for sellers to be confident that if they accept a consumer's offer, the consumer will purchase the requested goods or services at the agreed-upon price, and not just use the information to ascertain the seller's underlying level of price flexibility, which, if known to a seller's competitors or customers, could impact the seller's overall revenue structure.","For some sellers, response to an individual CPO is difficult without significant re-engineering of the existing transaction processing system. As a result, these sellers empower an agent to manage buyer-driven commerce transactions. These sellers become agency-based sellers, with a CPO management system acting as their agent. With multiple agency-based sellers, there is a need for efficient CPO management systems and methods to allocate CPO's among the agency-based sellers so as to maximize revenue for the agency-based seller and CPO management system.","For broadcast-based sellers, some form of allocation may also be desirable and\/or necessary. For example, it may be desirable to allocate CPO's among broadcast-based sellers serial transmission to such sellers. Alternatively, if the CPO is sent simultaneously to multiple broadcast-based sellers, it may be desirable to have a method for allocating the CPO where two broadcast-based sellers respond at the same time. As such, there is a need for efficient CPO management systems and methods to optimize the allocation of resources and for the maximization of revenue generation.","In one embodiment, a system and method is provided for allocating a conditional purchase offer (\u201cCPO\u201d) for a hotel reservation or other travel related services to one of a plurality of entities in a buyer-driven system. The CPO for a hotel reservation in a specified relevant market area is received and at least one of the plurality of entities capable of satisfying the CPO is identified. A first-look opportunity to accept the CPO is allocated to one of the identified entities and, if it is determined that none of the hotels associated with that entity can accept the CPO, then a second-look opportunity to accept the CPO is provided to one of the remaining entities. In other embodiments, the first-look and second-look opportunities are allocated based on a variety of criteria or metrics, including negotiated preferences with certain sellers or suppliers that increase their allocation priority. The CPO allocation system and method of the present application may also be used in the sale of various other goods and services, including, but not limited to, rental cars, airline tickets, insurance, gasoline, supermarket products and consumer products.","The figures are understood to provide representative illustration of the invention and are not limiting in their content. The leading reference numeral(s) indicates the first figure in which that reference number is introduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","110","100","130","140","150","160","100"]},"As used herein and in the claims, the following terms are defined to mean:\n\n","As shown in , the CPO management system  preferably includes a central controller , discussed further below in conjunction with . The CPO management system  may provide a given CPO to selected sellers , , ,  based on pre-defined screening criteria, so that sellers only obtain CPO's that they may be interested in or are authorized to screen or have the potential to fulfill. Alternatively, the CPO management system  may provide all CPO's to all sellers for screening.","As discussed further below, each buyer  contacts the CPO management system , for example, by means of telephone, facsimile, online access (i.e., the Internet), electronic mail, in-person contact or through an agent, and provides the CPO management system  with the terms of the buyer's CPO. It is noted that each buyer  and seller , , ,  may employ a general-purpose computer for communicating with the CPO management system . Though not illustrated, the general-purpose computer is preferably comprised of a processing unit, a communication device (e.g., a modem), memory means and any software required to communicate with the CPO management system .","The CPO management system , as well as any general-purpose computers utilized by buyers  or sellers , , ,  (collectively, the \u201cnodes\u201d) preferably transmit digitally encoded data and other information between one another. The communication links between the nodes preferably comprise a cable, fiber or wireless link on which electronic signals can propagate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","205","210","220","225","230","240","205","240","200","110","130","140","150","160","240"]},"In one embodiment, the central controller  operates as a web server providing a web page accessible on the world wide web, both for receiving and transmitting CPO's generated by buyer . The buyer  and seller , , ,  may use conventional communications software such as the Netscape Navigator browser to communicate with the central controller  of the CPO management system . In this manner, the buyer  using the web browser may communicate with the CPO management system  (e.g., submit the CPO) by accessing or logging on to the web page associated with the central controller  on the world wide web.","The ROM  and\/or data storage device  are operable to store one or more instructions, discussed further below, which the CPU  is operable to retrieve, interpret and execute. For example, the ROM  and\/or data storage device  preferably store processes to accomplish the transfer of required payments, charges and debits between the sellers , , ,  and buyers . The processing of such accounting transactions are preferably secured in a conventional manner, for example, using well-known cryptographic techniques.","The data storage device  preferably includes at least a seller database , a buyer database , an offer database  and a seller rules database . The seller database  preferably stores information on each seller , , ,  that is registered with the CPO management system  to sell goods or services to CPO buyers, including contact information. The buyer database  preferably stores information on each buyer of the CPO management system , including identification information and billing information, such as a credit card number. The offer database  preferably contains a record of each CPO being processed by the CPO management system , including the conditions associated with the CPO and the associated status. The seller rules database  preferably maintains the CPO rules for one or more agency-based sellers , .","In addition, the data storage device  preferably includes a CPO evaluation process  and a rules evaluation subroutine . Generally, the CPO evaluation process : (i) receives each CPO from a buyer ; (ii) provides each CPO to the appropriate broadcast-based sellers ,  and evaluates each CPO against the appropriate rules of each agency-based seller , ; and (iii) determines whether any sellers , , ,  accept the CPO. The rules evaluation subroutine  is a subroutine executed by the CPO evaluation process , which receives a CPO and compares the CPO against the rules of one or more agency-based sellers ,  to generate a response on behalf of the sellers to the given CPO.","In an embodiment of the present application illustrated in , the CPO management system  receives and processes a CPO, such as a hotel request, from one or more buyers . As previously described with reference to , the buyer  provides the CPO management system  with the buyer's CPO by means of, for example, telephone, facsimile, online access (i.e., the Internet), electronic mail, in-person contact or through an agent. Each buyer  and seller , , ,  may employ a general-purpose computer for communicating with the CPO management system  over communication links, such as a cable, fiber or wireless link on which electronic signals (e.g., digitally encoded data) can propagate.","In addition, one or more sellers , , ,  may utilize a computerized reservation system (not shown), such as a central reservation system (\u201cCRS\u201d) (e.g., Marriott Marsha, Pegasus, Wizcom, Apollo), Global Distribution System (\u201cGDS\u201d) (e.g., Worldspan, Sabre) or other booking engine, that contains information concerning the availability and price of hotel rooms provided by that seller and can be used to book reservations for such hotel rooms. The CPO management system  may communicate with the computerized reservation system to confirm availability at the rate and dates specified in the CPO and to reserve a hotel room if the CPO is accepted. Preferably, a communication link (e.g., cable, fiber, telephone line, wireless link, etc.) between the communications port  and the computerized reservation system permits the central controller  and CPO management system  to communicate with the seller's computerized reservation system.","The central controller  or similar computer apparatus processes the CPO received from buyer . Before processing the CPO, it may be desirable to normalize the data string associated with the CPO with an Offer Table stored in a database accessible to the controller . It may also be desirable for the central controller  to confirm that the buyer  provided a credit card number or other secured payment method before continuing to process the CPO.","In addition, before processing the CPO, it may be desirable for the central controller  to validate the CPO by, for example, comparing the specified date in the CPO (e.g., the desired hotel check-in\/arrival date) to the current date and time to assure that there is sufficient time to process the CPO before the date specified in the CPO, and\/or verifying that the dollar amount specified in the CPO is above a minimum threshold level for the quality of the service specified in the CPO. For instance, with respect to hotel services, hotels are commonly categorized based upon the quality of service provided using what is known as a \u201cstar rating\u201d (i.e., five star, four star, three star, two star and one star hotel) or some other equivalent classification. A table of minimum threshold prices for each star rating level may be maintained in a database accessible by the central controller  to facilitate comparing the dollar amount specified in the CPO to the minimum threshold level for the minimum star rating level specified in the CPO. In order to avoid unnecessary processing, if the dollar amount specified in the CPO is not equal to or greater than the minimum threshold level, then the central controller  may reject and terminate processing the CPO and inform the buyer  that the CPO management system  was unable to satisfy the CPO.","Similarly, as part of the validation process, it may be desirable for the controller  to determine that the CPO is unique to prevent a buyer  from repeatedly \u201cpinging\u201d the CPO management system  to determine the underlying pricing structure. For example, the central controller  may check for duplicate CPO's by comparing the conditions specified in the present CPO (e.g., credit card number, check-in (arrival)\/check-out (departure) dates, and geographic location or zone specified in the present CPO) to those stored and maintained in a CPO database for a predetermined period (e.g., the past seven days) and reject any CPO that matches a previous CPO stored in the CPO database within that predetermined period.","To process the CPO in accordance with the present application, which is preferably done after the CPO has been validated, the central controller  searches a table of potential sellers stored and maintained in a database accessible to the controller to filter for potential sellers that may be able to satisfy the CPO. In the context of hotel rooms, this table may be, for example, a Hotel Property Table listing, among other things, participating hotels (e.g., hotels that are participating and\/or in partnership with the provider of the service processing the CPO), the hotels' respective locations (e.g., metro region, city, etc.), the hotels' respective star ratings or other classification indicating quality of service, and the brand and owner associated with each respective hotel (hereinafter referred to as an \u201centity\u201d).","Thus, in step  in , the central controller  preferably searches the Hotel Property Table to identify all participating and enabled hotels or sellers that can satisfy the CPO and are: (a) greater than or equal to the minimum star rating specified by the buyer  in the CPO, and (b) located in the geographic zone, region or city specified in the CPO by the buyer . If no hotels or sellers match conditions (a) and (b) above, then the CPO is preferably rejected in step  and the CPO management system  terminates the processing of the CPO and informs the buyer  that it was unable to satisfy the CPO.","If, however, at least one hotel or seller is identified in step  as matching conditions (a) and (b) above, then the central controller  preferably ranks those hotels and\/or sellers that can satisfy the CPO in step  to determine the order that each hotel or seller will be searched for availability and rates on a first pass through the booking engine (i.e., first-look opportunity). A preferred ranking\/allocation process is described below.","Referring to , after at least one participating and enabled hotel property is identified in step  as being capable of satisfying the CPO, the central controller  identifies the entity (i.e., brand and\/or multi-property owner) that is associated with the identified hotel property in step . This may be accomplished by searching the Hotel Property Table, which maintains and stores, among other things, the entity (i.e., brand and\/or multi-property owner) that is associated with each hotel property. A particular identified hotel property may have no more than one brand (e.g., Marriott, Hilton, etc.) and one multi-property owner (e.g., Marriott, Starwood, REIT, etc.). However, if the hotel property has neither a participating brand nor multi-property owner associated with it, then the property is considered to be an \u201cIndependent\u201d entity. A hotel property that is enabled may (1) belong to a multi-property owner, (2) belong to a brand, or (3) be an independent entity, that participates in the buyer-driven system. If a hotel property belongs to an independent entity, however, it is not associated with a multi-property owner or brand. By belonging to a multi-property owner or brand, a hotel property may enhance its chances of allocation. In fact, in one embodiment of this allocation system, allocation preferences may be based upon negotiated preferences with certain entities or sellers that increase their allocation priority.","Once the CPO management system  identifies those entities associated with hotel properties capable of satisfying the CPO in step , then the central controller  preferably uses each identified entity's room share for the relevant market, region or area specified by the buyer  in the CPO to allocate the first-look opportunity to the identified entity having the largest \u201cnegative\u201d differential (\u201crelevant market share gap\u201d) between the percentage of first-look opportunities previously allocated to that entity and that entity's relevant market room share. Alternatively, the first-look opportunity may be allocated to one of the entities identified in step  based on relevant room market share for the market\/region specified by the buyer  in the CPO (e.g., highest relevant market room share).","A particular entity's relevant room market share is calculated by first determining the number of hotel rooms that particular entity (brand, owner or independent) has within the market, zone or region specified by the buyer  in the CPO. Because an entity may have more than one hotel property located within the specified market, zone or region, the number of rooms associated with a particular entity may include more than one hotel property located within the specified market, zone or region. In the event that the location specified in the CPO is not a mapped market or region (e.g., a list of hotels within a specified geographic area), then the CPO management system  may utilize a blended market share for all non-mapped areas (e.g., total market share less the market share for all mapped areas\/regions). The particular entity's relevant market room share is then calculated by dividing the total number of rooms that entity has within the specified market by the total number of rooms for all hotels within the specified market. Alternatively, an entity's relevant market room share may be calculated by dividing the number of hotel rooms an entity has within the specified market, zone or region by the aggregate total number of hotel rooms located within that specified market, zone or region. A preprogrammed data look-up table may be utilized in lieu of dynamic acquisition of the data to calculate relevant market room share.","The \u201crelevant market share gap\u201d for a particular entity is then calculated in step  by subtracting that entity's relevant market room share from the percentage of first-look opportunities previously provided to that entity in the specified market. This is done for each entity identified in step  and the entities are ranked or ordered according to their relevant market share gap over a predefined period of time. In step , the entity having the largest \u201cnegative\u201d relevant market share gap is allocated the first-look opportunity to accept the CPO. Information, broken down by entity and relevant market, regarding relevant market room share, first-look opportunities and relevant market share gap is preferably stored and periodically updated in a database that is accessible to the central controller . Over time, use of the relevant market share gap results in allocation of first-look opportunities that approximate relative market room share.","As an alternative to allocating the first-look opportunity to the entity having the largest \u201cnegative\u201d relevant market share gap in step , the first-look opportunity may be allocated using a conventional random number generator (not shown) weighted to reflect the relevant market room share to randomly allocate the first-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO to the entities identified in step . For example, a random number generator may assign numbers from 1 to 100 to entities based on relevant market room share (i.e., an entity with 43% relevant market room share would be assigned 43 of 100 numbers) and then randomly selecting a number from 1 to 100 to assign the first-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO to the entity associated with that number. Over time, the number of first-look opportunities given to any particular entity will approximate that entity's relevant market room share, notwithstanding that the allocation is randomly distributed.","Referring now to , once a first-look opportunity has been allocated or assigned to a specific entity (i.e., brand, owner or independent) in step  (), that entity's hotel properties within the relevant market are preferably identified in step  based upon, among other things, the star ratings assigned to each property.","In one embodiment illustrated in , the central controller  identifies any hotel property associated with the entity having the first-look opportunity (\u201cfirst-look entity\u201d) in step  that meets the minimum star rating and relevant market location specified by the buyer  in the CPO. Alternatively, the CPO management system  may blend or commingle hotel properties of different star ratings into \u201cbuckets\u201d for allocation purposes. For instance, the CPO management system  may identify in step  any hotel property associated with the first-look entity that is in the relevant market and is of a star rating of at least that specified in the CPO (e.g., to include minimum star rating specified in CPO and one star rating level higher), which identified hotels would then be treated as if they were of the same star rating level. It is understood that the buckets may be based upon the star rating of hotel properties or some other predefined criteria (e.g., price) and that such buckets may be defined in other ways than that described above. By blending or commingling hotel properties in this manner, the buyer may reserve a higher quality hotel than requested. In addition, such blending or commingling minimizes variations in the star rating system.","If one or more of the first-look entity's hotel properties are identified in step , then the central controller  calculates the \u201crelevant market share gap\u201d in step  for each such identified hotel using the same methodology described above for computing the relevant market share gap for the entities (in step  of ). A particular hotel's \u201crelevant market room share\u201d is calculated by dividing the total number of rooms that hotel has by the total number of rooms for all hotels within the market specified by the buyer  in the CPO. As discussed above, in the event that the location\/market specified by the buyer in the CPO is not a mapped market or region, then the CPO management system  may utilize a blended market share (i.e., total or aggregate market less all mapped areas\/regions) for all non-mapped areas. Of course, it is understood that the CPO may be allocated to the first-look entity's hotel properties on a different basis, such as random assignment, bind rate, or other methods.","The \u201crelevant market share gap\u201d for a particular hotel is then calculated in step  by subtracting the hotel's relevant market room share from the percentage of first-look opportunities previously provided to that hotel. This is done for each hotel identified in step  and the hotels are ranked or ordered according to their relevant market share gap. In step , the hotel having the largest \u201cnegative\u201d relevant market share gap (i.e., the largest negative difference between the percentage of first-look opportunities provided to the hotel property and the hotel's relevant market room share) is allocated the first-look opportunity to accept the CPO. Information, broken down by hotel property, regarding relevant market room share, first-look opportunities and relevant market share gap is stored and periodically updated in a database that is accessible to the central controller  of the CPO management system . This information may also be updated only for the entity allocated the first-look opportunity.","If that selected hotel cannot accept the CPO in step , then the CPO management system  will rank or order the first-look entity's remaining hotel properties at that star rating level (or commingled star rating level) by relevant market share size and will preferably seek to allocate the CPO in step  to the hotel having the largest relevant market share size. This process in steps \u2013 continues until one of the first-look entity's hotels identified in step  accepts the CPO (step ) or it is determined in step  that none of the hotels identified in step  can accept the CPO.","Alternatively, the CPO management system  may group the first-look entity's hotels into buckets as previously described. The hotels within each bucket may be randomly ordered or ordered by a predefined criteria or metrics (e.g., relevant market share size, first-look bind rate, etc.) and thereafter processed in that order to attempt to book the CPO. It is understood that the construction of such buckets may be made flexible to include one or more star ratings or other predefined criteria.","If none of the first-look entity's hotels identified in step  meet the minimum star rating (or commingled star rating) in the relevant market specified in the CPO, then the central controller  will identify in step  in  whether there is a higher star rating level that may be considered for allocation purposes. If it is determined that there is no higher star rating level in step , then referring to , the controller  will allocate a second-look opportunity to one of the entities (i.e., brand, owner or independent) identified in step  ().","However, if the controller  determines that there is a higher star rating level for consideration in step , then the system  will identify in step  any of the first-look entity's hotels in the relevant market that are preferably at one star rating above that specified in the CPO. If hotels of different star rating levels are blended or commingled in step , then the system  will identify in step  any of the first-look entity's hotels in the relevant market that are one or possibly more star rating levels higher than the highest star rating previously considered in step . Any hotels identified in step  are then preferably ordered by relevant market share size in step  and the CPO management system  allocates the CPO in step  to the first-look entity's hotel having the largest relevant market share size in that star rating level (or commingled star rating level). If that hotel cannot accept the CPO in step , then the CPO management system  will attempt to allocate the CPO to the first-look entity's hotel having the next largest relevant market share size in that star rating level (or commingled star rating level) in step . This process in steps \u2013 continues until one of the first-look entity's hotels identified in step  accepts the CPO (steps , ) or it is determined in steps  and  that none of the first-look entity's hotels identified in step  can accept the CPO.","If none of the first-look entity's hotels identified in step  can accept the CPO in steps  and , then the central controller  will identify in step  whether there is a higher star rating level that may be considered for allocation purposes. If it is determined that there is no higher star rating level in step , then referring to , the controller  will allocate a second-look opportunity to one of the entities (i.e., brand, owner or independent) identified in step  ().","However, if the controller  determines that there is a higher star rating level for consideration in step , then the CPO management system  will in step  identify any of the first-look entity's hotels in the relevant market that are at the next higher star rating level (or commingled star rating level) above that previously considered. If no hotels are identified in step , then the central controller  will identify any of the first-look entity's hotels in the next higher star rating level (or commingled star rating level) in step . Any hotels identified in step  are ranked or ordered by relevant market room share in step  and then, in step , the CPO is offered or allocated to the first-look entity's hotel having the highest relevant market share in that star rating level (or commingled star rating level). It is understood that criteria or metrics other than relevant market room share (e.g., bind rate, preference, etc.) may be utilized for ranking the hotel properties. If that hotel cannot accept the CPO in step , then the CPO management system  will in step  attempt to allocate the CPO to the hotel having the next largest relevant market share size in that star rating level (or commingled star rating level). This process in steps \u2013 will be repeated until one of the first-look entity's hotels in the relevant market at that star rating level (or commingled star rating level) accepts the CPO (steps , ) or it is determined in step  that none of the first-look entity's hotels in the relevant market at that star rating level (or commingled star rating level) can accept the CPO, in which case, the process repeats itself beginning at step  to determine whether there is a higher star rating level (or commingled star rating level) than that previously considered.","If none of the first-look entity's hotels in the relevant market can accept the CPO (steps \u2013 (), \u2013 (FIG. )), then, referring to , the controller  will allocate a second-look opportunity to at least one of the entities (i.e., brand, owner or independent) identified in step  (). This second-look opportunity is preferably provided to the entity identified in step  having the largest \u201cfirst-look bind rate,\u201d which is the ratio of first-look offers previously filled by that entity to first-look opportunities previously provided to that entity. This historical information, broken down by entity, is preferably stored and periodically updated in a database that is accessible to the controller  of the CPO management system .","Thus, when none of the first-look entity's hotel properties can satisfy the CPO, the CPO management system  preferably calculates and ranks the remaining entities previously identified in step  in order of highest to lowest \u201cfirst-look bind rate\u201d in steps . The entity having the highest \u201cfirst-look bind rate\u201d is then provided with the second-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO in step .","In step , the central controller  next identifies those hotel properties associated with the entity provided the second-look opportunity (\u201csecond-look entity\u201d) that are located in the relevant market and are capable of satisfying the CPO. These second-look entity hotels may be grouped into \u201cbuckets\u201d for consideration based upon their respective star ratings. Each bucket may be predefined to contain hotels of only one star rating level or blended\/commingled star rating levels (e.g., minimum star rating level specified in CPO and one star rating level higher). The \u201cfirst-look bind rate\u201d is then calculated for the hotels identified in step  and the second-look entity's hotels are ranked in order of \u201cfirst-look bind rate.\u201d The second-look entity hotel property having the highest \u201cfirst-look bind rate\u201d within the desired star rating level (or bucket of blended\/commingled star rating levels) is allocated the first \u201csecond-look opportunity\u201d to satisfy the CPO in step . Should this second-look hotel be unable to accept the CPO in step  in , then the CPO management system  in step  determines whether there are any remaining second-look entity hotels in that star rating level or bucket and, if so, provides the second-look entity's hotel having the next highest \u201cfirst-look bind rate\u201d with the opportunity to accept the CPO in step . This process in steps \u2013 continues for all of the star rating levels or buckets until one of the second-look entity's hotels identified in step  accepts the CPO (step ) or it is determined in step  that none of the second-look entity's hotels can accept the CPO.","In the event that none of the second-look entity's hotels can satisfy the CPO in step , then, in step  of , the central controller  will preferably rank the remaining entities identified in step  in order from highest to lowest relevant market share. Alternatively, the remaining entities may be ranked based upon first-look bind rate or bind rate. The CPO management system  will then allocate in step  the next or third-look opportunity to accept the CPO to the remaining entity identified in step  having the highest relevant market share, highest first-look bind rate, or simply the highest bind rate. That third-look entity's hotel properties within the relevant market will then be ranked by star rating level or commingled star rating level in order of market share in the relevant market or bind rate, and the central controller  will preferably allocate the next opportunity to accept the CPO in step  to the third-look entity's hotel having the highest relevant market share or bind rate within the desired star rating level or commingled star rating level.","Referring to , should that third-look entity's hotel be unable to accept the CPO in step , then the central controller  will preferably allocate the next opportunity to accept the CPO to the third-look entity's hotel having the next highest relevant market share within the desired star rating level or commingled star rating level in step . This process in steps \u2013 continues until one of the third-look entity's hotels accepts the CPO in step  or it is determined that none of the third-look entity's hotels can accept the CPO, in which case, the CPO management system  allocates the next opportunity to satisfy the CPO to the third-look entity's hotel in a higher star rating level or bucket based upon relevant market share.","If none of the third-look entity's hotels can accept the CPO, then the CPO management system  will attempt to allocate the next or N-look opportunity to the entity having the next highest relevant market share in step , and steps \u2013 are then repeated for the hotel properties associated with that N-look entity. If none of the N-look entity's hotel properties can accept the CPO, then the system  will allocate the next opportunity to one of the remaining entities preferably having the next highest relevant market share and this process in steps \u2013 will be repeated until it is determined that none of the entities identified in step  can accept the CPO.","Should one of the allocated hotel properties accept the CPO (steps , , , , , , ), then the CPO management system  will bind the CPO, transmit a confirmation to the buyer  and seller (steps , , , ), and terminate processing of the CPO. In determining whether a hotel can accept the CPO, the CPO management system  may communicate with a computerized reservation system, CRS, GDS or other hotel booking engine (not shown) to confirm availability at the rate and dates specified in the CPO and to reserve the hotel room(s) on behalf of the buyer  if the CPO is accepted. As discussed above, a communication link between the communications port  of the CPO management system  and the seller's computerized reservation system, CRS or hotel booking engine permits the central controller  to communicate with the seller's computerized reservation system, CRS or booking engine.","Alternatively, it is understood that the present application may be configured to go through the entire allocation process to create a table of hotel properties ranked from 1 to N, and then query the seller's computerized reservation system, CRS or booking engine to determine whether the hotel property allocated the CPO can satisfy the CPO. In this arrangement, the first hotel property that books the CPO ends the querying process.","In addition, for customer relations purposes, after one of the allocated hotel properties accepts the CPO (steps , , , , , , ) and prior to binding the CPO, controller  of the CPO management system  may compare the dollar amount specified in the CPO and accepted by the allocated hotel property to the lowest published rate of that hotel property that is stored in a database accessible to the controller . The CPO management system  may be programmed not to bind the CPO if the dollar amount of the accepted CPO is above the lowest published rate of the hotel property.","It is understood that the system may query a reservation system after each allocation to a hotel, thereby avoiding the need to allocate opportunities if a hotel accepts the CPO. Alternatively, the system may complete the entire ranking process and then sequentially query the reservation system until a hotel accepts the CPO.","In determining whether a hotel can accept the CPO, the CPO management system  also preferably considers whether the price\/rate specified by the buyer  in the CPO will satisfy any margin requirements. The CPO management system  preferably seeks to attempt to bind the CPO (e.g., book the hotel) at a positive, predefined margin requirement, and if it is unable to do so, the CPO management system  will attempt to bind the CPO at the rate closest to the system's predefined margin requirement.","In some instances, the service provider operating the CPO management system  may elect to subsidize a portion of the rate charged by the hotel above the rate specified by the buyer  in the CPO. Margin and subsidy amounts, if any, may be defined, stored and maintained in one or more databases (not shown) accessible to the central controller  based on specific entities, hotels, geographic region, star rating level, dates or period of stay, etc. In determining whether a particular hotel can satisfy a CPO, the CPO management system  may take into consideration any margin and subsidy amounts applicable to the particular hotel, specific entities, geographic region, star rating level, dates or period of stay, etc.","To determine relevant market share, \u201crelevant market share gap\u201d, \u201cfirst-look bind rate\u201d, etc., the central controller  preferably accesses one or more databases containing market share and other information for participating entities (hotel brand or property owner) and hotels within a specific market (region). It is understood that these databases may be compiled in real time or updated periodically. For instance, a Market Share Entity Table may preferably be accessed by the central controller  to obtain the following information for participating entities based upon the relevant or specific market specified by the buyer in the CPO:\n\n","Similarly, a Market Share Hotel Table may preferably be accessed by the central controller  to obtain the following information for participating hotels:\n\n","The Market Share Entity Table and the Market Share Hotel Table may preferably be stored, maintained and continuously or periodically updated in one or more databases (not shown) accessible to the central controller  of the CPO management system .","The above-identified CPO management system  () is also applicable to CPO's concerning the rental of automobiles or other travel related services. For instance, in another embodiment, the central controller  receives one or more CPO's for automobile rental reservations from buyers  in a manner similar to that described above with respect to hotel reservations. The CPO may specify the price, rate type (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, weekend, etc.), desired date(s) and geographic location for rental, and the type of automobile sought to be rented (e.g., compact, mid-sized, full-sized, luxury, convertible, minivan, sports utility vehicle, etc.). The central controller  processes the CPO to identify at least one of a plurality of sellers or entities (rental companies) in the relevant market capable of satisfying the CPO.","The CPO management system  thereafter ranks the identified sellers or entities based upon a predetermined criteria or metrics (e.g., market share, first-look bind rate, performance, preference, etc.) and allocates a first-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO to one of the identified sellers or entities based upon that predetermined criteria. For instance, the identified sellers or entities may be ranked by their respective market share in the relevant market (\u201crelevant market share\u201d) and the first-look opportunity may be allocated, for example, using a conventional random number generator (not shown) weighted to reflect each seller or entity's relevant market share to randomly allocate the first-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO to the identified entities. The random number generator may assign numbers (e.g., from 1 to 100) to sellers or entities based on relevant market share (i.e., a seller or entity with 43% relevant market share would be assigned 43 of 100 numbers) and then randomly selecting a number (e.g., from 1 to 100) to assign the first-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO to the seller or entity associated with that number. Over time, the number of first-look opportunities given to any particular seller or entity will approximate that entity's relevant market share, notwithstanding that the allocation is randomly distributed.","Once the first-look opportunity is allocated to one of the identified sellers or entities, then the CPO management system  will determine whether that first-look entity will accept the CPO. This may be accomplished, for instance, by querying, in a manner similar to that discussed above with respect to hotel reservations, a computerized reservation system associated with that first-look seller or entity (e.g., Maestro, Odyssey or ANC), a GDS (e.g., Worldspan) or some other booking engine for determining availability, price and reserving rental cars through the first-look seller or entity.","If the first-look seller or entity cannot accept the CPO, then the central controller  will allocate a second-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO to one of the remaining sellers or entities identified above. Again, allocation of the second-look opportunity may be based on a predetermined criteria or metric, such as market share, first-look bind rate, performance, preference, etc. Should it also be determined that the second-look seller or entity cannot satisfy the CPO, then the central controller  will allocate a N-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO to one of the remaining sellers or entities identified above. Like the first and second look opportunities, the Nth-look opportunity to satisfy the CPO may be allocated based on a variety of criteria or metrics (e.g., market share, first-look bind rate, performance, preference, etc.). This process will continue until one of the sellers or entities accepts the CPO or it is determined that none of the sellers or entities can accept the CPO.","Although illustrative embodiments and various modifications thereof have been described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the present application is not limited to these precise embodiments and the described modifications, and that various changes and further modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For instance, a seller, entity or hotel may alternatively be allocated a CPO based on the frequency that such seller, entity or hotel books with or otherwise accepts CPO's from the CPO management system , or the amount of revenue or profit earned by the CPO management system  in connection with such seller, entity or hotel.","In addition, although the above-described system and method of the present application has been described in the exemplary context of the offer and rental of hotel rooms and\/or automobiles, it is understood that the system and method of the present application is applicable to any industry where a buyer-driven commerce model can be applied, such as the offer and sale of airline tickets, automobile sales, telephone services, insurance sales, consumer products, grocery store products, etc."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing features and other aspects of the present application are explained in the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
