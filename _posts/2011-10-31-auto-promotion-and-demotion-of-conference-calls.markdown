This architecture can be referred to as the \u201cFirst Party Call Control.\u201d In this architecture, many of the media handling functions normally implemented by PBX server  are handled by enterprise server . Incoming calls addressed to any of the terminal devices connected to enterprise network  are first routed to enterprise server . Thereafter, a call leg is established from enterprise server  to the called terminal device connected to enterprise network , and the two legs are bridged. Accordingly, enterprise server  includes a digital trunk interface  and a digital signal processing (DSP) conferencing bridge . DSP conferencing bridge  performs the bridging of calls for implementation of various call features, such as conferencing, call transfer, etc. Digital trunk interface  can be implemented as a plurality of telephonic cards, such as the Intel\u2122 Dialogic cards, interconnected by a bus and operating under the control of a processor.

In some embodiment, enterprise server  can employ a communications protocol conforming to the ECMA-269 or ECMA-323 standards for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["105","109","318","318","109","314","316","314","316","314","318"]},"Furthermore, SIP server  interacts with media server  using SIP-based media handling commands. For example, SIP server  and media server  can communicate using Media Server Markup Language (MSML) as defined in IETF document Saleem A., \u201cMedia Server Markup Language\u201d, Internet Draft, draft-saleem-msml-07, Aug. 7, 2008, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

It is an application-layer control protocol for establishing, maintaining, modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions between two or more terminal devices. As further known by those of ordinary skill in the art, SIP protocol  includes two interfaces for signaling: SIP-Trunk (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-T\u201d) and SIP-Line (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-L\u201d). Specifically, the SIP-T interface is utilized when the terminal device is a non-specific entity or not registered (i.e., when communicating between two network entities). In contrast, the SIP-L interface is utilized when the terminal device is registered (i.e., when dialing to a specific extension). Specific operations of system  utilizing SIP  will be described in further detail below. In addition, system  can operate using any of the above disclosed protocols.","Enterprise server  also includes a plurality of enablers, among other things, a VoIP enabler , a Fixed Mobile Convergence or FMC enabler , a conference services enabler , a presence enabler , and an Instant Messaging (IM) enabler . Each of enablers - are used by corresponding services in services layer  that combine one or more of the enablers. Each of the applications in application layer  is then combined with one or more of the services to perform the desired application.

As illustrated in , conference server  is provided in enterprise communications platform  and is in communication with conference services enabler  preferably through SIP protocol , although it is recognized that additional protocols that control media separate from data can be appropriated, such as Web Services protocol  or CTI protocol . As will be described in further detail below, conference call server  is configured for directing media and data streams to and from the terminal devices connected to system .","Example conference call systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments will now be described with reference to , which shows another example embodiment of system  when used for a conference call system. As discussed above, enterprise communications platform  includes a conference server  for providing conference call services to the terminal devices connected to system  as depicted in . Although  only shows mobile devices , , and  and telephone set , other terminal devices can also be included in the system as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. The terminal devices can collectively form one or more conference call groups according to various embodiments described herein. For example, terminal device , as a host terminal device, moderates a conference call session joined by one or more terminal devices, such as terminal devices , , and . Host terminal device  can, for example, perform hosting or moderating functions including roll call, mute all, broadcast only, conference lock, etc. When a terminal device (e.g., , , and ) joins a conference call session moderated by a host terminal device (e.g., ), it is designated as a participant terminal device.","Enterprise communications platform  and the associated conference server  can be used for executing conference call functions described herein. As described above, in example embodiments, enterprise communications platform  can include or be coupled to media server  shown in , such that enterprise communications platform  controls the media handling and media sessions of media server .","Referring still to , to implement the conference call functions described herein, enterprise communications platform  can communicate with terminal devices , , , and  by way of media sessions or control sessions. Specifically, as shown in , terminal devices , , , and  communicate via media sessions  (shown as solid lines) and control sessions  (shown as dashed lines). For example, terminal device  can communicate via media session and control session . Terminal device  can communicate via media session and control session . Terminal device  can communicate via media session and control session . In some embodiments, as shown, the terminal device, such as terminal device , can communicate via a media session , without an associated control session, over PSTN , WAN , or PLMN  as depicted in .","In some example embodiments, the media sessions can be facilitated by enterprise communications platform  by way of Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) media sessions, and can include voice calls, video calls, circuit-switched calls, or VoIP calls. To generate or establish a conference call session, enterprise communications platform  can connect or link at least some of the call legs of each media session . The particular methods and processes for connecting media sessions  into a conference call session would be understood by those skilled in the art, which can for example be implemented by media shuffling or Session Description Protocol (SDP) media shuffling, etc.","In some example embodiments, a data connection (e.g., the same data connection as used by control sessions ) can be further used to provide additional data sharing between terminal devices , , , and . For example, during a conference call, host terminal device  can provide or transfer a data file to remaining terminal devices , , and . Data sharing can also include Web Services or sharing of presentation content.","The general operation of system  for managing conference calls will be discussed with references to . For example, as depicted in , a first conference call can be established to include several terminal devices (e.g., terminal devices , , and ), with one of the terminal devices being the host terminal device (e.g., terminal device ) and other terminal devices being the participant terminal devices (e.g., terminal devices  and ). A terminal device that does not participate in the first conference call is designated as a non-participant terminal device. The process of establishing the first conference call is known in the art.","During the first conference call, conference server  receives a request for adding a non-participant terminal device (e.g., terminal device ). The request for adding a non-participant terminal device can be generated by or originate from a number of network entities. Using  as an example, during the first conference call, host terminal device  can request that non-participant terminal device  join the conference. Specifically, host terminal device  can put on hold the call session associated with the first conference call and dial the identification number of non-participant terminal device . Conference server  receives a conference call request from host terminal device  including the number (e.g., extension number) assigned to non-participant terminal device . Accordingly, conference server  can then attempt to establish a call session with non-participant terminal device  in response to the request.","Alternatively, one of the participant terminal devices, such as terminal device  or , can initiate the request for adding the non-participant terminal device (e.g., terminal device ). For example, during the first conference call, terminal device  or  can dial the number assigned to non-participant terminal device . Accordingly, conference server  receives a call request including the number assigned to non-participant terminal device  from the requesting participant terminal device. Accordingly, conference server  can attempt to establish a call session with non-participant terminal device  in response to the request.","Still alternatively, the request for adding a non-participant terminal device can be initiated by the non-participant terminal device itself. For example, non-participant terminal device  can dial a number assigned to conference call server  to establish a call session with conference call server . After the call session between conference call server  and non-participant terminal device  is established, non-participant terminal device  can send a request to conference server  to join the first conference call. The request can include an identifier that identifies the first conference call hosted by host terminal device .","Still alternatively, non-participant terminal device  can dial the number assigned to host terminal device  or a participant terminal device  or . After receiving the incoming call from non-participant terminal device , host terminal device  or participant terminal device  or  can choose to send a conference call request to conference server  to add the newly established call session to the first conference call","In general, after receiving the request for adding a non-participant terminal device into the first conference call, conference server  attempts to merge the newly established call session with non-participant terminal device  into the first conference call. Because of the limitations of various system resources, however, such as the maximum number of media sessions or control sessions that can be supported by host terminal devices , PBX , or enterprise server , the first conference call can generally accommodate up to a certain number of participant devices. When the maximum number of participant devices is reached in the first conference call, conference server  will not be able to add non-participant terminal device  to the conference unless a participant terminal device (e.g., terminal device  or ) is dropped from the conference or other measures are taken.","To accommodate non-participant devices in the conference even after the maximum number of participant devices is reached in the first conference call, conference server  allows chaining of a plurality of conference calls. Specifically, conference server  determines if the maximum number of participant terminal devices has been reached in the first conference call. For example, when the first conference call is initiated, conference server  can determine the maximum number of participant terminal devices for the first conference call. As discussed above, this maximum number of participant terminal devices can be determined based on the resources of various system components, such as host device , PBX server A or B, or enterprise server .","Conference server  can then establish a record in its database for the first conference call. The record can indicate the maximum number of participant terminal devices allowable for the first conference call and the number of participant terminal devices currently included in the first conference call. For example, as shown in , the number of participant terminal devices in this embodiment is two. Additionally, conference server  can also update this record when a non-participant terminal device joins or a participant terminal leaves the first conference call. The number of participant terminal devices can be increased or decreased, accordingly. Additionally, conference server  can update the record when there is a change in available resources of system  due to other events or changes as readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, conference server  can update the record to increase the maximum number of participant terminal devices for the first conference call when the number of conference calls established on conference server  or PBX server  decreases due to termination of other conference calls.","Upon receiving the request for adding non-participant terminal device  as discussed above, conference server  can query its database to determine if the maximum number of participant terminal devices in the first conference call has been reached. For example, conference server  can compare the maximum number of participant terminal devices allowable in the first conference call with the number of participant terminal devices currently included in the first conference call.","Alternatively, upon receiving the request for adding non-participant terminal device , conference server  can query various components of system  to determine if any resources are still available to accommodate non-participant terminal device  in the first conference call. For example, conference server  can query host device , which can respond with an indication specifying if existing media sessions or control sessions associated with the participant terminal devices have occupied all of its resources. As another example, conference server  can query PBX A or B. Generally, PBX A or B assigns a limited amount of resources to each conference call established thereon. In response to the query, PBX A or B can send an indication to conference server  specifying whether it has additional resources available for adding non-participant terminal device  to the first conference call. It will be appreciated by one ordinary skilled in the art that conference server  can also query other system components of system  in a similar process.","If conference server  determines that the maximum number of participant terminal devices for the first conference call has not been reached, conference server  then proceeds to adding non-participant terminal device  to the first conference call, as known in the art.","If, on the other hand, conference server  determines that the maximum number of participant terminal devices in the first conference call has been reached, conference server  then proceeds to establish a second conference call. The second conference call is hosted by one of the participant terminal devices (e.g., terminal device  or ) of the first conference call. In addition, the second conference call includes non-participant terminal device , which is to be added but cannot be added to the first conference call.","For example, if conference server  determines that non-participant terminal device  cannot be added to the first conference call due to the limitations of resources on host terminal device , conference server  can query participant terminal devices  and  to determine which one of participant terminal devices  and  has available resources to host the second conference call with non-participant terminal device . In response to the query from conference server , participant terminal devices  and  can each send a response to conference server  with an indication whether they have the available resources needed to host the second conference call. Additionally, the responses from participant terminal devices  and  can specify the number of non-participant devices they each can additionally accommodate in the second conference call.","After receiving the responses from participant terminal devices  and , conference server  can identify one of the participant terminal devices to host the second conference call. This identification process can be based on a number of criteria. For example, conference server  can select a participant terminal device that can accommodate the largest number of additional non-participant devices. Specifically, if participant terminal device  indicates in its response that it can accommodate three non-participant terminal devices, and if participant terminal device  indicates in its response that it can accommodate two non-participant terminal devices, conference server  elects participant terminal device  to host the second conference call.","Alternatively, conference server  can select the participant terminal device based on the amount of resources available. For example, if participant terminal device  has more available resources than participant terminal device , conference server  can select participant terminal device  to host the second conference call.","Still alternatively, conference server  can select a participant terminal device to host the second conference call based on the connection between the participant terminal device and system . For example, if participant terminal device  is connected to system  through a wired connection, and if participant terminal device  is connected to system  through a wireless connection, conference server  can select participant terminal device  to moderate the second conference call, because the wired connection is generally more reliable and resilient than the wireless connection.","Still alternatively, conference server  can select the participant terminal device to host the second conference call based on the participant terminal device's own preferences or properties. For example, if participant terminal device  specified in its response that it prefers not to host any additional conference call, conference server  does not select participant terminal device  to host the second conference call. As another example, if participant terminal device  has higher computational power than participant terminal device , conference server  can select participant terminal device  to host the second conference call.","Still alternatively, if conference server  determines that the maximum number of participant terminal devices in the first conference call is reached due to the resource limitation of PBX A or B as discussed above, conference server  can select a participant terminal device to avoid establishing the second conference call on that PBX. For example, assuming participant terminal device  is associated with PBX A, if participant terminal device  is associated with PBX B, and if conference server  determines that all of the resources of PBX B are occupied, but that PBX server A still has available resources for additional conference calls, conference server  can select participant terminal device , which is associated with PBX A. Other methods for selecting the participant terminal device to host the second conference call will be recognized by those ordinary skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure.","After identifying the participant terminal device to host the second conference call, conference server  can then establish the second conference call to include the selected participant terminal device and the non-participant terminal device to be added. For example, assuming conference server  selects participant terminal device  to host the second conference call as discussed above, conference server  can send a message to participant terminal device  and instruct participant terminal device  to initiate the second conference call. Specifically, if no call session has been established between conference server  and non-participant terminal device , conference server  can extract the number assigned to non-participant terminal device  from the request for adding the non-participant device and then forward the number to participant terminal device . Conference server  can then instruct participant terminal device  to dial the number of non-participant terminal device . When non-participant terminal device  responds, conference server  establishes the second conference call including participant terminal device , as the host terminal device, and non-participant terminal device  as a participant terminal device.","Alternatively, instead of dialing the number assigned to non-participant terminal device , conference server  can instruct non-participant terminal device  to dial the number assigned to participant terminal device  to establish the second conference call. Still alternatively, conference server  can itself dial the number assigned to non-participant terminal device  on behalf of participant terminal device  or dial the number assigned to participant terminal device  on behalf of participant terminal devices  to establish the second conference call.","Still alternatively, if a call session has been established between conference server  and non-participant terminal device , conference server  can dial the number of participant terminal device . When participant terminal device  responds, conference server  merges the call session with non-participant terminal device  and the call session with participant terminal device  to establish the second conference call.","Other methods for establishing the second conference call will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading this disclosure. Furthermore, the terminal device that initiates the request for adding non-participant device  can be different from the terminal device that hosts the second conference call. For example, the request for adding non-participant terminal device  can be sent by participant terminal device , whereas the second conference call can be hosted by another participant terminal device, such as terminal device .","Upon establishing the second conference call, as shown in , conference server proceeds to chaining the first conference call and the second conference call through the participant terminal device that hosts the second conference call (e.g., terminal device ; conference server  and terminal device  are illustrated together for purposes of simplicity). Specifically, for the data  exchanged in the first conference call, conference server  forwards the exchanged first conference call (CC) data , including audio, video, etc., through terminal device  to non-participant device . Moreover, for the data  exchanged in the second conference call, conference server  forwards the exchanged second CC data  to the first conference call hosted by host terminal device . As a result, the terminal devices participating in the first conference call can communicate with the terminal devices participating in the second conference call, as if all terminal devices were in one conference call. Because the second conference call is hosted by terminal device , the conference call capacity of the host terminal device (e.g., terminal device ) is extended without adding additional call sessions to the first conference call.","Furthermore, additional conference calls can be added according to a process similar to those described above for chaining the first and second conference calls. For example, if necessary, conference server  can establish a third conference call to accommodate additional non-participant devices. The third conference call can be hosted by a participant terminal device of the first conference call or a participant terminal device of the second conference call. If conference server  selects a participant terminal device of the first conference call to host the third conference call, conference server  chains the third conference call with the first conference call. If, on the other hand, conference server  selects a participant terminal device of the second conference call to host the third conference call, conference server  chains the third conference call with the second conference call. Regardless how the conference calls are chained together, conference server  can forward data among all of the conference calls so that the terminal devices participating in the separate conference calls can communicate with one another as if they were within a single conference call.","Still further, system  can chain conference calls even when the maximum number of participant devices of the hosting terminal device or the PBX is not reached. For example, when conference server  receives a request for adding non-participant terminal device  into the first conference call, conference server  can choose to establish the second conference call to accommodate non-participant device  even when the maximum number of participant devices of the first conference call is not yet reached. Conference server  can choose to do this to balance the call volume or traffic load between the PBX servers. For example, if the PBX (e.g., PBX B) associated with host terminal device  has a higher load than another PBX (e.g., PBX server A) associated with participant terminal device , conference server  can choose to establish the second conference call and request participant terminal device  to accommodate non-participant device  in the second conference call, instead of adding non-participant device  to the first conference call. As a result, non-participant terminal device  can be brought into the conference without adding additional call sessions to PBX B, which is associated with host terminal device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"As shown in , process  begins at step , where a first conference call is established by a conference server. For example, the first conference call can be established between several terminal devices, with one of the terminal devices being a host terminal device and other terminal devices being participant terminal devices.","At step , the conference server receives a request for adding a non-participant terminal device to the first conference call. The request can be generated by or originate from a number of network entities as described above. In some embodiments, the conference server can establish a call session with the non-participant terminal device in response to the request before proceeding to step .","After receiving the request for adding the non-participant terminal device to the first conference call, the conference server can attempt to add the non-participant terminal device to the first conference call.

For example, the conference server can query one or more of the participant terminal devices in the first conference call to determine which one of the participant terminal devices has the available resources to host the second conference call to include the non-participant terminal device. In response to the query from the conference server, the participant terminal devices in the first conference call each respond to the conference server with an indication whether they have the available resources to host the second conference call. Additionally, the responses from the participant terminal devices can specify the number of non-participant terminal devices they each can additionally accommodate in the second conference call. Similarly, the PBX can also respond to the query and indicates to the conference server whether it has resources available to host the second conference call.","At step , after receiving the responses from the participant terminal devices and other system components, the conference server can identify one of the participant terminal devices to host the second conference call. This identification process can be based on a number of criteria.

Still alternatively, the conference server can select a participant terminal device to host the second conference call based on the participant terminal device's own preferences or properties.","Still alternatively, if the conference server determines that the maximum number of participant devices in the first conference call is reached due to a congested PBX (i.e., the resource limitation of the PBX is reached) as discussed above, the conference server can select a participant terminal device to avoid establishing the second conference call on the congested PBX. Other methods for selecting a participant terminal device to host the second conference call will be recognized by those ordinary skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure.","After identifying the participant terminal device, the conference server can then establish the second conference call at step . For example, the conference server can send a message to the participant terminal device selected at step  and instruct the selected participant terminal device to initiate the second conference call. Specifically, if no call session has been established between the conference server and the selected participant terminal device, the conference server extracts the number (e.g., phone number, extension number, PIN, etc.) of the non-participant terminal device to be added from the request and then forwards the number to the selected participant terminal device. The conference server then instructs the selected participant terminal device to dial the number of the non-participant terminal device. After the non-participant terminal device responds, the conference server establishes the second conference including the selected participant terminal device, as a host terminal device, and the non-participant terminal device, as a participant terminal device.","Alternatively, at step , instead of dialing the number of the non-participant terminal device, the conference server can instruct the non-participant terminal device to be added to dial the number assigned to the participant terminal device selected at step  to establish the second conference call.

Similarly, the conference server forwards the data of the second conference call to the first conference call also through the selected participant terminal device. As a result, the non-participant terminal device which cannot be added to the first conference call can communicate with the host terminal device and the participant terminal devices of the first conference call, as if all devices were in one conference call.
