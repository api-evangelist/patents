{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to implantable monitoring devices, such as implantable stimulation devices and the like.","The human heart is an extremely complex organ and has many operational parameters that can be useful to study in order to gain an appreciation for the heart's operation. Certain parameters can be used to not only assess the health and operation of the heart, but can be a powerful predictive tool for predicting certain aspects pertaining to the owner of the heart. Not surprisingly, ongoing medical and clinical research seems to find new and different correlations between heart parameters and information that is of interest to physicians. As these parameters and correlations are discovered, it would be highly desirable to make use of them in an integrated and convenient fashion.","As an example, consider the following. Many times the parameters and correlations mentioned above are such that they can only conveniently be studied and observed in a clinical setting, i.e. in the doctor's office. To observe the parameters and gather the information that is to be used to generate the desired correlations, the patient may be required to be connected to expensive medical testing devices. One image that comes to mind is the image of a heart patient, wired to a heart monitor, running or walking briskly on a treadmill in the doctor's office so that the doctor can gather information about how their heart performs under exercise conditions. While the information is useful to the doctor, it might be useful, in some instances, to gather the data in locations other than the doctor's office so that the desired correlations can be later (or contemporaneously) computed.","Accordingly, this invention arose out of concerns associated with providing methods and systems that enable heart parameters, useful in computing desired correlations, to be conveniently and flexibly collected and saved.","Methods and systems for monitoring heart rate recovery are described. In one embodiment, an implantable monitoring device monitors a patient's heart activity. The monitor looks for periods of increased activity, such as those that are experienced during some level of exercise, and periods of lesser activity (such as rest) directly following. The patient's heart rate recovery is monitored as the heart recovers from the active period to the rest period. Data associated with the patient's heart rate recovery can then be diagnostically used to ascertain certain conditions associated with the patient.","The following description is of the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the invention. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the invention. The scope of the invention should be ascertained with reference to the issued claims. In the description of the invention that follows, like numerals or reference designators will be used to refer to like parts or elements throughout.","Overview","Methods and systems for monitoring heart rate recovery are described. In one embodiment, an implantable monitoring device monitors a patient's heart activity. The monitor looks for periods of increased activity, such as those that are experienced during some level of exercise, and periods of lesser activity (such as rest) directly following. The patient's heart rate recovery is monitored as the heart recovers from the active period to the rest period. Data associated with the patient's heart rate recovery can be used to ascertain, in some instances probabilistically, certain conditions associated with the patient. For example, an overly fast heart rate recovery may suggest some problems that require further study. An overly slow heart rate recovery may suggest other problems that require further study.","Any suitable implantable heart monitor can be used. In certain embodiments, the heart monitor may, but need not, have other functions such as cardiac rhythm management functions.","Cardiac rhythm management devices (or stimulation devices as they are sometimes called), including implantable devices, can include, for example, implantable cardiac pacemakers, cardioverters or defibrillators. The devices are generally implanted in an upper portion of the chest, in either the left or right side depending on the type of the device, beneath the skin of a patient within what is known as a subcutaneous pocket. The implantable devices generally function in association with one or more electrode-carrying leads which are implanted within the heart. The electrodes are typically positioned within the right side of the heart, either the right ventricle or right atrium, or both, for making electrical contact with their designated heart chamber. Conductors within the leads couple the electrodes to the device to enable the device to deliver the desired stimulation therapy.","An exemplary device is described below in connection with .","Exemplary Stimulation Device","The following description sets forth but one exemplary stimulation device that is capable of being used in connection with the various embodiments that are described below. It is to be appreciated and understood that other stimulation devices, including those that are not necessarily implantable, can be used and that the description below is given, in its specific context, to assist the reader in understanding, with more clarity, the inventive embodiments described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","10","14","15","17","18","17","18","10"]},"To sense atrial cardiac signals and to provide right atrial chamber stimulation therapy, the stimulation device  is coupled to an implantable right atrial lead  having at least an atrial tip electrode , and preferably a right atrial ring electrode , which typically is implanted in the patient's right atrial appendage.","To sense left atrial and ventricular cardiac signals and to provide left-chamber pacing therapy, the stimulation device  is coupled to a \u201ccoronary sinus\u201d lead  designed for placement in the \u201ccoronary sinus region\u201d via the coronary sinus os so as to place one or more distal electrodes adjacent to the left ventricle  and one or more proximal electrodes adjacent to the left atrium . As used herein, the phrase \u201ccoronary sinus region\u201d refers to the vasculature of the left ventricle, including any portion of the coronary sinus, great cardiac vein, left marginal vein, left posterior ventricular vein, middle cardiac vein, and\/or small cardiac vein or any other cardiac vein accessible by the coronary sinus.","Accordingly, the coronary sinus lead  is designed to receive atrial and ventricular cardiac signals and to deliver: left ventricular pacing therapy using, for example, a left ventricular tip electrode  and a left ventricular ring electrode ; left atrial pacing therapy using, for example, a first and second left atrial ring electrode,  and ; and shocking therapy using at least a left atrial coil electrode .","The stimulation device  is also shown in electrical communication with the patient's heart  by way of an implantable right ventricular lead  having a right ventricular tip electrode , a right ventricular ring electrode , a right ventricular (RV) coil electrode , and an SVC coil electrode . Typically, the right ventricular lead  is transvenously inserted into the heart  so as to place the right ventricular tip electrode  in the right ventricular apex so that the RV coil electrode  will be positioned in the right ventricle and the SVC coil electrode  will be positioned in the superior vena cava. Accordingly, the right ventricular lead  is capable of receiving cardiac signals, and delivering stimulation in the form of pacing and shock therapy to the right ventricle .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"10"},"The stimulation device  includes a housing  which is often referred to as \u201ccan\u201d, \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccase electrode\u201d, and which may be programmably selected to act as the return electrode for all \u201cunipolar\u201d modes. The housing  may further be used as a return electrode alone or in combination with one or more of the coil electrodes , , or , for shocking purposes.","The housing  further includes a connector (not shown) having a plurality of terminals, , , , , , , , , , , and  (shown schematically and, for convenience, the names of the electrodes to which they are connected are shown next to the terminals). While it is recognized that current devices are limited to the number of terminals due to International Standards, one of skill in the art could readily eliminate some of the terminals\/electrodes to fit in the existing device configurations and permit programmability to select which terminals connect to which electrodes. However, in the near future, the standards may change to permit multi-polar in-line connectors, and multiple feedthroughs connectors could readily be manufactured to accommodate the configuration shown in FIG. .","As such, to achieve right atrial sensing and pacing, the connector includes at least a right atrial tip terminal  and a right atrial ring terminal , adapted for connection to the atrial tip electrode and ring electrodes  and , respectively.","To achieve left chamber sensing, pacing and\/or shocking, the connector includes at least a left ventricular tip terminal , a left ventricular ring electrode , a first left atrial ring terminal , a second left atrial ring terminal , and a left atrial shocking terminal , which are adapted for connection to the left ventricular tip electrode , left ventricular ring , the first left atrial tip electrode , the second left atrial ring electrode , and the left atrial coil electrode , respectively.","To support right chamber sensing, pacing and\/or shocking, the connector further includes a right ventricular tip terminal , a right ventricular ring terminal , a right ventricular (RV) shocking terminal , and an SVC shocking terminal , which are adapted for connection to the right ventricular tip electrode , right ventricular ring electrode , the RV coil electrode , and the SVC coil electrode , respectively.","At the core of the stimulation device  is a programmable microcontroller or microprocessor  that controls the various modes of stimulation therapy. As is well known in the art, the microcontroller  typically includes a microprocessor, or equivalent control circuitry, designed specifically for controlling the delivery of stimulation therapy, and may further include RAM or ROM memory, logic and timing circuitry, state machine circuitry, and I\/O circuitry. Typically, the microcontroller  includes the ability to process or monitor input signals (data) as controlled by a program code stored in a designated block of memory. The details of the design and operation of the microcontroller  are not critical to the present invention. Rather, any suitable microcontroller  may be used that carries out the functions described herein. The use of microprocessor-based control circuits for performing timing and data analysis functions are well known in the art.","As shown in , an atrial pulse generator  and a ventricular pulse generator  generate pacing stimulation pulses for delivery by the right atrial lead , the right ventricular lead , and\/or the coronary sinus lead  via a switch bank . It is understood that in order to provide stimulation therapy in each of the four chambers of the heart, the atrial pulse generator  and the ventricular pulse generator  may include dedicated, independent pulse generators, multiplexed pulse generators, or shared pulse generators. The atrial pulse generator  and the ventricular pulse generator  are controlled by the microcontroller  via appropriate control signals  and , respectively, to trigger or inhibit the stimulation pulses.","The microcontroller  further includes timing control circuitry  which is used to control the timing of such stimulation pulses (e.g., pacing rate, atrioventricular (AV) delay, atrial interconduction (A\u2014A) delay, or ventricular interconduction (V\u2014V) delay, etc.), as well as to keep track of the timing of refractory periods, PVARP intervals, noise detection windows, evoked response windows, alert intervals, marker channel timing (via marker channel logic ), etc., which is well known in the art.","In one embodiment, the microcontroller can be programmed with one or more heart rate recovery algorithms . The heart rate recovery algorithm(s) operate to monitor a patient's heart rate recovery when, for example, the patient recovers from a period of exercise to a period of rest. The algorithms can then save data associated with the heart rate recovery for later (or contemporaneous) use.","The switch bank  includes a plurality of switches for connecting the desired electrodes to the appropriate I\/O circuits, thereby providing complete electrode programmability. Accordingly, the switch bank , in response to a control signal  from the microcontroller , determines the polarity of the stimulation pulses (e.g. unipolar, bipolar, combipolar, etc.) and various shocking vectors by selectively closing the appropriate combination of switches (not shown) as is known in the art.","Atrial sensing circuits  and ventricular sensing circuits  may also be selectively coupled to the right atrial lead , coronary sinus lead , and the right ventricular lead , through the switch bank , for detecting the presence of cardiac activity in each of the four chambers of the heart. Accordingly, the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits  and  may include dedicated sense amplifiers, multiplexed amplifiers, or shared amplifiers. The switch bank  determines the \u201csensing polarity\u201d of the cardiac signal by selectively closing the appropriate switches. In this way, the clinician may program the sensing polarity independent of the stimulation polarity.","The atrial sensing circuit  or the ventricular sensing circuit  preferably employ one or more low power, precision amplifiers with programmable gain and\/or automatic gain control, bandpass filtering, and a threshold detection circuit, to selectively sense the cardiac signal of interest. The automatic gain control enables the stimulation device  to deal effectively with the difficult problem of sensing the low amplitude signal characteristics of atrial or ventricular fibrillation. The outputs of the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits,  and , are connected to the microcontroller  for triggering or inhibiting the atrial and ventricular pulse generators,  and , respectively, in a demand fashion, in response to the absence or presence of cardiac activity, respectively, in the appropriate chambers of the heart.","For arrhythmia detection, the stimulation device  utilizes the atrial and ventricular sensing circuits,  and , to sense cardiac signals for determining whether a rhythm is physiologic or pathologic. As used herein \u201csensing\u201d is reserved for the noting of an electrical signal, and \u201cdetection\u201d is the processing of these sensed signals and noting the presence of an arrhythmia. The timing intervals between sensed events (e.g. P-waves, R-waves, and depolarization signals associated with fibrillation which are sometimes referred to as \u201cF-waves\u201d or \u201cFib-waves\u201d) are then classified by the microcontroller  by comparing them to a predefined rate zone limit (e.g. bradycardia, normal, low rate VT, high rate VT, and fibrillation rate zones) and various other characteristics (e.g. sudden onset, stability, physiologic sensors, and morphology, etc.) in order to determine the type of remedial therapy that is needed (e.g. bradycardia pacing, anti-tachycardia pacing, cardioversion shocks or defibrillation shocks, collectively referred to as \u201ctiered therapy\u201d).","Cardiac signals are also applied to the inputs of an analog-to-digital (A\/D) data acquisition system . The data acquisition system  is configured to acquire intracardiac electrogram signals, convert the raw analog data into digital signals, and store the digital signals for later processing and\/or telemetric transmission to an external device . The data acquisition system  is coupled to the right atrial lead , the coronary sinus lead , and the right ventricular lead  through the switch bank  to sample cardiac signals across any pair of desired electrodes.","The microcontroller  is further coupled to a memory  by a suitable data\/address bus , wherein the programmable operating parameters used by the microcontroller  are stored and modified, as required, in order to customize the operation of the stimulation device  to suit the needs of a particular patient. Such operating parameters define, for example, pacing pulse amplitude, pulse duration, electrode polarity, rate, sensitivity, automatic features, arrhythmia detection criteria, and the amplitude, waveshape and vector of each shocking pulse to be delivered to the patient's heart  within each respective tier of therapy.","Advantageously, the operating parameters of the stimulation device  may be non-invasively programmed into the memory  through a telemetry circuit  in telemetric communication with the external device , such as a programmer, transtelephonic transceiver, or a diagnostic system analyzer. The telemetry circuit  is activated by the microcontroller  by a control signal . The telemetry circuit  advantageously allows intracardiac electrograms and status information relating to the operation of the stimulation device  (as contained in the microcontroller  or memory ) to be sent to the external device  through the established communication link .","The stimulation device  can further include one or more physiologic sensors . Some physiologic sensors are referred to as a \u201crate-responsive\u201d sensors because they are typically used to adjust pacing stimulation rate according to the exercise state of the patient. However, physiological sensors  may further be used to detect changes in cardiac output, changes in the physiological condition of the heart, patient activity, or diurnal changes in activity (e.g. detecting sleep and wake states). A physiological parameter of the heart, which may be measured to optimize such pacing and to indicate when such pacing may be inhibited or terminated is the stroke volume of the heart. Accordingly, the microcontroller  responds by adjusting the various pacing parameters (such as rate, AV Delay, A\u2014A Delay, V\u2014V Delay, etc.) at which the atrial and ventricular pulse generators,  and , generate stimulation pulses. A common type of rate responsive sensor is an activity sensor, such as an accelerometer or a piezoelectric crystal, which is mounted within the housing  of the stimulation device . Other types of physiologic sensors are also known, for example, sensors which sense the oxygen content of blood, respiration rate and\/or minute ventilation, pH of blood, ventricular gradient, etc.","The stimulation device  additionally includes a power source such as a battery  that provides operating power to all the circuits shown in FIG. . For the stimulation device , which employs shocking therapy, the battery  is capable of operating at low current drains for long periods of time, and also be capable of providing high-current pulses (for capacitor charging) when the patient requires a shock pulse. The battery  preferably has a predictable discharge characteristic so that elective replacement time can be detected. Accordingly, the stimulation device  can employ lithium\/silver vanadium oxide batteries.","It can be a primary function of the stimulation device  to operate as an implantable cardioverter\/defibrillator (ICD) device. That is, it can detect the occurrence of an arrhythmia, and automatically apply an appropriate electrical shock therapy to the heart aimed at terminating the detected arrhythmia. To this end, the microcontroller  further controls a shocking circuit  by way of a control signal . The shocking circuit  generates shocking pulses of low (up to 0.5 joules), moderate (0.5-10 joules), or high (11 to 40 joules) energy, as controlled by the microcontroller . Such shocking pulses are applied to the patient's heart through at least two shocking electrodes, and as shown in this embodiment, selected from the left atrial coil electrode , the RV coil electrode , and\/or the SVC coil electrode  (FIG. ). As noted above, the housing  may act as an active electrode in combination with the RV electrode , or as part of a split electrical vector using the SVC coil electrode  or the left atrial coil electrode  (i.e., using the RV electrode as the common electrode).","Cardioversion shocks are generally considered to be of low to moderate energy level (so as to minimize pain felt by the patient), and\/or synchronized with an R-wave and\/or pertaining to the treatment of tachycardia. Defibrillation shocks are generally of moderate to high energy level (i.e., corresponding to thresholds in the range of 5-40 joules), delivered asynchronously (since R-waves may be too disorganized), and pertaining exclusively to the treatment of fibrillation. Accordingly, the microcontroller  is capable of controlling the synchronous or asynchronous delivery of the shocking pulses.","As further shown in , the stimulation device  can have an impedance measuring circuit  including an impedance measuring current source  and a voltage measuring circuit  (shown in  as an A\/D converter), which can be enabled by the microcontroller  by a control signal  for providing stroke volume measurements of the heart. The current source  can provide an alternating or pulsed excitation current. The voltage measuring circuitry  may also take the form of, for example, a differential amplifier.","The uses for an impedance measuring circuit  include, but are not limited to, lead impedance surveillance during the acute and chronic phases for proper lead positioning or dislodgment; detecting operable electrodes and automatically switching to an operable pair if dislodgment occurs; measuring a respiration parameter (for example, tidal volume, respiration rate, minute ventilation or volume, abnormal or periodic breathing); measuring thoracic impedance for determining shock thresholds and shock timing (corresponding to the diastolic time); detecting when the device has been implanted; measuring a cardiac parameter (such as, stroke volume, wall thickness, left ventricular volume, etc.); and detecting the opening of the valves, etc. In the present embodiment, the impedance measuring circuit is used to monitor left heart disease and provides appropriate stimulation therapy, such as altering rate, AV, A\u2014A, or V\u2014V delays. The impedance measuring circuit  can be advantageously coupled to the switch bank  so that any desired electrode can be used. Impedance may also be useful in verifying hemodynamic collapse to confirm that ATP has failed and\/or VF has begun.","The microcontroller  is coupled to the voltage measuring circuit  and the current source  for receiving a magnitude of the established current and a magnitude of the monitored voltage. The microcontroller , operating under program instructions, divides the magnitude of the monitored or measured voltage by the magnitude of the established current to determine an impedance value. Once the impedance signals are determined, they may be delivered to the memory  for storage and later retrieved by the microcontroller  for therapy adjustment or telemetry transmission. The telemetry circuitry receives the impedance values from the microcontroller  and transmits them to the external programmer. The impedance value may then be monitored by the patient's physician to enable the physician to track the patient's condition.","The impedance measuring circuit  is advantageously coupled to the switch bank  so that any desired electrode may be used. The current source  may be programmably configured between a desired pair of electrodes, and the voltage measuring circuit  may be programmably configured between the same or preferably a different pair of electrodes.","Heart Rate Recovery Monitoring",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Step  detects an active period. This step can be implemented using one or more physiologic sensors, such as those described above. For example, an activity sensor, such as an accelerometer or piezoelectric sensor, can detect when a patient is active. Exemplary techniques for determining patient activity are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,128,534, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. These and other techniques can be used in accordance with the described embodiments. An active period can correspond to when a patient is exercising or otherwise exerting themselves in some manner. Exemplary exertions can include, for some patients, climbing the stairs, walking for a duration of time, working in the garden and the like. These active periods are characterized by an increase in the patient's heart rate. Step  detects termination of the active period. This step can be implemented utilizing the same physiologic sensor(s) utilized above. Step  monitors the patient's heart rate recovery as the patient's heart rate recovers from a generally elevated rate associated with the active period, to rate more associated with a rest or inactive period. This step can be implemented using sensors that are typically utilized to monitor a patient's heart rate. Exemplary sensors are described above in connection with . Step  can then save heart rate recovery data that is associated with the patient's heart rate recovery. This step can be implemented by saving the data in a memory onboard the monitoring device. Where the monitoring device comprises a stimulation device such as the one described above, the associated data can be stored in a memory such as memory .","The data, once collected by the monitoring device, can be further processed onboard the monitoring device, if the monitoring device is so equipped. Alternately, the monitoring device can simply save the data so that it can later provide the data to an external device for further processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"A first graph  plots patient activity versus time. In the graph, there is a period of general inactivity  followed by a period of activity  which, in turn, is followed by a period of general inactivity . For example, during period  the patient may be resting or nominally moving about. During period , perhaps the patient goes for a long vigorous walk or rides a bicycle. Period  coincides with the termination of the patient's exercise and a corresponding inactive period.","A second graph plots a patient's heart rate versus time. This graph corresponds in time with first graph . Notice that during a period , the patient's heart rate is at a first level that is associated with the inactive period . When the patient begins to exert themselves (corresponding to period ), their heart rate begins to climb until it reaches a level designated as \u201cHR\u201d for a period . When the patient terminates their activity or exertion, a period begins during which the patient's heart rate recovers to its resting or inactive rate\u2014designated as \u201cHR\u201d. It is the heart rate recovery between the termination of the exertion and the return to a lower, inactive heart rate that is monitored by the heart monitor.","Assume for purposes of discussion that the depicted heart rate recovery can be considered as a \u201cnormal\u201d heart rate recovery. The term \u201cnormal\u201d as it pertains to the patient's heart rate recovery can mean a couple of different things. A normal heart rate recovery can be one that is associated with a large group of individuals-perhaps across a cross section of people. So, in this case, a normal heart rate recovery might be one that is, on average, found to exist in a large group of individuals. One study, mentioned below, found a decrease of around 42 beats per minute to be about normal. Alternately, a normal heart rate recovery can be patient-specific. That is, there may be something about the patient that causes them to have a normal heart rate recovery that does not fit within what might be considered normal for a larger cross-section of individuals. Perhaps the patient is young or ailing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["400","500","502"],"i":"a "},"Monitoring heart rate recoveries can also assist, in stimulation device embodiments, with the administration of therapy and\/or with further assessment of the patient for problems of which an abnormal heart rate recovery is symptomatic. Specifically, if the patient's heart rate recovery is faster than normal (corresponding to plot ), then effectively their heart rate is more precipitously returning to normal than is desirable. This could lead to dizziness and possible loss of consciousness. By monitoring the heart rate recovery and ascertaining a trend away from normal and towards a faster heart rate recovery, the stimulation device can be programmed to administer pacing pulses to pace the patient back up to a more normal heart rate recovery. Conversely, having a heart rate recovery that is slower than normal (corresponding to plot ) might be indicative of a condition that warrants further investigation. For example, if the patient is exercising, stops exercising and their heart rate remains high, this might be indicative of a tachyarrithmia which can then be further assessed and treated if necessary.","Additionally, heart rate recoveries can be a predictor of mortality. That is, studies have been done, most notably at the Cleveland Clinic, that have found a correlation between having an abnormal heart rate recovery and an increased likelihood of mortality. Specifically, in the study (published in the Apr. 4, 2000 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine), over a 12 year period of time, only four percent of the patients with a normal heart rate recovery died, whereas ten percent of those with an abnormal heart rate recovery died. Accordingly, an abnormal heart rate recovery was associated with a ","Accordingly, having information that indicates a trend away from a normal heart rate recovery can assist a physician in diagnosing potential problems and suggesting remedial measures for a patient (e.g. diet changes, lifestyle changes, medication changes, and the like) that might increase the patient's life expectancy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Step  defines a normal heart rate recovery for a patient. This step can be implemented in a number of different ways. For example, a standardized heart rate recovery can be defined and programmed into a monitoring or stimulation device by, for example, the physician. Alternately, the heart rate recovery can be defined over time, by observing and monitoring the patient's heart rate recovery. For example, the monitoring or stimulation device can monitor the patient's heart rate recoveries and derive or build a model associated with that particular patient. The model can, for example derive a normal heart rate recovery by averaging the monitored heart rate recoveries over time. Other methods can, of course, be used. Over time, the patient's defined characteristic heart rate recovery will become established and the monitoring or stimulation device can then look for trends away from the established heart rate recovery.","Step  monitors the patient's heart rate recovery between active and less active periods. One example of an active period is an exercise period when the patient's heart rate reaches a level that is normally associated with structured exercise, such as walking, jogging, or riding a bicycle. There may be other active periods which are not necessarily associated with structured exercise, but which are desirable to observe. For example, an active period might result when the patient climbs a set of stairs in their home or office. The less active periods can typically be associated with rest periods or periods that are less active than active periods.","Step  ascertains whether the monitored heart rate recovery is trending away from the defined heart rate recovery. This step can be implemented in any suitable way. As an example, consider FIG. . There, a couple of different methods for determining whether a patient's heart rate recovery is trending in a particular direction are shown. In one embodiment, a histogram  can be defined that contains bins associated with a patient's heart rate recovery. A bin collection  indicates what can be considered as a normal heart rate recovery for the patient. A bin collection  is illustrated and indicates abnormal heart rate recoveries. Thus, certain histogram bins can indicate abnormal heart rate recoveries. In another embodiment, trend graphs or trending analysis can be used to ascertain whether a patient's heart rate recovery is trending away from a normal recovery. For example, trend graph  indicates a number of observations \u201cx\u201d and a trend line superimposed over the observations. Trend graph  indicates that, over time, the patient's heart rate recovery is increasing. Trend graph , on the other hand, indicates that the patient's heart rate recovery is decreasing. Trend graph  indicates that the patient's heart rate recovery is not meaningfully varying. Other methods for determining heart rate recovery trends can, of course, be utilized without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.","If step  determines that the patient's heart rate recovery is not trending away from the defined heart rate recovery (or what can be considered as normal for the patient), the method returns to step  and continues to monitor the patient. If, on the other hand, step  determines that the patient's heart rate recovery is trending away from the defined heart rate recovery, then step  can take a remedial action.","It is to be noted that a variety of remedial actions are possible, depending on, among other things, the nature of the observed trend and the type of monitoring device being used. For example, if the observed heart rate recovery is faster than normal, the remedial actions can include pacing the patient back up to an acceptable rate if the monitoring device is a stimulation device capable of pacing a patient. If the heart rate recovery is slower than normal, then the remedial action can include notifying the physician. This can be accomplished, for example, when the patient returns to the physician's office for a routine exam. Here, the monitoring device can, in some embodiments, telemetrically provide the collected data to a suitable programmer so that the programmer can further analyze the results and\/or notify the physician of the detected trend.","It should be noted and appreciated that while the above-described embodiments are directed to methods and system that consider a patient's heart rate recovery, a patient's heart rate acceleration and\/or acceleration duration may provide useful metrics for assessing and treating a patient. For example, AV conduction time is also modulated by the body. Long term shifts in the AV interval versus exercise may also be markers of physiologic changes due to either disease or drugs.","By monitoring a patient's heart rate recovery using an implantable monitoring device such as an implantable stimulation device, a more complete picture of a patient's overall health can be developed. This, in turn, can permit more timely and accurate diagnoses to be rendered by physicians. In addition, having heart rate recovery information can facilitate identification of potential problems so that remedial measures or actions can be taken.","Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or steps described.
