The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit translation initiation, pharmaceutical compositions of the novel compounds, and methods of treating medical disorders.","Translation, the mRNA-directed synthesis of proteins, occurs in three distinct steps: initiation, elongation and termination. Translation initiation is a complex process in which the two ribosomal subunits and methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNA) assemble on a properly aligned mRNA to commence chain elongation at the AUG initiation codon. The established scanning mechanism for initiation involves the formation of a ternary complex among eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), GTP and Met-tRNA. The ternary complex recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S pre-initiation complex. This complex recruits mRNA in cooperation with other initiation factors such as eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which recognizes the 7-methyl-guanidine cap (m-GTP cap) in an mRNA molecule and forms the 48S pre-initiation complex. Cap recognition facilitates the 43S complex entry at the 5\u2032 end of a capped mRNA. Subsequently, this complex migrates linearly until it reaches the first AUG codon, where a 60S ribosomal subunit joins the complex, and the first peptide bond is formed (Pain (1996) 236:747-771). After each initiation, the GTP in the ternary complex is converted to GDP. The eIF2.GDP binary complex must be converted to eIF2.GTP by the guanidine exchange factor, eIF2B for a new round of translation initiation to occur. Inhibition of this exchange reaction by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 reduces the abundance of the ternary complex and inhibits translation initiation. Forced expression of non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 or Met-tRNAcauses transformation of normal cells (Marshall (2008) 133:78; Berns (2008) 133:29). In contrast, pharmacologic agents that restrict the amount of eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAternary complex inhibit proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo (Aktas (1998) 95:8280), Palakurthi (2000) 60:2919, Palakurthi (2001) 61: 6213). These findings indicate that more potent and specific agents that reduce amount of ternary complex are potent anti-cancer agents.","Several features of the mRNA structure influence the efficiency of its translation. These include the m-GTP cap, the primary sequence surrounding the AUG codon and the length and secondary structure of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR). Indeed, a moderately long, unstructured 5\u2032 UTR with a low G and C base content seems to be optimal to ensure high translational efficiency. Surprisingly, sequence analysis of a large number of vertebrate cDNAs has shown that although most transcripts have features that ensure translational fidelity, many do not appear to be designed for efficient translation (Kozak (1991) 115:887-903). Many vertebrate mRNAs contain 5\u2032 UTRs that are hundreds of nucleotides long with a remarkably high GC content, indicating that they are highly structured because G and C bases tend to form highly stable bonds. Because highly structured and stable 5\u2032 UTRs are the major barrier to translation, mRNAs with stable secondary structure in their 5\u2032 UTR are translated inefficiently and their translation is highly dependent on the activity of translation initiation factors.","mRNAs with complex, highly structured 5\u2032 UTRs include a disproportionately high number of proto-oncogenes such as the G1 cyclins, transcription and growth factors, cytokines and other critical regulatory proteins. In contrast, mRNAs that encode globins, albumins, histones and other housekeeping proteins rarely have highly structured, GC-rich 5\u2032 UTRs (Kozak (1994) 76; 815-21; Kozak (1999) 234:187-208). The fact that genes encoding for regulatory but not for housekeeping proteins frequently produce transcripts with highly structured 5\u2032 UTRs indicates that extensive control of the expression of regulatory genes occurs at the level of translation. In other words, low efficiency of translation is a control mechanism which modulates the yield of proteins such as cyclins, mos, c-myc, VEGF, TNF, among others, that could be harmful if overproduced.","Translation initiation is a critical step in the regulation of cell growth because the expression of most oncogenes and cell growth regulatory proteins is translationally regulated. One approach to inhibiting translation initiation has recently been identified using small molecule known as translation initiation inhibitors. Translation initiation inhibitors such as clotrimazole (CLT) inhibit translation initiation by sustained depletion of intracellular Castores. Depletion of intracellular Castores activates \u201cinterferon-inducible\u201d \u201cdouble-stranded RNA activated\u201d protein kinase (PKR) which phosphorylates and thereby inhibits the \u03b1 subunit of eIF2. Since the activity of eIF2 is required for translation initiation, its inhibition by compounds such as CLT reduces the overall rate of protein synthesis. Because most cell regulatory proteins are encoded for by mRNAs containing highly structured 5\u2032 UTRs, they are poorly translated and their translation depends heavily on translation initiation factors such as eIF2 and eIF4. Therefore, inhibition of translation initiation preferentially affects the synthesis and expression of growth regulatory proteins such as G1 cyclins. Sequential synthesis and expression of G1 cyclins (D1, E and A) is necessary to drive the cell cycle beyond the restriction point in late G1. Thus, the decreased synthesis and expression of G1 cyclins resulting from CLT-induced inhibition of translation initiation causes cell cycle arrest in G1 and inhibits cancer cell and tumor growth (Aktas et al. (1998) 95:8280-8285, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes).","Like CLT, the n\u22123 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) depletes internal calcium stores, and exhibits anti-carcinogenic activity. Unlike CLT, however, EPA is a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), a fatty acid-activated transcription factor. Although EPA and other ligands of PPAR\u03b3, such as troglitazone and ciglitazone, inhibit cell proliferation, they do so in a PPAR\u03b3-independent manner (Palakurthi et al. (2000) 60:2919; and Palakurthi et al. (2001) 61:6213, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes).","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to compounds that inhibit translation initiation, and the use of such compounds or combination of compounds for treating (1) proliferative disorders, (2) non-proliferative, degenerative disorders, (3) viral infections, (4) disorders associated with viral infections, and\/or (5) disorders characterized by unwanted protein synthesis or diseases for which reducing protein synthesis is advantageous.","In at least certain examples, the compounds are of substituted diarylureas, more particularly, substituted N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds.

here can be used in the treatment of cellular proliferative disorders, such as cancer and non-cancerous cellular proliferative disorders. Treatment of cellular proliferative disorders is intended to include, but is not limited to, inhibition of proliferation including rapid proliferation. As used herein, the term \u201ccellular proliferative disorder\u201d includes, but is not limited to, disorders characterized by undesirable or inappropriate proliferation of one or more subset(s) of cells in a multicellular organism. The term \u201ccancer\u201d refers to various types of malignant neoplasms, most of which can invade surrounding tissues, and may metastasize to different sites (see, for example, PDR Medical Dictionary 1st edition (1995)). The terms \u201cneoplasm\u201d and \u201ctumor\u201d refer to an abnormal tissue that grows by cellular proliferation more rapidly than normal and continues to grow after the stimuli that initiated proliferation is removed. Id. Such abnormal tissue shows partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with the normal tissue which may be either benign (i.e., benign tumor) or malignant (i.e., malignant tumor).","Examples of general categories of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinomas (i.e., malignant tumors derived from epithelial cells such as, for example, common forms of breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer), sarcomas (i.e., malignant tumors derived from connective tissue or mesenchymal cells), lymphomas (i.e., malignancies derived from hematopoietic cells), leukemias (i.e., malignancies derived from hematopoietic cells), germ cell tumors (i.e., tumors derived from totipotent cells. In adults most often found in the testicle or ovary; in fetuses, babies and young children, most often found on the body midline, particularly at the tip of the tailbone), blastic tumors (i.e., a typically malignant tumor which resembles an immature or embryonic tissue) and the like. One of skill in the art will understand that this list is exemplary only and is not exhaustive, as one of skill in the art will readily be able to identify additional cancers based on the disclosure herein.","Examples of specific neoplasms intended to be encompassed by the present invention include, but are not limited to, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, childhood; adrenocortical carcinoma; AIDS-related cancers; AIDS-related lymphoma; anal cancer; appendix cancer; astrocytoma (e.g., cerebellar, cerebral); atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor;

These examples are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention as these and other equivalent embodiments will be apparent in view of the present disclosure, figures, and accompanying claims.","Design and Development of a Ternary Complex Assay","For assay development, a bi-directional plasmid was designed in which a common promoter\/enhancer complex drives the transcription of firefly luciferase (F-luc) ORF fused to the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of ATF-4, and of the renilla luciferase (R-luc) ORF fused to a 90-nucleotide 5\u2032 UTR derived from the plasmid (). Because the tetracycline-regulated transactivator ((tTA), required for driving transcription from this vector) is not normally expressed in the mammalian cells, stable KLN cancer cells were constructed that expressed tTA (KLN-tTA).","The KLN-tTA colonies that drove expression of reporter genes from pBISA-DL plasmid were selected by transient transfection and dual luciferase assay. One of these KLN-tTA cell lines was transfected with the pBISA-DLexpression vector, stable colonies were selected by dual luciferase assay and expanded. To determine if reduced availability of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary complex increased the translation of firefly luciferase and decreased translation of renilla luciferase, selected KLN-tTA\/pBISA-DLcolonies were treated with thapsigargin (TG) or tunicamycin (TU), two agents known to cause phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1.  shows that treatment with these agents increased the expression of firefly luciferase and decreased expression of renilla luciferase, leading to an increase in the ratio of firefly activity relative to renilla activity. This effect was due to presence of multiple uORFs but not other elements in the 5\u2032 UTR of ATF-4 (for example an internal ribosomal entry site, IRES, element) because removal of uORF2 by insertion of a single nucleotide abolished increased firefly\/renilla ratio in TG or TU treated cells (). Furthermore, the firefly\/renilla ratio was increased only in response to decreased abundance of the ternary complex but not inhibition of cell growth because several anti-proliferative agents such as etoposite or mitomycin had no effect on Firefly luciferase\/Renilla luciferase ratio, indicating that this assay is suitable for identification of agents that reduce abundance of the ternary complex (Table 6).","This assay was then adapted for high throughput screening in 96 and 384 well plates. This was done by evaluating the cell density, length of exposure to compounds, DMSO tolerance and optimum firefly and renilla substrate. We then challenged these cells with thapsigargin or DMSO. The scattered plot of these data is shown in . Using these data, the suitability of the assay for high throughput screening in 384 well was determined by determining signal to background ratio and the Z-factor. Cell-based assays usually have higher variation than homogeneous in vitro assays due to position effect in the plate, and other variables associated with handling of cells and the plates. Overall, this assay had a very high signal to background ratio (approximately 100 for both luciferases), and a Z score of 0.58, an excellent value for a cell based assay.","Screening","Screening was conducted in 384 well white opaque plates (Nalge Nunc), 100 \u03bcl volume RPMI+10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated at the sub-confluent density of 10,000 cells\/well, and allowed to attach for a period of 16-18 hours at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO. Compounds were added as 1 \u03bcl of a 1 mM DMSO stock solution for a final screening concentration of 10 using low-volume tips for transfer (Molecular Bioproducts). Cells were then incubated in the presence of compound for an additional sixteen hours, again at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO. Following incubation 70 \u03bcl of the culture medium was removed from each well to allow for reagent addition and plates were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for thirty minutes. Firefly luciferase reporter activity was then read by the addition of thirty microliters of Dual Glo Luciferase reagent (Promega), followed by one hour incubation at room temperature to allow for adequate signal buildup. Luminescence counting was conducted on a Microbeta Trilux using a 1 second read time. Renilla luciferase reporter activity was measured following addition of 30 \u03bcl Stop and Glo Luciferase reagent (Promega) and incubation identical to the one carried out for the firefly luciferase one.","Compound scores were interpreted as firefly luciferase activity divided by renilla luciferase activity, normalized to the plate's DMSO control. Using a preliminary screen of the NCI Diversity set as a guide (1990 compounds), a hit threshold of three times the DMSO control readout was chosen to achieve a target hit rate of 1%; wells with this threshold value typically fell three standard deviations from the plate mean. All data analysis was conducted using the BioAssay HTS software package (CambridgeSoft).","With this format, signal-to-noise and signal-to-background typically ran at 100 and 10 respectively, with thapsigargin (TG) an agent known to induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at 100 nM.","102,709 compounds in the NCI Open Chemical Repository were then screened using this HTS assay. Of these, approximately 1200 compounds were identified as hits in the primary screen (1.2% hit rate). Initial hits were confirmed by repeating the same dual luciferase assay in 96 well plates. Briefly, 20,000 cells\/well were plated in triplicate for each concentration (10, 5 and 2.5 \u03bcM) of the compounds. The compounds that increased firefly\/renilla luciferase ratio at least three-fold above the same ratio in the DMSO treated wells were considered confirmed hits. The final number of confirmed hits was 648 (See Table 5).","Lead Scaffolds","A review of the confirmed hits identified N,N\u2032-diarylureas as a privileged scaffold that can provide attractive leads. Using commercially available sources we assembled a 120 member lead finding library of N,N\u2032-diarylureas with various substitutions.

Therefore, expression of endogenous CHOP mRNA and CHOP protein in KLN-tTA\/pBISA-DLcells were utilized as secondary assays to validate N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds as modifiers of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAternary complex. As shown in  and D, active N,N\u2032-diarylureas did indeed induce expression of CHOP mRNA and protein. These findings demonstrate that the ternary complex assay reported herein is a very valuable tool for screening the chemical repositories for the inhibitors of translation initiation that reduce the amount of the ternary complex. To rule out the possibility that the activity of N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds was confined to a single cell type, the effects of these compounds on the ternary complex assay and the expression of CHOP mRNA was assayed in CRL-2351, PC-3, CRL-2813 human breast, prostate, and melanoma cancer cell lines respectively. For the reporter gene assay, the three human cell lines were co-transfected with tTA expression vector and the pBISA-DLdual luciferase expression vector shown in . As shown in , the active N,N\u2032-diarylureas displayed significant activity in all the cell lines tested, albeit with different potencies. The expression of CHOP mRNA was assayed by real time PCR in the same cell lines treated with 5 or 20 \u03bcM of each compound.

To determine which of these was the case, the effect of active N,N\u2032-diarylureas on the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was studied. KLN-tTA\/pBISA-DLor PC-3 prostate cancer cells were incubated with three active and one inactive N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds and determined the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by Western blot analysis. As shown in , three N,N\u2032-diarylureas that increased firefly\/renilla luciferase ratio and induce endogenous CHOP also caused the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, whereas the inactive N,N\u2032-diarylurea compound had no effect on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. To determine if the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was responsible for reduced amount of the ternary complex in the cells treated with N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds, previously generated PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines in which expression of endogenous eIF2\u03b1 was replaced with recombinant wild type (WT) or non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1-S51A were utilized. These cells were co-transfected with tTA and pBISA-DLdual luciferase expression vector and treated with three active and one inactive N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds.  demonstrates replacement of endogenous eIF2\u03b1 with the non-phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1-S51A abrogated the activity of N,N\u2032-diarylureas in this assay. These finding demonstrate conclusively that N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds reduce the amount of the ternary complex by causing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1.","As shown in , active N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds inhibited cyclin D1 protein expression without any effect on p27protein. These agents had no effect on the level of cyclin D1 mRNA indicating that they inhibit cyclin D1 expression at the level of translation.","Four distinct kinases are shown to specifically phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 in response to the metabolic state of the cells or external stimuli. These are PKR, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), general control derepressible kinase 2 (GCN2), and heme regulated inhibitor. To determine if N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds cause phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by causing activation of one or more of these kinases, knockdown expression of these kinases was assayed in KLN-tTA\/pBISA-DLcells individually or in combinations, treating the cells with compound #1781 or DMSO. As seen in , knocking down the expression of PKR, PERK, or GCN had no effect on the induction of F-luc\/R-luc ratio by compound #1781. In contrast, knocking down the expression of HRI almost completely abrogated activity of the compound #1181 (). Furthermore simultaneous knocking down of PKR, PERK, and GCN2 failed to abrogate effects of #1781 indicating that these three kinases do not play a role in the induction of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds. Furthermore real-time PCR analysis revealed that knocking down HRI expression but not that of PKR, PRK or GCN2 abrogated induction of CHOP mRNA by compound #1781, further supporting the finding that the HRI is the molecular target of N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds (). To further confirm these data, KLN-tTA\/pBISA-DLcells were transfected with or without siRNA against HRI followed by their treatment with one inactive and three active N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds or vehicle. As shown in , knocking down the expression of HRI abrogated induction of R-luc\/R-luc ratio (indicative of the limited availability of the ternary complex) by all three active compounds with no effect on the inactive compound (). Finally, all four kinases were knocked down by about the same efficiency, ruling out the possibility that the lack of effect by PKR, PERK, and GCN2 was due to failure of siRNA knockdown (). Taken together these data clearly demonstrated that N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds cause phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 specifically by activating HRI.","Further studies were done to determine which eIF2\u03b1 kinase(s) mediate phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by N,N\u2032-diarylureas.

Furthermore any effect of the test compounds on translation elongation or termination will be similar for both reporters. Because of these features, the ternary complex assay described herein controls for many variables at once. In addition, the primary assay is backed by the secondary assays such as the expression of CHOP protein and mRNA, which faithfully reflects the abundance of the ternary complex. The specificity of the assay was further demonstrated by testing well-known anti-cancer agents for their effects on the abundance of the ternary complex. None of these anti-cancer agents with no known effect on the formation of the ternary complex showed any activity, indicating that this assay is suitable for identification of mechanism specific active compounds. In addition to identifying privileged scaffolds that could be utilized for design of focused libraries for lead generation, a library of N,N\u2032-diarylureas was prepared and studied using the ternary complex assay. Further characterization of selected compounds indicated that N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds reduced the amount of the ternary complex by causing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. These findings indicate that the ternary complex assay is highly suitable for guiding development of translation initiation inhibitors, and that these N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds do in fact display potent anti-proliferative activity correlated with their activity in the ternary complex assay.","The data described herein indicate that the active N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds cause phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, induce expression of CHOP mRNA and protein and potently inhibit cell proliferation.

It was further demonstrated that N,N\u2032-diarylureas compounds inhibit cell proliferation by causing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 with ICvalues in the low\/sub-micromolar range.","The data presented herein demonstrates the clear potential for targeting of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary complex in a cell based high throughput screening campaign to develop translation initiation inhibitors and potential of N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds for development of novel mechanism specific agents for cancer therapy.","Materials and Methods","Cell Growth Assay: Cell Growth was Measured by the SRB Assay.","Plasmids: The bi-directional mammalian expression vector pBI (Clontech, CA) was modified to expand the multiple cloning sites MCSs and thereafter named pBISA.

The TRE is flanked on both sides by minimal human cytomegalovirus (CMV) minimal promoters allowing bi-directional transcription and two (MCS). Firefly and renilla luciferases were subcloned into MCS-I and MCS-II, respectively. This base plasmid, designated pBISA-DL, transcribes two mRNAs that contain the 90 nucleotide plasmid derived 5\u2032 UTR (same sequence in both mRNAs), and the ORF encoding either firefly or renilla luciferase followed by a polyadenylation sequence. This plasmid was further modified by inserting the 5\u2032 UTR of ATF-4 into MCS-I in front of the firefly luciferase mRNA. Transcription from this direction generates an mRNA that contains the firefly luciferase ORF preceded by a 5\u2032 UTR composed of 90 nucleotides derived from the plasmid and 267 nucleotides derived from the 5\u2032 UTR of ATF-4 mRNA. Transcription from the other direction generates an mRNA that contains the renilla luciferase ORF preceded only by the 90-nucleotide plasmid-derived sequence in the 5\u2032 UTR (). This expression plasmid is called pBISA-DL.","Stable and transient transfection: Cells were seeded at the density of 10in 60-mm (stable transfection) or 10cells per well of 96-well plate (transient transfection) plates and transfected one day later using the Qiagen Transfectamine transfection kit.
