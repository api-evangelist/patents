Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a system for driving a hardware device and a method thereof and processing data and, more particularly, to a system for driving a hardware device in a computer system and processing data and a method thereof.","2. Description of the Related Art","DirectX is a special multimedia application programming interface (API) used in Microsoft windows, and it allows a programmer to use the functions of various hardware without writing hardware code by himself or herself. The DirectX includes components such as DirectShow, DirectDraw, DirectSound, DirectInput, Direct3D, DirectAnimation, and DirectMusic. Various kinds of multimedia applications such as Yahoo VOIP, MSN VOIP, Skype, and Google Talk are gradually developed on the basis of the architecture of the DirectX.","Additionally, Microsoft launches a windows driver model (WDM) after Window 98, and the WDM and the DirectX are closely related to each other. The WDM is a design specification of a hardware device driver established by Microsoft and compatible with Microsoft operating systems, the hardware device performing the design specification is also called a WDM hardware device, and the brand, the model, and the pin of the WDM hardware device in the specification do not need to be considered. Consequently, if the WDM hardware device needs to be used by the multimedia application, integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers must first develop a WDM driver performing the design specification of the WDM according to Window driver development kit (DDK) of Microsoft, and then system manufacturers may utilize the WDM driver to drive the WDM hardware device.","For example, a web camera includes a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor and a universal serial bus (USB) IC. USB IC manufacturers must provide the driver performing the WDM specification, and then the system manufacturer may normally drive the web camera.","However, if the USB IC manufacturers do not provide a correct WDM driver, the system manufacturers cannot amend or use the WDM hardware device.","Additionally, since parts of USB ICs do not have enough computing power or corresponding hardware design, it cannot support a color adjusting interface and a camera lens control interface regulated by the Directshow.","Moreover, since common multimedia applications such as MSN, VOIP, Skype, and Google Talk only support a standard audio input microphone and do not support a Bluetooth microphone, the multimedia applications such as MSN, VOIP, Skype, and Google Talk cannot capture multimedia information via the Bluetooth microphone.","The invention relates to a system for driving a hardware device and processing data and a method thereof, and it at least includes the following advantages.","First, the Bluetooth microphone originally does not supporting the multimedia application, the multimedia application can play the audio data captured by the Bluetooth via a virtual WDM interface.","Second, system manufacturers may debug program or add additional functions at a virtual control interface or a virtual color adjusting interface by themselves to greatly improve added value, which does not need any hardware cost.","Third, the color adjusting interface and a camera lens control interface regulated by the Directshow are absolutely supported.","Fourth, the USB IC with low cost may be replaced with a USB IC with low cost quickly.","Fifth, the image quality in playing is improved via strong computing power of a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphic processor unit (GPU).","The invention provides a system for driving the hardware device and processing the data. The system includes a storage unit, a processor, and the hardware device. The storage unit stores a multimedia application interface, a virtual WDM interface, and a multimedia application. The processor is electrically connected with the storage unit and used for executing the multimedia application. The hardware device receives or outputs first format data. When the multimedia application and the hardware device are active, the multimedia application interface and the virtual WDM interface are taken as communication interfaces between the multimedia application and the hardware device, the virtual WDM interface converts the first format data to second format data and transmits the second format data to the multimedia application via the multimedia application interface, and the second format data is processed by the multimedia application.","The invention provides a method for driving a hardware device and processing data. The method includes the following steps. First, a multimedia application interface, a virtual WDM interface, and a multimedia application are stored. Second, the multimedia application is executed. Third, the first format data is received or outputted via the hardware device. When the multimedia application and the hardware device are active, the multimedia application interface and the virtual WDM interface are taken as communication interfaces between the multimedia application and the hardware device, the virtual WDM interface converts the first format data to second format data and transmits the second format data to the multimedia application via the multimedia application interface, and the second format data is processed by the multimedia application.","These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","160","140","150","140","140","110","120","130","160","150","110"]},"When the multimedia application  and the hardware device  are active, the multimedia application interface  and the virtual WDM interface  are taken as communication interfaces between the multimedia application  and the hardware device , the virtual WDM interface  converts first format data D to second format data D and transmits the second format data D to the multimedia application  via the multimedia application interface , and the second format data D is processed by the multimedia application .
