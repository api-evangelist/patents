title: Tune-stabilized, non-scaling, fixed-field, alternating gradient accelerator
abstract: A FFAG is a particle accelerator having turning magnets with a linear field gradient for confinement and a large edge angle to compensate for acceleration. FODO cells contain focus magnets and defocus magnets that are specified by a number of parameters. A set of seven equations, called the FFAG equations relate the parameters to one another. A set of constraints, call the FFAG constraints, constrain the FFAG equations. Selecting a few parameters, such as injection momentum, extraction momentum, and drift distance reduces the number of unknown parameters to seven. Seven equations with seven unknowns can be solved to yield the values for all the parameters and to thereby fully specify a FFAG.

The government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments relate to the fields of electromagnetic fields, magnets, and particle accelerators. Embodiments also relate to the field of constrained systems of equations, and computational methods for solving constrained systems of equations.","Particle accelerators have been researched and produced since the discovery of electric fields and electrical potential. Initially, linear accelerators were developed followed by a variety of ring shaped accelerators which are now a common and often the most economical choice in many technical applications","In general, charged particles are sent through an injection port into a ring shaped accelerator that then accelerates them. The accelerated particles can then be obtained as they exit out of an extraction port.","There are many types of ring shaped accelerators and all of them require careful control over electric fields and magnetic fields. The electric fields accelerate the particles. The magnetic fields bend particle trajectories so that the particles remain within the accelerator. The required careful control is accomplished with complex magnetic field configurations in conjunction with sophisticated control systems. In ring accelerators such systems are almost always required to dynamically adjust the fields. Limits, therefore, exist, particularly in ring accelerators, regarding the rate at which parameters can be dynamically adjusted. This rate of parameter change affects the acceleration cycle time, total current (duty cycle), and other technical requirements such as variations in energy that can be dynamically delivered. Systems and methods for accelerating particles with ring accelerators are needed which improve performance and output such as enhancing the beam current, increasing the dynamical range or variability in beam parameters, or simplifying or reducing the cost of the control system, magnets, power supplies, and other ring components.","The following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the embodiments and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the embodiments can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.","Fundamental design methods providing for accelerating charged particles with non-scaling fixed-field, alternating-gradient accelerators are needed in particular new approaches which stabilize the tune dynamically.","It is therefore an aspect of the embodiments that a focus magnet which focuses or confines the beam in the horizontal plane using fixed, not dynamically adjusted fields, can be specified by parameters which include an injection field strength, an extraction field strength, the length of the magnet at injection, the length of the magnet at extraction, and the horizontal orbit separation between the two.","It is also an aspect of the embodiments that the so-termed, defocus magnet, which defocuses beam in the horizontal plane, but confines or focuses vertically, is also specified by parameters that include an injection field strength, an extraction field strength, the length of the magnet required at injection, the magnetic length at extraction, and the orbit separation in the horizontal plane between the two.","It is a further aspect of the embodiments that the focus magnet and the defocus magnet are positioned with a separation specified by a drift distance and are part of a system having conventional accelerator system parameters such as a phase advance, an injection momentum, and an extraction momentum.","It is a yet further aspect of the embodiments that the parameters defining horizontally-focusing magnets, defocusing magnets, phase advance, and a drift distance can be related by seven equations. The seven equations describe stable beam motion in a fixed, linear-field magnetic FODO cell which is constrained in phase advance, or tune, at injection and extraction. This FODO cell comprises the basic building block of a non-scaling, linear-field FFAG (NLFFAG) with likewise constrained tune. As such, the seven equations are called the NLFFAG equations. A solution to the NLFFAG equations can be obtained by applying both technical constraints and magnetic optics constraints to the NLFFAG equations. The technical constraints and the magnetic optics constraints are called the NLFFAG constraints.","The particular values and configurations discussed in these non-limiting examples can be varied and are cited merely to illustrate at least one embodiment and are not intended to limit the scope thereof. In general, the figures are not to scale.","A FFAG is a particle accelerator having turning magnets with a fixed field gradient designed for beam confinement across a specified energy range and within a defined magnet aperture. FODO cells contain focus magnets and defocus magnets that are specified by a number of parameters such as focusing strength which is nominally expressed in terms of length and the magnetic field value or its gradient. Here, FODO cells are used as the basic optics unit of the FFAG. A set of seven equations have been developed which, relate the simple, linear FODO cell optical and geometrical parameters to one another as required to build a non-scaling FFAG that is constrained in tune. These seven equations impose the constraint of both fixed, linear fields (either constant or linear gradient fields) and fixed tune. In the approach used to derive these equations, phase advance or tune is constrained at the injection and extraction momentum. Magnetic optical constraints in the presence of fixed and linear field gradients further reduce the equations (). Then, selecting a few parameters, such as injection momentum, extraction momentum, and drift distance reduces the number of unknown parameters to seven. Seven equations with seven unknowns can be solved to yield the values for all the parameters and to thereby completely specify the magnetic and optical parameters of a non-scaling, linear-field FFAG with stable tune at both injection and extraction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","103","104","107","105","107","106","101","102","105","106","107"]},"Upon injection, the particles have an injection momentum, p, and are accelerated by the accelerator modules  until they reach an extraction momentum, p.
