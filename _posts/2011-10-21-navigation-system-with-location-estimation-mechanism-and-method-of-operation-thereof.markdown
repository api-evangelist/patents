This is especially true for client devices such as navigation systems, cellular phones, portable digital assistants, and multifunction devices.","The navigation systems generally provide a recommended route to a desired destination. Generally, the recommended route and the desired destination are selected from a large database of roads stored in mass media storage, such as a compact disc read-only memory (CD ROM) or a hard drive, which includes roads of an area to be traveled by a user. The navigation systems can also notify waypoints or times along the route.","As users adopt mobile navigation service devices, new and old usage begin to take advantage of this new device space. Navigation system and service providers are continually making improvement to enhance the user's experience in order to be competitive.","Thus, a need still remains for a navigation system with location estimation mechanism for increasing levels of functionality. In view of ease of use, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.","Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.","The present invention provides a method of operation of a navigation system including: generating a navigation route for displaying on a device; estimating a public display location along the navigation route; and scheduling a location-based notification to be presented at the public display location and prior to traversing the navigation route.","The present invention provides a navigation system, including: a navigation module for generating a navigation route for displaying on a device; an identify location module, coupled to the navigation module, for estimating a public display location along the navigation route; and a schedule notification module, coupled to the identify location module, for scheduling a location-based notification to be presented at the public display location and prior to traversing the navigation route.","Certain embodiments of the invention have other steps or elements in addition to or in place of those mentioned above.

The information module  can store and provide the preferences , the usage information , or a combination thereof to other modules for further processing.","For example, the preferences  can include favorite places, preferred types of point of interests (POIs), highway-only or street-only selection, streets with least number of school zones or least amount of traffic, and routes with least number of accidents or constructions. Also for example, the usage information  can include navigation historical data or relevant information including most frequently visited locations, past queries extracted from searches performed that are associated with points of interest, and places visited when the navigation route  was previously traveled. Further, for example, the preferences , the usage information , or a combination thereof can be used to select the point of interest  of  based on the user's calendar, trip itinerary, diet preference, and review ratings.","The navigation system  can include a media module , which is defined as a module that generates location-based information associated with navigation information. The location delivery module  can send the current location  and the navigation route  to the media module  for further processing. The information module  can send the preferences , the usage information , or a combination thereof to the media module  for further processing.","The media module  can include an obtain module , which is defined as a module that interfaces with the location delivery module  and the information module .

The public display location  is a geolocation or a geographic location of the public display system  of . The public display location  is scheduled or selected in advance prior to the vehicle arriving at the public display location , the user of the navigation system  begins traveling along the navigation route , or a combination thereof.","The public display location  is estimated by the identify location module  selecting a location associated with the navigation route . The public display location  is estimated to be within a geographic area along the navigation route . The term \u201cwithin a geographic area\u201d referred to herein means a location, along the navigation route , at which information on the public display system  is clearly and safely viewed without obstruction and with no risk of having accidents. The public display interface  of  can be viewed without viewing problems and without getting into any collisions when the current location  is at or near the public display location  along the navigation route .","The public display location  is identified to be a location such that sufficient amount of time is provided for the information on the public display system  to be viewed. The sufficient amount of time is determined based on speed, lighting, traffic conditions, weather conditions, or a combination thereof. For example, if an average travel speed of a vehicle approaching the public display location  is increased, a number of time units allocated for displaying the location-based notification  of  on the public display interface  is increased so that the location-based notification  is displayed at the number of time units prior to the vehicle arriving at the public display location .","The media module  can include a select notification module , which is defined as a module that determines the location-based notification . The select notification module  selects the location-based notification  related to the point of interest  based on the preferences , the usage information , or a combination thereof. In other words, the select notification module  selects the location-based notification  with information that matches the preferences , the usage information , or a combination thereof. The location-based notification  can be generated before the current location  is at or near the public display system  to solve the problem of scheduling in real-time.","For example, the location-based notification  can be determined based on the user's preferred products offered by businesses located in an area along the navigation route .

The view time  allows the location-based notification  to be viewed before the vehicle passes by the public display system .","The schedule notification module  estimates the view time  by speed, lighting, traffic conditions, weather conditions, or a combination thereof. The schedule notification module  also estimates the view time  by compensating for optimal contrast for easier reading according to time of day when the vehicle approaches the public display system . For example, the time of day can be used to indicate dawn, dusk, noon, or nighttime.","The schedule notification module  estimates the view time  by compensating for rates at which the public display location  and the current location  are changed. The rates can be compensated by taking into account a speed difference or a relative speed of moving vehicles or objects in a case where the public display location  is a position of one of the moving vehicles or objects to or on which the public display system  is attached or mounted.","The schedule notification module  estimates the view time  by compensating for a direction change. For example, the direction change can be compensated for when the vehicle or the current position  deviates or moves away from a previously planned route, such as the navigation route .","Also for example, the direction change can be compensated for in a case of a moving vehicle, for which a position is identified by the current position , and another moving vehicle, for which a position is identified by the public display location  since the public display system  is attached to or mounted on the another moving vehicle. In this example, the direction change is a resulting direction or a direction difference between travel directions of the moving vehicle and the another moving vehicle.","The media module  can be coupled to the navigation module  and the information module .
