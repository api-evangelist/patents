title: Method and apparatus for adaptive transmission control in a high data rate communication system
abstract: In a high data rate communication system, a method and apparatus for improved throughput while transmitting data packets within multiple time slots. In order to avoid unnecessary retransmissions of a packet, a subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal to a base station, causing the base station to cease further transmissions of the packet. In order to enable successful decoding of a packet, a subscriber station sends a Continue-Repeat signal to a base station, causing the base station to send retransmissions of the packet during time slots beyond a predetermined default number of time slots.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["I. Field of the Invention","The current invention relates to wireless data communication. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for high rate packet data transmission in a wireless communication system.","II. Description of the Related Art","A modern day communication system is required to support a variety of applications. One such communication system is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system which conforms to the \u201cTIA\/EIA-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System\u201d and its progeny, hereinafter referred to as IS-95. The CDMA system allows for voice and data communications between users over a terrestrial link. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS\u201d, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM\u201d, both assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","In a CDMA system, communications between users are conducted through one or more base stations. In wireless communication systems, forward link refers to the channel through which signals travel from a base station to a subscriber station, and reverse link refers to channel through which signals travel from a subscriber station to a base station. By transmitting data on a reverse link to a base station, a first user on one subscriber station communicates with a second user on a second subscriber station. The base station receives the data from the first subscriber station and routes the data to a base station serving the second subscriber station. Depending on the location of the subscriber stations, both may be served by a single base station or multiple base stations. In any case, the base station serving the second subscriber station sends the data on the forward link. Instead of communicating with a second subscriber station, a subscriber station may also communicate with a terrestrial internet through a connection with a serving base station. In wireless communications such as those conforming to IS-95, forward link and reverse link signals are transmitted within disjoint frequency bands.","The subscriber station communicates with at least one base station during a communication. CDMA subscriber stations are capable of communicating with multiple base stations simultaneously during soft handoff. Soft handoff is the process of establishing a link with a new base station before breaking the link with the previous base station. Soft handoff minimizes the probability of dropped calls. The method and system for providing a communication with a subscriber station through more than one base station during the soft handoff process are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,261, entitled \u201cMOBILE ASSISTED SOFT HANDOFF IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. Softer handoff is the process whereby the communication occurs over multiple sectors which are serviced by the same base station. The process of softer handoff is described in detail in copending U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,876, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING HANDOFF BETWEEN SECTORS OF A COMMON BASE STATION\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein","Given the growing demand for wireless data applications, the need for very efficient wireless data communication systems has become increasingly significant. The IS-95 standard is capable of transmitting traffic data and voice data over the forward and reverse links. A method for transmitting traffic data in code channel frames of fixed size is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,504,773, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORMATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, the traffic data or voice data is partitioned into code channel frames that are 20 milliseconds wide with data rates as high as 14.4 Kbps.","A significant difference between voice services and data services is the fact that the former imposes stringent and fixed delay requirements. Typically, the overall one-way delay of speech frames must be less than 100 milliseconds. In contrast, the data delay can become a variable parameter used to optimize the efficiency of the data communication system. Specifically, more efficient error correcting coding techniques which require significantly larger delays than those that can be tolerated by voice services can be utilized. An exemplary efficient coding scheme for data is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,462, entitled \u201cSOFT DECISION OUTPUT DECODER FOR DECODING CONVOLUTIONALLY ENCODED CODEWORDS\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","Another significant difference between voice services and data services is that the former requires a fixed and common grade of service (GOS) for all users. Typically, for digital systems providing voice services, this translates into a fixed and equal transmission rate for all users and a maximum tolerable value for the error rates of the speech frames. In contrast, for data services, the GOS can be different from user to user and can be a parameter optimized to increase the overall efficiency of the data communication system. The GOS of a data communication system is typically defined as the total delay incurred in the transfer of a predetermined amount of data, hereinafter referred to as a data packet.","Yet another significant difference between voice services and data services is that the former requires a reliable communication link which, in the exemplary CDMA communication system, is provided by soft handoff. Soft handoff results in redundant transmissions from two or more base stations to improve reliability. However, this additional reliability is not required for data transmission because the data packets received in error can be retransmitted. For data services, the transmit power used to support soft handoff can be more efficiently used for transmitting additional data.","Transmission delay required to transfer a data packet and the average throughput rate are two attributes used to define the quality and effectiveness of a data communication system. Transmission delay does not have the same impact in data communication as it does for voice communication, but it is an important metric for measuring the quality of the data communication system. The average throughput rate is a measure of the efficiency of the data transmission capability of the communication system. There is a need in the art for communication systems that provide improved data throughput while simultaneously providing a GOS that is appropriate for wireless packet data services.","The present invention is directed to a novel and improved method and apparatus for high rate packet data transmission in a CDMA system. An exemplary system for transmitting high rate digital data in a wireless communication system is disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGHER RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d (hereafter the '386 application) assigned to the assignee of the present application and incorporated by reference herein. The present invention advantageously improves the throughput of a high data rate CDMA system by minimizing unnecessary retransmissions of packet data within transmit time slots after successful decoding of the associated packet data by a destination network node such as a wireless subscriber station.","It is an aspect of the present invention to improve the data throughput of a high data rate system such as that described in the '386 application. In an exemplary aspect, a destination network node such as a subscriber station sends a data rate control (DRC) signal to a source network node such as a base station on a data rate control (DRC) channel. Based on the DRC signal, the base station chooses a data rate at which packets of data are sent to the subscriber station on the forward link. The information in the DRC signal is based on carrier-to-interference (C\/I) measurements that the subscriber station performs on previous forward link signals received from the base station. In an exemplary aspect, the subscriber station chooses a data rate that will ensure that the packet error rate (PER) will not exceed a predetermined target PER and specifies that data rate in the DRC signal. As the characteristics of the forward link channel change over time, the subscriber station adjusts the DRC signal accordingly.","In an exemplary aspect of the invention, the base station sends data to the subscriber station at the data rate specified by the DRC signal most recently received from the subscriber station. The base station sends packets of data to a plurality of subscriber stations using fixed-duration forward link time slots. In an exemplary aspect, the base station sends data to only one of the plurality of subscriber stations during each forward link time slot.","If the data rate specified by the DRC signal of a destination subscriber station is sufficiently small, the base station sends each packet of data within multiple forward link time slots. In an exemplary aspect, a 1024-bit packet of data may be transmitted at a rate of 38,400 bits-per-second (bps) within sixteen time slots, with each time slot having a duration of 1.67 milliseconds. In the exemplary aspect, the same packet of data may be alternatively sent at a rate of 76,800 bps within eight time slots. Accordingly, several other data rates are contemplated in the exemplary aspect, with a predetermined number of time slots associated with each data.","In an aspect of the invention, the forward link signal transmitted in each of the multiple time slots for a packet contains all of the data in the packet. In other words, the packet data is not divided among the multiple time slots. Instead, the entire packet of data is transmitted within each time slot. The lower the data rate indicated by the subscriber station's DRC request, the greater the number of time slots in which the packet must be repeated to maintain the target PER. For example, a DRC request of a data rate of 38,400 may require that the base station send a 1024-bit packet in sixteen time slots. The base station will then transmit the same 1024-bit packet during sixteen subsequent time slots. In an exemplary aspect, the base station uses puncturing techniques well known in the art to puncture a preamble into the signal transmitted during the first of multiple time slots associated with a multiple-slot packet. The subscriber station uses this preamble to determine whether the base station has begun transmitting a multiple-slot packet addressed to the subscriber station.","In an aspect of the invention, the multiple copies of a multiple-slot packet are sent within non-consecutive time slots. For example, a sixteen-slot packet may be sent in every other slot during a thirty-one-slot period. In another aspect of the invention, a sixteen-slot packet may be sent in every fifth slot of a sixty-five-slot period. In either aspect, the pattern of slots used to transmit frames of each rate is predetermined. All signals sent within the time slots associated with a single packet are transmitted at the same data rate. In other words, once the transmission of a multiple-slot packet has begun at a data rate, the rest of the time slots associated with that packet are transmitted at the same data rate. The subscriber station accumulates the data received during each of the associated time slots in order to successfully decode the packet data and distinguish it from the signal noise.","In an exemplary aspect, the base station may not increase the data rate of a multiple-slot packet once the first time slot of the packet has been transmitted. To avoid losing a multiple-slot packet when the forward link channel degrades, the data rates chosen for multiple-slot packets are very conservative. Often, if the forward link channel improves during the transmission of a multiple-slot packet, the destination subscriber station may successfully decode the packet before all of the multiple copies of the packet have been sent by the base station. The longer the period during which multiple-slot packets are transmitted, the greater is the probability that the C\/I of the forward link will change and no longer match the subscriber station's requested DRC data rate. If the subscriber station successfully decodes the packet within less than the predetermined number of copies of the packet, transmitting the remaining copies of the packet is a waste of precious forward link bandwidth. In addition, if the forward link signal happens to fade during the transmission of a multiple-slot packet, then the data thus far accumulated for the packet might be prematurely discarded. Transmitting the packet for just one or two more slots might enable successful decoding and avoid wasting the signals transmitted in the previous time slots.","In an exemplary aspect, each packet has a sequence number, and packets that are not successfully received by a subscriber station are retransmitted by a higher protocol layer. However, the subscriber station discards the buffered samples from the first transmission of the packet before the first slot of the packet retransmission is received. For this reason, the subscriber station cannot combine the packet retransmissions by the higher protocol layer with samples buffered from the first attempt to transmit the packet. For example, suppose a multiple-slot packet is transmitted at a low rate in sixteen time slots. If the packet is not successfully decoded in those sixteen time slots, then the higher protocol layer retransmits the packet at some time in the future. If the retransmission occurs at the same data rate as the first attempt, then the retransmission may consume sixteen additional time slots, depending upon the data rate used for the retransmission. If, however, the subscriber station can request a few more time slots in the first attempt, then the packet might be successfully decoded within, for example, eighteen time slots. The net savings on the forward link would be fourteen time slots.","In an aspect of the invention, each forward link data rate is assigned a default number of time slots per packet. If the subscriber station successfully decodes a multiple-slot packet early (before it has received the default number of time slots), the subscriber station stops the base station from sending the rest of the time slots for the packet. The subscriber station accomplishes this by sending a Stop-Repeat signal to the base station. Upon receiving a Stop-Repeat signal, the base station ceases sending the packet in subsequent time slots.","In another aspect of the invention, if the subscriber station is unable to decode a multiple-slot packet from signals received in the default number of time slots, the subscriber station requests additional retransmissions of the packet from the base station. The subscriber station accomplishes this by sending a Continue-Repeat signal to the base station. Upon receiving a Continue-Repeat signal, the base station sends additional copies of the packet in one or more subsequent time slots in addition to the default number of time slots.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["106","108","106","108","108","102","108","108","102","108","108","108","102","104","102","104","108","102","104"],"i":["a ","a ","b ","b ","a","a ","a ","b","b ","a ","b","a ","a ","a ","b ","b","b ","b ","c. "]},"In an exemplary embodiment, each subscriber station  generates a signal quality metric based on signals received from base stations . A subscriber station receiving forward link signals from multiple base stations  identifies the base station associated with the received signal having the highest quality metric (for example base station ). The subscriber station generates a prediction of a data rate at which the packet error rate (PER) of packets received from the selected base station will not exceed a target PER. An exemplary embodiment uses a target PER of approximately 2%.","In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station computes a rate at which the \u201ctail probability\u201d is greater than or equal to the target PER. The tail probability is the probability that the actual signal quality during the packet transmission period is less than the signal quality required for successful decoding of a packet correctly at a requested rate. Subscriber station then sends a data rate control (DRC) signal based on the predicted tail probabilities to the selected base station . In an exemplary embodiment, the tail probability is computed using signal quality attributes such as the carrier-to-interference (C\/I) ratio of previous received signals. Based on previous measurements of signal quality, the subscriber station generates a prediction of the probably signal quality during the time slots used to transmit the next packet.","In an exemplary embodiment, each DRC signal sent by a subscriber station is addressed specifically to one selected base station . The selected base station is then the only base station which may transmit traffic channel data to the subscriber station during a subsequent time slot associated with the DRC signal. In an exemplary embodiment, the DRC signal indicates a requested data rate at which a specific selected base station may transmit forward link data to the subscriber station during a specific future time slot. Because the selected base station is the only base station that may \u201cserve\u201d the subscriber station during the specific future time slot, the selected base station is referred to as a \u201cserving base station.\u201d In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station identifies the serving base station by encoding the DRC signal using a specific Walsh code associated with the selected base station . Because the subscriber station uses a different orthogonal Walsh code to encode DRC signals to each different base station, no base station can decode a DRC signal that is meant for a different base station.","In an alternate embodiment, the DRC signal specifies one of a predetermined set of data rates at which the base station may send forward link data to the subscriber station . The data rate specified in the DRC signal is selected from the predetermined set of data rates based on previous measurements of signal quality metrics. The data rate is selected such that the predicted TAIL PROBABILITY for a packet at that rate will be less than or equal to the target TAIL PROBABILITY. In an exemplary embodiment, the DRC signal specifies one of thirteen possible data rates, though the number of possible data rates may vary. The DRC signal encodes the selected data rate into a four-bit signal transmitted on a DRC channel. In an exemplary embodiment, the DRC channel is orthogonal to the reverse link data channel. The reverse link data and pilot channels are orthogonally spread by 4-ary Walsh functions Wand W, respectively, as defined in Table 1 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"4-ary Walsh Functions"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"W","0000"]},{"entry":[{},"W","0101"]},{"entry":[{},"W","0011"]},{"entry":[{},"W","0110"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In an exemplary embodiment, base station monitors DRC signals from one or more subscriber stations and transmits forward link data to no more than one destination subscriber station during each forward link transmit time slot. Base station selects the destination subscriber station (for example subscriber station ) based on a scheduling procedure designed to balance the quality of service (QOS) requirements of each subscriber station with the desire to maximize throughput of the system. In an exemplary embodiment, base station transmits data to the destination subscriber station only at the rate indicated by the most recent DRC signal received from the destination subscriber station. This restriction makes it unnecessary for the destination subscriber station to perform rate detection on the forward link signal. Subscriber station need only determine whether it is the intended destination subscriber station during a given time slot.","In an alternative embodiment, base station may transmit forward link packets at a different rate than indicated by the DRC signal received from the destination subscriber station . In an exemplary embodiment, base station sends a data rate signal on the forward link that is used by subscriber stations to decode the corresponding forward link packets. In an alternative embodiment, base station just sends the forward link packet, requiring the destination subscriber station to perform blind rate determination while decoding the packet.","In an exemplary embodiment, the base station transmits a preamble within the first time slot of each new forward link packet. The preamble identifies the intended destination subscriber station. In an exemplary embodiment, the base station assigns one of a set of  possible Walsh codes to each active subscriber station in its cell. The Walsh codes assigned to each active subscriber station are unique within the cell. In other words, no two subscriber stations are assigned the same Walsh code for the same cell at the same time. The preamble of each packet is covered with the Walsh code assigned to the destination subscriber station. This Walsh cover identifies the intended destination subscriber station for each packet. In an exemplary embodiment, only the first of multiple slots containing data for a single packet is transmitted with a preamble. In an exemplary embodiment, the preamble is punctured into the forward link packet data.","In an exemplary embodiment, once a destination subscriber station establishes that it is the intended destination for data in a slot, the subscriber station begins decoding the data in the associated time slot. In an exemplary embodiment, the destination subscriber station determines the data rate of the data in the forward link time slot based on previous DRC signals sent by the destination subscriber station . As described above, the destination subscriber station may alternatively determine the rate based on a forward link data rate signal or on blind rate detection.","In an exemplary embodiment, base station transmits the data for a single packet using a single data rate. In other words, if a packet is transmitted within sixteen time slots, the forward link data rates in each of those time slots will be equal to each other.","In an exemplary embodiment, the number of forward link time slots used to transmit a packet varies based on the data rate at which the packet is sent. Packets sent at a lower rate are sent using a greater number of time slots.

By accumulating samples for a packet over multiple slots, destination subscriber station takes advantage of the strong slot-to-slot correlation in the data signal compared to the weak slot-to-slot correlation in the interference and noise components. The samples accumulated over multiple slots eventually enable successful decoding of the packet. A multiple-slot packet is sent over a maximum number of time slots at a constant data rate. If the noise characteristics of the forward link channel improve after the first slot is sent, the destination subscriber station may be able to successfully decode the packet before receiving the maximum number of time slots. Once the destination subscriber station successfully decodes the packet, subsequent forward link time slots containing data for the decoded packet are discarded. In an exemplary embodiment, each packet includes a cyclic redundancy checksum (CRC) that enables the destination subscriber station to determine when the packet has been successfully decoded.","Another advantage of transmitting a packet over multiple time slots is that the received signal will have greater time diversity. In a dynamic fading environment, a packet that is transmitted over a short period of time can easily be lost to a relatively transient fade in the signal. However, if a packet is transmitted over a period of time that is longer than the duration of a fade, then the signal received outside of the fade period can allow successful decoding of the packet. The longer the transmission period of a packet, the lower are the chances that a fade will block the entire packet signal. However, longer transmission periods also make it more difficult to accurately predict the signal quality over the entire transmission period. In an exemplary embodiment, feedback signals enable the system to take advantage of time diversity while suffering minimally for inaccurate predictions of tail probability.","In an exemplary embodiment, destination subscriber station accumulates samples of a packet transmitted within the multiple time slots of a multiple-slot packet. After the samples of the first slot of the packet are received, the samples of subsequent slots containing data for the same packet are accumulated into a packet accumulation buffer. If the CRC of the contents of the packet accumulation buffer indicate receipt of an error-free packet, the destination subscriber station declares the packet successfully decoded. In an exemplary embodiment, destination subscriber station then sends a Stop-Repeat signal to base station , indicating the successful decoding of the packet. Upon receiving the Stop-Repeat signal from destination subscriber station , base station terminates the transmission of that forward link packet. If fewer than the maximum number of time slots have been used to transmit the packet, the Stop-Repeat signal results in base station using fewer than the maximum number of time slots to send the packet. For example, if base station receives a Stop-Repeat signal after sending only eight slots of a sixteen-slot packet, then base station sends no more slots containing data for that packet.","It is desirable to avoid sending the Stop-Repeat signal where it results in no change in the behavior of base station . For this reason, in an exemplary embodiment, destination subscriber station only sends the Stop-Repeat signal if it has received fewer than the maximum number of time slots containing data for a multiple-slot packet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","208","204","208","204","206","204","208","202","210","212"],"i":["b","b "]},"In an exemplary embodiment, the pilot burst signals are transmitted continuously over an orthogonal code channel, similar to IS-95 systems. In an exemplary embodiment, the pilot burst signals are spread using a Walsh code W(which is equivalent to no Walsh cover). In an exemplary embodiment, the pilot burst signals are used by subscriber stations for initial acquisition, phase recovery, timing recovery, and ratio combining. In an exemplary embodiment, the pilot burst signals are also used by subscriber stations to perform C\/I measurements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":["a ","a ","a "],"b":["302","302","308"]},"Upon determining that the first time slot contains data for a packet addressed to the subscriber station, the subscriber station attempts to decode the received packet data from the data stored in the packet accumulation buffer. In an exemplary embodiment, the data rate of the packet is based on a DRC signal sent previously by the subscriber station and addressed specifically to the serving base station.","In an exemplary embodiment, each attempt to decode a packet from the contents of the packet accumulation buffer-takes an additional number of slot periods shown as decoding period . Though shown as three slots, decoding period may vary. At the end of the decoding period , the subscriber station checks the cyclic redundancy checksum (CRC) of the received forward link packet. If the CRC indicates that the packet was received without errors, then the destination subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal to the serving base station during the next time slot . The base station, upon successfully decoding the Stop-Repeat signal, sends no further repeated transmissions of the same packet.","In an exemplary embodiment, a subscriber station can receive multiple packets in interlaced slots. For example, slot might contain the first slot of a first multiple-slot packet for the subscriber station. In addition, during decoding period and the next time slot , the subscriber station may receive the data for additional packets. For example, during the three slots shown as decoding period , the subscriber station might receive the third slot of data for a second multiple-slot packet, the sixteenth slot of data for a second multiple-slot packet, and the first and only slot of data for a third packet. In addition, the subscriber station might receive a slot of data for a fourth packet during the following slot . The subscriber station stores the data for each separate packet into separate packet accumulation buffers. In an exemplary embodiment, wherein each multiple-slot packet is transmitted in forward link slots spaced five slots apart, a subscriber station has five packet accumulation buffers to decode as many as five packets at a time. In an exemplary embodiment, the five packets are not necessarily transmitted by the same serving base station. For example, a first serving base station may be sending the first two multiple-slot packets using time slots that are interlaced with time slots associated with three multiple-slot packets transmitted by a second serving base station.","After each slot prior to the maximum number of slots for a multiple-slot packet, the subscriber station attempts to decode the packet from the data accumulated in the corresponding packet accumulation buffer. In an exemplary embodiment, the process of decoding the contents of the packet accumulation buffer takes several slot periods shown as decoding period . If, at the end of decoding period , the packet has been successfully decoded, the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal to the serving base station. The Stop-Repeat signal is transmitted during the time slot  immediately following the decoding period . After sending a Stop-Repeat signal, the subscriber station searches for a subsequent packet beginning in time slot ","If the packet is not successfully decoded from the received signal of the first time slot , then the serving base station transmits the data of the packet in a second time slot . If the serving base station never receives a Stop-Repeat signal, the serving base station will continue to transmit the packet in every fifth time slot. The serving base station stops transmitting the packet after the maximum number of time slots associated with the transmit data rate has been reached. Meanwhile, the destination subscriber station accumulates data received during the different time slots of a multiple-slot packet into a packet accumulation buffer. For example, after the first data of a packet is received in a first time slot the data is accumulated into a previously clear packet accumulation buffer. When the next set of data for the same packet is received during time slot , the received data is accumulated into the same packet accumulation buffer along with the data from the first slot . The data for the same packet is transmitted again in time slot , and the data is again accumulated into the packet accumulation buffer along with the data from previous time slots and ","After each time slot associated with the multiple-slot packet , the subscriber station attempts to decode the packet from the contents of the packet accumulation buffer. If the subscriber station successfully decodes the packet after a decoding period , the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal during the time slot immediately following the decoding period  in which the packet was decoded. In an exemplary embodiment, an exception to this rule exists when the packet is decoded after receiving the maximum number of time slots for the packet. The Stop-Repeat signal is not sent after the maximum number of time slots for a packet have been received, whether or not the packet was successfully decoded.","In an exemplary embodiment, a base station transmits at low data rates using multiple-slot packets. In order for the base station to direct the full forward link capacity to a subscriber station using a low data rate, the base station must send five multiple-slot packets at a time. In an alternate embodiment, the subscriber station has fewer packet accumulation buffers than the number of slots in decoding period and the following slot . This decreases the number of simultaneous packets that the subscriber station can receive, but saves memory in the subscriber station.","If the base station does not receive a Stop-Repeat signal in time slot , then the base station transmits the packet in the time slot immediately following time slot . The base station's failure to decode a Stop-Repeat signal could mean either that the subscriber station did not send a Stop-Repeat signal or that the Stop-Repeat signal was lost to communication error. In the latter case, the base station may end up transmitting the packet in more time slots than needed for successful decoding by the subscriber station. For example, if the base station sends a sixteen-slot packet that is successfully decoded by the subscriber station after the first slot, the destination subscriber station will send a Stop-Repeat signal to the base station. If the base station does not successfully decode the Stop-Repeat signal, then the base station will send the remaining fifteen slots of the packet, resulting in undesirable waste of forward link bandwidth.","Several approaches are contemplated to minimize the probability that a Stop-Repeat signal is lost to communication error. In an exemplary embodiment, a subscriber station transmits the Stop-Repeat signal using the Walsh code channel otherwise used to transmit the DRC signal. In an exemplary embodiment, eleven data rates are encoded into a four-bit signal on the DRC channel. The number of data rates is less than the sixteen possible four-bit DRC code words, leaving some code words available for other uses. In an exemplary embodiment, the Stop-Repeat signal is sent as one of the unused DRC code words. In an exemplary embodiment, the Stop-Repeat signal is transmitted through the Pilot\/DRC channel using greater power than Pilot and DRC signals to improve decoding reliability of the Stop-Repeat signal.","In an alternate embodiment, the pilot signal and DRC signals are transmitted at the same time as the Stop-Repeat bit. The Stop-Repeat bit is transmitted using a different orthogonal Walsh function than the reverse link data signals and the pilot and DRC signals. In an exemplary embodiment, the reverse link data, the pilot\/DRC channel, and the Stop-Repeat signal are orthogonally spread by 4-ary Walsh functions W, W, and W, respectively, as defined in Table 1 above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":["b ","a ","a"],"b":["322","324"]},"In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station accumulates data received in the first slot into a packet accumulation buffer and tries to decode a packet preamble from the signal. Based on the preamble, the subscriber station identifies time slot as the first slot of a multiple-slot packet addressed to the subscriber station. In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station analyzes the quality of the pilot burst data received in time slot . The pilot burst quality information is then used to predict whether the packet data in time slot can be successfully decoded.","In an exemplary embodiment, the pilot burst signal quality information from subsequent time slots associated with the same packet is combined to form a new prediction of whether the packet can be reliably decoded. For example, a subscriber station may receive a first transmission of a multiple-slot packet in a first time slot . If the subscriber station does not send a Stop-Repeat signal in time slot , the serving base station will send the second transmission of the multiple-slot packet in time slot . The subscriber station will combine signal quality information generated from pilot bursts in the first slot with signal quality information generated from pilot bursts in the second slot . This process continues with the third slot of the multiple-slot packet and so forth until the serving base station has transmitted the maximum number of slots for the multiple-slot packet. After each new slot of a multiple-slot packet is received, the subscriber station uses the cumulative pilot burst signal quality information to generate a new prediction of whether the packet can be successfully decoded. If it is determined that the packet can be successfully decoded, then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal in the nearest reverse link time slot to the serving base station. After sending the Stop-Repeat signal, the subscriber station begins looking for the beginning of a new packet in subsequent forward link time slots.","In an exemplary embodiment, a multiple-slot packet is sent during every other time slot. In order to accumulate multiple-slot packets in every forward link time slot, a subscriber station needs only two separate packet accumulation buffers. This lesser number of packet accumulation buffers is desirable, because it reduces the cost of building the subscriber station.","In an exemplary embodiment, the destination subscriber station uses the second half-slot of a first time slot to evaluate the signal quality of the pilot burst received during the first half-slot of the first time slot . In an exemplary embodiment, this is necessary to allow time to determine whether to send a Stop-Repeat signal during the next time slot . A Stop-Repeat signal sent in time slot will be based on pilot burst signal quality information from the pilot burst in the first half-slot, but not the pilot burst in the second half-slot of time slot . If no Stop-Repeat signal is sent in time slot , then signal quality information from three pilot burst periods is analyzed in the second half-slot of time slot to determine whether to send a Stop-Repeat signal during time slot . The pilot burst periods analyzed during the second half-slot of time slot include both pilot bursts received during time slot and the pilot burst from the first half-slot of time slot . Likewise, pilot burst data from five pilot bursts are analyzed during time slot , with two additional pilot bursts being analyzed in each subsequent time slot associated with the same multiple-slot packet. In an alternate embodiment in which faster processors are used, both pilot bursts of each new time slot are used to determine whether to send a Stop-Repeat signal in the following time slot.","In an exemplary embodiment, analyzing the pilot burst signal quality takes less time than actually decoding the contents of the packet. For this reason, the subscriber station may send the Stop-Repeat signal in the time slot immediately after the slot containing the packet data. One disadvantage with this approach is that inaccurate predictions can waste bandwidth. For example, the subscriber station might predict that a packet can be successfully decoded based on the quality of the pilot burst signal. The subscriber station would then send a Stop-Repeat signal to the serving base station based on that prediction. After receiving the Stop-Repeat signal, the base station will not send data for that packet in any more time slots. If the prediction turns out to be inaccurate and the packet cannot be successfully decoded, then all forward link time slots previously used for that packet will have been wasted.","In an exemplary embodiment, signal quality information for multiple pilot bursts is cumulatively analyzed to generate a decoding prediction metric. In an exemplary embodiment, all but the pilot burst in the last half-slot are analyzed to generate the decoding prediction metric. In an exemplary embodiment, each forward link time slot is divided into two half-slots. Each half-slot has one pilot burst, transmitted at the center of the half-slot. The pilot burst information generates the decoding prediction metric by adding the C\/I values generated over each pilot burst. The decoding prediction metric is then compared with a decoder prediction threshold. If the decoding prediction metric is greater than or equal to the decoding prediction threshold, then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal to the serving base station.","Either an unnecessarily high or an unnecessarily low decoder prediction threshold value can lead to system inefficiency. For example, if the decoder prediction threshold is too low, then the subscriber station will incorrectly predict that a packet can be successfully decoded. After sending a Stop-Repeat signal, the subscriber station will not be able to decode the packet from the data received in previous time slots. The data received in previous time slots will be lost. On the other hand, if the decoder prediction threshold is too high, then the subscriber station will incorrectly predict that a packet cannot be successfully decoded from the data received in previous time slots. Because the subscriber station will not send a Stop-Repeat signal, it will receive an additional time slot of data that it doesn't need. The bandwidth used to send the unneeded time slot will be wasted. In an exemplary embodiment, the decoder prediction threshold is chosen to balance the cost of incorrect predictions in either direction. In addition, the decoder prediction threshold may be modified over time to compensate for a changing signal propagation environment.","In an alternate embodiment, the serving base station transmits a multiple-slot packet in every other time slot, and the subscriber station performs full decoding before sending the Stop-Repeat signal. For example, if the decoding period is two time slots long, then the signal received in the first time slot will not be decoded until the end of time slot . By the time the subscriber station decodes the first time slot of the packet, the next time slot for the packet will already have been received. After decoding of the first time slot has begun, the subscriber station accumulates the data received for the same packet in the next time slot into the same packet accumulation buffer. If the subscriber station correctly decodes the packet from the signal received in the first time slot , then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal during the next time slot . In this event, the bandwidth used to send the copy of the packet within the second time slot will have been wasted. If the packet is correctly decoded after receiving and accumulating the fourth slot of data for the packet, then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal during the slot following the decoding period. In an exemplary embodiment, multiple-slot packets are sent in every other time slot, the subscriber station does full decoding after each packet time slot, and at most one time slot of data is wasted.","In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station does not send a Stop-Repeat signal after the maximum number of time slots have been received for a packet. This is true even if the subscriber station successfully decodes a multiple-slot packet after accumulating data in the second-to-last time slot of the packet. It is not necessary for the subscriber station to consume reverse link bandwidth telling the serving base station to stop repeating the packet when the serving base station would stop at that time anyway.","In another alternate embodiment, the subscriber station combines two of the techniques described above. The subscriber station performs pilot burst signal quality analysis and, if the decoding prediction metric is greater than or equal to the decoding prediction threshold, then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal to the serving base station. In parallel with analyzing the quality of received pilot burst signals, the subscriber station performs full decoding of received time slot data.","In an exemplary embodiment, multiple-slot packets are sent in every other time slot, and the decoding period is two time slots. The subscriber station receives the first slot of a multiple-slot packet in time slot and stores the received data into a packet accumulation buffer. The subscriber station analyzes the quality of the pilot burst signal received in the time slot and generates a decoding prediction metric. If the decoding prediction metric is greater than or equal to the decoding prediction threshold, then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal in time slot . If the decoding prediction metric is less than the decoding prediction threshold, then the subscriber station does not send a Stop-Repeat signal in time slot . The subscriber station also begins decoding the contents of the packet accumulation buffer. If the packet can be successfully decoded from the contents of the packet accumulation buffer, then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal in the time slot immediately following the decoding period. The subscriber station analyzes pilot burst data received in time slots and to determine whether to send a Stop-Repeat signal in time slot . The pilot burst analysis continues in each slot until the maximum number of time slots for the packet have been received or until the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal. Likewise, the subscriber station accumulates the signals received during time slots and to determine whether to send a Stop-Repeat signal in time slot . Each subsequent slot of data is accumulated into the packet accumulation buffer, and the data is decoded. If the packet is successfully decoded from the contents of the packet accumulation buffer before the maximum number of time slots for the packet, then the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal. As soon as the subscriber station sends a Stop-Repeat signal, whether based on pilot burst signal quality or successful decoding, the subscriber station begins looking for new frames in the next forward link time slot.","Occasionally, a packet is not successfully decoded even after repeating the packet over the maximum number of time slots associated with the packet's transmit data rate. In some cases, the packet might be decodable after retransmitting the frame in one or two additional time slots. For example, if a sixteen-slot packet cannot be successfully decoded from the packet accumulation buffer contents after sixteen slots, perhaps accumulating the packet data in a seventeenth slot would be just enough to make the packet decodable. If this were so, then the seventeenth slot might be worth expending to avoid wasting the previous sixteen slots already devoted to the packet. In an alternate embodiment, the subscriber station may request that a packet be repeated over a limited number of time slots after the maximum time slots have already been transmitted. For example, after receiving the last of sixteen time slots of a multiple-slot packet, the subscriber may request additional repeated transmissions of the packet from the serving base station.","In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station sends a Continue-Repeat signal to the serving base station to request that the data for a packet be retransmitted in an additional time slot. In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station may request as many as n\/2 repeated transmissions of an n-slot packet in one-slot increments. For example, after receiving the last slot of a sixteen-slot packet in time slot , the subscriber station may request as many as eight additional repetitions of the packet beyond time slot . If the subscriber station is not able to decode the packet from data received in time slot , the subscriber station sends a Continue-Repeat signal in the following time slot . Upon receiving the Continue-Repeat signal transmitted during time slot , the serving base station retransmits the packet in a seventeenth time slot . This process continues until the subscriber station is unable to decode the packet after having requested and received the packet in a total of twenty-four time slots.","In an exemplary embodiment, the base station retransmits the packet in only one time slot after receiving a Continue-Repeat signal. For example, in order to receive a seventeenth retransmission of a packet in time slot , the subscriber station must send a Continue-Repeat signal in time slot . In order to receive an eighteenth retransmission of a packet in time slot , the subscriber station must send another Continue-Repeat signal in time slot . In an exemplary embodiment, the subscriber station may request half as many Continue-Repeats of a packet as the maximum number of slots for the multiple-slot packet. For example, the subscriber station may send as many as eight Continue-Repeat signals for a sixteen-slot packet.","Even when a subscriber station has received all the slots of a multiple-slot packet without being able to correctly decode the packet, the subscriber station should not necessarily send a Continue-Repeat signal. Based on the signal quality throughout the transmission period, the subscriber station can estimate the probability that the packet can be successfully decoded even after receiving several Continue-Repeat retransmissions. For example, the subscriber station can generate this estimate using signal quality information generated from pilot burst signals received from the serving base station. In an alternate embodiment, the subscriber station decides whether to send a Continue-Repeat signal after the last time slot of a multiple-slot packet based on this estimate. If the subscriber station predicts that the packet will most likely not be decodable even after receiving the maximum number of allowable Continue-Repeat retransmissions, then the subscriber station will not send a Continue-Repeat signal.","In an alternate embodiment, the first Continue-Repeat signal causes the serving base station to send a number multiple retransmissions of the packet. The number of multiple retransmissions of the packet depends upon the the maximum number of slots associated with the multiple-slot packet. For example, the first Continue-Repeat signal received in slot by a serving base station after sending the sixteenth time slot of a sixteen-slot packet causes the serving base station to retransmit the packet for an additional eight time slots. The subscriber station can cause the serving base station to send fewer than eight retransmissions of the packet by sending a Stop-Repeat signal. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the number of additional time-slots could be any fraction of the maximum number.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Stop-Repeat signal and the Continue-Repeat signal are sent using a spare DRC code word on the DRC channel. For example, if the first eleven code words of the 4-bit DRC channel signal are used to request each of the eleven data rates, then the twelfth DRC code word is used for sending Stop-Repeat and Continue-Repeat signals. The base station distinguishes Stop-Repeat signals from Continue-Repeat signals based upon time of receipt. For example, if the base station receives the twelfth DRC code word from the destination subscriber station before the last time slot of a multiple-slot packet has been transmitted, the base station recognizes it as a Stop-Repeat signal. If the base station receives the twelfth DRC code word from the destination subscriber station immediately after the last time slot of a multiple-slot packet has been transmitted, the base station recognizes it as a Continue-Repeat signal. As discussed above, the subscriber station may send the Stop-Repeat signals and Continue-Repeat signals at greater power than pilot signals or DRC rate requests. This is done to improve the reliability of receiving the Stop-Repeat signals and Continue-Repeat signals at the base station.","In an alternate embodiment, Stop-Repeat and Continue-Repeat signals are sent using different spare DRC code words on the DRC channel. For example, the first eleven code words of the 4-bit DRC channel signal are used to request eleven data rates. One of the remaining five DRC code words is used for sending Stop-Repeat signals and a different one of the remaining four DRC code words is used to send Continue-Repeat signals.","The Stop-Repeat and Continue-Repeat signals consume reverse link bandwidth, and therefore impact reverse link capacity. For this reason, the transmission of Stop-Repeat and Continue-Repeat signals is advantageously minimized in the system. Because each base station transmits to no more than one destination subscriber station at a time, no more than one subscriber station per cell can send either a Stop-Repeat or a Continue-Repeat signal. Also, a subscriber station does not send a Stop-Repeat and Continue-Repeat signal to a base station unless it will change the behavior of the base station. For example, a subscriber station does not send a Stop-Repeat signal after the last time slot of a multiple-slot packet, because the base station will stop transmitting the packet even without receiving the Stop-Repeat signal. Similarly, the subscriber station will not send a Continue-Repeat signal if the base station would otherwise continue transmitting copies of a packet without receiving the Continue-Repeat signal.","In an alternate embodiment, the Continue-Repeat signal is sent using the negative value of the 4-ary Walsh function used to send the Stop-Repeat symbol. In an exemplary embodiment, the reverse link data is spread using 4-ary Walsh function W, as defined in Table 1 above. The pilot\/DRC channel is spread using 4-ary Walsh function W, as defined in Table 1 above. In an exemplary embodiment, a +1 spread using 4-ary Walsh function W, as defined in Table 1 above indicates, a Stop-Repeat signal. A value of (\u22121) spread using 4-ary Walsh function W(as defined in Table 1 above) indicates a Continue-Repeat signal. If neither a Stop-Repeat signal nor a Continue-Repeat signal is being sent, then no power is transmitted on the orthogonal channel distinguished by 4-ary Walsh function W, as defined in Table 1 above.","In an exemplary embodiment, the time slots of a multiple-slot packet are spaced at constant intervals. For example, in , the different slots of a multiple-slot packet are shown as every fifth time slot. In , the different slots of a multiple-slot packet are shown as every other time slot. At very low data rates, the likelihood that a packet will be successfully decoded in the first few time slots is generally very small. However, spacing out the time slots used to transmit a multiple-slot packet also stretches out the time that it takes to completely transfer the packet. It is desirable to minimize the total time necessary to transmit a multiple-slot packet. In an alternate embodiment, the serving base station sends the first slots of a multiple-slot packet consecutively. For example, the serving base station might send the first eight time slots of a sixteen-time-slot packet consecutively and then transmit the remaining time slots at five-slot intervals. In an exemplary embodiment, the serving base station sends the first n\/2 time slots of an n-time-slot packet consecutively, and sends the remaining time slots at constant intervals. In alternate embodiments, other patterns of time slot usage for multiple-slot packets are also contemplated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B","b":["402","404","404"]},"During a forward link time slot following the sending of the DRC signal at step , the subscriber station reads the received forward link signal into a buffer at step .

In an exemplary embodiment, the serving base station inserts a preamble into the first slot of a packet transmission that only the intended destination subscriber station can decode.","If no preamble is decoded at step , then at step  the subscriber station requests a new packet again, starting with step .

MUX  multiplexes the output signals of summer  with a pilot channel signal. In an exemplary embodiment, the output signals of gain blocks  are part of a media access control (MAC) channel that is punctured into the continuous pilot channel signal by MUX . The output signal of MUX  is provided as an in-phase component of a signal to complex pseudonoise (PN) spreader . In an exemplary embodiment, the quadrature-phase component of the signal carries reverse link packet data being transmitted by the subscriber station. The output of complex PN spreader  is then upconverted, amplified, and transmitted by the subscriber station.","In an exemplary embodiment, control processor  sends forward link rate information to decoder  and controls buffers  based on the DRC signals previously sent through DRC encoder . In an exemplary embodiment, a serving base station may only send packets to the subscriber station at the rates requested in the subscriber station's DRC signals. Allowing the subscriber station to dictate the forward link data rate makes blind rate detection at the subscriber station unnecessary. In an alternate embodiment, the base station may send packets using a data rate other than those specified in the subscriber station's DRC signals. In the alternate embodiment, decoder  performs blind rate detection.","In an exemplary embodiment, demodulator  performs such functions as PN despreading, Walsh despreading, and deinterleaving of the data signals received from front end . The deinterleaving performed by demodulator  may utilize any of a number of interleaving techniques, such as block interleaving and bit reversal interleaving. In an exemplary embodiment, decoder  performs forward error correction (FEC) decoding of the data signals received from buffers . Decoder  may utilize any of several forward error correction coding techniques, including turbo-coding, convolutional coding, block coding, or other forms of coding including soft decision coding. In an exemplary embodiment, control processor  may be a general-purpose microprocessor, digital signal processor (DSP), programmable logic device, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other device capable of performing the functions of control processor  described herein. In an exemplary embodiment, C\/I processor  may be a general-purpose microprocessor, digital signal processor (DSP), programmable logic device, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other device capable of performing the functions of C\/I processor  described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["702","704","708","704","706","706","708","710","710","712","712","710"]},"In an exemplary embodiment, the base station receives reverse link signals through antenna , where they are downconverted in RF unit . RF unit  provides the downconverted, sampled signals to demodulator . Demodulated packets are provided by demodulator  to control processor , which routes data packets to base station controller (BSC) interface . In an exemplary embodiment, BSC interface  then sends the reverse link packets to a base station controller (not shown) through a backhaul interface (not shown).","Demodulator  also decodes Stop-Repeat and Continue-Repeat signals and provides those signals to control processor . Control processor  sends Stop-Repeat and Continue-Repeat information to scheduler . Upon receiving a Stop-Repeat signal or when no more repeats of a packet are to be sent, scheduler  clears the data of that packet from data queue . That space in the data queue can then be used for subsequent packets. Upon receiving a Continue-Repeat signal, scheduler  retransmits the data of the associated packet from data queue  in a subsequent forward link time slot.","In an exemplary embodiment, modulator  performs such functions as forward error correction (FEC) encoding, interleaving, Walsh spreading, and PN spreading of the data received from scheduler . In an exemplary embodiment, demodulator  performs such functions as PN despreading, Walsh despreading, deinterleaving, and forward error correction (FEC) decoding of the data signals received from RF unit .
