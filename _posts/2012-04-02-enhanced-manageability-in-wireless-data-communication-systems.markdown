No. 12\/315,178 entitled ENHANCED MANAGEABILITY IN WIRELESS DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS filed Nov. 26, 2008 which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","In some applications of cellular communication services, a service provider negotiates an advantageous billing rate per volume of data transfer between a device and a cellular communications network based on the specific needs of the service the service provider is providing to its customers. For example, a customer requires regular transmissions of very small amounts of data and negotiates an advantageous rate based on a guarantee of a small total data transfer volume. The service provider and the cellular communication network have an interest in ensuring that the customer is not able to use the cellular communication service outside of the negotiated parameters.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and\/or a processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and\/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term \u2018processor\u2019 refers to one or more devices, circuits, and\/or processing cores configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.","Enhanced manageability in wireless data communication systems is disclosed. A system implementing enhanced manageability comprises a rule-based authentication server for verifying that a particular combination of subscriber identity module (SIM) and device are allowed to use a network (e.g., a data network of a cellular phone network). Identification information associated with the SIM and the device are communicated with the network. The network in conjunction with a service provider determines acceptable accessibility between the device (e.g., a device provided by the service provider) and the network.","In some embodiments, the network comprises a global system for mobile communications (GSM) protocol network. The GSM network includes a username and a password for verification when a device registers with a general packet radio service (GPRS) data network overlaid on the GSM cellular network. The username fields and the password fields are used to provide device and SIM identification information to the network. In some networks, the username and password verification are not used, and either no data or meaningless data is\/are transmitted. The network and\/or service provider (e.g., an authentication server and\/or a service provider server) determines the appropriate action based on the identification numbers and a set of rules. In various embodiments, the appropriate action includes one or more of the following: allowing access, denying access, alerting a customer of a change in a device being used with a given SIM, logging the current device\/SIM combination, or any other appropriate server action.","In various embodiments, the relationship between a customer and a cellular communications service provider is direct or is arranged by a third party (e.g., a service provider). In some embodiments, a guarantee of data transfer volume is based on the requirements of a device (e.g., a service provider provided device) specific to the customer's desired application (e.g., a point of sale device, a credit card reader, a credit card approval device). To prevent an account being used with a device requiring higher data transfer which is outside of a desired network usage parameters (e.g., data transfer volume, usage access times, number of accesses, etc.), one or more conditions are enforced on a device used in conjunction with the account (e.g., as coupled to a user or customer via a SIM). In various embodiments, the one or more conditions comprise a prevention of a swapping of a SIM from a device to another device, a limitation on devices or kinds of devices to which the SIM can be swapped, a tracking of devices the SIM has been swapped to, or any other appropriate condition.","In various embodiments, device information is encoded into a username field, user\/account\/subscriber\/customer information is encoded into a username field, device information is encoded into a password field, user\/account\/subscriber\/customer information is encoded into a password field, device information is encoded into a username field and a password field, user\/account\/subscriber\/customer information is encoded into a username field and a password field, device information is partially encoded into a username field and\/or a password field, user or account or subscriber or customer information is partially encoded into a username field and\/or a password field, any other appropriate allocation of information between device, user, account, subscriber, customer or other information and a username field and\/or a password field. In some embodiments, the encoding comprises a secure encoding, a tamper proof encoding, no encoding, an error checking encoding, or any other appropriate encoding. In various embodiments, a username field and\/or a password field is subdivided to provide storage space for one or more of the following: a production date, a sign up date, an expiration date, a maintenance date, an account type, a rule set version, an encoding version, service provider identifier, a home network identifier, a revision number, or any other appropriate information.","In some embodiments, a username and password are not set up in advanced. In some embodiments, the username and\/or password are established on first or subsequent login attempts. In some embodiments, a customer or a device indicates a different username and\/or password on a login attempt based at least in part on the device identifier associated with the device that a user or customer is using to connect to a network.","In some embodiments, the username and\/or password fields are or are not used for authentication. In some embodiments, the username and\/or password fields are used for passing other information (e.g., device identity) enabling management of a user and\/or customer account regarding allowed device(s) for a given user's and\/or customer's interaction with a network.","Although the following description focuses on a GSM type cellular network, this should not be construed as limiting as other embodiments using other cellular network types (e.g., CDMA, TDMA, etc.) are implementable to one practiced in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","112","104","112","104","112","100","104","100","110","120","100","104","102","102","100","106","106","102","110","108","120","112","108","110","110","110","100","110","100","110","100","112","104","120","120","120","100","120","100","100","120","100"]},"Wireless data network  comprises serving GPRS support node (SGSN) , gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) , and authentication server .
