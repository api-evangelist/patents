Such systems can require many different components, distributed across many different hardware platforms, possibly in several different geographical locations. Thus, the architecture of a large software application, i.e., what its components are and how they fit together, is an important aspect of its design for a successful implementation.","This specification presents a software architecture design for a personnel events software application.","In its various aspects, the software architecture design can be implemented as methods, systems, and apparatuses, including computer program products, for implementing a software architecture design for a software application implementing service procurement.

These entities can be process components, business objects and reuse service components. A reuse service component is a piece of software that is reused in different transactions. A reuse service component is used by its defined interfaces, which can be, e.g., local APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or service interfaces.","A process component of an external system is drawn as a dashed-line process component . Such a process component  represents the external system in describing interactions with the external system; however, the process component  need not represent more of the external system than is needed to produce and receive messages as required by the process component that interacts with the external system.","The connector icon  is used to simplify the drawing of interactions between process components . Interactions between process component pairs  involving their respective business objects , process agents (at , , , and ), operations , interfaces , and messages (at  and ) are described as process component interactions, which determine the interactions of a pair of process components across a deployment unit boundary, i.e., from one deployment unit  to another deployment unit . Interactions between process components  are indicated in  by directed lines (arrows). Interactions between process components within a deployment unit need not be described except to note that they exist, as these interactions are not constrained by the architectural design and can be implemented in any convenient fashion. Interactions between process components that cross a deployment unit boundary will be illustrated by the figures of this patent application; these figures will show the relevant elements associated with potential interaction between two process components , but interfaces , process agents (at , , , and ), and business objects  that are not relevant to the potential interaction will not be shown.","The architectural design is a specification of a computer software application, and elements of the architectural design can be implemented to realize a software application that implements the end-to-end process mentioned earlier. The elements of the architecture are at times described in this specification as being contained or included in other elements; for example, a process component  is described as being contained in a deployment unit . It should be understood, however, that such operational inclusion can be realized in a variety of ways and is not limited to a physical inclusion of the entirety of one element in another.","The architectural elements include the business object . A business object  is a representation of a type of a uniquely identifiable business entity (an object instance) described by a structural model. Processes operate on business objects. This example business object represents a specific view on some well-defined business content. A business object represents content, which a typical business user would expect and understand with little explanation. Business objects are further categorized as business process objects and master data objects. A master data object is an object that encapsulates master data (i.e., data that is valid for a period of time). A business process object, which is the kind of business object generally found in a process component , is an object that encapsulates transactional data (i.e., data that is valid for a point in time). The term business object will be used generically to refer to a business process object and a master data object, unless the context requires otherwise. Properly implemented, business objects  are implemented free of redundancies.","The architectural elements also include the process component . A process component  is a software package that realizes a business process and generally exposes its functionality as services. The functionality includes the ability to perform all or parts of particular kinds of business transactions. A process component  contains one or more semantically related business objects . Any business object belongs to no more than one process component. Process components can be categorized as a standard process component, a process component at a business partner, a third party process component, or a user centric process component. The standard process component (named simply process component) is a software package that realizes a business process and exposes its functionality as services. The process component at a business partner is a placeholder for a process component (or other technology that performs the essential functions of the process component) used at a business partner. The third party process component is a process component (or other technology that performs the essential functions of the process component) provided by a third party. The user centric process component is a process component containing user interface parts.","Process components  are modular and context-independent. That they are context-independent means that a process component  is not specific to any specific application and is reusable. The process component  is often the smallest (most granular) element of reuse in the architecture.","The architectural elements also include the operation . An operation  belongs to exactly one process component . A process component  generally is able to perform multiple operations . Operations  can be synchronous or asynchronous, corresponding to synchronous or asynchronous process agents (e.g. at , , , and ), which will be described below. Operation  may be the smallest, separately-callable function, described by a set of data types used as input, output, and fault parameters serving as a signature.","The architectural elements also include the service interface , referred to simply as the interface. An interface  is a named group of operations . Interface  typically specifies inbound service interface functionality or outbound service interface functionality. Each operation  belongs to exactly one interface . An interface  belongs to exactly one process component . A process component  might contain multiple interfaces . In some implementations, an interface contains only inbound or outbound operations, but not a mixture of both. One interface can contain both synchronous and asynchronous operations. All operations of the same type (either inbound or outbound) which belong to the same message choreography will belong to the same interface. Thus, generally, all outbound operations  directed to the same other process component  are in one interface .","The architectural elements also include the message . Operations  transmit and receive messages . Any convenient messaging infrastructure can be used. A message is information conveyed from one process component instance to another, with the expectation that activity will ensue. An operation can use multiple message types for inbound, outbound, or error messages. When two process components are in different deployment units, invocation of an operation of one process component by the other process component is accomplished by an operation on the other process component sending a message to the first process component. In some implementations, the message is a form based message  that can be translated into a recognized format for an external process component . The form message type  is a message type used for documents structured in forms. The form message type  can be used for printing, faxing, emailing, or other events using documents structured in forms. In some implementations, the form message type  provides an extended signature relative to the normal message type. For example, the form message type  can include text information in addition to identification information to improve human reading.","The architectural elements also include the process agent (e.g. at , , , and ). Process agents do business processing that involves the sending or receiving of messages . Each operation  will generally have at least one associated process agent. The process agent can be associated with one or more operations . Process agents (at , , , and ) can be either inbound or outbound, and either synchronous or asynchronous.","Asynchronous outbound process agents  are called after a business object  changes, e.g., after a create, update, or delete of a business object instance. Synchronous outbound process agents  are generally triggered directly by a business object .","An outbound process agent ( and ) will generally perform some processing of the data of the business object instance whose change triggered the event. An outbound agent triggers subsequent business process steps by sending messages using well-defined outbound services to another process component, which generally will be in another deployment unit, or to an external system. An outbound process agent is linked to the one business object that triggers the agent, but it is sent not to another business object but rather to another process component. Thus, the outbound process agent can be implemented without knowledge of the exact business object design of the recipient process component.","Inbound process agents ( and ) are called after a message has been received. Inbound process agents are used for the inbound part of a message-based communication. An inbound process agent starts the execution of the business process step requested in a message by creating or updating one or multiple business object instances. An inbound process agent is not the agent of a business object but of its process component. An inbound process agent can act on multiple business objects in a process component.","Synchronous agents ( and ) are used when a process component requires a more or less immediate response from another process component, and is waiting for that response to continue its work.","Operations and process components are described in this specification in terms of process agents. However, in alternative implementations, process components and operations can be implemented without use of agents by using other conventional techniques to perform the functions described in this specification.","The architectural elements also include the communication channel template. The communication channel template is a modeling entity that represents a set of technical settings used for communication. The technical settings can include details for inbound or outbound processing of a message. The details can be defined in the communication channel template. In particular, the communication channel template defines an adapter type, a transport protocol, and a message protocol. In some implementations, various other parameters may be defined based on a selected adapter type. For example, the communication channel template can define a security level, conversion parameters, default exchange infrastructure parameters, processing parameters, download URI parameters, and specific message properties.","The communication channel template  can interact with internal or external process components (at  and ). To interact with an internal process component, the communication channel template is received and uploaded to be used with an operation and interface pair. To interact with an external process component, the communication channel template is received and uploaded to be used with an external entity, such as an external bank, business partner, or supplier.","The architectural elements also include the deployment unit . A deployment unit  includes one or more process components  that are deployed together on a single computer system platform. Conversely, separate deployment units can be deployed on separate physical computing systems. For this reason, a boundary of a deployment unit  defines the limits of an application-defined transaction, i.e., a set of actions that have the ACID properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. To make use of database manager facilities, the architecture requires that all operations of such a transaction be performed on one physical database; as a consequence, the processes of such a transaction must be performed by the process components  of one instance of one deployment unit .","The process components  of one deployment unit  interact with those of another deployment unit  using messages  passed through one or more data communication networks or other suitable communication channels. Thus, a deployment unit  deployed on a platform belonging one business can interact with a deployment unit software entity deployed on a separate platform belonging to a different and unrelated business, allowing for business-to-business communication. More than one instance of a given deployment unit can execute at the same time, on the same computing system or on separate physical computing systems. This arrangement allows the functionality offered by a deployment unit to be scaled to meet demand by creating as many instances as needed.","Since interaction between deployment units  is through service operations, a deployment unit can be replaced by other another deployment unit as long as the new deployment unit supports the operations depended upon by other deployment units. Thus, while deployment units can depend on the external interfaces of process components in other deployment units, deployment units are not dependent on process component interaction within other deployment units. Similarly, process components  that interact with other process components  or external systems only through messages , e.g., as sent and received by operations , can also be replaced as long as the replacement supports the operations  of the original .","In contrast to a deployment unit , the foundation layer does not define a limit for application-defined transactions. Deployment units  communicate directly with entities in the foundation layer, which communication is typically not message based. The foundation layer is active in every system instance on which the application is deployed. Business objects  in the foundation layer will generally be master data objects. In addition, the foundation layer will include some business process objects that are used by multiple deployment units . Master data objects and business process objects that should be specific to a deployment unit  are assigned to their respective deployment unit .","Interactions between Process Components \u201cTime and Labor Management\u201d and \u201cPayroll Processing\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["108","140"]},"As shown in , the Time and Labor Management process component  includes an Employee Time Agreement business object . The Employee Time Agreement business object  represents an agreement between employer and employee including time management stipulations derived from legal, company-specific, and pay-related provisions, and from terms agreed individually with the employee.","The Employee Time Agreement business object  uses a Notify of Planned Working Times from Time Agreement to Payroll Processing outbound process agent  to invoke a Notify of Planned Working Times operation  .

The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component (e.g., a data server), a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or a front-end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described herein), or any combination of such back-end, middleware, and front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) and a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), e.g., the Internet.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","While this specification contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the present disclosure or of what may be claimed, but rather as an exemplification of preferred embodiments of the present disclosure. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment may also be provided in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.","The subject matter has been described in terms of particular variations, but other variations can be implemented and are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. As one example, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Other variations are within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 20"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
