title: Display of port transmit and receive parameters sorted by higher of transmit or receive value
abstract: The data ports in a network are displayed in a list in descending order based on either the higher transmit or receive data value of the port. Therefore, the port with the highest of either the transmit or receive data value would be displayed on the top of the list. The port with the second highest of the transmit or receive data value would be displayed second on the list. This process would continue for all data ports that are displayed. The other of the transmit or receive data values of the port would be displayed but would not affect the ordering on the display.

Field of the Invention","The invention relates to network device management and more particularly to displaying a networking device.","2. Description of the Related Art","Network management software provides network administrators a way of tracking the bandwidth utilization of ports on a network. For smaller networks with a fewer number of ports, closely monitoring port utilization in a graphical user interface (GUI) is a less arduous task. However, for large networks, there are often so many ports that arrangement of the display of data values for each port based on predetermined parameters is necessitated. Current solutions to this problem offer arranging the ports in several ways. One current solution offers arranging the ports in descending order based on the port with the highest transmit value. Another current solution offers arranging the ports in descending order based on the port with the highest receive value. Yet another current solution offers arranging the ports in descending order based on the port with the highest of sum data transmit and data receive value. While these solutions aid administrators in tracking port traffic, they do not always allow for quick viewing of ports close to their physical maximum data transmit or receive values so that the administrator can take action to reroute traffic before congestion occurs. Therefore a method and system to improve the display of heavily used ports is desirable.","The data ports in a network are displayed in a list in descending order based on either the higher transmit or receive data value of the port. Therefore, the port with the highest of either the transmit or receive data value would be displayed on the top of the list. The port with the second highest of the transmit or receive data value would be displayed second on the list. This process would continue for all data ports that are displayed. The other of the transmit or receive data values of the port would be displayed but would not affect the ordering on the display.","This technique can be used on any telecommunication network.","Referring to , an Ethernet network  is shown wherein a LAN  is interconnected to a remote campus  via WAN . The campus core  includes a plurality of interconnected core switches . The core switches  are connected to a data center (not shown). A router no is connected to the core switches and the WAN . The core switches  are connected to switches  and  of an aggregation campus . The aggregation campus switches  and  are connected to switches  of large network  and provide data communication services to the large network's telephone , computer , and wireless access  devices. The aggregation network switches  and  may also be connected to additional campuses (not shown) in order to provide additional data communication services. The LAN  is connected to the WAN  via router no. The WAN  is comprised of a plurality of interconnected Ethernet switches  and other networking devices (not shown). WAN  is connected to remote campus  via a router . Router  provides data communication services to computers  and telephone devices . It is understood that this is an exemplary network and numerous other network topologies can be monitored according to the present invention.","In an embodiment of the present invention a management station  is connected to router no of the campus core . As will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art, the management station  allows a network administrator to monitor the data traffic, port utilization, and various other networking characteristics of each switching device in the Ethernet network .","Turning next to , a block diagram of an Ethernet switch or router  that may be utilized in Ethernet network  is shown. The Ethernet switch  comprises a switch software environment  and switch hardware environment . The software environment  includes a diagnostics and statistics module  to allow management software access to the various statistical counters in the switch , such as receive and transmit rate counters for each port , , , .
