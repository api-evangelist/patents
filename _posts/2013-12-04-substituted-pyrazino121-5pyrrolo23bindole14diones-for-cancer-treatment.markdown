In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent is any substance that can be used to alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of, and\/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a disease, disorder, and\/or condition.","As used herein, the term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount of a substance (e.g., a therapeutic agent, composition, and\/or formulation) that elicits a desired biological response when administered as part of a therapeutic regimen. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a substance is an amount that is sufficient, when administered to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease, disorder, and\/or condition, to treat, diagnose, prevent, and\/or delay the onset of the disease, disorder, and\/or condition. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of a substance may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the substance to be delivered, the target cell or tissue, etc. For example, the effective amount of compound in a formulation to treat a disease, disorder, and\/or condition is the amount that alleviates, ameliorates, relieves, inhibits, prevents, delays onset of, reduces severity of and\/or reduces incidence of one or more symptoms or features of the disease, disorder, and\/or condition. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is administered in a single dose; in some embodiments, multiple unit doses are required to deliver a therapeutically effective amount.","As used herein, the term \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreatment,\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d refers to any method used to partially or completely alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of, and\/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a disease, disorder, and\/or condition. Treatment may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease, disorder, and\/or condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered to a subject who exhibits only early signs of the disease, disorder, and\/or condition, for example for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing pathology associated with the disease, disorder, and\/or condition.","The expression \u201cunit dose\u201d as used herein refers to an amount administered as a single dose and\/or in a physically discrete unit of a pharmaceutical composition. In many embodiments, a unit dose contains a predetermined quantity of an active agent. In some embodiments, a unit dose contains an entire single dose of the agent. In some embodiments, more than one unit dose is administered to achieve a total single dose. In some embodiments, administration of multiple unit doses is required, or expected to be required, in order to achieve an intended effect. A unit dose may be, for example, a volume of liquid (e.g., an acceptable carrier) containing a predetermined quantity of one or more therapeutic agents, a predetermined amount of one or more therapeutic agents in solid form, a sustained release formulation or drug delivery device containing a predetermined amount of one or more therapeutic agents, etc. It will be appreciated that a unit dose may be present in a formulation that includes any of a variety of components in addition to the therapeutic agent(s). For example, acceptable carriers (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable carriers), diluents, stabilizers, buffers, preservatives, etc., may be included as described infra. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, in many embodiments, a total appropriate daily dosage of a particular therapeutic agent may comprise a portion, or a plurality, of unit doses, and may be decided, for example, by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. In some embodiments, the specific effective dose level for any particular subject or organism may depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of specific active compound employed; specific composition employed; age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject; time of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific active compound employed; duration of the treatment; drugs and\/or additional therapies used in combination or coincidental with specific compound(s) employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts.","As used herein, the term \u201cwild-type\u201d has its art-understood meaning that refers to an entity having a structure and\/or activity as found in nature in a \u201cnormal\u201d (as contrasted with mutant, diseased, altered, etc) state or context. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that wild type genes and polypeptides often exist in multiple different forms (e.g., alleles).","As used herein, the terms \u201ceffective amount\u201d and \u201ceffective dose\u201d refer to any amount or dose of a compound or composition that is sufficient to fulfill its intended purpose(s), i.e., a desired biological or medicinal response in a tissue or subject at an acceptable benefit\/risk ratio. The relevant intended purpose may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect). In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount that, when administered to a population of subjects that meet certain clinical criteria for a disease or disorder (for example, as determined by symptoms manifested, disease progression\/stage, genetic profile, etc.), a statistically significant therapeutic response is obtained among the population. A therapeutically effective amount is commonly administered in a dosing regimen that may comprise multiple unit doses. For any particular pharmaceutical agent, a therapeutically effective amount (and\/or an appropriate unit dose within an effective dosing regimen) may vary, for example, depending on route of administration, on combination with other pharmaceutical agents. In some embodiments, the specific therapeutically effective amount (and\/or unit dose) for any particular patient may depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific pharmaceutical agent employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and\/or rate of excretion or metabolism of the specific pharmaceutical agent employed; the duration of the treatment; and like factors as is well known in the medical arts. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that in some embodiments of the invention, a unit dosage may be considered to contain an effective amount if it contains an amount appropriate for administration in the context of a dosage regimen correlated with a positive outcome.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides a compound having the structure of formula I-a:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0166"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00017","num":"00017"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00017","he":"29.97mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09353150-20160531-C00017.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In some embodiments, the present invention provides a compound having the structure of formula I-b:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0168"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00018","num":"00018"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00018","he":"45.72mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09353150-20160531-C00018.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In some embodiments, the present invention provides drug-ligand conjugate compounds.

Exemplary cell-specific ligand unit are widely known in the art, including those described herein.","In some embodiments, M includes within its scope any unit of a Ligand (L) that, for example, binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor, antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target-cell population. In some embodiments, a Ligand is a molecule that binds to, complexes with, or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit acts to deliver the drug unit (e.g., a compound of formulae I-c or I-d) to the particular target cell population with which the Ligand unit reacts. Such Ligands include, but are not limited to, large molecular weight proteins such as, for example, full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, smaller molecular weight proteins, polypeptide or peptides, lectins, glycoproteins, non-peptides, vitamins, nutrient-transport molecules (such as, but not limited to, transferring, or any other cell binding molecule or substance), nucleic acids and their derivatives and analogs. In some embodiments, a Ligand is modified from its corresponding natural form by, for example, amino acid mutations (including substitutions, deletions, insertions, etc), incorporation of unnatural building blocks (such as unnatural amino acids and unnatural nucleotides (e.g., those with unnatural bases, sugars, and\/or internucleoside linkages)), chemical modifications, and\/or conjugation with other small or macro molecules. In some embodiments, M comprises a reactive functional group such as an amine (\u2014NH), aldehyde (\u2014CHO), carboxyl (\u2014COOH) or a sulfhydryl group (\u2014SH), or can be modified to contain such a functional group. In some embodiments, M is coupled to the linker moiety of the conjugate by way of a free reactive sulfhydryl (\u2014SH), amine (\u2014NH), aldehyde (\u2014CHO), ketone or carboxyl (\u2014COOH) group or can be modified to contain such a sulfhydryl, amine, aldehyde, ketone or carboxyl group. In some embodiments, M is an antibody (Ab). In some embodiments, L is a covalent bond and M is directly connected to D. In some embodiments, L is not a covalent bond and M is connected to D through L.","In some embodiments, a Ligand unit can form a bond to a linker unit (L) via a carbon atom of the Ligand. In some embodiments, a Ligand unit can form a bond to a linker unit (L) via a heteroatom of the Ligand. Heteroatoms that may be present on a Ligand unit include sulfur (in some embodiments, from a sulfhydryl group of a Ligand), oxygen (in some embodiments, from a carbonyl, carboxyl or hydroxyl group of a Ligand) and nitrogen (in some embodiment, from a primary or secondary amino group of a Ligand). These heteroatoms can be present on the Ligand in the Ligand's natural state, for example a naturally-occurring antibody, or can be introduced into the Ligand via chemical modification.","In some embodiments, a Ligand has a sulfhydryl group and the Ligand bonds to the Linker unit via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom.","In yet some other embodiments, the Ligand has one or more lysine residues that can be chemically modified to introduce one or more sulfhydryl groups. The Ligand unit bonds to the Linker unit via the sulhydryl group's sulfur atom. The reagents that can be used to modify lysines include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and 2-Iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut's Reagent).","In some embodiments, the Ligand can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be chemically modified to have one or more sulfhydryl groups. The Ligand unit bonds to the Linker Unit, such as the Stretcher Unit, via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom.","In some embodiments, the Ligand can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be oxidized to provide an aldehyde (\u2014CHO) group (see, for e.g., Laguzza, et al., 1989, 32(3), 548-55). The corresponding aldehyde can form a bond with a Reactive Site on a Stretcher. Reactive sites on a Stretcher that can react with a carbonyl group on a Ligand include, but are not limited to, hydrazine and hydroxylamine. Other protocols for the modification of proteins for the attachment or association to a compound of formulae I-c or I-d are described in Coligan et al., 2, John Wiley & Sons (2002).","Useful non-immunoreactive protein, polypeptide, or peptide Ligands include, but are not limited to, transferrin, epidermal growth factors (\u201cEGF\u201d), bombesin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, transforming growth factors (\u201cTGF\u201d), such as TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, vaccinia growth factor (\u201cVGF\u201d), insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, lectins and apoprotein from low density lipoprotein.","In some embodiments, M is an antibody. In some embodiments, an antibody refers to any immunoglobulin, whether natural or wholly or partially synthetically produced. All derivatives thereof which maintain specific binding ability are also included. In some embodiments, an antibody also covers any protein having a binding domain which is homologous or largely homologous to an immunoglobulin-binding domain. Such proteins may be derived from natural sources, or partly or wholly synthetically produced. An antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal. An antibody may be a member of any immunoglobulin class, including any of the human classes: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. In certain embodiments, an antibody may be a member of the IgG immunoglobulin class. In some embodiments, M is an antibody fragment or characteristic portion of an antibody, which refers to any derivative of an antibody which is less than full-length. In general, an antibody fragment retains at least a significant portion of the full-length antibody's specific binding ability. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), scFv, Fv, dsFv diabody, and Fd fragments. An antibody fragment may be produced by any means. For example, an antibody fragment may be enzymatically or chemically produced by fragmentation of an intact antibody and\/or it may be recombinantly produced from a gene encoding the partial antibody sequence. Alternatively or additionally, an antibody fragment may be wholly or partially synthetically produced. An antibody fragment may optionally comprise a single chain antibody fragment. Alternatively or additionally, an antibody fragment may comprise multiple chains which are linked together, for example, by disulfide linkages. An antibody fragment may optionally comprise a multimolecular complex. In some embodiments, a functional antibody fragment comprises at least about 50 amino acids. In some embodiments, a functional antibody fragment comprises at least about 200 amino acids. In some embodiments, an antibody may be a human antibody. In some embodiments, an antibody may be a humanized antibody. Exemplary antibody embodiments for M include intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.","Useful polyclonal antibodies as Ligand are, in some embodiments, heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen-of-interest. For example, for the production of polyclonal antibodies, various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof, including but not limited to rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete) adjuvant, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.","Useful monoclonal antibodies as Ligand are, in some embodiments, homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen, a microbial antigen, a protein, a peptide, a carbohydrate, a chemical, nucleic acid, or fragments thereof). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an antigen-of-interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally described by K\u00f6hler and Milstein (1975256, 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 19834: 72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.","Useful monoclonal antibodies include, but are not limited to, human monoclonal antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, or chimeric human-mouse (or other species) monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art (e.g., Teng et al., 198380, 7308-7312; Kozbor et al., 19834, 72-79; and Olsson et al., 198292, 3-16).","The antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Milstein et al., 1983305:537-539). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Similar procedures are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C2, and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (C1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. Nucleic acids with sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","In an embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation (International Publication No. WO 94\/04690).","For further details for generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 1986, 121:210; Rodrigues et al., 1993151:6954-6961; Carter et al., 199210: 163-167; Carter et al., 19954:463-470; Merchant et al., 199816:677-681. Using such techniques, bispecific antibodies can be prepared for use in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.","Bifunctional antibodies are also described, in European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 105 360. In some embodiments, hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically, i.e., by cell fusion techniques, or chemically, especially with cross-linking agents or disulfide-bridge forming reagents, and may comprise whole antibodies and\/or fragments thereof. Methods for obtaining such hybrid antibodies are disclosed for example, in International Publication WO 83\/03679, and European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 217 577. Bifunctional antibodies include those biologically prepared from a \u201cpolydoma\u201d or \u201cquadroma\u201d or which are synthetically prepared with cross-linking agents such as bis-(maleimido)-methyl ether (\u201cBMME\u201d), or with other cross-linking agents familiar to those skilled in the art.","An antibody can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, or microbial antigens or other antibodies bound to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard, \u201cfunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to elicit anti-anti-idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically, in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay) (See, for e.g., Kabat et al., 1991, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.; Kabat E et al., 1980125(3):961-969).","Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as, but not limited to, F(ab)fragments, which contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule, and Fab fragments, which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)fragments. Other useful antibodies are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies, or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies (SCAs) (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988242:423-42; Huston et al., 198885:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989334:544-54), or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.","In some embodiments, an antibody is an immunoglobulin antibody. In some embodiments, an immunoglobulin antibody recognizes a tumor-associated antigen.","In some embodiments, an antibody is a recombinant antibody, such as a chimeric and\/or a humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions. See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. See, e.g., Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089. Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in International Publication No. WO 87\/02671; European Patent Publication No. 184,187; European Patent Publication No. 171496; European Patent Publication No. 173494; International Publication No. WO 86\/01533; U.S. Pat.

Immunol. 141:4053-4060.","In some embodiments, completely human antibodies are desirable and can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from, for example, Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.).","Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope (Jespers et al. (1994) 12:899-903). Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries (Hoogenboom and Winter, 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., 222:581 (1991); Quan, M. P. and Carter, P. 2002. In Anti-IgE and Allergic Disease, Jardieu, P. M. and Fick Jr., R. B, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y., Chapter 20, pp. 427-469).","In other embodiments, an antibody is a fusion protein of an antibody, or a functionally active fragment thereof, for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond) at, for example, either the N-terminus or the C-terminus, to an amino acid sequence of another protein (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein) that is not the antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof is covalently linked to the other protein at the N-terminus of the constant domain. In some embodiments, an antibody is a fusion protein comprising an albumin-binding peptide sequence (ABP).","In some embodiments, an antibody is conjugated to one or more polymer units.

For example, but not by way of limitation, the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein, amino acid mutations, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin, etc.","In some embodiments, an analog or derivative of an antibody, peptide or protein contains one or more unnatural amino acid residues.

However, due to the synthetic challenges posed by the complex molecular architecture, only very few structures could be made, and even for those that have been synthesized, only very limited amounts have been provided. Therefore, although various ETP alkaloids have been assessed in a diverse array of biological tests, the non-uniformity of these studies precludes comparative analysis and the inference of meaningful conclusions. In some embodiments, among other things, the present invention recognizes that access to greater quantities of ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines and their analogs and derivatives is highly desired. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for synthesizing ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines and analogs and derivatives thereof. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for synthesizing ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines and analogs and derivatives thereof, wherein the methods produce ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines or analogs and derivatives thereof in quantities large enough to enable uniform biological studies. In some embodiments, the present invention provides new ETP or thiodiketopiperazine compounds and compositions thereof. In some embodiments, the present invention provides ETP or thiodiketopiperazine compounds and compositions thereof in quantities enough to enable uniform biological studies. In some embodiments, with the provided compounds and compositions in large enough quantities, the present invention analyzes the structural features of the ETP or thiodiketopiperazine compounds and their analogs and derivatives in relation to the biological activities. In some embodiments, the present invention provides evaluation of one or more of the following structural factors in relation to biological activities of ETP or thiodiketopiperazine compounds and derivatives and analogs thereof: polysulfide; the number of sulfur atoms, for example, in the polysulfide; the stereochemical configurations of the sulfurated centers; and dimerization state. In some embodiments, the present invention recognizes that investigation of the impact of each of these structural features is crucial to elucidating the mode of action of these compounds, to designing highly potent structures with suitable physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties, and to their translation in vivo in clinical applications (e.g., biological probes and chemotherapeutic agents).","In some embodiments, the present provides a method for optimizing a ETP or thiodiketopiperazine compound or derivative or analog thereof, comprising:","(i) maintaining the polysulfide, or modifying the polysulfide to groups that can be converted to polysulfide when administered to a subject;","(ii) maintaining the stereochemistry of the sulfurated centers; and","(iii) optionally introducing an electron-withdrawing group to N1, if N1 is present.","In some embodiments, an electron-withdrawing group is R.

Boyer and M. Movassaghi, 2012, 3, 1798), was used to access epidithiodiketopiperazines bearing different C3-substituents (Scheme E1-I). Electrophilic activation using silver(I) tetrafluoroborate in nitroethane and trapping of the transient tertiary benzylic carbocation with the desired nucleophile (i.e., fluoride, N-TIPS-pyrrole (E. M. Beck, N. P. Grimster, R. Hatley and M. J. Gaunt, 2006, 128, 2528), anisole, 5-Br\u2014N-TIPS-indole) afforded the C3-substituted endo-tetracycles 59 and 68-70 in high yields and excellent levels of regio- and stereoselection (N. Boyer and M. Movassaghi, 2012, 3, 1798). Dihydroxylation of 59 and 68-70 at the C11-methine and C15-methylene positions was achieved with tetra-n-butylammonium permanganate (n-BuNMnO, 4 equiv) in dichloromethane to provide the corresponding diols in moderate to good yields as single diastereomers. The direct double cis-thiolation was accomplished in a single step and in good to high yields (47-80%) by exposure of the bis-hemiaminals to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in hydrogen sulfide-saturated dichloromethane solution followed by mild aerobic oxidation to access the bridgehead disulfides as \u03b2-epimers 26, 30-33 and \u03b1-epimers 34-35. The relative stereochemistry of the \u03b1-epimers 26, 30-33 of the epidisulfide bridges has been confirmed by key NOESY cross-peaks on the corresponding bis(thiomethylether).

Boyer and M. Movassaghi, 2012, 3, 1798).","Exposure of hemiaminal 56 to benzyl mercaptan and TFA in nitroethane resulted in the formation of the corresponding bis(benzylthioether) (C15\u03b2:C15\u03b1=5.7:1) in 80% yield (single diastereomer, C15\u03b2). Further derivatization of the indole nitrogen with a t-butoxycarbonyl group gave 43 in 69% yield. After masking the indole substituent of the key ETP intermediate 26, the bridgehead disulfide was reduced with NaBHand S-methoxymethylated in a single flask. Subsequent t-butoxycarbonyl removal with TFA in dichloromethane afforded bis(thioether) 40 in 66% yield over two steps. A similar strategy including the photoinduced reductive removal of the N1-benzenesulfonyl group provided 41 in 55% over three steps. Reduction of the sulfur bridge of ETP 24 with NaBHin a mixture of THF and methanol and in situ trapping of the resulting thiolates with 2-methoxyethoxy-methyl chloride (MEMCl) led to thioether 47 and bis(thioether) 42 in 19% and 80% yield, respectively.","Further modifications to the sulfur bridge were accomplished by treatment of the corresponding dithiol (obtained from NaBHreduction of ETP 26) with 1,1\u2032-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (TCDI) or 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to afford di- and trithiocarbonates 36 and 37, respectively. Similarly, thioacetal 38 was accessed directly by double alkylation using diiodomethane. Desulfurization of epidithiodiketopiperazine 26 was realized by treatment with triethylphosphite in THF to give epimonosulfide 25 in 63% yield (F. Cherblanc, Y.-P. Lo, E. De Gussem, L. Alcazar-Fuoli, E. Bignell, Y. He, N. Chapman-Rothe, P. Bultinck, W. A. Herrebout, R. Brown, H. S. Rzepa and M. J. Fuchter, .-2011, 17, 11868). The sulfur atoms were also capped with the S-acetyl and S-methylsulfane functional groupings to afford compounds that are potentially more labile under intracellular conditions. After reduction of the sulfur bridge of epidisulfide 26, its treatment with an excess of acetyl chloride, methanesulfenyl chloride, or dimethyldisulfide afforded compounds 44, 45 and 46, respectively, in good yields.","Compounds with substituent at the C15 position were also prepared, for example, compounds derived from N-methyl-1-alanine 1-tryptophan cyclo-dipeptide. As exemplified in Scheme E1-3, synthesis of these derivatives commenced with endo-tetracyclic bromide 73. Tertiary benzylic bromide 73 also proved to be an excellent substrate for the desired regio- and stereoselective Friedel-Crafts-type coupling with 5-bromo-1-triisopropylsilylindole (67% over 2 steps) to afford C3-indolyl tetracycle 74. Allylation of the C3-tertiary benzylic halide using allyltributylstannane under radical conditions (K. M. Depew, S. P. Marsden, D. Zatorska, A. Zatorski, W. G. Bornmann and S. J. Danishefsky, 1999, 121, 11953) followed by hydrogenation of the terminal olefin afforded C3-n-propyl tetracycle 75. These two C3-substituted tetracyclic monomers were subsequently subject to hydroxylation conditions using bis(pyridine) silver(I) permanganate (PyrAgMnO) in pyridine. Treatment of the resultant diols with potassium trithiocarbonate and TFA in dichloromethane resulted in rapid formation of the desired monomeric dithiepanethiones 64 and 66 in 63% yield as a 5:1 isomeric mixture, as well as 65 and 67 in 52% and 17% yield, respectively.

N1,N1\u2032-benzenesulfonylated analog (14) of (+)-12,12\u2032-dideoxyverticillin A (3) showing the best activity {IC(U-937): 0.18 nM; IC(HeLa): 0.09 nM}. Monomeric ETP derivatives also show good activity in both HeLa (IC\u22675.9 nM) and U-937 (IC\u22672.8 nM) human cancer cell lines. Within the N1-benzenesulfonyl monomeric class, various aromatic substituents (indol-3\u2032-yl 26, N-Boc-indol-3\u2032-yl 24, pyrrol-3\u2032-yl 32, p-MeO-phenyl 33) are well tolerated at the C3-position and their IC's are of the same order of magnitude {IC(U-937): 2.8-14.8 nM; IC(HeLa): 22-75 nM}. Halide substitution at C3 (bromide 30, fluorides 31 and 35) results in intermediately good activity. While not wishing to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that in some embodiments, the steric environment of the C3 position may be crucial for biological activity: n-alkyl groups at that position (n-propyl analogs 61 and 65) lead to substantially lower potencies than more sterically hindered (hetero)aryl and halide substituents or the C3\u2032 quaternary carbon of a second monomeric subunit, and the dimers in some embodiments have better activity than (hetero)arylated monomers. In some embodiments, dimers containing two sulfur bridge groups are one order of magnitude more potent than monomeric C3-(3\u2032-indolyl) analogs and 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more potent than heterodimers bearing a single sulfur bridge. This non-linear increase of biological activity between mono- and dimeric ETP compounds was also observed in other families. While not wishing to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that the observation may suggest a synergistic effect; pharmacokinetic properties could also play a role.","Comparing homodimers (+)-12,12\u2032-dideoxyverticillin A (3), (+)-chaetocin A (4), (+)-chaetocin C (5), and (+)-12,12\u2032-dideoxychetracin A (6) head-to-head reveals that, in some embodiments, the chaetocin-type ETP derivatives are more potent than their non-C15-hydroxylated counterparts {IC(U-937): 0.75-1.3 nM vs. 15.5 nM; IC(HeLa): 5.6-6.9 nM vs. 7.2 nM}. In some embodiments, acetylation of the 17,17\u2032-hydroxyl groups (15-16) also results in a reduction of potency (5.8- to 12.9-fold for U-937; 2.0- to 11.1-fold for HeLa). Methyl substitution at C15 in monomeric alkaloids (Trp-Ala cyclo-dipeptides 60 vs. 26 and 64 vs. 36) affects the potency of the compounds moderately in the test. Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that the difference in potency between the different types of substituents at C15 may be generally minimal, although it could be sensitive to variations of the steric environment. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of optimizing an ETP compound or a derivative of an analog thereof, comprising modifying substituents at the C15 position. In some embodiments, a provided method is used to optimize the pharmacokinetic parameters during drug development. In some embodiments, a compound of formula I-a, I-b, I-c, or I-d is connected to L through C15 or a substituent on C15.","In some embodiments, the present invention discovered that substitution at N1 and N1\u2032 with electron-withdrawing groups, such as benzenesulfonyl (14) or trifluoroacetyl (17) groups, enhanced the anticancer activity of the alkaloids. For example, sulfonyl group (14) dramatically increased the potency {2 orders of magnitude more potent than the corresponding secondary aniline (+)-12,12\u2032-dideoxyverticillin A (3)}. The trifluoroacetamide at N1 and N1\u2032 (17 vs. 16) also enhanced the anticancer activity. For the monomeric ETP-containing analogs, the N1-benzenesulfonyl substitution also amplifies the anticancer effect in U-937 cell line (epidisulfide: 26 vs. 10; epitrisulfide: 27 vs. 29). Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that the N1 group could confer significantly higher chemical stability, and may also affect the pharmacodynamic properties of these ETP compounds.","In some embodiments, the present invention demonstrated that sulfuration at only the tryptophan C-position is not sufficient for potent activity {bis(trisulfanes) (19 and 20), C11-thioesters (50-51), C11-thioether (49), and C11-thiols (47-48)}. In some embodiments, a provided method for optimizing an ETP compound, or derivatives or analogs, thereof comprises maintaining or installing sulfurization at both C-position of the diketopiperazine ring (e.g., C11 and C15). In some embodiments, both amino acid C positions have sulfuration by separate sulfur atoms.","In some embodiments, sulfur derivatives possessing non-labile alkyl groups {S-methylthioethers (7 and 39), S-(methoxymethyl)thioethers (40-41), S-(2-ethoxyethoxymethyl)thioether (42 and 47), S-benzylthioether (43)} did not display any anticancer activity (IC>10 \u03bcM). Thioacetal 38 were active. In some embodiments, the degree of sulfuration of the polysulfide bridge {dimers: (+)-chaetocin A (4) vs. (+)-chaetocin C (5) vs. (+)-12,12\u2032-dideoxychetracin A (6) or 15 vs. 16; monomers: 10 vs. 29, 26 vs. 27 vs. 28} has no substantial impact on cell death induction; in some embodiments, the ICvalues are within the margin of error of each other.","In addition to ETP-containing compounds, several monomeric or dimeric derivatives provided by the present invention possessing modifications directly on the sulfur bridge are competent anticancer agents. Exemplary derivative compounds include thioacetate (44), dithiocarbonate (37), trithiocarbonates (18, 36, 64), and alkyl disulfides (45-46). Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that certain derivatives could be readily converted to the thiols; for example, the methyl disulfides would readily be converted to the thiols through reduction or nucleophilic displacement. While not wishing to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that the data could suggest a mode of action that involves a common intermediate; in the presence of a reducing cytoplasmic environment combined with the presence of enzymes-hydrolases, carboxylesterases, and lipases (W. Kroutil, A. A. St\u00e4mpfli, R. Dahinden, M. J\u00f6rg, U. Miller and J. P. Pachlatko, 2002, 58, 2589)\u2014methyl disulfides, thioacetates, and thiocarbonates could play the role of prodrugs ((a) C. A. Fink, J. E. Carlson, P. A. McTaggart, Y. Qiao, R. Webb, R. Chatelain, A. Y. Jeng and A. J. Trapani, 1996, 39, 3158; (b) B. Testa and J. M. Mayer, ; Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2003; (c) J. Rautio, H. Kumpulainen, T. Heimbach, R. Oliyai, D. Oh, T. J\u00e4rvinen and J. Savolainen, 2008, 7, 255). Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that these compounds may be converted to their corresponding epidisulfide pharmacophores, which could be potentially actively concentrated within the cell via a glutathione-dependent uptake mechanism ((a) P. H. Bernardo, N. Brasch, C. C. L. Chai and P. Waring, 2003, 278, 46549; and (b) C. S. Sevier and C. A. Kaiser, 2002, 3, 836). In some embodiments, compounds with the sulfur bridge on the \u03b1-face of the DKP (34, 62-63, 66-67) are inactive.","Certain provided compounds were tested in culture against a panel of three supplementary human cancer cell lines representing three additional tumor histologies (H460, lung carcinoma; 786-O, renal carcinoma; MCF-7, breast carcinoma). As shown in Table E1-2, the ETPs retain their potency across the cell lines. In some embodiments, a provided compound is active in all cell lines. In some embodiments, a provide compound can be used to selectively target certain cells and\/or cancers. For example, compound 14 retains high levels of activity in all of the cell lines, while compound 17 is more active toward some of the cell lines. Without the intention to be limited, Applicant notes that certain cell lines could be more sensitive to provided compounds; for example, U-937 and HeLa are slightly more sensitive to the ETPs than the other three cell lines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0837","num":"0938"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

across the board. In the case of the N1,N1\u2032-benzenesulfonylated analog of (+)-12,12\u2032-dideoxyverticillin A (14), the potency is dramatically increased (2 orders of magnitude more potent than with the addition of the benzenesulfonyl group.","In some embodiments, the degree of sulfuration has a larger impact in some of the adherent cell lines tested (H460, 786-O, and MCF-7), especially in the case of 26-28. In some embodiments, this set of compounds shows a 2-fold decrease in activity with each additional sulfur atom in the polysulfide bridge. Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that lack of substitution at N1 (10 and 29, and dimers 4-6) mitigates this effect.","Bisthioacetate 44, trithiocarbonate 36 and dithiocarbonate 37 display lower activity than the corresponding epidisulfide 26, but are active toward the cell lines. These compounds show consistently lower ICvalues than epidisulfide 10 (up to 6.7-fold more potent). In some embodiments, a provided compound displayed different activity across cell lines. C3-pyrrolyl 32 and C3-p-methoxyphenyl 33 epidisulfides displayed a consistent potency (4-fold change in activity, as compared to 6- to 40-fold changes for other derivatives) in addition to good relative potency in H460 cells.","The exemplary compounds were evaluated for their ability to induce hemolysis in human erythrocytes at concentrations well above their anticancer IC50 values. As shown in  the compounds show no hemolytic activity. The concentrations at which hemolytic activity was assessed (1 and 10 \u03bcM) are, in some cases, over 1000-fold higher than the IC50 values for cancer cells.","Compounds 5, 14, 26 and 33 were examined for their ability to induce caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway on U-937 cells. The induction of apoptosis was first evaluated by the level of phosphatidylserine externalization (detected by FITC-conjugated Annexin V (AnnV)) that occurs prior to the disruption of cell membrane integrity (detected by propidium iodide (PI)). The progression of cells through the AnnV+\/PI\u2212 quadrant (lower right, ) demonstrates the ability of both monomeric and dimeric ETP-containing derivatives to induce apoptosis.","Another marker of apoptosis is the cleavage patterns of various intracellular proteins. Caspase-3, one of the key apoptotic executioner caspases, is activated from its low-Page activity zymogen (procaspase-3) at an early stage of apoptosis. This activation was visualized by Western blot () by the cleavage of procaspase-3 (35 kDa) to caspase-3 (12 and 17 kDa). Caspase-3 in turn cleaves one of its cellular substrates, PARP-1. Treating cells with the four ETP derivatives, followed by Western blotting for procaspase-3\/caspase-3 and PARP-1 revealed that all these compounds induce cleavage of procaspase-3 and PARP-1. Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that data in  indicate that these ETP derivatives may induce caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.","The present invention provides methods and compounds that enable structural-activity relationship study.

Again, without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that compounds may be highly potent if the diketopiperazines were sulfurated at the C11\/C15 sites in a manner consistent with a species capable of being converted to an epidisulfide on the same face of the hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione moiety as N1 in the biological milieu. In some embodiments, the anticancer potencies of this collection of compounds correlate positively with the steric environment at the C3 position, rendering the dimeric ETP alkaloids, in certain cases, the most potent with (sub)nanomolar IC's against a range of human cancer cell lines. Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that the muted sensitivity of these cell lines to variations in N1 and Csubstitution make these ideal sites for compound optimization. In some embodiments, despite their attenuated activity, a lower molecular-weight monomers may prove to have more optimal pharmacokinetic properties and provide further avenues for molecular modification in the optimization and development of small-molecule drugs.","General Procedures.","All reactions were performed in oven-dried or flame-dried round-bottom flasks. The flasks were fitted with rubber septa, and reactions were conducted under a positive pressure of argon. Cannulae or gas-tight syringes with stainless steel needles were used to transfer air- or moisture-sensitive liquids. Where necessary (so noted), solutions were deoxygenated by sparging with argon for a minimum of 10 min. Flash column chromatography was performed as described by Still et al. using granular silica gel (60-\u212b pore size, 40-63 \u03bcm, 4-6% HO content, Zeochem) (Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. 1978, 43, 2923). Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using glass plates pre-coated with 0.25 mm 230-400 mesh silica gel impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm). TLC plates were visualized by exposure to short wave ultraviolet light (254 nm), reversibly stained with iodine (Iabsorbed on silica) vapor, and irreversibly stained by treatment with an aqueous solution of ceric ammonium molybdate (CAM) followed by heating (\u02dc1 min) on a hot plate (\u02dc250\u00b0 C.). Organic solutions were concentrated at 29-30\u00b0 C. on rotary evaporators capable of achieving a minimum pressure of \u02dc2 torr. The benzenesulfonyl photodeprotection was accomplished by irradiation in a Rayonet RMR-200 photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Company, Branford, Conn., USA) equipped with 16 lamps (RPR-3500, 24 W, \u03bb=350 nm, bandwidth \u02dc20 nm).","Materials.","Commercial reagents and solvents were used as received with the following exceptions: dichloromethane, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, pyridine, toluene, and triethylamine were purchased from J. T. Baker (Cycletainer\u2122) and were purified by the method of Grubbs et al. under positive argon pressure (Pangborn, A. B.; Giardello, M. A.; Grubbs, R. H.; Rosen, R. K.; Timmers, F. J. 1996, 15, 1518). Nitromethane and nitroethane (from Sigma-Aldrich) were purified by fractional distillation over calcium hydride and were stored over Linde 3 \u212b molecular sieves in Schlenk flasks sealed with septa and Teflon tape under argon atmosphere (Armarego, W. L. F.; Chai, C. L. L. 5ed.; Butterworth-Heinemann: London, 2003). H\u00fcnig's base and benzene were dried by distillation from calcium hydride under an inert argon atmosphere and used directly. 1,4-Dimethoxynaphthalene, hafnium (IV) trifluoromethanesulfonate hydrate, and iodomethane were purchased from Alfa Aesar; 1-(triisopropylsilyl)-1H-pyrrole was purchased from Combi-Block; triphenylmethanesulfenyl chloride was purchased from TCI America, Inc; 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (DTBMP) was purchased from OChem. Incorporation. All other solvents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Silver tetrafluoroborate (\u226799.99% trace metals basis) and hydrogen sulfide (\u226799.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1,4-Dimethoxynaphthalene was purified by crystallization from absolute ethanol.","Instrumentation.","Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE-600 NMR spectrometer (with a Magnex Scientific superconducting actively-shielded magnet) or a Varian inverse probe 500 INOVA spectrometer, are reported in parts per million on the \u03b4 scale, and are referenced from the residual protium in the NMR solvent (CDCl: \u03b4 7.26 (CHCl), acetone-d: \u03b4 2.05 (acetone-d), acetonitrile-d: \u03b4 2.13 (acetonitrile-d), DMSO-d: \u03b4 2.50 (DMSO-d), methanol-d: \u03b4 3.31 (methanol-d)) (Fulmer, G.

We are grateful to Dr. Li Li and Deborah Bass for obtaining the mass spectrometric data at the Department of Chemistry's Instrumentation Facility, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics APEXIV 4.7 Tesla FT-ICR-MS using an electrospray (ESI) ionization source.","Positional Numbering System.","At least three numbering systems for dimeric diketopiperazine alkaloids exist in the literature ((a) Von Hauser, D.; Weber, H. P.; Sigg, H. P. 1970, 53, 1061. (b) Barrow, C. J.; Cai, P.; Snyder, J. K.; Sedlock, D. M.; Sun, H. H.; Cooper, R. 1993, 58, 6016. (c) Springer, J. P.; B\u00fcchi, G.; Kobbe, B.; Demain, A. L.; Clardy, J. 1977, 28, 2403). In assigning the H and C NMR data of all intermediates en route to our different naturally occurring ETPs and their synthetic analogs, a uniform numbering scheme was to employed. For ease of direct comparison, particularly between early intermediates, non-thiolated diketopiperazines, and advanced compounds, the numbering system used by Barrow for (+)-WIN-64821 (using positional numbers 1-21) is optimal and used throughout this report.

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt was obtained from Promega. Human erythrocytes were purchased from Bioreclamation and used within three days of receipt. Optical densities were recorded on a Spectramax Plus 384 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Biociences LSR II (San Jose, Calif.) and the data was analyzed as described using FACSDiva software (San Jose, Calif.).","Cell Culture Information.","Cells were grown in media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 \u03bcg\/mL penicillin and 100 U\/mL streptomycin). Specifically, experiments were performed using the following cell lines and media compositions: U-937, HeLa, H460, and 786-O (RPMI-1640+10% FBS), and MCF7 (EMEM+10% FBS). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO, 95% humidity atmosphere.","ICValue Determination for Adherent Cells Using Sulforhodamine B (SRB).","Adherent cells (HeLa, H460, 786-O, and MCF7) were added into 96-well plates (5,000 cells\/well for HeLa cell line; 2,000 cells\/well for H460, 786-O, and MCF7 cell lines) in 100 \u03bcL media and were allowed to adhere for 2-3 hours. Compounds were solubilized in DMSO as 100\u00d7 stocks, added directly to the cells (100 \u03bcL final volume), and tested over a range of concentrations in triplicate (1% DMSO final) on a half-log scale. Concentrations tested ranged from 1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM, depending on the potency of the compound. DMSO and cell-free wells served as the live and dead control, respectively. After 72 hours of continuous exposure, the plates were evaluated using the SRB colorimetric assay as described previously (Vichai, V.; Kirtikara, K. 2006, 1, 1112). Briefly, media was removed from the plate, and cells were fixed by the addition of 100 \u03bcL cold 10% trichloroacetic acid in water. After incubating at 4\u00b0 C. for an hour, the plates were washed in water and allowed to dry. Sulforhodamine B was added as a 0.057% solution in 1% acetic acid (100 \u03bcL), and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, washed in 1% acetic acid, and allowed to dry. The dye was solubilized by adding 10 mM Tris base solution (pH 10.5, 200 \u03bcL) and incubating at room temperature for 30 minutes. Plates were read at \u03bb=510 nm. ICvalues were determined from three or more independent experiments using TableCurve (San Jose, Calif.).","ICValue Determination for Non-Adherent Cells Using MTS.","In a 96-well plate, compounds were pre-added as DMSO stocks in triplicate to achieve a final concentration of 1%. DMSO and cell-free wells served as the live and dead control, respectively. U-937 (5,000 cells\/well) cells were distributed in 100 \u03bcL media to the compound-containing plate. After 72 hours, cell viability was assessed by adding 20 \u03bcL of a PMS\/MTS solution (Cory, A. H.; Owen, T. C.; Barltrop, J. A.; Cory, J. G. 1991, 3, 207) to each well, allowing the dye to develop at 37\u00b0 C. until the live control had processed MTS, and reading the absorbance at \u03bb=490 nm. ICvalues were determined from three or more independent experiments using TableCurve (San Jose, Calif.).","Hemolysis Assay Using Human Erythrocytes.","To prepare the erythrocytes, 0.1 mL of human blood was centrifuged (10,000 g, 2 min). The pellet was washed three times with saline (0.9% NaCl) via gentle re-suspension and centrifugation (10,000 g, 2 min). Following the final wash, the erythrocytes were re-suspended in 0.8 mL red blood cell (RBC) buffer (10 mM NaHPO, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl, pH 7.4).","DMSO stocks of compounds were added to 0.5 mL tubes in singlicate (1 \u03bcL, 3.3% DMSO final). The stocks were diluted with 19 \u03bcL RBC buffer. Positive control tubes contained DMSO in water, and negative control tubes contained DMSO in RBC buffer. A suspension of washed erythrocytes (10 \u03bcL) was added to each tube, and samples were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Samples were centrifuged (10,000 g, 2 min), and the supernatant was transferred to a clear, sterile 384-well plate. The absorbance of the supernatants was measured at \u03bb=540 nm, and percent hemolysis was calculated relative to the average absorbance values measured for the controls.","Apoptosis in U-937 Cells with Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide (AnnV\/PI).","DMSO stocks of compounds were added to a 24-well plate in singlicate (0.2% DMSO final). After compound addition, 0.5 mL of a U-937 cell suspension (250,000 cells\/mL) was added and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. Following treatment, the cell suspensions were transferred to flow cytometry tubes and pelleted (500 g, 3 min).

Each sample was then vigorously vortexed twice for 15 seconds, with a 15-minute incubation on ice following each agitation. The cellular debris was pelleted (16,100 g, 5 min), and then 33 \u03bcL of the protein suspension was transferred to fresh 0.5 mL tubes. The protein levels were quantified using a standard BCA (Thermo Scientific), after which the samples were diluted with deionized water to achieve equal protein concentrations for all samples.","Prior to analyzing the samples, 6\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer (350 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 12% SDS, 0.012% bromophenol blue, 47% glycerol) with 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol was added to each sample to achieve a final 1\u00d7 concentration, after which the samples were incubated at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes to denature the protein samples. 20-30 \u03bcg of protein was added to a 15-well 4-20% Tris-HCl gel and run for 1 hour at 120 V. The gel was equilibrated PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 minutes, and then transferred to a PVDF membrane for 2 hours at 45 V.","Generally, blots were probed as follows.

Addition of pyrrolidine to a solution of the adducts in acetonitrile under an atmosphere of oxygen resulted in the direct conversion of substrates E2-31-E2-33 to their corresponding disulphides (Table E2-1). In the event that a dithiol cannot be oxidized readily with molecular oxygen to the disulphide in order to drive the \u03b2-addition\/elimination equilibriation process toward product formation, a sacrificial thiol can be added to the reaction mixture to effect a transthioetherification.","Indeed, application of the provided new methodology for sulfidation of diketopiperazines proved critical in the synthesis of (+)-bionectins A and C. Treatment of a solution of dipivaloate E2-27 and ketomercaptan reagent E2-29 with trifluoroacetic acid in nitromethane at 23\u00b0 C. yielded a diastereomeric mixture of bisthioethers E2-36 in 80% yield and 3:1 dr with concomitant removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl groups at the N1\u2032 amine and C12 alcohol. While not wishing to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that ionization at C11 did not occur in acetonitrile likely due to the inductive effects of the C12-hydroxy group. The major diastereomer possessed the desired C11, C15-stereochemistry and could be isolated in 56% yield upon photoinduced electron transfer-mediated removal of the benzensulfonyl group (T. Hamada, A. Nishida and O. Yonemitsu, 1986, 108, 140). The bisthioethers were then removed with a mild enamine-mediated transthioetherification protocol employing pyrrolidine and ethanethiol in THF. The use of a sacrificial thiol was surprisingly found to be optimal in the unveiling of the thiols; exposure to an atmosphere of oxygen was insufficient in oxidizing the dithiol to a disulphide. Without the intention to be limited by theory, Applicant notes that the C15 thiol may prefer an equatorial disposition in its ground state and that conformation may not be as conducive to oxidation by molecular oxygen. Mild oxidation with KIin pyridine then afforded the target compound (+)-bionectin A (E2-1) in 81% yield.","We treated the synthetic sample of (+)-E2-1 with p-nitrobenzoyl chloride and DMAP in CHClat 0\u00b0 C. to afford (+)-bionectin A-p-nitrobenzoate (E2-38) in 98% yield. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of this C12-p-nitrobenzoate derivative confirmed its structure. Reductive methylation of (+)-bionectin A (E2-1) with sodium borohydride and MeI in pyridine and methanol afforded (+)-bionectin C (E2-2) in 97% yield (H. Poisel and U. Schmidt, 1971, 104, 1714).","General Procedures.","All reactions were performed in oven-dried or flame-dried round-bottom flasks. The flasks were fitted with rubber septa and reactions were conducted under a positive pressure of argon. Cannulae or gas-tight syringes with stainless steel needles were used to transfer air- or moisture-sensitive liquids. Where necessary (so noted), solutions were deoxygenated by sparging with argon for a minimum of 10 min. Flash column chromatography was performed as described by Still et al. using granular silica gel (60-\u212b pore size, 40-63 \u03bcm, 4-6% HO content, Zeochem) (Still, W.

TLC plates were visualized by exposure to short wave ultraviolet light (254 nm) and an aqueous solution of ceric ammonium molybdate (CAM) followed by heating on a hot plate (\u2212250\u00b0 C.). Organic solutions were concentrated at 29-30\u00b0 C. on rotary evaporators capable of achieving a minimum pressure of \u02dc2 torr.
