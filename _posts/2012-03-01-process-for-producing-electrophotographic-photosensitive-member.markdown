In the present state of affairs, however, various layers are often formed between the support and the photosensitive layer for the purposes of, e.g., covering any defects of the surface of the support, protecting the photosensitive layer from any electrical breakdown, improving its chargeability, improving the blocking of injection of electric charges from the support into the photosensitive layer, and so forth.","Among such layers formed between the support and the photosensitive layer, a layer containing metal oxide particles is known as the layer formed for the purpose of covering any defects on the surface of the support. The layer containing metal oxide particles commonly has a higher electrical conductivity than a layer not containing any metal oxide particles (e.g., 1.0\u00d710to 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm as volume resistivity). Thus, even where the layer is formed in a large layer thickness, any residual potential at the time of image formation can not easily come to increase. Hence, any defects of the support surface can be covered with ease.","The covering of defects of the support surface by providing between the support and the photosensitive layer such a layer having a higher electrical conductivity (hereinafter \u201cconductive layer\u201d) makes the support surface have a great tolerance for its defects. As the results, this makes the support have a vastly great tolerance for its use, and hence brings an advantage that the electrophotographic photosensitive member can be improved in productivity.","PTL 1 discloses a technique in which tin oxide particles doped with phosphorus are used in an intermediate layer formed between the support and the photosensitive layer. PTL 2 also discloses a technique in which tin oxide particles doped with tungsten are used in a protective layer formed on the photosensitive layer. PTL 3 still also discloses a technique in which titanium oxide particles coated with oxygen deficient tin oxide are used in a conductive layer formed between the support and the photosensitive layer. PTL 4 still also discloses a technique in which barium sulfate particles coated with tin oxide are used in an intermediate layer formed between the support and the photosensitive layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["PTL 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H06-222600","PTL 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-316059","PTL 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2007-047736","PTL 4: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H06-208238"]}},"However, studies made by the present inventors have revealed that fog comes to tend to occur due to an increase in dark attenuation when images are repeatedly formed in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment by using an electrophotographic photosensitive member employing as the conductive layer any layer containing such metal oxide particles as the above.","An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing an electrophotographic photosensitive member that can not easily cause such fog due to an increase in dark attenuation even where it is an electrophotographic photosensitive member employing as the conductive layer the layer containing metal oxide particles.","The present invention is a process for producing an electrophotographic photosensitive member; the process comprising:\n\n","According to the present invention, an electrophotographic photosensitive member can be produced which can not easily cause any fog due to an increase in dark attenuation even where it is an electrophotographic photosensitive member employing as the conductive layer the layer containing metal oxide particles.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","The present invention is a process for producing an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and has the step of forming on a support a conductive layer having a volume resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less and the step of forming a photosensitive layer on the conductive layer. The electrophotographic photosensitive member produced by the production process of the present invention is an electrophotographic photosensitive member having a support, a conductive layer formed on the support, and a photosensitive layer formed on the conductive layer.","The photosensitive layer may be a single-layer type photosensitive layer which contains a charge-generating material and a charge-transporting material in a single layer, or may be a multi-layer type photosensitive layer formed in layers of a charge generation layer which contains a charge-generating material and a charge transport layer which contains a charge-transporting material. An undercoat layer may also optionally be provided between the conductive layer formed on the support and the photosensitive layer.","As the support, it may preferably be one having electrical conductivity (a conductive support). For example, a metallic support may be used which is made of a metal, formed of a metal such as aluminum, an aluminum alloy or stainless steel. Where aluminum or an aluminum alloy is used, usable are an aluminum pipe produced by a production process having the step of extrusion and the step of drawing, and an aluminum pipe produced by a production process having the step of extrusion and the step of ironing. Such aluminum pipes can achieve a good dimensional precision and surface smoothness without requiring any surface cutting and besides are advantageous in view of cost as well. However, burr-like protruding defects tend to come on the surfaces of these non-cut aluminum pipes, and hence it is especially effective to provide the conductive layer.","In the present invention, for the purpose of covering any defects of the surface of the support, the conductive layer having a volume resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more to 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less is provided on the support. If a layer having a volume resistivity of more than 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm is provided on the support as the layer for covering any defects of the surface of the support, the flow of electric charges comes to tend to stagnate therein when images are formed, to come to tend to increase in residual potential. If on the other hand the conductive layer has a volume resistivity of less than 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, the electric charges flowing through the conductive layer may be so excessively large in quantity when the electrophotographic photosensitive member is charged that the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation of the electrophotographic photosensitive member may come to tend to occur.","How to measure the volume resistivity of the conductive layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is described below with reference to .  is a plan view to illustrate how to measure the volume resistivity of the conductive layer, and  is a sectional view to illustrate how to measure the volume resistivity of the conductive layer.","The volume resistivity of the conductive layer is measured in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity (23\u00b0 C.\/50% RH) environment. A tape  made of copper (Type No. 1181, available from Sumitomo 3M Limited) is stuck to the surface of a conductive layer  to make it serve as an electrode on the surface side of the conductive layer . A support  is also made to serve as an electrode on the back side of the conductive layer . A power source  and a current measuring instrument  are respectively set up; the former for applying voltage across the copper tape  and the support  and the latter for measuring electric current flowing across the copper tape  and the support .","To make the voltage applicable to the copper tape , a copper wire  is put on the copper tape , and then a tape  made of copper like the copper tape  is stuck from above the copper wire  to the copper tape  so that the copper wire  may not protrude from the copper tape , to fasten the copper wire  to the copper tape . To the copper tape , voltage is applied through the copper wire .","A background current value found when any voltage is not applied across the copper tape  and the support  is represented by I(A), a current value found when a voltage of \u22121 V having only a direct-current component is applied across the copper tape  and the support  is represented by I (A), the layer thickness of the conductive layer  is represented by d (cm) and the area of the electrode (copper tape ) on the surface side of the conductive layer  is represented by S (cm), where the value expressed by the following mathematical expression (1) is taken as volume resistivity \u03c1 (\u03a9\u00b7cm) of the conductive layer .\n\n\u03c1=1\/()\u00d7(\u03a9\u00b7cm)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In this measurement, the level of electric current of extremely as extremely small as 1\u00d710A or less as absolute value is measured, and hence it is preferable to make the measurement by using as the current measuring instrument  an instrument that can measure an extremely small electric current. Such an instrument may include, e.g., a pA meter (trade name: 4140B) manufactured by Yokogawa Hewlett-Packard Company.","Incidentally, the volume resistivity of the conductive layer shows the like value in either of measurement made in the state only the conductive layer has been formed on the support and measurement made in the state the respective layers (photosensitive layer and so forth) on the conductive layer have been stripped off the electrophotographic photosensitive member so as to leave only the conductive layer on the support.","In the present invention, the conductive layer is formed by using a coating liquid for conductive layer prepared with use of a solvent, a binder material and metal oxide particles. The coating liquid for conductive layer may be prepared by dispersing the metal oxide particles in the solvent together with the binder material. As a method for dispersion, it may include, e.g., a method making use of a paint shaker, a sand mill, a ball mill or a liquid impact type high-speed dispersion machine. The conductive layer may be formed by applying the coating liquid for conductive layer, thus prepared, onto the support and then drying and\/or curing the wet coating formed.","In the present invention, as the metal oxide particles, titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with tungsten (W) are used. These are hereinafter generically termed also \u201ctin oxide coated titanium oxide particles\u201d.","The tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles used in the present invention are particles having been made to have a powder resistivity x (\u03a9\u00b7cm) by coating titanium oxide (TiO) particles [(particles composed of only titanium oxide (TiO)] having a powder resistivity y (\u03a9\u00b7cm), with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W), where the y and the x satisfy the following relations (i) and (ii):\n\n5.0\u00d7105.0\u00d710\u2003\u2003(i)\n\n1.0\u00d7101.0\u00d710\u2003\u2003(ii)\n","In other words, where powder resistivity of the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles used in the present invention is represented by x (\u03a9\u00b7cm) and powder resistivity of the titanium oxide (TiO) particles that are core particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles used in the present invention is represented by y (\u03a9\u00b7cm), the y and the x satisfy the above relations (i) and (ii).","If the core particles titanium oxide (TiO) particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles has a powder resistivity y of less than 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation of the electrophotographic photosensitive member comes to tend to occur. This is because, in addition to the coats (also \u201ccoat layers\u201d) [i.e., the part of the tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W)] that originally tend to flow electric current therethrough, even the core particles [the titanium oxide (TiO) particles] covered with such coats has a low powder resistivity y, and hence the electric charges flowing through not only the coats but also the core particles tends to become large in quantity when the electrophotographic photosensitive member is charged, as so considered. That is, it is because the electric charges come to more tend to flow at the time of charging of the electrophotographic photosensitive member at which the quantity of electric charges flowing through the electrophotographic photosensitive member should be controlled or limited. The powder resistivity y may preferably be 1.0\u00d710or more (1.0\u00d710\u2266y).","On the other hand, if the core particle titanium oxide (TiO) particle constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles has a powder resistivity y of more than 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, the residual potential comes to tend to increase. This is because the core particles [the titanium oxide (TiO) particles] has a high powder resistivity y, and hence the electric charges flowing through the core particles may inevitably become small in quantity at the time of exposure, so that it may come about that the electric charges flow chiefly only at the coats, as so considered. That is, it is because the electric charges come more not to easily flow at the time of exposure at which the quantity of electric charges flowing through the electrophotographic photosensitive member should be made large. The powder resistivity y may preferably be 1.0\u00d710or less (y\u22661.0\u00d710).","The value of y\/x in the above relation (ii) (hereinafter also \u201cpowder resistivity ratio y\/x\u201d) is a parameter which means that the quantity of electric charges flowing through the core particles titanium oxide (TiO) particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles and the quantity of electric charges flowing through the whole tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles inclusive of the coats are required to be balanced with each other within a specific range.","If the powder resistivity ratio y\/x is more than 1.0\u00d710, the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation of the electrophotographic photosensitive member comes to tend to occur. This is caused by the fact that any high powder resistivity ratio y\/x makes the balance between the quantity of electric charges flowing through the core particles titanium oxide (TiO) particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles and the quantity of electric charges flowing through the whole tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles break when the electrophotographic photosensitive member is charged, as so considered. That is, it is because the electric charges come to tend to flow locally at the coats at the time of charging of the electrophotographic photosensitive member at which the quantity of electric charges flowing through the electrophotographic photosensitive member should be controlled or limited.","On the other hand, if the powder resistivity ratio y\/x is less than 1.0\u00d710, the residual potential comes to tend to increase. This is caused by the fact that any low powder resistivity ratio y\/x makes the balance between the quantity of electric charges flowing through the core particles titanium oxide (TiO) particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles and the quantity of electric charges flowing through the whole tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles break when the electrophotographic photosensitive member is charged, as so considered. That is, it is because the electric charges come not to easily flow through the coats at the time of exposure at which the quantity of electric charges flowing through the electrophotographic photosensitive member should be made large.","For the above reasons, the powder resistivity ratio y\/x is required to be from 1.0\u00d710or more to 1.0\u00d710or less. A preferable powder resistivity ratio y\/x may be from 1.0\u00d710or more to 1.0\u00d710or less, i.e.:\n\n1.0\u00d7101.0\u00d710\u2003\u2003(iii).\n","The titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) [in particular, phosphorus (P)] as used in the present invention are more greatly effective in keeping the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation of the electrophotographic photosensitive member from occurring, and also more greatly effective in keeping the residual potential from increasing when images are formed, than any titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with oxygen deficient tin oxide (SnO).","Details are unclear about the reason why the former particles are greatly effective in keeping the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation from occurring, which, however, is considered to be concerned with the fact that the use of the titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) [in particular, phosphorus (P)] makes small the electric current (dark electric current) flowing through the electrophotographic photosensitive member at its dark areas when a stated voltage is applied thereto.","About the reason why the former particles are greatly effective in keeping the residual potential from increasing when images are formed, it is considered due to the fact that the latter titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with oxygen deficient tin oxide (SnO) come oxidized in the presence of oxygen to lose their oxygen deficient portions, so that the latter particles may come to have a high resistance to make the flow of electric charges come to tend to stagnate in the conductive layer, whereas the former particles according to the present invention are not so.","The core particles titanium oxide (TiO) particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles used in the present invention may have a particle shape which is granular, spherical, acicular, fibrous, columnar, rod-like, spindle-like or plate-like, or other similar shape, any of which may be used. From the viewpoint of less image defects such as black spots, spherical particles are preferred. The core particles titanium oxide (TiO) particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles may also have a crystal form of rutile, anatase, brookite or amorphous, any crystal form of which may be used. As to their production method as well, any production method may be used, such as a sulfuric acid method or a hydrochloric acid method.","The tin oxide (SnO) in the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles may preferably be in a proportion (coverage) of from 10% by mass to 60% by mass. To control the coverage of the tin oxide (SnO), a tin raw material necessary for formation of the tin oxide (SnO) must be compounded when the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles are produced. For example, where tin chloride (SnCl) that is a tin raw material is used, it must be formulated taking account of the amount of the tin oxide (SnO) to be formed from the tin chloride (SnCl).","Here, the tin oxide (SnO) serving as the coats of the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles used in the present invention stands doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W), where the coverage is defined as the value found by calculation from the mass of the tin oxide (SnO) with respect to the total mass of the tin oxide (SnO) and titanium oxide (TiO), without taking account of the mass of the phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) stands doped.","Any tin oxide (SnO) in a coverage of less than 10% by mass makes it difficult to control the powder resistivity ratio y\/x to be from 1.0\u00d710or more to 1.0\u00d710or less. Any tin oxide (SnO) in a coverage of more than 60% by mass tends to make non-uniform the covering of the titanium oxide (TiO) with the tin oxide (SnO), and tends to result in a high cost.","The phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) is doped may preferably be in an amount of from 0.1% by mass to 10% by mass based on the mass of the tin oxide (SnO) [the mass not inclusive of the phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W)]. Any phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) is doped in an amount of less than 0.1% by mass makes it difficult to control the powder resistivity ratio y\/x to be from 1.0\u00d710or more to 1.0\u00d710or less. Any phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) with which the tin oxide (SnO) is doped in an amount of more than 10% by mass makes the tin oxide (SnO) low crystallizable, and makes it difficult to control the powder resistivity ratio y\/x to be from 1.0\u00d710or more to 1.0\u00d710or less. The doping of the tin oxide (SnO) with the phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) can commonly make the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles have a lower powder resistivity than those not doped therewith.","Incidentally, how to produce the titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) and the titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with tungsten (W) is also disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H06-207118 and No. 2004-349167.","How to measure the powder resistivity of the metal oxide particles (tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles) is as described below.","The powder resistivity of the metal oxide particles (tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles) and that of the core particles [titanium oxide (TiO) particles] constituting the metal oxide particles are measured in a normal-temperature and normal-humidity (23\u00b0 C.\/50% RH) environment. In the present invention, a resistivity measuring instrument manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation [trade name: LORESTA GP (or HIRESTA UP in the case of more than 10\u03a9\u00b7cm)] is used as a measuring instrument. The measurement object metal oxide particles (tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles) and so forth are each compacted at a pressure of 500 kg\/cmto prepare a pellet-shaped measuring sample. The powder resistivity is measured at an applied voltage of 100 V.","In the present invention, the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles having the core particles [titanium oxide (TiO) particles] are used as the metal oxide particles incorporated in the conductive layer, which are used in order to achieve an improvement in the dispersibility of the metal oxide particles in the coating liquid for conductive layer. Any use of particles composed of only the tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) or the oxygen deficient tin oxide (SnO) tends to make the metal oxide particles have a large particle diameter in the coating liquid for conductive layer, so that protrusive seeding defects may occur on the surface of the conductive layer and also the coating liquid for conductive layer may have a low stability.","The titanium oxide (TiO) particles are used as the core particles, which are used because they are greatly effective in keeping the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation of the electrophotographic photosensitive member from occurring. Details are unclear about the reason why such particles are greatly effective in keeping the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation from occurring, which, however, is considered to be concerned with the fact that their use makes small the electric current (dark electric current) flowing through the electrophotographic photosensitive member at its dark areas when a stated voltage is applied thereto. Further, the titanium oxide (TiO) particles as the core particles have an advantage that they are so low transparent as the metal oxide particles as to easily cover any defects of the surface of the support. In contrast thereto, where, e.g., barium sulfate particles are used as the core particles, they are so high transparent as the metal oxide particles as to make it necessary to specially use a material for covering any defects of the surface of the support.","Not any uncoated titanium oxide (TiO) particles, but the titanium oxide (TiO) particles coated with tin oxide (SnO) doped with phosphorus (P) or tungsten (W) are used as the metal oxide particles, which are used because such uncoated titanium oxide (TiO) particles make the flow of electric charges come to tend to stagnate when images are formed, and come to tend to result in an increase in residual potential, whereas the latter particles according to the present invention are not so.","As the binder material used in preparing the coating liquid for conductive layer, it may include, e.g., resins such as phenol resin, polyurethane resin, polyamide resin, polyimide resin, polyamide-imide resin, polyvinyl acetal resin, epoxy resin, acrylic resin, melamine resin and polyester resin. Any of these may be used alone or in combination of two or more types. Also, of these, from the viewpoints of control of migration (transfer) to other layers, adhesion to the support, dispersibility and dispersion stability of the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles and solvent resistance after layer formation, hardening resins are preferred, and heat-hardening resins (thermosetting resins) are much preferred. Still also, of the thermosetting resins, thermosetting phenol resins and thermosetting polyurethane resins are preferred. Where such a hardening resin is used as the binder material for the conductive layer, the binder material to be contained in the coating liquid for conductive layer serves as a monomer, and\/or an oligomer, of the hardening resin.","The solvent used in preparing the coating liquid for conductive layer may include, e.g., alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monomethyl ether; esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene.","In the present invention, the metal oxide particles (tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles) (P) and binder material (B) in the coating liquid for conductive layer are required to be in a mass ratio (P\/B) of from 1.5\/1.0 to 3.5\/1.0. If the metal oxide particles (tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles) (P) and the binder material (B) are in a mass ratio (P\/B) of less than 1.5\/1.0, the flow of electric charges comes to tend to stagnate in the conductive layer when images are formed, to come to tend to increase in residual potential. Also, those in such a ratio make it difficult to control the volume resistivity of the conductive layer to be 5.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less. If the metal oxide particles (tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles) (P) and the binder material (B) are in a mass ratio (P\/B) of more than 3.5\/1.0, this makes it difficult to control the volume resistivity of the conductive layer to be 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or more, and also makes it difficult to bind the metal oxide particles (tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles), to come to tend to cause cracks in the conductive layer and come to tend to cause the fog due to an increase in dark attenuation.","From the viewpoint of covering any defects of the surface of the support, the conductive layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 10 \u03bcm or more to 40 \u03bcm or less, and much preferably from 15 \u03bcm or more to 35 \u03bcm or less.","In the present invention, the layer thickness of each layer, inclusive of the conductive layer, of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is measured with FISCHERSCOPE Multi Measurement System (MMS), available from Fischer Instruments Co.","The tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles in the coating liquid for conductive layer may preferably have an average particle diameter of from 0.10 \u03bcm or more to 0.45 \u03bcm or less, and much preferably from 0.15 \u03bcm or more to 0.40 \u03bcm or less. If the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles have an average particle diameter of less than 0.10 \u03bcm, such tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles may come to agglomerate again after the coating liquid for conductive layer has been prepared, to make the coating liquid for conductive layer low stable or cause cracks in the surface of the conductive layer. If the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles have an average particle diameter of more than 0.45 \u03bcm, the surface of the conductive layer may come so rough as to come to tend to cause local injection of electric charges therefrom into the photosensitive layer, so that black dots may come to conspicuously appear in white background areas of reproduced images.","The average particle diameter of the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles in the coating liquid for conductive layer may be measured by liquid-phase sedimentation in the following way.","First, the coating liquid for conductive layer is so diluted with the solvent used in preparing the same, as to have a transmittance between 0.8 and 1.0. Next, a histogram of average particle diameter (volume base D50) and particle size distribution of the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles is prepared by using a centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument. In the present invention, as the centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument, a centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument (trade name: CAPA700) manufactured by Horiba, Ltd. is used to make measurement under conditions of a number of revolutions of 3,000 rpm.","As particle diameter of the titanium oxide (TiO) particles that are the core particles constituting the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles, it may preferably be from 0.05 \u03bcm or more to 0.40 \u03bcm or less, from the viewpoint of controlling the average particle diameter of the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles within the above range.","In order to keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light having reflected from the surface of the conductive layer, a surface roughness providing material for roughening the surface of the conductive layer may also be added to the coating liquid for conductive layer. Such a surface roughness providing material may preferably be resin particles having an average particle diameter of from 1 \u03bcm or more to 5 \u03bcm or less. Such resin particles may include, e.g., particles of hardening rubbers and of hardening resins such as polyurethane, epoxy resin, alkyd resin, phenol resin, polyester, silicone resin and acryl-melamine resin. Of these, particles of silicone resin are preferred as being not easily agglomerative. The specific gravity of resin particles (which is 0.5 to 2) is smaller than the specific gravity of the tin oxide coated titanium oxide particles (which is 4 to 7), and hence the surface of the conductive layer can efficiently be roughened at the time of formation of the conductive layer. However, the conductive layer has a tendency to increase in volume resistivity with an increase in content of the surface roughness providing material in the conductive layer.

conductive layer was measured on the electrophotographic photosensitive members  to  and C to C each, the surfaces of their conductive layers were observed on an optical microscope, whereupon cracks were seen to have occurred in regard to the conductive layers of the electrophotographic photosensitive members C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C and C.","The electrophotographic photosensitive members  to  and C to C were each set in a laser beam printer (trade name: HP LASERJET P1505) manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Co., and the dark attenuation was measured in the following way in a high-temperature and high-humidity (30\u00b0 C.\/80% RH) environment.","First, using a potential jig having a potential-measuring probe, charge potential (dark area potential) was measured while solid white images were reproduced on three sheets. On that occasion, during the reproduction of images on three sheets, a power source of the potential-measuring probe was kept ON, in the state of which a power source of the laser beam printer was forcedly switched OFF. Charge potential Vdimmediately before the latter power source was switched OFF and charge potential Vdon lapse of one second after the latter power source was switched OFF were each measured to find the value of dark attenuation rate: (Vd\u2212Vd)\u00d7100\/Vd(%). Here, it shows that, the smaller this dark attenuation rate is, the smaller the dark attenuation is. Also, this dark attenuation is herein \u201cdark attenuation before sheet feeding durability test\u201d.","Next, the electrophotographic photosensitive members  to  and C to C were each put to a sheet feeding durability test in the same high-temperature and high-humidity environment as the above. In the sheet feeding durability test, printing was operated in an intermittent mode in which a character image with a print percentage of 2% was sheet by sheet reproduced on letter size sheet, to reproduce images on 500 sheets.","After the image reproduction on 500 sheets was finished, each electrophotographic photosensitive member was left to stand for 10 minutes, and thereafter the dark attenuation was again measured in the same way as the dark attenuation before sheet feeding durability test to likewise find the dark attenuation rate. The results are shown in Tables 5 and 6.","In addition to the electrophotographic photosensitive members  to  and C to C on which the sheet feeding durability test was conducted, one more each of the electrophotographic photosensitive members  to  and C to C was readied, and each of them was set in a laser beam printer (trade name: HP LASERJET P1505) manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Co., where the sheet feeding durability test was conducted in a low-temperature and low-humidity (15\u00b0 C.\/10% RH) environment. In this sheet feeding durability test, printing was operated in an intermittent mode in which a character image with a print percentage of 2% was sheet by sheet reproduced on letter size sheet, to reproduce images on 3,000 sheets, and any potential variations were measured.","At the start of the sheet feeding durability test and after the finish of the image reproduction on 3,000 sheets, charge potential (dark area potential) and potential at the time of exposure (light area potential) were measured. Each potential was measured using one sheet each of solid white images and solid black images.","The dark area potential at the initial stage (at the start of the sheet feeding durability test) and the light area potential at the initial stage (at the start of the sheet feeding durability test) were represented by Vd and Vl, respectively. The dark area potential after the finish of the image reproduction on 3,000 sheets and the light area potential after the finish of the image reproduction on 3,000 sheets were represented by Vd\u2032 and Vl\u2032, respectively.","Then, the value of dark area potential variation level \u0394Vd that is the difference between the dark area potential Vd\u2032 after the finish of the image reproduction on 3,000 sheets and the dark area potential Vd at the initial stage, \u0394Vd (=|Vd\u2032|\u2212|Vd|), and the value of light area potential variation level \u0394Vl that is the difference between the light area potential Vl\u2032 after the finish of the image reproduction on 3,000 sheets and the light area potential Vl at the initial stage, \u0394Vl (=|Vl\u2032|\u2212|Vl|), were each found.
