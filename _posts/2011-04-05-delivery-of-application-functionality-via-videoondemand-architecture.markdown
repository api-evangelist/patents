A service provider may have millions of devices in the field, wherein some devices may have been deployed for over ten years and may be limited in memory and capability.","As new and more advanced applications become available for providing useful functionality to customers\/users, a problem surfaces because older or so-called legacy set-top boxes or other client-side computing devices for providing application functionality and\/or content to the end user may not have memory capacity or processing capability for handling the new and more advanced applications. Cable services providers are faced with costly upgrades to or physical replacement of deployed devices, or customers simply do not get the benefit of the new and more advanced software applications. Thus, a need exists for providing new and more advanced software application functionality and associated content via deployed older or legacy devices.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","The above and other problems are solved by providing application functionality and associated content at a client side cable services system services provision device (e.g., a set-top box) by providing the results of server-based application functionality to the client side via a video-on-demand architecture. According to embodiments, application functionality that is not deployed on a client side device is performed at a server side computing system (e.g., cable services system backend system). Application processing and memory are maintained and utilized at the backend application server, and resulting content produced by processing at the backend server is provided to the customer\/user at the client side device via video-on-demand (VoD) architecture. VoD navigation commands, such as Play, Fast-Forward (FF), Rewind (REW), Pause, and the like, may be utilized for interfacing with the remote application functionality and with resulting application functionality content.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing application functionality and associated content at a client side cable services system services provision device (e.g., a set-top box) by providing the results of server-based application functionality to the client side via a video-on-demand architecture. Utilization of an existing Video on Demand (VoD) architecture to allow services other than traditional VoD services (e.g., movies, television shows, sporting events, etc.) to be provided to networked devices, such as set-top boxes is provided. Through a combination of backend VoD delivery systems and VoD navigation commands, such as Play, Fast-Forward (FF), Rewind (REW), Pause, and the like (sometimes referred to as \u201ctrick mode commands\u201d), application functionality may be housed, maintained and performed at backend application servers and the results of the application functionality may be provided to a customer\/user at a client side device via VoD delivery systems. A variety of software applications may be provided by remote application servers acting as VoD servers. Requested content or applications may be requested by a client VoD application, wherein the requested content may be streamed to the requesting device. The thin VoD client side application may interact with the remote application as if the content from the server side application is VoD content. Accordingly, normal VoD command functionality may be utilized to interact with the remote application.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar elements. While embodiments of the invention may be described, modifications, adaptations, and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions, or modifications may be made to the elements illustrated in the drawings, and the methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, or adding stages to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the proper scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.","A cable television\/services system (hereafter referred to as \u201cCATV\u201d) architecture  showing an integrated video or content on demand architecture that may serve as an exemplary operating environment for embodiments of the invention is described with reference to . Referring now to , digital and analog video programming, information content and interactive television services are provided via a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) network  to a television set  for consumption by a cable television\/services system customer. As is known to those skilled in the art, HFC networks  combine both optical fiber and coaxial cable lines. Typically, optical fiber runs from the cable head end  to neighborhoods of 500 to 2,000 customers. Coaxial cable runs from the optical fiber feeders to each customer. According to embodiments of the present invention, the functionality of the HFC network  allows for efficient bidirectional data flow between the client-side networked device (e.g. set-top box ) and the server-side application server  of the present invention.","According to embodiments of the present invention, the CATV system  is in the form of a distributed client-server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network  between server-side services providers (e.g., cable television\/services providers) via a server-side (backend) head end  and a client-side customer via a networked device (e.g., client-side set-top box (STB) ). As should be appreciated, a STB  may be a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism, and connected to a customer receiving device, such as the television set . Alternatively, STB functionality may be embedded in a network-connected display device, such as a television . According to embodiments, the term \u201cSTB\u201d is being used to describe a physical media access control (MAC) address device. This physical MAC address device may be an external STB , or may be a television  or other network-connected device that comprises a VoD application .","As is understood by those skilled in the art, modern CATV systems  may provide a variety of services across the HFC network  including traditional digital and analog video programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, video on demand (VoD), and information services. On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As described above, the STB  may be a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism of a STB  receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The STB  may also include a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (API) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . According to one embodiment, the middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML). As should be appreciated XML is only one example formatting type and other suitable formatting languages or types may be utilized. As also should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, although some embodiments described in this specification are oriented to middleware installed and executed on a STB , alternative embodiments implemented as firmware or as hardware are well within the scope of the present invention.","According to one embodiment, the set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . According to other embodiments, two-way communication transports may be utilized, for example, via high definition multimedia (HDMI) ports. The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The video\/data downlink is an \u201cin band\u201d downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system  through the HFC network  to the set-top box  for use by the STB  and for distribution to the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, the \u201cin band\u201d signaling space may operate across a variety of frequency ranges, for example, at a frequency between 54 and 1000 megahertz. The signaling space is generally divided into 6 megahertz channels in which may be transmitted a single analog signal or a greater number (e.g., up to ten) digital signals.","The data downlink and the data uplink, illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. As is understand by those skilled in the art, the \u201cout of band\u201d frequency range generally lies between zero and 54 megahertz. According to embodiments of the present invention, data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via display devices, such as televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand (VoD) services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box .","According to embodiments, VoD services may be provided to clients. When a client requests an asset from a VoD system, a compressed digital stream of bits representing the asset may be transmitted from a video server to a client STB , where it may be decoded into analog video and audio, and displayed on a connected display device  or by being modulated on an RF channel that links a display device  to a STB . A video on demand (VoD) back office  may be located at the head end , and may communicate with a controller function . A distant streaming storage  may contain additional assets than a local streaming storage  may hold. For example, a distant streaming storage  may contain movie files. The metadata about the movie files may be published from the controller  to the VoD back office . A navigation interface may be presented to a client, wherein the client may utilize the navigation interface to select an asset (e.g., a movie title) he\/she wishes to view. A session setup request may be sent to the VoD back office . The VoD back office  may request the local streaming storage  to create a stream. Through the metadata, the local streaming storage  may know that it doesn't have the asset stored locally, and may send a request through the controller  to the distant streaming storage  to send the asset to the client .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["126","115","106","112","212","214","216","105","120","212","214","216"]},"According to embodiments, a user may review an activation sequence in order by navigating through a favorites folder selected from applications in addition to VoD providers. Upon selection, a line item within the application may be selected via a play command. A session request may be sent to the VoD back office , which may then be forwarded to a local streaming storage server . Upon determining that an asset is coded as reference only, a call may be made to an equivalent controller . That is, the local streaming storage  may contain metadata, which may allow it to know that the asset is stored remotely. The local streaming storage  may send a request through the controller . The controller , operative to manage data across all application servers, may issue a request for the applicable content. The content may be rendered into a specified format if necessary by a renderer , and may be delivered to a streamer . The data stream may be sent to the client using a unique identifier of a requesting device (e.g., MAC address of a set-top box). According to embodiments, if the user is presented with a navigation screen, rather than end goal content, the user may use trick mode keys to navigate through the screens. That is, a specified button or command may be used to select an item and generate the next part of the experience. The on demand architecture  illustrated in  may include a subscriber database . Rights for applications and subscriber entitlements may be stored in the subscriber database .","According to embodiments, throughout the application functionality\/content via VoD experience, by manipulation of metadata, including a use of updating asset duration, for example through a digital storage media command and control (DSM-CC) extension, the VoD application may see the applications , ,  as an \u201con demand\u201d stream. Accordingly, new applications may be introduced without adhering to limitations of the requesting device (e.g., legacy digital set-top boxes). Applications may be designed to execute in a web domain, and may be presented as video to an on demand infrastructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["305","310","114"]},"The method proceeds to OPERATION , where a general subscriber experience opportunity is published from the controller  to the VoD back office . Specifically, the publisher component representing choices to be presented to a subscriber is published. According to embodiments, choices may be presented to subscribers in a personal folder. The personal folder may be personal to a specified subscriber, or may be associated with a given service provider. The personal folder may contain a series of lists that may be navigated. The lists may represent one or more services that may be available to the subscriber via the VoD architecture described herein, for example (but not limited to), videomail, user generated content, videoshopping, horoscopes, games, interactive news feeds, productivity applications, such as word processors, spreadsheet applications, data processing applications, etc. An asset synopsis page may be provided that may point to details about a given service (e.g., videomail from a given date, news topics, particular star signs, etc.). Metadata associated with VoD content may include descriptive data identifying a title of a piece of content, descriptive data to populate a electronic program guide, to provide an index of scenes of a movie, and\/or to provide business rules detailing how content may be displayed, copied, or sold. The metadata may contain specific fields that may automatically display information in various areas of a display screen. Embodiments of the present invention provide for replacing one or more metadata fields in an asset synopsis page with other content associated with a non-VoD application. For example, a summary of given movie may be replaced with text stating, \u201cGet Your Video Mail Here.\u201d","The method proceeds to OPERATION , where an application experience is selected by a subscriber via a normal VoD navigation method. A selection may be made by various means, such as by utilizing a command function (e.g., \u201cplay\u201d or \u201cselect\u201d) on a remote control  or keyboard . According to an embodiment, a play command is a request sent to obtain an asset from a particular location and to return the asset to the requesting device via a unique identifier, such as a MAC address, wherein the MAC address is a unique identifier for a particular STB .","Upon asset selection, the method proceeds to OPERATION , where a session set-up request is sent from the VoD application  to the VoD back office . At OPERATION , the session set-up request is received by the VoD back office , wherein the VoD back office  requests the local streaming storage  to provide the requested asset stream.","The method proceeds to DECISION OPERATION , where the local streaming storage  makes a determination via metadata whether the referenced asset is coded as reference only. That is, it is determined whether the referenced asset is located at the local streaming storage , or located remotely, for example, remote applications ,,. If the application is located at the local streaming storage , the application may proceed to OPERATION .","If the application is not locally resident at the local streaming storage , the method proceeds to OPERATION , where a request is sent to an equivalent controller  to supply the requested asset stream, as determined via the URL of the selected asset. According to an embodiment, the controller may be called via a data call, for example, a C2 data call.","At OPERATION , the controller  makes a determination of which of the available applications it manages has been requested and directs the request to the applicable application server ,,. According to an embodiment, the controller  may communicate with a subscriber database  to personalize the experience. The request may include a unique identifier, such as a MAC address, which may be tied to an account in a subscriber database . For example, a subscriber's personal video mail may be accessed, and the subscriber's interaction with a requested application ,, may provide for a dynamic user experience. According to another embodiment, the unique identifier may be associated with a more general identification, for example, as a specified service provider subscriber.","At DECISION OPERATION , a determination is made as to whether the requested content requires rendering. For example, if the requested content is video mail, rendering may not be required as it is already in video format. As another example, if the requested content is not in a video format, then rendering may be required. If the requested content does not require rendering, the method proceeds to OPERATION . If the requested content requires rendering, the method proceeds to OPERATION , where the content may be rendered into a streaming format (e.g., MPEG2), and then delivered to a streamer .","At OPERATION , the stream may be sent to the client using the delivered MAC address. If the referenced asset was not located at the local streaming storage , the stream may be sent directly from the streamer  to the client , or alternatively, from the streamer to the client  through an edge cache of the local streaming storage . If the referenced asset was located at the local streaming storage , the stream may be sent from the local streaming storage to the client. The experience may be a personalized experience. In current VoD systems, provided content is static. Embodiments of the present invention provide for user experiences in real time generated through applications ,, and piped through the VoD back office . The user experience may be personalized as the subscriber interacts with the content. For example, if a selected application is a card game, each time a user plays the game, he\/she will get a different experience.","As shown in , according to embodiments, the subscriber may use VoD navigation keys functions when navigating through selections. That is, buttons or commands typically utilized for VoD may be utilized for non-VoD applications provided through the VoD architecture. For example a Rewind button  may be utilized to navigate back; a Fast-Forward button  may be utilized to navigate forward; and a Play button  may be utilized to select an item, and to generate the next part of the experience. Once a stream is in play, the stream may be paused, accelerated, or reversed, or stopped through the use of the Pause button , Fast-Forward button , Rewind button , or Stop button . As should be appreciated use of remote control buttons, as illustrated, in  is only one example of an interface with the VoD-based experience described herein. For example, a set of soft buttons may be displayed on a display screen  that may be selected via the remote control device, a keyboard or via other selection means including touch, voice, and the like.","Referring back to , the method ends at OPERATION .","By utilizing a thin VoD client  at the client side STB  and a backend application server acting as a VoD back office  to speak to a controller , additional application functionality may be provided. New applications may be introduced without adhering to limitations of the requesting device (e.g., legacy digital set-top boxes) or without requiring upgrading of VoD back office  technologies. Applications may be designed to execute in a web domain, and may be presented as video to an On Demand infrastructure.","Embodiments of the present invention, for example, are described above with reference to block diagrams and\/or operational illustrations of methods, systems, and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention.
