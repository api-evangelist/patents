title: Reproduction controller, and reproduction controlling method and program
abstract: A drive unit supplies to an auxiliary information generating section a first event notice related to reproducing operation and a second event notice indicating reproducing position information, regarding content recorded on a recording medium. The auxiliary information generating section generates auxiliary information based on the first and second event notices, for storage in an information storage section. A comparison/computation section makes a comparison or a computation using the reproducing position information indicated by the auxiliary information and reproducing position information indicated by a later-supplied second event notice. A command issuing section issues a command for controlling reproduction of the content based on a result of the comparison or the computation. As a result, a reproducing operation differing from an operation according to a predetermined command can be performed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present document is based on Japanese Priority Application JP2002-227749, filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Aug. 5, 2002, the contents of which being incorporated herein by reference to the extent permitted by law.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a reproduction controller, and a reproduction controlling method and program. More particularly, the invention is intended to generate auxiliary information based on a first event notice related to reproducing operation regarding content recorded on a recording medium and a second event notice indicating reproducing position information on the recording medium, and then to issue a command for controlling reproduction of the content based on the result of a comparison or a computation made on the auxiliary information and reproducing position information indicated by a later-supplied second event notice.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, in order to reproduce content recorded on a recording medium, such as, for example, a disk compatible with a DVD-Video standard, a desired command is selected from among predetermined commands and issued to a drive unit, whereby to play the recording medium. For example, when a \u201cPlay\u201d command is issued, a current title may be reproduced. When a \u201cPlayChapter(parameter)\u201d command is issued, a chapter specified by the parameter of the current title is reproduced. When a \u201cPlayNextChapter\u201d command is issued, reproduction of a next chapter is started, and when a \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command is issued, reproduction of a chapter immediately before a current chapter is started. Also, when a \u201cPlayAtTime(parameter)\u201d command is issued, reproduction of the content is started at a time specified by the parameter of the current title. It is further arranged to issue a command such as to reproduce a specified title.","On the other hand, the drive unit supplies predetermined event notices indicating information related to reproducing operation and information related to reproducing positions regarding the content recorded on the recording medium. For example, when an event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START(parameter)\u201d is supplied, it is indicated that reproduction of the chapter specified by the parameter of the current title is started. Also, in an event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME(parameter)\u201d, reproducing position information (a time code) is indicated by the parameter, whereas an event notice \u201cEC_DVD_DISC_INSERTED\u201d or \u201cEC_DVD_DISC_EJECTED\u201d indicates that the disc is inserted into or ejected from a reproducing apparatus.","It is worth a note that, since the commands as mentioned above are pre-set, the reproducing operations utilizing such commands are limited. For example, when any of the \u201cPlayChapter(parameter)\u201d, \u201cPlayNextChapter\u201d, and \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d commands is used, the command can only move the reproducing position by the chapter, when issued. Also, when the \u201cPlayAtTime(parameter)\u201d command is issued, Also, when the \u201cPlayAtTime(parameter)\u201d command is issued, the content can be reproduced only from a position specified by the parameter.","Additionally, the disc contains various management information so as to play DVD-Video compatible content properly. However, the event notices are pre-set and thus so limited that this management information cannot be read.","Consequently, there is an issue in which mere issuance of a limited number of predetermined commands according to user's operation, and non-utilization of the management information constitutes a barrier for implementation of a more diversified and elaborate reproducing operation.","In order to alleviate the above mentioned problems, the present invention provides a reproduction controller, and a reproduction controlling method and program, which can implement a variety of reproducing functions by using predetermined commands and event notices supplied by the drive unit.","A reproduction controlling apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes: auxiliary information generation means for generating auxiliary information based on a first event notice related to reproduction operation regarding content recorded in a recording medium and a second event notice indicating reproduction position information of the recording medium; comparison-computation means for comparing or computing reproduction position information indicated by the auxiliary information with reproduction position information indicated by the second event notice; and command issuing means for issuing a command for controlling reproduction operation of the content, based on a result of the comparison or the computation.","In addition a reproduction controlling method according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention includes the steps of generating auxiliary information based on a first event notice related to reproduction operation regarding content recorded in a recording medium and a second event notice indicating reproduction position information of the recording medium; and issuing a command for controlling reproduction operation of the content, based on a result of comparison or computation of reproduction position information indicated by the auxiliary information with reproduction position information indicated by the second event notice.","Furthermore, a computer program written in computer readable form for reproduction controlling according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention has program codes for causing a computer to execute the steps of: acquiring a first event notice related to reproduction operation regarding content recorded in a recording; acquiring a second event notice indicating reproduction position information of the recording medium; generating auxiliary information based on the first event notice and the second event notice; and issuing a command for controlling reproduction operation of the content, based on a result of comparison or computation of reproduction position information indicated by the auxiliary information with reproduction position information indicated by the second event notice.","According to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, auxiliary information is generated based on a first event notice related to reproducing operation and a second event notice indicating reproducing position information, regarding content recorded on a recording medium, and a command for controlling the content reproducing operation is issued based on the result of a comparison or a computation performed on the reproducing position information indicated by the auxiliary information and reproducing position information indicated by a later-supplied second event notice, whereby not only operations according to predetermined commands, but also diverse reproducing operation can be performed.","Furthermore, the generated auxiliary information is stored, and thereafter read to use the reproducing position information in the read auxiliary information for comparison or computation, whereby further diverse reproducing operation can be performed.","Furthermore, the first event notice notifies the reproduction start of a content block constituting the content, whereas the auxiliary information is generated based on the content block, reproduction of which has been started, and the reproducing position information at the time of its reproduction, whereby a reproducing operation can be performed in which the reproduction starting position of this content block is used as a reference. For example, when reproducing position information indicated by a second event notice is a predetermined time ahead of the reproducing position information indicated by the auxiliary information, a command is issued to change content blocks for reproduction, whereby the skip function can be implemented.","Moreover, when a command issuing operation is performed for controlling the content reproducing operation, such command is issued after converted or adjusted based on the result of a comparison or a computation, whereby conventional command functions can be expanded.","An embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings.  shows a general configuration of a content reproducing system that reproduces content recorded on a recording medium, such as, for example, a DVD-Video compatible disk.","A control processing section  of a reproduction controller  has connected to it a user interface  that inputs signals according to operation by a user. The interface  includes a keyboard, a mouse, a touch panel, and remote control signal receiving circuitry. A command issuing section of the control processing section  issues commands based on manipulated signals, when receiving the manipulated signals corresponding to command input operation performed by the user via the user interface .","A command issued by the command issuing section is supplied to a drive unit  via a driver section . The driver section  converts the issued command into a signal acceptable by the drive unit . Thus, even when the drive unit  is changed to a different type, if a driver section  compatible with the changed drive unit  is provided, the existing commands issued from the command issuing section can be performed by the changed drive unit , with no change or modification made on these commands.","The drive unit  reproduces image and\/or audio content based on the supplied command, and delivers a signal read from the disc to a reproduced signal processing section . The drive unit  also feeds event notices indicative of information related to reproducing operation and reproducing positions for the content, to the control processing section  via the driver section .","The reproduced signal processing section  decodes the supplied image and\/or audio data, and outputs the decoded image and\/or audio data to an image display unit  and\/or an audio output unit  via the control processing section . The image display unit  presents the image content based on the image data supplied. The audio output unit  presents the audio content based on the audio data.","An auxiliary information generating section of the control processing section  generates auxiliary information using the event notices from the drive unit , and stores the generated auxiliary information in an information storage section . Also, in order to read the generated but not yet stored auxiliary information, or all or some desired items of stored auxiliary information, a comparison\/computation section compares or computes reproducing position information contained in the auxiliary information and reproducing position information supplied by a specific event notice. Based on a comparison or computation result, the command issuing section automatically issues a corresponding command to the drive unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["11","1","11","20","2","3","1","2"]},"In step ST, the control processing section  stores the auxiliary information generated in step ST in the information storage section , and then goes to step ST, in which a second event notice from the drive unit , which indicates reproducing position information, is acquired. Then, in step ST, the auxiliary information from the information storage section  is read out, and the process proceeds to step ST.","In step ST, the control processing section  performs a comparison or a computation between or on the reproducing position information indicated by the second event notice acquired in step ST and the position information contained in the auxiliary information read in step ST, to determine whether or not a command should be issued based on a comparison or computation result. If it is determined not to issue a command, the control processing section  loops back to step ST; otherwise it goes to step ST, where it issues a command to the drive unit  and then returns to step ST.","The above operation of  will be described more specifically with reference to  that shows an example of a skip function. In the skip function, auxiliary information indicating a relationship between a content block constituting content, for example, a chapter, and its starting position is generated, and by using such auxiliary information, each chapter, is sequentially and automatically reproduced (played) from its beginning for only a predetermined time.","When the skip function is selected, first, the command issuing section of the control processing section  issues to the drive unit  a \u201cPlay\u201d command at a time t in . The drive unit  then starts reproducing a chapter 1, which is a first chapter, in a title 1. The drive unit  also outputs an event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d indicating the reproduction start of the chapter 1, at a time t at which the reproduction is started. It further starts outputting event notices \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d as the reproduction is started. Each event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d outputs as reproducing position information, a current time measured from the starting time of the title as a reference. This event notice is outputted at the beginning of every VOBU (Video Object Unit) that is generated every 0.4 to 1 seconds. The reproducing position information includes a time code \u201ctime, minute, second, frame\u201d.","The control processing section  acquires the event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d in step ST and a first one of the event notices \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d in step ST, of . Then, in step ST, auxiliary information is generated by relating the chapter 1 to the reproducing position information indicating the beginning position of the chapter 1, based on these event notices received in steps ST and ST. In step ST, the generated auxiliary information is stored in the information storage section .","Thereafter, in step ST, the control processing section  acquires reproducing position information indicative of a current reproducing position based on a later supplied event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d, and then in step ST, reads the auxiliary information from the information storage section . In step ST, the information indicated by the auxiliary information is subtracted from the reproducing position information acquired in step ST, to determine whether the reproducing time for the chapter 1 exceeds a predetermined time TA or not. If not, the control processing section  loops back to step ST. Otherwise, or if a time t is reached upon lapse of the predetermined time TA, then the control processing section  goes to step ST where it issues a \u201cPlayNextChapter\u201d command for reproducing a next chapter, and returns to step ST. It should be noted that in step ST, a reference value obtained by adding a predetermined time to the position information indicated by the auxiliary information may be set, and that this reference value may be compared with the reproducing position information indicated by the event notice to issue a command based on a comparison result.","Then, based on the \u201cPlayNextChapter\u201d command, the drive unit  moves the reproducing position to a chapter 2. When starting reproduction of the chapter 2 at a time t, the drive unit  outputs an event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d indicating that reproduction of the chapter is started.","The control processing section  acquires the event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d in step ST and an event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d in step ST. Then, in step ST, the chapter 2 is associated to the reproducing position information indicating its beginning, to generate auxiliary information for storage in the information storage section . Thereafter, processing similar to that for the chapter 1 is performed, whereby the chapter 2 is reproduced for the predetermined time TA, and the reproducing position can be jumped to a chapter 3.","In this way, the predetermined commands and the event notices supplied from the drive unit can be utilized to realize the skip function by which content can be reproduced automatically from the beginning of one chapter to another for the predetermined time TA.","While the above operation has been described as an example of implementation of the skip function, the functions of predetermined commands may be expanded by issuing the commands as converted or adjusted based on comparison or computation results. For example, when a \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command is issued, the reproducing position is moved back to the beginning of a chapter that is one chapter before a chapter currently being reproduced in the conventional scheme. However, by generating auxiliary information and converting or adjusting the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command using this auxiliary information, the function of the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command can be expanded.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},"When the command issuing section  issues to the drive unit  the \u201cPlay\u201d command at a time t of  as so manipulated by a user, the drive unit  starts reproducing a chapter 1 in a first title 1, and outputs an event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d indicating that reproduction of the chapter 1 is started at a time t, and also starts outputting event notices \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d indicating reproducing position information, as a result of content being reproduced.","The control processing section  acquires the event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d in step ST and a first one of the event notices \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d in step ST, of . Then, in step ST, it generates auxiliary information by relating the chapter 1 to the reproducing position information indicating the beginning of the chapter 1, based on these event notices received in steps ST and ST. In step ST, the generated auxiliary information is stored in the information storage section .","Thereafter, the control processing section  acquires reproducing position information based on a later-supplied event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d in step ST, and then reads the auxiliary information from the information storage section  in step ST.","When going to step ST from step ST, the control processing section  determines whether or not the user has manipulated to issue the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command. If not, the control processing section  loops back to step ST. Otherwise, it goes to step ST. Thus, when the operation to issue the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command is not performed, the control processing section  generates new auxiliary information upon start of reproducing a chapter, for storage in the information storage section . For example, at a time t at which reproduction of a chapter 2 is started, auxiliary information is generated based on the corresponding event notices \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d and \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d.","Then, when operation is performed to issue the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command at a time t at which the chapter 2 is being reproduced, the control processing section  goes to step ST to determine whether or not a predetermined time TB has elapsed from the beginning of the chapter being reproduced, based on the position information indicated by the read auxiliary information and reproducing position information indicated by a later-supplied event notice \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d. If a value obtained by subtracting the position information indicated by the auxiliary information from the reproducing position information indicated by the later-supplied event notice is smaller than the predetermined time TB, then the control processing section  goes to step ST, where it sets a parameter to a \u201ccurrent chapter number\u20141\u201d and then goes to step ST. In step ST, it supplies the drive unit  with a \u201cPlayChapter(parameter)\u201d command for reproducing a chapter set by the parameter. Thus, when the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command is supplied before the lapse of the predetermined time TB from the beginning of the chapter 2, the reproducing position is moved back to the beginning of one chapter before, which is the chapter 1, to start reproducing the chapter 1 at a time t.","On the other hand, when operation is performed to issue the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command at a time t at which the predetermined time TB has elapsed from the beginning of the chapter 2, the control processing section  goes from step ST to step ST, and, knowing that the predetermined time TB has already elapsed, it further goes to step ST to set the parameter to a \u201ccurrent chapter number\u201d. In step ST, the section  supplies the \u201cPlayChapter(parameter)\u201d command for reproducing a chapter set by the parameter, to the drive unit . Thus, when the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command is supplied after the lapse of the predetermined time TB from the beginning of the chapter 2, the reproducing position is moved back to the beginning of the chapter 2 being reproduced, to start reproducing the chapter 2 at a time t.","In this way, when the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command is instructed, the jumping destination is changed according to the time elapsed from the beginning of a chapter being reproduced, whereby the function of the \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command can be expanded.","Alternatively, the reproduction controller  may be implemented by a computer system. In that case, the driver section  is replaced with a device driver, and the reproduced signal processing section  with an API (Application Programming Interface) for multi-media applications. Also, the operation of the control processing section  is implemented by application software. In this way, if the reproduction controller  is implemented by a computer system, the application software is used to perform the processing shown in , whereby the skip function can be performed and the functions of predetermined commands can be expanded.","In the above embodiment, the auxiliary information is generated by relating a chapter to reproducing position information related to the beginning of the chapter, based on the event notices \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d and \u201cEC_DVD_CURRENT_HMSF_TIME\u201d. However, the event notice related to reproducing operation is not limited to the \u201cEC_DVD_CHAPTER_START\u201d notice. For example, DVD-Video standards are designed to include a maximum of 99 titles and allow each title to be divided into a maximum of 999 logical chapters. Thus, as auxiliary information indicating a relationship between a content block constituting content and its position, auxiliary information may be generated in which a title is associated to reproducing position information, based on an event notice, for example, \u201cEC_DVD_TITLE_CHANGE\u201d indicating that title numbers are changed. In addition, event notices related to reproducing operation, such as \u201cEC_DVD_STILL_ON\u201d and \u201cEC_DVD_STILL_OFF\u201d indicating the start and end of \u201cstill\u201d mode may also be generated as the auxiliary information.","Furthermore, the information storage section  sequentially stores auxiliary information generated based on event notices related to content reproducing operation and event notices indicating reproducing position information, and thus besides the above-mentioned skip function and expanded \u201cPlayPrevChapter\u201d command function, a variety of reproducing operations including, for example, jumping to a desired position even some chapters before, can be performed.","Furthermore, the above embodiment discusses only reproduction of DVD-Video compatible content in detail. However, the above embodiment may also be applicable to reproduction of content recorded on other types of recording media such as optical discs and magnetic tapes, as long as these media can acquire the first event notice related to reproducing operation and the second event notices indicating reproducing position information, regarding content recorded thereon.","Although the invention having been described hereinabove in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularity, other changes, variations, combinations and sub-combinations are possible therein. It is therefore to be understood that any modifications will be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of the presently exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
