title: System and method for creating and managing object credentials for multiple applications
abstract: A method includes storing a credential object for a user to an encrypted silo on an information handling system. The credential object operates to authenticate the user to use an application. The method also includes copying the encrypted silo from the information handling system to a second information handling system, retrieving at the second information handling system the credential object from the copy of the encrypted silo, and authenticating the user to use the application on the second information handling system using the credential object.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally information handling systems, and more particularly relates to creating and managing object credentials for multiple applications.","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and\/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software resources that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","The following description in combination with the Figures is provided to assist in understanding the teachings disclosed herein. The following discussion will focus on specific implementations and embodiments of the teachings. This focus is provided to assist in describing the teachings, and should not be interpreted as a limitation on the scope or applicability of the teachings. However, other teachings can certainly be used in this application. The teachings can also be used in other applications, and with several different types of architectures, such as distributed computing architectures, client\/server architectures, or middleware server architectures and associated resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100","100","100","100"]},"Information handling system  includes an application , an authentication module , an application programming interface (API) , biometric modules  and , biometric sensors  and , and a provincial silo . Application  is connected to authentication module . Authentication module  includes a log-in service  and a biometric service , and is connected to biometric modules  and . API  is connected to authentication module , to biometric modules  and , and to provincial silo . Biometric module  is connected to biometric sensor , and biometric module  is connected to biometric sensor . Biometric sensor  includes a biometric template .","Application  represents one or more services or programs that provide functionality for information handling system . For example, application  can represent the functionality of an operating system (OS) instantiated on information handling system , background services of the OS, application programs running on the information handling system, other program software or code operating on the information handling system, or a combination thereof. Access to the functionality of application  can be restricted or limited to authorized users or services. For example, where application  seeks to access an external network, access to the external network can be blocked unless information handling system  has been logged on to the external network. Here, application  accesses log-in service  to prompt a user for log in credentials, such as a user name and a password, and the log-in service verifies that the user name represents a valid user, and that the password matches that of the user. In a particular embodiment, log-in service  operates to compare user provided log in credentials with valid user credentials in a credential repository. For example, log-in service  can provide a prompt to a user to provide the user's log in credentials, and the log-in service can query the credential repository to determine if the provided user credentials are valid. In another embodiment, log-in service  operates to store the log in credentials, and to automatically provide the log in credentials upon request. For example, once a user has logged onto information handling system , then subsequent acts of logging the user in to a database, a network, or the like, can be performed by log-in service  without intervention of the user.","In another example, a user can be restricted or have access to limited functionality of application  until a biometric authentication of the user is completed. Here, application  accesses biometric service  to prompt a user to provide a biometric signature to one or more of biometric sensors  and , such as a finger print scan, a retinal scan, a DNA scan or another biometric identifier of the user, and the biometric service verifies that the user is a valid user of information handling system . Biometric service  operates to compare user provided biometric information with a valid biometric template from a biometric template repository. Here, biometric service  provides a prompt to a user to provide a biometric input to biometric sensor , and the biometric sensor scans the user's biometric information to provide a biometric template associated with the information to biometric module . Biometric service  then compares the received biometric template from the user with the valid templates in the template repository to determine if the user is a valid user. If so, the user is authenticated onto information handling system  and is given access to the functionality of application .","Biometric service  also operates to receive the results of a comparison between user provided biometric information and a valid biometric template from a biometric sensor . Here, biometric service  provides a prompt to a user to provide a biometric input to biometric sensor , and the biometric sensor scans the user's biometric information to provide a biometric template associated with the information. In this case, biometric sensor  includes a NVRAM that includes one or more valid biometric templates  that are compared to the scanned biometric information, and the biometric sensor determines if the user is a valid user. Biometric sensor  then provides an indication as to whether or not the user is a valid user to biometric module  to authenticate the user onto information handling system .","API  operates to provide extensions in the interfaces between authentication module  and biometric modules  and , such that authentication credentials for various users of information handling system  and application  are securely stored and maintained on provincial silo . Thus, in a particular embodiment, when a user seeks to access application , log-in service  prompts the user for the user's log in credentials, provides a request to API  to search provincial silo  for the user and an associated password, and compares to user provided credentials with the search results to determine if the user is authenticated to use application . Further, when application  seeks to access an external network, log-in service  provides a request to API  to query provincial silo  to provide the user's log in credentials to the external network.","Further, API  operates to provide a biometric template repository for users of information handling system . Here, biometric service  prompts a user to provide a biometric signature to one or more of biometric sensors  and , and the biometric service compares the user provided biometric information with the valid biometric templates in provincial silo . Here, biometric sensor  scans the user's biometric information to provide a biometric template associated with the information to biometric module , and biometric service  compares the received biometric template from the user with the valid templates in provincial silo  to determine if the user is a valid user. Where biometric service  operates to receive the results of a comparison between user provided biometric information and a valid biometric template from a biometric sensor , API  operates to determine a pointer to the valid biometric template .","Provincial silo  operates as a container for securely holding the authentication objects that are passed between application , authentication module , biometric modules  and , and other elements of information handling system , such as an external network or the like. As such, API  includes encryption utilities to securely store provincial silo  on a system memory of information handling system . For example, provincial silo  can reside on an encrypted storage device, or can represent an encrypted file stored in a non-encrypted storage device. As such, provincial silo  can be stored in a NVRAM or system memory of information handling system , on a disk drive or solid state drive of the information handling system, on a network storage device, or another storage device, as needed or desired. Provincial silo  also stores authentication objects for multiple applications similar to application , and for multiple users, and provides policy objects for the multiple applications and users.","Provincial silo  includes application identifier objects , user identifier objects , application policy objects , user policy objects , user application associations , username objects , password objects , user biometric template objects , and user biometric template pointer objects . Application identifier  represents one or more objects associated with each application that utilizes provincial silo . User identifier  represents one or more objects associate with each user that is authorized to access the applications identified by application identifier . Application identifier  and user identifier  are each associated with a unique identifier such as a Globally Unique IDentifer (GUID). Application policy object  represents an association between application identifier  and the authentication activities that are utilized to authorize access to the application. For example, a particular application may be associated with a user log in credential, a finger print scan, and a retinal scan, while another application may be associated with only a user log in. Similarly, user policy object  represents an association between user identifier  and the authentication activities that are utilized to authenticate the user. Here a particular user may be authenticated by only log in credentials, while another user may be authenticated by log in credentials and a finger print scan.","User application associations  represent an association between application identifier  and user identifier . As such, each user is associated with one or more applications that the user is authorized to access. Username object  and password object  represent associations between user identifier  and a user name and password for the user. Username object  and password object  can be used within provincial silo  as log in credential repository items, to check the validity of a log in attempt by a user, and, after the user is successfully authenticated, the username and password objects can be provided on behalf of the user to authenticate the user onto other services of information handling system , such as to log onto an external network.","User biometric template object  represents a biometric scan template associated with user identifier . As such, when a user provides biometric information to biometric sensor , provincial silo  operates as the biometric template repository, and the provided biometric information is compared with one or more user biometric template objects to authenticate the user. User biometric template pointer object  represents a pointer to biometric template  that is associated with user identifier . Thus, when a user provides biometric information to biometric sensor , user biometric template pointer  operates to redirect the authentication of the user to the biometric sensor to find the biometric template. In this way, authentication module  can perform a common set of steps for biometric authentication, regardless of whether the sensor provides the biometric template for comparison, as is the case with biometric sensor , or if the sensor performs the comparison, as is the case with biometric sensor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["180","200","200","250","200","250"]},"By providing data trees  and , provincial silo  permits the secure portability of the credential information between information handling systems. Here, because provincial silo  is encrypted, a file that includes the provincial silo can be managed as needed or desired. For example, a new employee can create log in credentials and can provide biometric scans at the time of hiring, and a provincial silo for the employee can be created that associates the employee with the applications needed by the employee. The provincial silo can be provided to the employee on, for example, a USB thumb drive. Then, when the employee arrives at a designated information handling system, the file associated with the provincial silo can be loaded onto the information handling system and the employee can log in and use the information handling system. Further, when an employee no longer needs access to the information handling system, the provincial silo can be managed such that all associations with the employee are deleted from the provincial silo. Also, the employee can remove the provincial silo from the information handling system and transport it to a different information handling system, thereby transferring the employee's authentication credentials to the new information handling system.","The functionality of provincial silo  is enabled based upon the extensions of API  that permit the creation, deletion, and manipulation of the data included in the provincial silo.  illustrate flowcharts of exemplary embodiments of the functions that are available to be performed with a provincial silo similar to provincial silo .  illustrates a method for an application to request a user GUID, starting at block .
