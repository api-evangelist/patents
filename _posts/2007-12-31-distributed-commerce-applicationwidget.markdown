No. 60\/912,077 filed Apr. 16, 2007 (\u201cPUBLICATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM\u201d), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of algorithms and programming and, in one specific example, the use of widgets to implement a distributed commerce and viral marketing regime.","Software applications may be executed within the context of other software applications to perform certain predefined functions. For example, a software application written in JavaScript may be executed within the context of a web browser to provide a user of the web browser a richer and dynamic viewing experience. This richer and dynamic viewing experience may be used to sell good and services.","A system and method for using widgets to facilitate distributed commerce are illustrated. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of some embodiments. It may be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that some embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.","In some example embodiments, a system and method are shown that facilitate distributed commerce and\/or viral marketing through the use of widgets embedded in web pages. These web pages may be associated with social networking web sites or web sites transacting commerce. These widgets may be used to sell good or services.","In some example embodiments, a widget may be a portable piece of code that can be installed and executed within any separate eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and\/or Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) based web page. Widgets may be implemented using technology and programming techniques that includes Dynamic HTML (DHTML), Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), FLASH\u2122, a Java applet or some other suitable technology.","In some example embodiments, a widget may be an interface element that is part of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Examples of this type of widget may include a button, scroll bar, any object appearing in a GUI that may be executed using an input device (e.g., a mouse, light pen, keyboard or touch screen). Further, combinations of objects appearing in a GUI may form a widget. Technologies and techniques used to implement a widget may include Java, C++, C#, Visual Basic or some other suitable programming language.","Some example embodiments may include, a system and method to facilitate distributed commerce. Distributed commerce may include distributing widgets in the form of widget code to various users for placement into web pages operated or managed by users of the web pages. These widgets may track a good or service for sale, and\/or allow a person (e.g., a natural person or legal entity) to purchase the good or service using the widget.","In some example cases, viral marketing may be used to distribute these widgets. Viral marketing may include allowing persons to freely distribute and use widget code, and to be compensated for the this distribution and use. In one example embodiment, a user may retrieve widget code from a commerce server or a social networking server (e.g., an originating server), and then implement this widget code. This widget code may be implemented on a commerce server or social networking server that is distinct from the originating server. Once this widget code is implemented, the user may be compensated monetarily for this use (e.g., widget use) based upon, for example, page views of the good or service for sale as advertised by the widget, click throughs using the widget, bids using the widget, or some other suitable basis to count the usage of the widget.","In some example embodiments, the widget use is tracked based upon ID values associated with the widget itself (e.g., a widget ID), the user of the widget (e.g., a user ID), a buyer of the good or service advertised by the widget (e.g., buyer ID), or some other suitable basis to track widget use. These ID values may be Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) value that may serve to distinguish these ID from one another and other values. A GUID may be a 16 byte number that may be hexadecimal, decimal or binary in form. In some example embodiments, a number of some other suitable length may be used. As used herein ID may GUID may be considered to be interchangeable.","Example System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","107","109","107","102","107","102","103","104","105","106","101","107","109","109","110","110","110","109","108","109","110","111","111"]},"In some example embodiments, once the commerce server  retrieves item data from the item data store , the commerce server  may transmit a widget code request  to a widget server . This item data may be in the form of a web page (e.g., an item page) advertising a good or service for sale. This widget server  may generate widget code  to accompany the item data. This widget code  may be sent to the commerce server  in response to the widget code request . This widget code  may then be combined with an item page to form an item page with widget code . This item page with widget code  may be sent back across the network  to be displayed on the web interface . The widget server  may use any one of a number of the above references technologies and techniques to generate the widget code .","In some example embodiments, the widget code request  includes item data and code type data. Item data may include data relating to how a web page upon which the widget is to appear is to be formatted. For example, the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) information for a web page may be included in the item data. The code type data may include identifiers used to identify the technology and techniques to be used to generate a widget.","In some example embodiments, once the item page with widget code  is received and displayed as a part of the web interface , the user  may retrieve his or her social networking page from a social networking server . This social networking page may be a web page. In some example embodiments, the user  may retrieve a web page from some other type of server used to transact commerce. In some example embodiments, the user  may retrieve a social networking page  and display this social networking page  as a part of a web browser, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), an HTML editor, or as part of some other suitable application. The user  may extract the widget code from the item page with widget code , and paste the widget code into the social networking page to generate a social networking page with widget . In some example embodiments, this process of extracting the widget code from item page with widget code  and inserting or pasting into the social networking page with widget  may be automated. Automation may include the user  not engaging in any direct action to extract the widget code and insert it into a social networking page. Rather this process is automatically (e.g., the widget code is automatically inserted) executed by a computer system. This social networking page with widget  may then be transmitted across the network  by the user  utilizing the web interface  to be received by the social networking server . The social networking server  may store this social networking page with widget  into a user page data  database. Additionally, the social networking server  may post or otherwise display for others to review the social networking page with widget .","Some example embodiments may include the item page with widget code  that also includes a distribution menu. This distribution menu may identify certain web sites including social networking sites or other commercial sites that transact in good or services to which the widget code may be posted. When executed using an input device, a menu selection may prompt the user  with a login associated with a selected web site (e.g., a social networking site or other commercial site). In some example embodiments, HTTP or Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) over a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) may be used to facilitate the login process. Where login is successful, widget code may be directly inserted into the user 's web page associated with the web site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","101","107","101","107","201","110","201","107","101","201","209","209","101","108","110","110","110","201","202","203","206","202","203","206"]},"In some example embodiments, the commerce server  may create a TCP\/IP connection with a social networking server , a social networking server , and a social networking server . In some example embodiments, HTTP, HTTPS, or a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) session may be established between the commerce server  and each of the social networking servers , , and . Once this HTTP, HTTPS or FTP session is established between the commerce server  and each of the social networking servers (e.g., ,  and ) the commerce server  may transmit widget code for a page , widget code for page , and widget code for page  across the network  to separate social networking servers. For example, the widget code for page  may be transmitted across the network  to be received and posted by the social networking server . The widget code for page  may be transmitted across the network  to be received by and posted by the social networking server . Additionally, the widget code for page  may be transmitted across the network  to be received by and posted by the social networking server . The widget code for page  may be stored into the user page data  data base using SQL or MDX. The widget code for page  may be stored into the user page data  data base using SQL or MDX. The widget code for page  may be stored into the user page data  database using SQL or MDX. This process for generating widget code and posting it to a plurality of social networking servers will be illustrated below more fully.","Some example embodiments may include the item page with widget code  including a share button. This share button, when executed using an input device, may generate a prompt asking the user  where they would like to embed the widget code (e.g., what web page associated with what web site and servers associated with the web site). Where a web site is selected, the user  may be prompted with a login associated with this web site. In some example embodiments, HTTP, HTTPS or FTP over TCP\/IP may be used to facilitate the login process. Where login is successful, widget code may be directly inserted into the user 's web page associated with the web site. This insertion process may not involve user .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","301","307","307","302","302","303","304","305","306","307","301","310","310","310","307","301","108","310","110","110","310","320","311","320","320","320","312","110","312","301"]},"In some example embodiments, the commerce server  and security server  may be connected via an internet, a LAN or a WAN (not pictured). The verification process to verify IDs may be executed by the security server  or may occur as a part of the commerce server . Once some type of authentication occurs, the commerce server  may send an authentication confirmation  back across the network  to be received by the buyer . Once the authentication confirmation  is received by the buyer , a complete purchase  command may be generated and sent back across the network  to be received by the commerce server , thereby concluding the purchase of an item advertised by the widget appearing on the social networking page.","In some example embodiments, the initial generation of the item purchased with the request ID  may be facilitated by, for example, the buyer  generating and transmitting across the network , a social networking page request . In response, the social networking server  may retrieve the requested social networking page from the user data  database. A widget may be associated with the requested social networking page so as to generate a social networking page with widget . This social networking page with widget  may be transmitted by the social network server  back across the network  to be displayed within the web interface .

For example, buyer  may execute a button on a widget to purchase a good or service. Once this button is executed, the widget may establish an HTTP, or HTTPS over TCP\/IP connection with the commerce server . The buyer  may be prompted to provide a user ID (e.g., a buyer ID). The buyer  may be prompted to identify an image in some examples. Where the user ID and image are successfully identified, the buyer  may be prompted to enter a widget password. Where all or some of the IDs and passwords are valid, the buyer  may be prompted with a complete purchase page that, when executed (e.g., a button residing on the page is executed), generates a complete purchase signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","101","503","517","101","503","501","101","517","501","501","101","503","503","119","509","503","503","517","119","514","503","517","503","517","119","503","517","503","517","503","517","101","509","504","505","506","507","508","515","510","511","512","513","514"]},"Some example embodiments may include the user  receiving some type of credit or other monetary compensation for the user  and  becoming affiliates of the user . For example, each time the widget code existing as a part of social networking page with widget  is copied, or otherwise utilized by the user  or user , the user  may receive some type of credit or other monetary compensation. Further, each time the widget code, existing as a part of the social networking page with widget , is viewed, clicked, on or otherwise activated, the user  may also receive credit or monetary compensation. Additionally, in some example embodiments, every time the copied widget code with ID  is activated by some user, the user  receives credit or other monetary compensation such that the more users that utilize the copied widget code with ID , the more credit or other monetary compensation the user  receives.","In some example embodiments, the ID value associated with a widget is used to track the viral distribution of a widget from its originating source. For example, each time a widget is copied and activated, a signal is sent to the commerce server  informing the commerce server  of the activation of the widget. This tracking of the viral distribution may be facilitated through the establishment of a TCP\/IP connection between the widget and the commerce server , wherein the commerce server  is updated as to the activities of the widget. Widget activity or activation may include, as referenced elsewhere, clicks, bids, views, purchases, copying or any other suitable activity. Further, the widget may also receive item updates as to changes in the item being advertised by the widget. Users or sites maintaining the server(s) upon which the web page including the widget resides may receive credit or monetary compensation for the widget activity.","Some example embodiments may include the selling of items using a widget. For example, a widget may be posted on a web page. This widget may be a selling widget such that the widget may facilitate the posting of goods or services for sale on the commerce server . In one example embodiment, a selling widget is executed so as to posted goods or services for sale on a commerce server . Once executed, the user  is prompted with a login for the commerce server . The user  may then be prompted with a security confirmation image. Further, the user  may be prompted with a password for a widget. Where one or more of the login, security confirmation image, or password for the widget is successfully provided, the user  may be prompted to provide details relating to the good or service for purchase. These item details, when entered, may then be posted along with the other item data for the good or service being sold. Further, these details may also be stored into the item data store . Item details may include: seller contact information, selling price information, condition of item information, time of same information, lowest bid price information, or some other suitable information.","Example Interface and Widget Code",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["115","115","601"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["114","114","114","701","702","114","601"]},"In some example embodiments, other example widget code may be implemented.

Some embodiments may include a first tier as an interface (e.g., an interface tier) that is relatively free of application processing. Further, a second tier may be a logic tier that performs application processing in the form of logical\/mathematical manipulations of data inputted through the interface level, and communicates the results of these logical\/mathematical manipulations to the interface tier, and\/or to a backend, or storage, tier. These logical\/mathematical manipulations may relate to certain business rules, or processes that govern the software application as a whole. A third, storage tier, may be a persistent storage medium or, non-persistent storage medium. In some cases, one or more of these tiers may be collapsed into another, resulting in a two-tier architecture, or even a one-tier architecture. For example, the interface and logic tiers may be consolidated, or the logic and storage tiers may be consolidated, as in the case of a software application with an embedded database. This three-tier architecture may be implemented using one technology, or, as will be discussed below, a variety of technologies. This three-tier architecture, and the technologies through which it is implemented, may be executed on two or more computer systems organized in a server-client, peer to peer, or some other suitable configuration. Further, these three tiers may be distributed between more than one computer system as various software components.","Component Design","Some example embodiments may include the above illustrated tiers, and processes or operations that make them up, as being written as one or more software components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate data. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components may be implemented by a computer system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Java Enterprise Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), or other suitable technique. These components may be linked to other components via various Application Programming interfaces (APIs), and then compiled into one complete server, client, and\/or peer software application. Further, these APIs may be able to communicate through various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above illustrated components across a distributed programming environment as distributed computing components. For example, an interface component (e.g., an interface tier) may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system including a logic component (e.g., a logic tier). These first and second computer systems may be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. These various components may be written using the above illustrated object-oriented programming techniques, and can be written in the same programming language, or a different programming language. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, a component written in C++ may be able to communicate with another component written in the Java programming language through utilizing a distributed computing protocol such as a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or some other suitable protocol. Some embodiments may include the use of one or more of these protocols with the various protocols outlined in the OSI model or TCP\/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data.","A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client","Some embodiments may utilize the OSI model or TCP\/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three-tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also includes port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer and the data transmitted over a network such as an Internet, LAN, WAN, or some other suitable network. In some cases, Internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, and additionally ATM, SNA, SDI, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology), or structures.","A Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2400","102","2400"]},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory , and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
