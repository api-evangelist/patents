{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/595,975, titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF DETECTING, MEASURING, AND EXTRACTING SIGNATURES OF SIGNALS EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL MEDIA DATA STREAMS, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.","The epic growth of the social web has created rich data sources for predictive analytics. The enormous volume and diversity of information propagating amongst large user communities on micro-blogging platforms, Twitter in particular, and the emergence of social media data aggregation service providers such as GNIP, Topsy, and StockTwits, enable new, intriguing opportunities to leverage the information content embedded in social media. In addition to providing huge volumes of minable data for diverse commercial applications, social media sources enable real-time detection, surveillance, and estimates of social media signatures for events and entities, thus extending the transformation of these data beyond estimation of the social media \u201csentiment\u201d expressed for an entity.","The current practice of social media analytics has strongly focused on techniques to estimate the sentiment component of an entity's signature. These techniques employ methods from the discipline of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in varying degrees and complexity, to produce coarse grained sentiment estimates, oriented in terms of \u201cPositive\u201d, \u201cNegative\u201d, or \u201cNeutral\u201d for an entity. One disadvantage of coarse gained estimates is that they are highly sensitive to the thresholds selected to determine the entity's possible three state outcome. Further, such discrete estimates are not suitable to time series normalization techniques, which allow the detection of changes from an entity's normal sentiment levels or the comparison of one entity's sentiment level to another entity's level on a common measurement basis. The level of social media activity is also an important component of an entity's social media signature. Current analytic techniques estimate an entity's level or intensity of social media activity by counting the total number of \u201cmentions\u201d of the entity present in micro-blogging data streams observed during a time interval or converting the total to an average value observed over the interval. However, an activity metric driven solely by the total number of counts does not readily show significant deviations from the entity's normal level of social media activity, nor does such a representation allow for comparison of one entity's activity level to another entity's level on a common basis. An example from the domain of stock trading is Apple Inc., stock symbol AAPL, which is consistently the most frequently mentioned stock on Twitter. A comparison of the total number of tweets observed during a day for AAPL to the total number observed for a stock with less activity, such as Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), is not useful because tweet volumes for AAPL will always dominate, compared to CAT, over any observation interval.","In one aspect of the present invention, certain disadvantages of known techniques may be remedied by measuring an entity's sentiment on a continuous, normalized scale, enabling entity-to-entity comparisons and detection of changes in an entity's sentiment level relative to a sentiment universe, such as a broad market sentiment index or a market sector sentiment index as an example drawn from the financial markets and trading application domain. In another aspect of the present invention, certain disadvantages of known techniques may be remedied by expressing a stock ticker's level of social media activity on a continuous, normalized scale, enabling the direct comparison to other stocks, using a common metric, and the detection of significant changes of the stock ticker's activity level relative to the constituents of a market sector or broad market index.","In one example, a system for scoring micro-blogging messages includes a private infrastructure and a public infrastructure. The private infrastructure includes an extractor, and evaluator, a calculator, and a publisher. The extractor may be configured to receive micro-blogging messages via an application programming interface of at least one micro-blogging source, to access a set of terms of interest, to detect received micro-blogging messages having least one of the terms of interest, to extract raw data from the micro-blogging messages, and to store the extracted raw data in a private database, the extracted raw data including at least a posting account, a posting time, and message contents.","The evaluator may be configured to access the stored raw data, to parse the stored raw data into tokenized data, and to store the tokenized data in the private database. The evaluator may also be configured to detect terms of interest mentioned in the tokenized data to identify relevant micro-blogging messages, to tag in the private database micro-blogging messages that contain a term of interest as being relevant to that term of interest, and using a posting account of a micro-blogging message to tag the micro-blogging message as indicative. Micro-blogging messages may be filtered to exclude micro-blogging messages from low-volume or malicious sources before the remaining messages are tagged as indicative. The evaluator may also be configured to eliminate duplicate micro-blogging messages.","The calculator may be configured to access a sentiment dictionary and to access the stored tokenized data of micro-blogging messages tagged as indicative. The calculator may be further configured to calculate a sentiment score based on sentiment values of words and phrases in the tokenized data for micro-blogging messages tagged as indicative, and to calculate a vector of sentiment metrics for a term of interest based on the sentiment scores associated with the term of interest and falling within a predetermined lookback period, the calculator further configured to store the vector of sentiment metrics in the private database. The publisher may be configured to access the vectors of sentiment metrics corresponding to a plurality of micro-blogging messages and to provide access to the vectors of sentiment metrics.","The public infrastructure may include a public database, the public database being populated with vectors of sentiment metrics from the publisher and providing access to the sentiment metric to clients of the system for scoring micro-blogging messages.","In one example, the vector of sentiment metrics comprises at least a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period, a smoothed weighted average of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period, a volume of indicative micro-blogging messages, and a change in volume of indicative micro-blogging messages relative to the average volume level of relevant micro-blogging messages. In another example, the vector of sentiment metrics comprises at least a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period and a measure of diversity of posting accounts contributing to the sentiment time series score. In another example, the vector of sentiment metrics comprises at least a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period and a measure of the change in sentiment volume relative to the average level observed for a sentiment Universe.","The vector of sentiment metrics may further comprise a plurality of vectors of sentiment metrics, wherein each vector represents sentiment metrics calculated periodically according a predetermined calculation interval. In one example, the calculation interval is 15 minutes and the lookback period is a number of days.","In another example, a system for scoring micro-blogging messages may be implemented in a relational database having a term table, a message table, a digest table, a digest score table and a sentiment dictionary. The system may also include an extractor, an evaluator, and a calculator.","The term table includes a set of tennis of interest, such as but not limited to stock ticker symbols. The extractor, may be configured to receive micro-blogging messages via an application programming interface of at least one micro-blogging source, to detect received micro-blogging messages having least one of the terms of interest, to extract raw data from the micro-blogging messages, and to store the extracted raw data in a message table in the database, the extracted raw data including at least a posting account, a posting time, and message contents.","The evaluator may be configured to access the stored raw data in the message table, to parse the stored raw data into tokenized data, to store the tokenized data in a digest table, to detect terms of interest mentioned in the tokenized data, to analyze the raw data for indications of relevance, and to flag indicative micro-blogging messages in a digest score table.","The sentiment dictionary may include sentiment values associated with words and phrases commonly expressed in relevant micro-blogging messages. The sentiment dictionary may be included with the calculator.","The calculator may be configured to access a sentiment dictionary and to access the stored digest score table. The calculator may be further configured to calculate a sentiment score based on sentiment values of words and phrases in the tokenized data for micro-blogging messages tagged as indicative, and to calculate a vector of sentiment metrics for a term of interest based on the sentiment scores associated with the term of interest and falling within a predetermined lookback period. The calculator may be further configured to store the vector of sentiment metrics in a vector table. In one example, at least one of the sentiment metrics comprises a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score.","Various aspects of the invention disclosed in the examples provided herein relate generally to the field of social media analytics and specifically to the detection and measurement of the signature of terms of interest as expressed in social media data sources such as the micro-blogging platform, Twitter. One particularly advantageous domain of application is the financial markets and the entities are the stocks of companies of interest to financial market traders and investors. Various aspects of the invention provide a framework and methods to extract and interpret sentiment signatures for the stocks of companies as expressed in the Twitter messaging stream. This framework can be extended and adapted to other application domains, such as media, marketing, and healthcare, where the expression of sentiment through social media is important. Throughout the description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","103","102","102","102","101","102","103"]},"The Public Infrastructure  maintains a relational database  of sentiment signature results and enables public client access  to real-time and historical sentiment signatures for stocks that are members of the Universe list.
