No. 60\/333,142, which was filed on Nov. 27, 2001. This patent application claims the Nov. 27, 2001 filing date of the above referenced provisional patent application, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the United States Government for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.","The present invention is related to electrochemical energy storage devices, which are based on non-aqueous electrolytes, such as high energy density batteries and\/or high power electrochemical capacitors. The present invention is also related to electrochemical storage devices, which are based on non-aqueous electrolytes that include lithium salt dissolved in a solvent system The present invention is additionally related to rechargeable lithium and\/or lithium ion batteries.","High voltage and high energy density rechargeable (or secondary) lithium batteries based on non-aqueous electrolytes are widely utilized in portable devices such as camcorders, notebook computers, and cell phones. This type of battery generally employs as a cathode, lithiated transition metal oxides such as LiCoO, LiNiO, LiMnO, and variations of previous oxides with dopants and a varying stoichiometry. Lithium metal, lithium alloys, and carbonaceous materials are candidates for use as anode materials for rechargeable lithium (ion) batteries. Note that as utilized herein, the term \u201cLi batteries\u201d generally can refer to batteries, which utilize a pure Li metal or alloy as an anode. Carbonaceous materials can be chosen over lithium metal and alloys as anode materials in commercial rechargeable batteries. This type of battery is referred to generally as \u201clithium battery\u201d or \u201cLi-ion battery\u201d because pure lithium is not present in the anode The Li ions can be intercalated into and de-intercalated out of carbon materials during the charging and discharging processes, respectively. The advantageous of carbonaceous anodes is that they do not possess problems associated with lithium dendrite growth on the anode, which often causes shorting of the cell.","Non-aqueous electrolytes utilized in state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries can be formed in the context of a mixed solvent system that generally includes cyclic ester compounds, such as, for example, ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), butylenes carbonate (BC), and \u03b3-butyrolactone (i.e., gamma-butyrolactone), chain esters such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), ethyl formate, methyl formate, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, and methyl butyrate. Such a solvent system can contain more than one cycle ester and more than one chain ester. Cyclic esters are chemically and physically stable and possess a high dielectric constant, which is generally required for their ability to dissolve salts. The chain esters are also chemically and physically stable and possess a low dielectric constant and low viscosity, which is needed to increase the mobility of lithium ions in the electrolytes. The electrolyte solute utilized can be a lithium salt, such as, for example, lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF), lithium imide (LiN(SOCF)), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCFSO), lithium hexafluoroarsenate (LiAsF), lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF), and lithium bis(oxalato) borate (LiBOB). The preferred salt for the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries is LiPF.","To improve low temperature performance, a ternary or quaternary solvent mixture containing cyclic carbonate with a high linear carbonate content can be utilized, as reported by Smart et al and Plichta et al. Refer to Smart et al., \u201cImproved Low Temperature Performance of Lithium Ion Cells with Low Ethylene Carbonate (EC) Content Electrolytes,\u201d Meeting Abstract, 20001 Joint International Meeting in Electrochemistry, Vol. 2001-2, San Francisco, Calif., 2-7 Sep. 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, refer to Plichta et al., \u201cLow Temperature Electrolyte for Lithium and Lithium Ion Batteries,\u201d Proc. 38Power Sources Conference, pg 444, Cherry Hill, N.J., 8-11, June 1998, which is also incorporated herein by reference This approach is based on a low melting point and a low viscosity of the linear carbonates. Utilizing this same approach, solvents of low viscosity such as methyl acetate and methyl butyrate can also be added to improve low temperature performance.","Additionally, aliphatic carboxylate, such as methyl propionate and ethyl propionate can also be utilized to improve a low temperature performance For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,862, \u201cNonaqueous Electrolyte Secondary Batteries,\u201d which issued to Okuno et al on Dec. 12, 1995, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,443, \u201cNon-Aqueous Secondary Electrochemical Battery\u201d, which issued to Okuno et al on Jun. 11, 1996, indicate that methyl propionate and ethyl propionate can also be utilized to improve a low temperature performance. U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,862 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,443 are incorporated herein by reference. Disadvantages of such solvents include their high vapor pressure at elevated temperatures and their low dielectric constant, which restricts the ability of the solvents to dissociate salt. Li and Li-ion cells with such electrolytes typically will encounter large internal pressure when operated at elevated temperatures and under high rate discharge conditions. The lower temperature performance is not necessarily optimized utilizing electrolytes of this nature because the lithium transport number is likely to be low.","Batteries with solid-state electrolytes including polymer electrolytes are safer because they experience less pressure build-up through solvent vapor at elevated temperatures. Their poor conductivities, however, limit their application to a high temperature end. To improve solid-state polymer electrolytes for higher performance, a gel electrolyte, or a homogeneous hybrid film of polymer, salt, and plasticizers, which function as a low molecular weight polar solvent, have been utilized. For example, such a configuration is described by F. M Gray, \u201cPolymer Electrolyte Reviews\u20141,\u201d pp. 141-149, Elsevier Applied Science Publishers Ltd., New York, N.Y. 1987, which is incorporated herein by reference. Polar plasticizers include propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), \u03b3-butyrolactone (\u03b3BL), 1-methyl-2pyrrolidinone (NMP), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).","To further improve the conductivity of the gel electrolyte, solvents with low dielectric constants and low viscosities, such as diethyl carbonate (DEC) have been utilized as a major component (e.g., over 70%). Such a solvent is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,717, \u201cElectrolyte Composition for Rechargeable Electrochemical Cells,\u201d which issued to Pendalwar et al on Jun. 1, 1999. U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,717 is incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,717 discloses an electrochemical cell that includes first and second electrodes and an electrolyte system disposed therebetween. The electrolyte system includes a polymeric support structure through which is dispersed an electrolyte active species in an organic solvent. The solvent, which remains liquid to low temperatures, is a binary or higher order system comprising diethyl carbonate and one or more of propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, dipropylcarbonate, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and combinations thereof.","Among the lactam compounds, NMP can also be utilized as a complexing agent or a plasticising agent for fabricating solid-state polymeric and gel polymeric electrolytes utilizing a specific salt, such as alkali metal triflate (or trifluoromethanesulfonate) salt. Such a use of NMP is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,096, \u201cSolid State Polymeric Electrolyte for Electrochemical Devices,\u201d which issued to Stephen F. Hope on Feb. 15, 2000, and is incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,096 discloses a solid state polymeric electrolyte, which is formed by complexing an alkaline metal triflate salt and polyethylene oxide with an ester and an ether or a pyrrolidinone and an ether, or two ethers of different boiling points as co-solvents to form a solid or semi-solid state electrolyte.","NMP is commonly utilized as a solvent for dissolving polyvinylidene fluoride binder. Mixing the binder solution with active electrode material, such as lithiated transition metal oxides for positive electrode or carbonaceous materials for negative electrode and conductive diluents, can form a slurry thereof. Such a slurry can then be coated on a metal substrate and the NMP removed later by heating under reduced pressure. Such a method is commonly utilized in lithium battery industrial processes for fabricating coated electrodes on current collectors An example of such a method is described by DA. Stevens and J. R. Dahn, \u201cThe Mechanisms of Lithium and Sodium Insertion in Carbon Materials,\u201d J. Electrochem. Soc, 148(8), A803 (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference","NMP can also be utilized as a solvent of choice for the preparation of electro conductive polymer composite electrodes for use in secondary batteries as a positive electrode. An electro conductive polymer such as polyaniline and the polymer electrolyte, which can be composed of, for example, LiClOand polyvinyl alcohol or polyalkylene oxide, can be dissolved in NMP to form a solution thereof The resulting solution can then be cast on a current collector and the solvent later removed and a film electrode formed thereof. Such a technique is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,454, \u201cElectroconductive Polymer Composites for Use in Secondary Batteries as Positive Electrode Materials,\u201d which issued on Jan. 26, 1999 to Chen et al, and which is incorporated herein by reference.","Other lactams utilized in industry include 1-methyl-piperidone and 1-methyl caprolactam, which are important monomers for synthetic fabrics. Lactams or solvents based on lactam structures are not utilized in liquid based electrolytes for Li-ion batteries.","The following summary of the invention is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention, and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the invention can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.","It is therefore one aspect of the present invention to provide an improved nonaqueous electrolyte system that includes a lithium salt dissolved in a solvent mixture formed from a lactam-based solvent, one or more cyclic esters, and\/or one or more chain esters.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an improved electrolyte system, which is physically, chemically and electrochemically stable with respect to anode, cathode and separator materials utilized in lithium and lithium ion cells, and which can maintain such stability over a wide temperature range.","It is still another aspect of the present invention to provide a nonaqueous electrolyte system that includes a lithium salt such as LiPFor LiBFsalt dissolved in a solvent system, which includes a lactam-based solvent, one or more cyclic esters and one or more chain esters having properties as described above.","It is yet a further aspect of the present invention to provide a lithium or lithium ion battery system employing the aforementioned non-aqueous electrolyte system, which is stable, possesses excellent capacity, capacity retention, and which is safe at elevated temperatures.","The above and other aspects can be achieved as is now described.

Ethylene carbonate and ethylmethyl carbonate (electrolyte grade) were mixed according to certain ratios and then subjected to a Karl-Fischer titration. The moisture content was below 10 ppm in all cases. N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) was added according to different desired weight percentages, in a range between 2% up to 90%. After thoroughly mixing, 1.0 modality of LiPFor LiBFwas added into the solvent mixture. The solution was shaken occasionally to accelerate the salt dissolution. Two electrolyte compositions of 1 m LiPFin EC:NMP:EMC (3:3:4 wt) and in EC:NMP:EMC (1:1:3 wt.) were used for illustrative purposes. The stability of the electrolyte solutions was then subject to various tests to demonstrate its advantage for use with an Li-ion battery.","Linear sweep voltammetry was used to determine the stability of Al in the electrolytes of Example 1.  depicts a graph too indicating the corrosion current as a function of voltage of an Al current collector in an electrolyte system that includes solvents of the present invention in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in , Al can be passivated in the potential range above 4.0 V (vs. Li\/Li) in the electrolyte of 1 m in LiPF6 in EC NMP EMC (3:3:4), and the anodic dissolution of Al is effectively suppressed in subsequent scans. Stabilization of Al ensures that the electrolytes formulated in this invention will withstand high charging voltages in Li and Li-ion cells.","Stability of the electrolyte solution of Example I was further tested against a commonly known lithiated manganese spinel cathode material using cyclic voltammetry.  illustrates a graph  depicting the oxidative stability of an electrolyte system that includes the solvents of the present invention with respect to a cathode in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in , the major decomposition of the NMP-containing electrolytes start at potentials above 4.6 V, well above the range where reversible intercalation chemistry of Li-ion occurs. This result proves that the electrolyte of the present invention can operate with high stability utilizing a lithiated manganese spinel cathode.","Stability of the electrolyte solution of Example I was further tested on the surface of a carbonaceous anode using cyclic voltammetry.  depicts graphs  and  illustrating the cycling of an anode composite coated on a Cu current collector in any electrolyte system comprising solvents of the present invention in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Note that the cycling of the anode composition coated on the Cu current collector is illustrated utilizing a cyclic voltammogram for the 1cycle at 0.01 mV\/s as indicated at graph  and a cyclic voltammogram for the 3 cycle at 0.001 mV\/s as indicated at graph . Also, as demonstrated by graphs  and  , no solvent decomposition of the NMP-containing electrolytes was detected while the reversible intercalation of Li-ion occurs. At a slower scan rate of 0.001 mV\/s, distinctively resolved graphite intercalation stages appeared. This result proves that the electrolyte of the present invention can operate in a stable manner utilizing a carbonaceous anode","The electrolyte solution (1.0 m LiPF3:3:4 EC\/NMP\/EMC) of Example I was incorporated in a full Li ion cell that uses the above cathode and anode to test its performance.  illustrates a graph  depicting the discharge capacity of an Li-ion full cell utilizing graphite as an anode, lithiated spinel as a cathode and the electrolyte of the present invention in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
