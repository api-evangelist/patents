In operation, the client computer  may execute a web browser and send a request or data to the firewall  over one of the one or more networks . The firewall  may be configured to verify that the client computer  is a trusted computer and that the request or data is of a permissible type to send to the web server . In an event that the firewall  determines that requests or data are of an impermissible type, the firewall  may block the requests or data from being forwarded to the web server . On the other hand, in an event that the firewall  determines that the requests or data are of a permissible type, the firewall  may forward the requests or data to the web server  over the network .","When the web server  receives requests or data from the client computer , the web server  may access a database in the first SQL server A to obtain data from the database or to store data into the database. In such a case, the web server  may be configured to form a SQL query to obtain data from the database, or to form one or more commands to insert or update data in the database at the first SQL server A. The web server  may send the queries or commands to first SQL server A through the firewall  and over the network  and the network A. The firewall  may be configured to verify that proper access is being made to the first SQL server A before sending the queries or commands over the network A.","In a case where the first SQL server A receives one or more commands to insert, update, modify, delete, or the like, data or tables in a database, the first SQL server A may be configured to carry out the commands. When there are two or more SQL servers A, B, the two or more SQL servers A, B, may be synchronized in real time to allow for redundancy in the system . For example, each time a database is changed in the first SQL server A, the change to the database may be backed-up on the second SQL server B by sending information regarding the change over the network . In some embodiments, the synchronization between the first SQL server A and the second SQL server B may allow for sending changes to the second SQL server B within seconds of the changes being made in the first SQL server A. Thus, in case of a failure of the first SQL server A, a back-up copy of the database is stored for use in the second SQL server B.","In a case where the first SQL server A receives a SQL query from the web server , the first SQL server A may be configured to access the relevant database and to provide data to the web server  in response to the SQL query. The data sent from the first SQL server A to the web server  passes over the network A, through the firewall , and over the network .

The log-in button  may be clicked by a user to start a log-in process in which the user name entered in the user name section , the password entered in the password section , and the company code entered in the company code section  are transmitted to the web server  for verification.","The web server  may be configured to execute a computer program upon receipt of the user name, password, and company code, to verify that the user name is a valid user name for a company specified by the company code, and to verify that the password is a valid password for the user name associated with the company code. In a case that the password is not a valid password, the web server  may send a web page to prompt a user for another password. In a case that the password is a valid password, then the web server  may allow access to the user. Thus, the web server  provides for password protection against unauthorized use by individuals.","The company code allows for specifying a company with which the user is associated. Many companies may each have an account for tracking incidents at facilities related to the company. In addition, different organizations within a company may be supplied unique company codes for accessing the web server . The web pages subsequently provided by the web server  after log-in may be customized based on the company code associated with the user, so that the types of incidents, reports, information, and the like, available to users may be customized for each company or organization. Thus, companies and organizations may capture and analyze particular information specially suited for their purposes.","Moreover, different users within each company or organization may have different access privileges to input or access particular information within the system . The web server  may be programmed, for example, to set the access privileges based on the user name specified in the log-in page  by referencing a table of privileges for users indexed by user name. Thus, there may be some secure areas and information that are protected or even hidden from users based on their access privileges. For example, in some embodiments, investigation information related to investigations for incidents may be hidden from some users that do not have appropriate access privileges.","Also, once a user has logged-in, the web server  may maintain a session timer that begins counting each time a user is idle and has not submitted information to or requested information from the web server  after logging-in.
