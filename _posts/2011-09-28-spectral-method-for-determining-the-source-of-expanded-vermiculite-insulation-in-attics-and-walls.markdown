No. 61\/387,685, entitled \u201cA Spectral Method for Determining the Source of Expanded Vermiculite Insulation in Attics and Walls,\u201d by Gregg A. Swayze et al., filed Sep. 29, 2010 in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon.","The present invention relates in general to a method for classifying the source of insulation and, in particular, to a method for determining the source of expanded vermiculite insulation used in attics and walls.","There are approximately 1 million homes in the United States that have expanded vermiculite attic insulation (U.S. EPA, 1985). Prior to 1990, there were four sources that produced most of the vermiculite ore used for attic insulation. Three of these are located in the United States in Enoree, S.C.; Louisa, Va.; and Libby, Mont. The fourth is located in Palabora, South Africa. Most of the vermiculite used for attic insulation originated from the Rainy Creek Igneous Complex near Libby, Mont., where fibrous amphiboles were a common mineral contaminant. Ore from the Libby mine supplied up to 80% of the world's vermiculite. The Libby mine closed in 1990.","Over the last decade, health studies in the town of Libby (Peipins et al., 2003; McDonald et al., 2004) and at expansion plants throughout the United States that processed ore from this location revealed a high rate of asbestos-related lung disease among people exposed to the fibrous amphibole potentially contained in the vermiculite insulation. Vermiculite from other commercial sources in the United States and South Africa apparently do not contain fibrous amphibole in significant quantities. There will be a growing demand for vermiculite insulation inspections and source identification as the public becomes aware of the potential health issues posed by exposure to fibrous amphiboles during home improvements or maintenance in areas insulated with vermiculite ore from the Libby mine, or of the liabilities of owning property containing this vermiculite.","Visually differentiating vermiculites according to their source locations can be difficult. Traditional methods used to determine the source of expanded vermiculite samples involve time-consuming laboratory analysis using microscopic, electron probe microanalysis, x-ray fluorescence, and x-ray methods. These methods involve collection of vermiculite samples from an attic or wall, transport of the potentially hazardous samples to an off-site laboratory, and subsequent analysis to detect amphibole fibers. The methods are costly and generate hazardous waste that must be disposed of properly. In addition, property owners typically get the results of their analyses a week or more after the samples are collected. Thus, improvements are desired in this art.","Given the large number of homes and businesses potentially requiring evaluation for the presence of vermiculite insulation from Libby, use of an in situ analytical method to differentiate among vermiculite sources can save time, eliminate the transport of potentially hazardous vermiculite samples, and reduce analysis costs.","While investigating the spectral properties of vermiculite ore from Libby, Mont., the inventors observed that ultraviolet-near infrared (UV-NIR) spectral examination of expanded vermiculite shows characteristic vibrational absorption features in the 1.4- and 2.3-micron regions that can be used to differentiate among vermiculite sources. These results indicated that portable field spectrometers can be used to make in situ reflectance measurements to determine the source of the vermiculite and to estimate the amount of potentially fibrous amphibole in expanded vermiculite. The inventors realized that spectrally identifying the source of vermiculite would help in evaluating the potential for asbestos contamination. Use of a spectral method for in situ measurement of asbestos contamination in attics and walls insulated with vermiculite would speed the evaluation process by avoiding potentially costly and time-consuming laboratory analysis.","The inventors conducted a study to determine if near-infrared reflectance spectra could be used to identify the source of the vermiculite ore. Spectra of 29 expanded vermiculite samples, including attic insulation, commercial packing material, and horticultural products, were measured with a portable field spectrometer. The sources of the vermiculite samples were distinguished based on differences in elemental composition as measured by electron probe microanalysis and collection location information. Reflectance spectra of the samples have absorptions that vary in wavelength position and relative intensity depending on composition, which allows determination of source and detection of potential amphibole, talc, and\/or serpentine contamination.","The resulting in situ spectral method developed by the inventors can be used to identify expanded vermiculite originating from Libby, Mont., which may contain potentially toxic amphibole fibers. Use of this spectral reflectance method for in situ identification of expanded vermiculite can speed the evaluation process by avoiding potentially costly and time-consuming collection of samples and their subsequent laboratory analyses. Reflectance spectra of expanded vermiculite can be measured using a portable spectrometer in situ in the field by a trained field technician. This method can be used to provide an immediate answer to property owners regarding the origin of their expanded vermiculite insulation. If their insulation is from the vermiculite mine in Libby, Mont., based on its mineral spectral signature, then it is likely contaminated with fibrous amphibole and may require remediation. This spectral identification method can also be used in a laboratory to determine the source of expanded vermiculite samples.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, there is provided a system and a method of identifying a source of a vermiculite sample in situ. The method includes determining compositional field boundaries for classes of source areas from spectral measurements of vermiculite materials of known origin, according to band depth ratios for absorption bands centered at 1.38 and 2.32 microns. Each source area class has a range of 1.38\/2.32-micron band depth ratios, including the following:","Class 1: 0.0000-0.0005,","Class 2: 0.0005-0.0106,","Class 3: 0.0106-0.0418,","Class 4: 0.0418-0.0657, and","Class 5: 0.0657-0.1200.","Next, a plurality of near infrared reflectance spectral measurements are obtained at a plurality of locations within a sample of unknown origin, and the spectral measurements are averaged. Band depths of the averaged spectral measurements are calculated for absorption bands centered at wavelengths of 1.38, 1.40, 1.42, 2.24, 2.32, and 2.38 microns. Band depth ratios are calculated for the 1.38- and 2.32-micron absorption bands (1.38\/2.32 ratio), the 2.24- and 2.38-micron absorption bands (2.24\/2.38 ratio), and the 1.40- and 1.42-micron absorption bands (1.40\/1.42 ratio). The source of the sample is identified by comparing the 1.38\/2.32 ratio of the sample to the range of 1.38\/2.32 ratios of each source area class to determine into which source area class the sample fits, yielding a classification result that is provided to a user.","The invention also includes a method of testing for the presence and levels of amphibole, talc, and\/or serpentine in the sample using the 1.40\/1.42-micron band depth ratios, verifying the identification of the source using the 2.24\/2.38-micron band depth ratios, and determining whether the identified source is a false positive based on the wavelength position of the 2.24-micron absorption.","The invention described herein uses reflectance spectroscopy and absorption band depth ratios to differentiate between vermiculite sources and to test for the presence of amphibole, serpentine, and\/or talc contaminants in attic vermiculite insulation.","There are subtle spectral differences in the averaged spectra of Enoree, Libby, Louisa, and Palabora expanded vermiculites that can be used to sort various expanded vermiculite samples according to their respective sources.  shows the averaged spectra of Enoree, Libby, Louisa, and Palabora expanded vermiculites. Vibrational absorption bands in near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra of expanded vermiculite change shape and wavelength position as a function of mineral proportions and their elemental composition. In , diagnostic variations can be seen in the 1.4- and 2.3-micron regions: up to 3 bands near 1.4 microns and variable strength of the 2.38-micron band depending on source.","Commercially expanded vermiculite is actually a mixture of the micaceous minerals biotite, hydrobiotite, vermiculite, and impurities in various proportions depending on the source of the ore. These mixtures are herein referred to as \u201cvermiculite.\u201d The elemental compositions (e.g., Fe, Fe, Mg, Al, O, OH, HO, and Si) of these individual minerals also change as a function of where they were mined (i.e., their source). The combined effect of variable mineral proportions and elemental compositional changes results in a unique spectral fingerprint for many sources of vermiculite ore. Specifically, band depth ratio values can be used to differentiate vermiculites from different sources and to estimate amphibole, serpentine, and\/or talc contamination.","As illustrated in , band depth, which indicates absorption feature strength, is calculated by first normalizing a diagnostic absorption for variations in spectral slope. This is accomplished by dividing the reflectance values of an absorption band by the reflectance values of a straight line continuum drawn between continuum endpoints on the shoulders of the absorption. The reflectance value at the bottom of the normalized absorption is then subtracted from 1.00 to derive the band depth as explained in Clark and Roush (1984). Measuring band depths can be automated if the wavelength locations of the spectral absorptions are known and the data have a signal-to-noise ratio high enough to allow accurate continuum endpoint placement and band depth calculation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"sup":["2 ","2 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},"First, reference data of source area classes and their boundaries are determined and stored in a table at . Spectral measurements of vermiculite materials of known origin are used to generate the reference data. From the spectral measurements of the known materials, band depth ratios are calculated for absorption bands centered at 1.38 and 2.32 microns, which are used to determine the boundaries for each source area. Reference data for the presence of amphibole, talc, and\/or serpentine contaminants are also determined and stored in a table based upon band depth ratios calculated for absorption bands centered at 1.40 and 1.42 microns, which are used in conjunction with the 1.38- and 2.32-micron band depth ratios to determine a contaminant boundary or threshold below which no contaminants are detectable.","Next, data are collected at  for a sample of unknown origin. NIR reflectance spectral measurements are obtained at a plurality of locations within the sample. Band depth ratios are calculated at  from the spectral measurements of the sample for absorption bands centered at wavelengths of 1.38 and 2.32 microns (1.38\/2.32 ratio) and at wavelengths of 1.40 and 1.42 microns (1.40\/1.42 ratio).

If the two source area classes do not match, then standard laboratory techniques (e.g., scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or X-ray fluorescence (XRF)) can be used to determine the sample's source area.","The presence of amphibole, talc, and\/or serpentine contaminants in the sample is verified at  by comparing the 1.40\/1.42 ratio of the sample to the threshold.

The Mixtures category includes mixtures of vermiculites from various sources. The source areas for the 29 vermiculite samples were determined independently using electron probe microanalysis or collection location information. The 29 vermiculite samples were used to empirically determine the boundaries of the source area classes by enclosing clusters of sample points from the same source within boundary lines. For example, for the Libby samples, the minimum and maximum 1.38\/2.32-micron band depth ratios determined the boundaries (0.0106 to 0.0418) for the Libby source area. Expanded vermiculite samples from the other source areas fall outside of these bounds. The specific compositional field boundaries for all the categories, expressed as unitless ratios between the 1.38- and 2.32-micron band depths, are as follows:\n\n","Amphibole, talc, and\/or serpentine contamination are estimated using the 1.40\/1.42-micron band depth ratio. Samples that plot above the curve in  may contain one or more of these contaminant phases. There are no detectable amounts of amphibole, talc, or serpentine in samples that plot below the curve. Non-detect of amphibole, talc, and serpentine was based on spectroscopy and substantiated with SEM, TEM, or X-ray diffraction analysis. Potential amphibole, talc, and\/or serpentine contaminants increase the 1.40\/1.42-micron band depth ratio for a given sample because these contaminants preferentially absorb photons at 1.40 microns but not at 1.42 microns. Spectroscopy cannot distinguish fibrous from non-fibrous amphibole, talc, and serpentine using this method. Thus, the magnitude of the 1.40\/1.42-micron band depth ratio does not necessarily indicate the degree of fibrousness of these potential contaminants; instead, elevated values indicate that amphiboles may be present whether fibrous or not. Direct spectral detection of low levels (less than about 5 wt %) of amphibole in vermiculite is difficult because vermiculite has spectral features at wavelength positions that conceal diagnostic amphibole absorptions. However, when band depths are ratioed, the amphiboles can be detected. Talc and serpentine also have absorptions at nearly the same wavelengths as amphibole, so these vermiculite contaminants cannot be differentiated from amphibole at low concentrations with NIR spectroscopy.","Because coarser contaminant grains absorb more strongly than finer contaminant grains, the 1.40\/1.42-micron band depth ratio is not a direct measurement of the concentration of these potential contaminants. However, referring to , the skewness of 1.40\/1.42-micron band depth ratio values for individual spectral measurements indicates the relative grain size of the contaminants: larger skewness values suggest coarser-grained contaminants while lower values suggest finer-grained contaminants. The circles on the left side of the graph of  represent Libby church attic samples having 6 wt % coarse fibrous amphibole bundles (up to 4 mm). The Libby church attic samples have a skewness of 3.340. The diamonds represent constructed mixtures of 5 wt % fine fibrous Libby amphibole (approximately 10 to 30 microns) with Palabora vermiculite. The constructed vermiculite\/amphibole sample has a skewness of \u22120.983. Note the large positive skewness, or right asymmetry, of the 1.40\/1.42-micron band depth parameter distribution shown by the coarser-grained Libby amphibole. This contrasts with the smaller negative skewness of the constructed vermiculite\/amphibole mixture. Such differences in skewness values are rough guides to the grain size of amphibole, talc, or serpentine contamination. Contaminant grain size is not always a measure of toxicity. As amphibole bundles from the church attic are disturbed, they can release dangerous individual fibers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 5B","FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},"0.0000-0.0210=Palabora South Africa and mixtures of vermiculites","0.0210-0.2832=Libby, Mont. vermiculites","0.2832-0.4762=Jiangsu, China vermiculites","0.4762-2.5000=Louisa, Va. and Enoree, S.C. vermiculites","Both the 1.38\/2.32- and 2.24\/2.38-micron band depth ratio values are sensitive indicators of the source location of the vermiculite and results from both ratios can be compared to check spectral determinations for consistency. The advantage of using the 2.24\/2.38-micron band depth ratio values to determine the source of expanded vermiculite insulation is that only spectral data from 2.2 to 2.5 microns need to be collected, unlike the 1.38\/2.32-micron band depth ratio values that also require measurement of spectral data in the 1.35- to 1.42-micron region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 5C","FIG. 9"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["Lower left corner=(0.0186, 2.2441)","Lower right corner=(0.2835, 2.2441)","Upper left corner=(0.0186, 2.2465)","Upper right corner=(0.2835, 2.2465)"]}}}},"Vermiculites with values that plot outside of this box are not from Libby, Mont.","The corner coordinates of the box defined by the Palabora samples are as follows:\n\n","The corner coordinates of the box defined by the China sample are as follows:\n\n","The corner coordinates of the box defined by the Louisa\/Enoree samples are as follows:\n\n","No false negative determinations were made for the samples tested. In mixtures where vermiculite from Libby is a minor component, a false negative determination of source could conceivably be made. The likelihood of uniform mixing of Libby vermiculite with other vermiculite in an attic to the point where the Libby spectral signature is lost is small. The method outlined herein calls for sampling attics in a sufficient number of locations (i.e., a minimum of 4 areas with about 5 to 8 spots in each area) to detect patches of unmixed Libby vermiculite, thereby minimizing false negatives. If any Libby vermiculite is detected even once, then a confirmed detection of Libby vermiculite is given for the attic. Samples that fall in the Mixture field category in the 1.38\/2.32-micron band depth ratio graph shown in  require an independent test for the presence of fibrous amphibole or serpentine. Moderate levels of cellulose or fiberglass in expanded vermiculite insulation do not affect the spectral source determination because these admixed materials are relatively bright in the NIR while their spectral signatures are dominated by vermiculite.","Referring to , a portable field spectrometer  equipped with a light emitting contact probe  connected to a NiMH battery  was used to test the attic insulation, horticultural, packing, and miscellaneous samples discussed above for the presence of expanded vermiculite insulation derived from the Rainy Creek Igneous Complex near Libby, Mont. There are many commercially available portable spectrometers. The spectrometer used for the expanded vermiculite measurements described herein is an ASD, Inc. (Boulder, Colo.) FieldSpec\u00ae spectroradiometer with a 1 meter optical fiber and a high intensity contact light probe. Other portable reflectance spectrometers can be used to make these measurements if they have adequate spectral resolution and sampling spot size. For example, a hand-held spectrometer with an internal light rather than a contact probe may be used. A spectral bandpass of 11-nm or smaller with 2-nm spectral sampling is needed to achieve the results shown in  to . Spot size is herein defined as a 2-cm diameter spot, which was provided during measurements by the optical opening of the ASD Inc. contact light probe. Each spectral measurement was made by inserting the contact probe  into an expanded vermiculite sample for a 6-second spectral integration. Care was taken to immerse the probe into the sample where it would only be in contact with expanded vermiculite grains and not the sample container walls.","The spectral measurements made in the field are recorded and analyzed using a controller computer  connected to the spectrometer . The controller computer  has the automated software that continuum-removes the appropriate absorptions and compares their depth ratios, as described above. The software then identifies the likely source of the vermiculite and provides a report outlining the measurements and probable vermiculite source to the operator. A sample configuration includes a personal computer such as a laptop running the Windows\u00ae XP operating system with SigmaPlot\u00ae graphing software by Systat Software, Inc. of Chicago, Ill., and reflectance spectroscopy analysis software available from the U.S. Geological Survey.","Advantages of the invention include the ability to perform vermiculite source determinations in situ and to give analytical results to property owners within minutes of the analysis. Potentially hazardous samples need not be collected nor transported to a laboratory for analysis, which is a current requirement for all other methods used to determine the source of vermiculite.","The present invention has been described with respect to the use of NIR reflectance spectroscopy and absorption band depth ratios to differentiate between commercial expanded vermiculite sources. Alternatively, absorption band area ratios can be used in place of band depth ratios to differentiate between vermiculite sources, the source of raw unexpanded vermiculite can be determined using band depth ratio source area classes based on raw vermiculite parameters, and other combinations of band depth ratios can be used to differentiate among vermiculite sources, including those of absorptions in the mid-infrared spectral region.","Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications and variations of the present invention are possible without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.","The following bibliography provides citations to the references cited in the above text.
