{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119() of U.S. provisional patent application 61\/106,724 filed on Oct. 20, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates, in general, to munitions, and, in particular, to projectiles that may be launched from tubes having smooth bores.","Artillery weapons may fire spin-stabilized projectiles. The projectiles may be launched from rifled tubes, which impart high spin rates to the projectiles. These types of projectiles maintain a stable flight because of their high spin rate, which keeps them gyroscopically stable. These projectiles may not be fired from a smooth bore tube because they lack stabilizing surfaces for static stability.","The precision of mortar and artillery projectiles may be greatly improved by retrofitting the projectiles with guidance kits. These guidance kits, however, may not extend the range of the projectiles. Most of the guidance kits may shorten the maximum possible range, because of a heavier launch weight and increased aerodynamic drag. A need exists for a method of adapting a standard artillery projectile (normally spin-stabilized) for firing from a smooth bore tube, such as a mortar tube, while meeting the requirements of precision and extended range.","It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for converting a standard spin-stabilized projectile into a projectile suitable for firing from a smooth bore tube.","One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for adapting a rocket-assisted artillery projectile of a first caliber for firing from a smooth bore tube of a second caliber. The first caliber may be smaller than the second caliber.","The apparatus may include an adapter for connecting to an aft end of the rocket-assisted artillery projectile. The adapter may include a main channel for receiving rocket exhaust and a plurality of sub-channels that lead from the main channel to an exterior of the adapter. An ignition channel may lead from the main channel to an ignition delay disposed in the adapter. A tail boom may be fixed to an aft end of the adapter. The tail boom may include an opening in a fore end that communicates with the ignition delay in the adapter. Lifting surfaces may be attached to the tail boom.","Another aspect of the invention is a rocket-assisted projectile for firing from a smooth bore tube. The projectile may include a projectile body containing rocket propellant and an adapter fixed to an aft end of the projectile body. The adapter may include a main channel for receiving rocket exhaust from the projectile body and a plurality of sub-channels that lead from the main channel to an exterior of the adapter. An ignition channel may lead from the main channel to an ignition delay disposed in the adapter. A tail boom may be fixed to the adapter. The tail boom may include an opening in a fore end that communicates with the ignition delay in the adapter. Lifting surfaces may be attached to the tail boom.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","By way of example only, an embodiment of the invention will be described in relation to a 105 mm, M913 Rocket-Assisted Projectile (RAP). However, the invention described herein may be applied to many other projectiles.","To improve the precision of artillery shells such as the M913, a guidance kit with fuzing functions (such as the Precision Guidance Kit, or PGK) may be used. The guidance kit may replace the fuze that is located on the forward end of the projectile. The guidance kit may include canards that may help steer the projectile to its target. One embodiment of the present invention may be used to adapt a PGK-equipped M913 projectile for firing from a smooth bore 120 mm mortar.","The invention may make the projectile more statically stable. Static stability is important because a smooth bore mortar tube does not impart any spin to the projectile. That is, the projectile may not be gyroscopically stabilized when fired from a smooth bore tube. The invention may provide for exhausting gases from the existing rocket motor; for incorporating a rocket motor ignition delay; for obturating the gun gases behind the projectile; and for preventing excessive balloting of the projectile in the tube. The body of the normally spin-stabilized projectile may have a smaller caliber or diameter than the caliber or diameter of the smooth bore tube.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","10","12","10","14","10","22","22","24","26","18","12","20"]},"An obturator band  may be disposed on an aft end of projectile body . The obturator band  may be made of a plastic material. Obturator band  may act as a seal between the projectile body  and the gun tube. The band  may remain on the projectile  until it exits the gun tube. After exiting the gun tube, the band  may be discarded, in a manner similar to the obturator used on conventional 120 mm mortar ammunition.","The projectile body  may have an outside diameter or caliber d. A smooth bore gun tube  () may have an inside diameter or caliber e. Caliber e may be larger than caliber d. Thus, there may be a need to prevent excessive balloting of the projectile  in the gun tube. A means for preventing excessive balloting of the projectile  in the gun tube may include a bore rider , which may be a generally circular band that is placed on the fore end of the projectile body . The bore rider  may be made of a plastic material. The bore rider  may be discarded after exit from the gun tube, to help reduce the aerodynamic drag of the projectile  in free flight. By way of example, the caliber d of the projectile body  may be about 105 mm and the caliber e of the gun tube  may be about 120 mm.","Another means for preventing excessive balloting of the projectile  in the gun tube may include a plurality of nubs  () or short projections disposed around the circumference of the fore end of the projectile body . Nubs  may be made of, for example, a plastic or a soft metal material. Nubs  may remain attached to the projectile  throughout its flight. For retrofitting existing M913 projectiles or other projectiles, nubs  may be affixed to the projectile body  by, for example, gluing, epoxying, welding, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","22","28","26","26","40","26","40","24"]},"The exterior surface of the adapter  may taper from the aft end of the projectile body  to a smaller diameter using a boattail .

Port  may lead to a main channel . A plurality of sub-channels  may branch off the main channel . An ignition channel  may connect the ignition delay  and the aft end of the main channel . Each sub-channel  may include a throat section  upstream of a nozzle . The throat section  may be made of, for example, graphite. The main channel  and the sub-channels  may be, for example, cylindrical. However, the main channel  and the sub-channels  may have other shapes that may enhance the performance of the rocket motor.","Tapered plugs  may be inserted into the nozzles  to prevent propellant gases (from the propellant increments  shown in ) from entering the rocket motor cavity and prematurely igniting the rocket motor. The plugs  may be expelled when the rocket motor ignites and high pressure gases pass through the main channel  and the sub-channels . By way of example, the port , main channel , sub-channels , and ignition channel  may be a single piece, such as a ceramic insert.","Thus, an existing rocket-assisted artillery projectile, which is normally spin-stabilized and fired from a rifled gun tube, may be retrofitted in accordance with the invention to produce a projectile that is suitable for firing from a smooth bore gun tube.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
