abstract: A method for implementing a remote receiver connected to a telephony network can include a call authorizer that can access remote receiver specific information, wherein the remote receiver specific information can include an authorization requirement. The call authorizer can receive a digitally encoded signal specifying an authorization code. Prior to a telephony connection being established between the remote receiver and an originating device, the call authorizer can determine whether the authorization code satisfies the authorization requirement. Responsive to this determination, the call authorizer can send a ringing signal via the telephone line to the remote receiver. The remote receiver can power an actuator within the remote receiver with a voltage from the ringing signal. The actuator can activate a device controlled by the remote receiver.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present invention relates to the field of telecommunications and, more particularly, to a remote receiver controlled through telephony signals.","2. Description of the Related Art","A demand exists for remotely controllable devices such as garage door openers and security gates. One method of remotely controlling a device involves sending telephone signals to a device through a telephony communication system. For example, breaches in home security systems can result in a telephone call being sent to a monitoring station resulting in police notification.","Most conventional telephony devices, such as a device that receives calls from the security system, require a telephony connection as well as a power source. Utilizing an external power source can result in substantial costs relating to the installation of the requisite power lines. While internal power sources, such as batteries, can provide power without the necessity connecting to a power grid, internal power sources can require periodic replacement resulting in high maintenance costs. Regardless of whether battery power or external line power is used, these power sources can represent a potential source of failure for a given system.","Another concern for remote devices triggered through telephone lines relates to security. Only authorized users should be able to trigger a given remote activation device. Conventional authorization mechanisms require that a connection be established between a calling device and a called device. Then the called device will require an access key or code before the calling device is granted access to portions of the secure system. Unfortunately, because the authorization occurs after a connection is established, an unauthorized user is provided with an opportunity to attack or \u201chack\u201d a restricted remote device.","The invention disclosed herein provides a method and a system for controlling remote receivers utilizing telephony signals. In particular, the invention can provide call authorization functions before a connection is established with a remote receiver. The call authorization functions can utilize pre-connection digital signals to relay information between a call originating device and a network element for authorizing telephony calls. Once the originating device has been authorized, a ringing signal can be sent to the remote receiver. A ring voltage associated with the ringing signal can be utilized by the remote receiver to activate a device controlled by the remote receiver. The results of such an activation can include, but are not limited to, the opening\/closing of a device, such as a gate or a door, the locking\/unlocking of the controlled device, and the starting\/stopping of the remotely controlled device.","One aspect of the present invention can include a method for implementing a remote receiver connected to a telephony network. In the method, a call authorizer can access remote receiver specific information, wherein the remote receiver specific information can include an authorization requirement. In one embodiment, the remote receiver can transmit an authorization signal to the call authorizer that can specify information for modifying the authorization requirement. The call authorizer can receive a digitally encoded signal from an originating device that specifies an authorization code. In one embodiment, the authorization code can be responsive to an authorization request sent by the call authorizer to the originating device. In a further embodiment, the authorization request can include an encrypted key that the originating device can decrypt in order to generate a proper authorization code.","Both the authorization request and the authorization code can be conveyed across available pre-connection telephony channels. In one embodiment, the authorization request can be transported via a ringback channel. The ringback channel can be a back channel present between a telephony switch and an originating device though which a ringback signal can be relayed. The ringback signal can be an audio tone sequence that signifies that a receiving device is ringing. In another embodiment, the authorization code can be transported via a CNG channel. The CNG channel can be a forward channel present between an originating device and a receiving device through which a facsimile (fax) calling tone (CNG) signal can be conveyed. A FAX CNG signal, as defined by the T0.30 protocol, can be a 1,100 Hz signal continuing for 0.5 seconds and repeated every 3 seconds that signifies an attempt by an originating device to establish a fax call. The CNG channel can include a frequency range of approximately 900\u20131,300 Hz.","Prior to a telephony connection being established between the remote receiver and the originating device, the call authorizer can determine whether the authorization code satisfies the authorization requirement. If the authorization requirement is satisfied, a ringing signal can be sent via a telephone line to the remote receiver. A voltage from the ringing signal can power an actuator configured to activate a device controlled by the remote receiver. In one embodiment, circuitry within the remote receiver other than the actuator can be powered with the span power from the telephone line. In a particular embodiment, activating the remote receiver can alter the controlled device between a locked and an unlocked state. In another embodiment, activating the remote receiver can alter the controlled device between an open and a closed state. In yet another embodiment, activating the remote receiver can alter the controlled device between a started and a stopped state.","Another aspect of the present invention can include a method of utilizing a remote receiver including receiving a digitally encoded signal via a telephone line that specifies data for the remote receiver. The remote receiver can decode this digitally encoded signal. In one embodiment, the digitally encoded signal can specify an authorization code that the remote receiver can utilize to grant or deny access to remote receiver functions. In another embodiment, the digitally encoded signal can specify a remote receiver command that can be executed by the remote receiver resulting in a functional change within the remote receiver. In yet another embodiment, the digitally encoded signal can be a pre-connection telephony signal. In a particular embodiment, the remote receiver can digitally encode information specifying remote receiver data into a receiver signal and can transmit this receiver signal via the telephone line.","Additionally, the remote receiver can acquire a ringing signal via the telephone line and can power an actuator with a voltage from the ringing signal to perform a predefined function upon a controlled device. In one embodiment, the remote receiver can power internal circuitry within the remote receiver other than the actuator with span power from the telephone line. The predefined function that can be performed upon the controlled device can include a locking function, an unlocking function, an opening function, a closing function, a starting function, or a stopping function.","Another aspect of the present invention can include a system for remote controlling a device through telephony signals including a call authorizer and a remote receiver. The call authorizer can be communicatively linked to a telephony network and configured to send and receive digitally encoded pre-connection telephony signals that specify authentication information. In one embodiment, the call authorizer can be further configured to generate a digitally encoded signal specifying an encrypted key that must be decrypted by an originating device before a telephony connection is established between the originating device and the remote receiver. In another embodiment, the call authorizer can be a network element within a telephony network. In a further embodiment, the call authorizer can be a switch independent application.","The remote receiver can be communicatively linked to the call authorizer via a telephone line. Moreover, the remote receiver can contain a switching mechanism which can be powered by a ring voltage received through the telephone line. In one embodiment, the remote receiver can further include a receiver power generator configured to power the remote receiver utilizing span power from the telephone line. In another embodiment, the remote receiver can further include a command processor configured to alter at least one function performed by the remote receiver whenever the remote receiver is activated. In yet another embodiment, the remote receiver can include a security manager including security information about accessing the remote receiver. The security manager can be configured to convey a digitally encoded signal specifying at least a portion of the security information to the call authorizer.","Another aspect of the present invention can include a remote receiver including a signal processor communicatively linked to a telephony network. The signal processor can be configured to send and receive digitally encoded telephony signals specifying remote receiver information. The remote receiver can also include an actuator powered by a ring voltage received via a telephone line. The actuator can be configured to trigger a change within a controlled device when the remote device receives a ring signal.","In one embodiment, at least one of the digitally encoded telephony signals can be a pre-connection telephony signal. In another embodiment, the remote receiver can further include a receiver power generator configured to power the remote receiver utilizing span power from the telephone line. In an alternative embodiment, the remote receiver can further include a command processor configured to alter at least one function performed by the remote receiver whenever the remote receiver is activated. In yet another embodiment, the remote receiver can further include a security manager configured to perform authorization tasks within the remote receiver. In such an embodiment, at least one function within the remote receiver cannot be accessed without prior authorization being granted by the security manager.","The invention disclosed herein provides a method and a system for controlling remote receivers utilizing telephony signals. In particular, the invention can include a remote device communicatively linked to a telephony network via a telephone line. This remote device can perform functions such as opening\/closing a device, such as a gate or a door, locking\/unlocking a device, or starting\/stopping a device. The functions performed within the remote receiver can be powered in part by a ring voltage received through the telephone line.","Additionally, the invention can perform call authorization functions before a ring signal is sent to the remote device. These call authorization functions can utilize pre-connection digital signals to relay information between a call originating device and a network element for authorizing telephony calls. Hence, the invention can assure through the call authorizer that only authorized parties can activate the remote receiver.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","115","125","170","120","190","180","175","120","190","190"]},"The originating switch  can be a node within a telephony network that can facilitate the connection between telephony devices, such as telephones and other customer premise equipment. Notably, switches, such as the originating switch  and the destination switch , can connect customer premise equipment to the telecom network . Hence, the originating switch  can connect an originating device  to the telecom network . Similarly, the destination switch  can be a node within the telecom network  communicatively linking a remote receiver  to the telecom network . Since one switch can connect many telephony devices to a given network, both the originating device  and the remote receiver  can be connected to the same switch. Accordingly, embodiments can exist where the originating switch  and the destination switch  are the same switch.","The telecom network  can be any series of points or nodes connected by a series of interconnection paths capable of connecting the originating switch  to the destination switch . For example, the telecom network  can be a circuit-switched network included within the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In another embodiment, portions of the telecom network  can be a commercially owned proprietary packet-switched network with Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capabilities.","The telephone line  can be a line that connects a telephony device (customer premise equipment) to the telecom network . Physically, the telephone line  can include, but is not limited to, such a medium as a twisted pair, a coaxial cable, a fiber optic cable, as well as a wireless connectivity pathway. The telephone line can carry span power, ring voltage, and data signals to attached customer premise equipment. Notably, the span power can be a constantly supplied power source capable of providing low voltage to customer premise equipment.","The data signals can be conveyed through a voice channel . This voice channel  can be a bandwidth segment, typically 64 kbps, utilized by a telephony network for a single voice connection. The voice channel  can operate within the voice band, wherein the voice band can include the frequency range of approximately 0 to 3,400 Hz, which is sufficient bandwidth to convey intelligible human speech. Ordinary telephone service is often restricted to the voice channel , while other services, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL) service, can utilize a broader frequency range.","A CNG channel  can include a frequency range within the voice band through which an authorization code  can be transmitted. While the CNG channel  is always capable of transporting a pre-connection FAX CNG signal, the exact frequency range available within the CNG channel  can vary according to filters placed within the telephony network which typically have a passband at or around 1,100 Hz. For example, in one embodiment, frequencies below approximately 300 Hz and above approximately 2,400 Hz can be filtered. The resulting CNG channel  can include the frequency range from approximately 300 Hz to 2,400 Hz. In another embodiment, all frequencies that deviate from the 1,100 Hz frequency (used by the FAX CNG signal according to T 0.30 protocol) by more than 200 Hz are filtered. Accordingly, the CNG channel  can include the frequency range from approximately 900 Hz to 1,300 Hz.","In one embodiment, signals within the CNG channel  can be digitally encoded by intermittently turning on and off a frequency of about 1,100 Hz, where an \u201con state\u201d can represent a digital one, and an \u201coff state\u201d can represent a digital zero, or vice versa. In an alternate embodiment, signals within the CNG channel  can utilize a modulation technique with a base or carrier frequency of about 1,100 Hz. Furthermore, specific modulation techniques, such as phase key shifting (PKS) and frequency key shifting (FKS), can be used in particular embodiments of the invention. Still, digitally encoded signals can be generated using any of a variety of modulation schemes including, but not limited to, time division multiplexing, frequency modulation, phase modulation, amplitude modulation, and pulse code modulation. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited by the particular data encoding or modulation type. Rather, any suitable data encoding and\/or modulation scheme can be used to carry information over the defined telephony channels.","The ringback channel  can include a frequency range within the voice channel  wherein at least one authorization request  can be conveyed to the originating device . The ringback channel  can be a back channel through which a ringback signal is ordinarily sent from a telephony switch to an originating device . The ringback signal is an intermittent audio tone that the originating device  receives after dialing a number, when the distant end of the circuit or the remote receiver  is receiving a ringing signal. While the ringback signal is typically an analog signal, the authorization request  can be a digital signal conveyed through the ringback channel .","The call authorizer  can be an application capable of performing call authorizations for at least one remote receiver . In so doing, the call authorizer  can relay authorization data to an originating device  via the ringback channel  and receive authorization data from the originating device  via the CNG channel . All conveyances of authorization data to and from the call authorizer  can occur before a telephony connection is established between the originating device  and the remote receiver . This telephony connection can be a voice channel through which typical telephony communications occur. In one embodiment, the call authorizer  can be a network element that interfaces with the destination switch  through a gateway . In another embodiment, the call authorizer  can be a stand-alone solution interfacing directly with the destination switch  without utilizing the gateway  as an intermediary. In yet another embodiment, the call authorizer  can be a program disposed within the destination switch .","The call authorizer  can utilize encrypted keys to determine if a connectivity request is to be granted. Any type of encryption can be used including symmetric key and public key encryption schemes. For example, the call authorizer can send an encrypted key to the originating device . This encrypted key can then be decrypted, utilizing a decryption key possessed by the originating device . The originating device  can then send an authorization code  as proof of successful decryption. Only those devices possessing an approved decryption key can construct an approved authorization code. The returned authorization code  can be utilized by the call authorizer  to determine if a connectivity request should be granted or denied.","In order to determine the necessary authorizations for a particular remote receiver , the call authorizer  can access a profile repository . The profile repository  can contain remote receiver specific information. In one embodiment, this information can be modified by a user of the remote receiver . The profile repository  can be a data store internal or external to the call authorizer . Additionally, the profile repository  can include different authorization requirements for different originating devices. For example, in one embodiment, when the originating device  is located within the same building as the remote receiver , no authorization may be necessary. Yet, authorization can be necessary within that embodiment for originating devices located outside the building in which the remote receiver  is located.","The network  can be any series of points or nodes connected by a series of interconnection paths capable of connecting destination switch  to the call authorizer  and transporting packet-switched messages between connected nodes. For example, the network  can be the Internet. Alternately, the network  can be an intranet utilized by a telecom carrier that owns the destination switch . In that case, the gateway  can be used to interface between the call authorizer  and the destination switch . In one embodiment, the gateway  can facilitate switch independent application programming by providing a set of open network application programming interfaces (APIs). These interfaces can translate standardized telephony commands to switch specific commands. Additionally, the gateway  can function as a layer of abstraction between a telephony network and an application, providing standardized routines to ease many programming tasks.","For example, in one embodiment, the gateway  can be a Parlay gateway capable of interfacing any Parlay compliant application to a Parlay compliant telecom network . In another example, the International Business Machines (IBM) Resource Manager, which is commercially available from IBM Corporation of Armonk, N.Y., can provide the call authorizer  value-added telephony services and functions. Hence, in a particular embodiment, the IBM Resource Manager can function as the gateway . In yet another embodiment, the gateway  can include JAVA APIs for Integrated Networks (JAIN) allowing the call authorizer  to be implemented as a switch independent JAIN compliant application.","In operation, the originating device  can place a call to the remote receiver  through the telecom network . The originating device  can send a connectivity request through the originating switch  across the telecom network  to the destination switch . This connectivity request can specify the calling phone number as well as the called phone number. Notably, when both the originating device  and the remote receiver  are connected to the same switch, the connectivity request can be handled directly by that switch, which can function as both the originating switch  and the destination switch . The destination switch  can then send an authorization inquiry to the call authorizer . The call authorizer  can utilize the profile repository  to determine that an authorization code is necessary before a connection with the remote receiver  is permitted.","Thereafter, the call authorizer  can construct an authorization request . This authorization request  can be conveyed to the originating device  via the ringback channel . Notably, the ringback processor  can be utilized to facilitate the transmission of the authorization request . This authorization request  can contain an encrypted key that the originating device  can decrypt. Upon decrypting the encrypted key, an authorization code  can be generated. The originating device  can transmit the authorization code  to the call authorizer  via the CNG channel . The call authorizer  can then grant or deny connectivity to the remote receiver  based upon the authorization code .","Should connectivity be denied, no ring signal will be sent to the remote receiver  and no activities will result. If, on the other hand, the call authorizer  grants connectivity, a ring signal can be sent to the remote receiver. This ring signal can include a ring voltage that can activate an actuator within the remote receiver  causing some operation to be performed. The operation performed can depend on the nature of the remote receiver  and the device being controlled by the remote receiver .","It should be noted that the call authorizer  can, but need not, submit an encrypted key to the originating device . In one embodiment, the call authorizer  can utilize a password encoded within the authorization code  to determine connectivity. This password need not be based on an encryption scheme. In another embodiment, no authorization request  need be sent from the call authorizer  at all. In such an embodiment, the originating device  can submit an authorization code  to the call authorizer  at or about the time when the connectivity request is submitted or shortly thereafter. In such an embodiment, any connectivity requests sent without an accompanying authorization code  can be automatically denied.","While in one embodiment the call authorizer  can convey data to the originating device  without assistance, in another embodiment, a ringback processor  can assist in these transmissions. The ringback processor  can be an application capable of receiving data and conveying this data as analog and digital signals over the ringback channel . The ringback channel  can be a segment of telephony bandwidth within the voice frequency range (approximately 0\u20133,400 Hz) reserved for pre-connection transmissions between a telephony switch and the originating device . Typically, an intermittent analog signal representing the ringing of a data source is sent along this ringback channel.","Still, according to one embodiment wherein the remote receiver  includes logic and\/or information processing capabilities, the network element can forward pre-connection digital information received from the originating device  directly to the remote receiver , also using pre-connection signals as previously described. Accordingly, the remote receiver  can then determine whether to terminate a connectivity request by communicating with either the network element or directly with the originating device  through the telecom network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["200","205","200","205","215","230","260","240","240","265","205","205"]},"In a basic embodiment, the command processor  can detect an incoming ring signal and route the ring voltage to an actuator . The command processor  need not immediately route the ring voltage, but can contain components, such as capacitors, that allow the ring voltage to be temporarily stored. Furthermore, in particular embodiments, the command processor  can receive data signals via the telephone line  that can contain remote receiver  commands. These data signals can be conveyed either before or after a telephony voice channel connection is established with the remote receiver .","The actuator  can be a mechanism within the remote receiver  that can put something in motion, such as an active mechanism . The actuator  can be powered by the ring voltage received through the ring voltage conduit . For example, the actuator  can be a switch, such as a solenoid, that upon receiving the ring voltage can be altered between two different states. Because in some embodiments, the command processor  can temporarily store the ring voltage, the actuator  can be activated either before or after a telephony voice channel connection is established.","The controlled device  can be a device connected to the remote receiver  that can perform some function triggered by the actuator . The controlled device  can include an active mechanism  and an activation power source . In particular embodiments, depending on the power requirements of the active mechanism , the activation power source  can be unnecessary. Instead, the actuator  can supply sufficient power to operate the active mechanism . For example, in one embodiment where the controlled device  causes a computer to be turned on or turned off, the active mechanism can be completely powered by the actuator . In another embodiment, where the controlled device  causes a gate to open or close, the active mechanism  can be triggered by the actuator , but can require power supplied by the activation power source  to move the gate.","It should be noted that the remote receiver  can be a implemented as an integrated circuit. Alternately, the remote receiver  can be a complex device containing many different mechanical and electronic components. For example, the remote receiver  can be integrated with the controlled device  and contain the active mechanism  and the supplementary activation power source . Furthermore, the remote receiver  can contain additional components and features other than those depicted in . One such embodiment where the remote receiver  can include additional components is shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["200","205","200","205","210","215","220","225","230","235","210","205","210","210","245","245","265"]},"The signal processor  can transmit and receive data signals to and from the remote receiver . For example, in one embodiment, the remote receiver  can receive a signal requesting current state information about the remote receiver  and can responsively generate a signal denoting the receiver's status. The signal processor  can contain the necessary components to encode and decode digital information within telephony signals. These telephony signals can be sent through a data conduit  within the telephone line . In one embodiment, the data conduit  can transmit signals through a voice channel having a frequency range of approximately 0\u20133,400 Hz. In another embodiment, the data conduit  can have additional bandwidth outside the voice channel, such as the bandwidth available to the data channel of a DSL line. Notably, the signal processor  can process both pre-connection telephony signals and post connection signals.","The active mechanism  can include the physical hardware that performs a function for which the remote receiver  is triggered. For example, in an embodiment where the remote receiver  opens\/closes a floodgate, the active mechanism can include the gate, levers, and hydraulic components necessary to make the gate open\/close. In another example, the active mechanism  can consist entirely of integrated circuitry within a circuit board capable of performing a specified function.","The command processor  can maintain and control circuitry within the remote receiver . For example, in one embodiment where the remote receiver  starts and stops a device, the command processor  can determine that the current state of the controlled device is an off state. Accordingly, the command processor  can assure that the next activation of the actuator  will cause the device to be placed in an on state. The command processor  can make such determinations by either receiving data from the controlled device or by inferring the state of the controlled device based upon activities occurring within the remote receiver . For example, if the actuator  is in an active position, the command processor  can infer that a controlled device is turned on. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the command processor  can send remote receiver  status information to the signal processor  to be conveyed to a querying device. In yet another embodiment, the command processor  can activate\/deactivate a remote receiver  in order to prevent unauthorized remote operations.","The security manager  can contain security related information used or needed by the remote receiver . This security information may be necessary to perform functions within the remote receiver . For example, in one embodiment, the only status queries that the remote receiver  can respond to require authorization by the security manager . In another embodiment, authorization by the security manager  is a prerequisite to activating the actuator .","Notably, the security manager  can function in conjunction with an external call authorizer, as well as function independently. For example, in a particular embodiment, the security manager  can transmit an authorization requirement to the signal processor  that can be conveyed to the call authorizer , shown in . In such an embodiment, the call authorizer  can thereafter perform the authorization tasks for the remote receiver . In another embodiment, both the call authorizer  and the security manager  can perform authorization checks independent of one another. For instance, the authorization requirement contained within the call authorizer  can be established and modified independent of security features contained within the remote receiver . In yet another embodiment, the security manager  can perform remote receiver  authorizations for an overall system that does not include a call authorizer.","In operation, a digitally encoded authorization signal can be sent from a switch across a telecom network through a telephone line  to the remote receiver . This authorization signal can be conveyed through the data conduit  to the signal processor  which can decode the information within the authorization signal. This decoded information can be sent to the security manager  for authorization. If authorization is denied, the security manager  can cause the signal processor  to transmit a signal indicating to the requesting party that access has not been authorized. If the security manager  approves access, a signal can be sent to the command processor  denoting that access has been authorized.","Up to this point, the remote receiver  can be in a disabled state. Such a state can be established by the command processor  which can be powered by the receiver power generator  through the span power conduit . When the security manager  sends an access approval to the command processor , the command processor  can place the remote receiver  in an enabled state. Accordingly, the command processor  can record the present system status, which can indicate that a controlled device is in a \u201clocked\u201d position. Thereafter, the command processor  can enable the actuator , allowing the actuator  to receive ring voltage from the ring voltage conduit . Furthermore, the actuator can be adjusted to perform an \u201cunlock\u201d operation upon receiving current.","Then, a ring signal including ring voltage, can be conveyed to the remote receiver . This ring voltage can activate the actuator  causing the active mechanism , which can be a lock, to become unlocked. As soon as the system state is changed, an indication can be sent to the command processor . The command processor  can record the change in system state and adjust the actuator  to lock the active mechanism  whenever it is next triggered. Thereafter, the command processor  can deactivate the remote receiver  so that unauthorized parties cannot utilize the remote receiver's functions.","One of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the receiver power generator , the actuator , the signal processor, the security manager , the command processor , and the active mechanism  need not be discrete elements within the remote receiver . Instead, the remote receiver  can itself perform some or all of the functions detailed within the specified elements without grouping the functions in the manner depicted in . For example, an embodiment can exist where the functions of the command processor , the actuator , and the active mechanism  are intermeshed within a single element such as a microcontroller or application-specific integrated circuit.","Furthermore, not all the functions depicted by the elements detailed in  need be incorporated in all embodiments of the invention. For example, in one embodiment, the remote receiver  need not include a signal processor . Notably, such a system may not be capable of encoding or decoding digital information contained within data signals. Nevertheless, the remote receiver  can be activated whenever a ring voltage is sent via the ring voltage conduit  and perform a function upon a controlled device. In another embodiment, the remote receiver  can lack a receiver power generator . Such a remote receiver  can provide constant power to circuitry through a battery source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2B"],"b":["300","300","300","305","310"]},"In step , the remote receiver can publish call restrictions to an external call authorizer. This publication can occur automatically upon first powering up the remote device or can be responsive to a query from the call authorizer. Such a publication can occur by sending telephony signals containing digitally encoded information to the call authorizer. It should be noted that the invention can utilize both pre-connection and post connection telephony signals.","In step , the remote receiver can determine a present system state and set internal circuit logic. For example, if a remote receiver opens\/closes a gate, the remote receiver can determine that the gate is presently closed. Subsequently, the receiver can set circuit logic so that a gate opening event occurs whenever the remote receiver receives a ring signal. In another embodiment, the circuit logic can be set to an inactive state until security restrictions of the remote receiver are satisfied.","In step , the remote device can receive a ring voltage signal. This ring voltage signal can be sent to the actuator in step . In embodiments where the remote receiver is not connected to power from a phone line, the ring signal can still trigger the actuator that can be linked to a battery or external power source. Once powered, the actuator can activate or manipulate a mechanism in step . This mechanism can include, but is not limited to, locking\/unlocking mechanisms, gate opening\/closing mechanisms, and engine shut-off\/turn on mechanisms. A given remote receiver can also have multiple actuators and active mechanisms governed by internal circuit logic.","In step , the circuit logic of the remote device can be updated responsive to the activation of step .

Authorization schemes can vary according to a telephone number associated with a remote receiver. In step , a determination can be made in reference to the authorization scheme accessed that an authorization key is required. Accordingly, some cryptography key, such as a public key, can be required before a connection to the remote receiver is permitted.","In step , the call authorizer can transmit a request for a required key to the originating device through a ringback channel. In step , an authorization code can be received through the CNG channel. Notably, the authorization code can contain a digitally encoded signature that results from the originating device decrypting the cryptography key sent within the authorization request. In certain embodiments, the original connection request sent from the originating device can include an authorization code containing either a password or a previously determined digitally encoded signature. In such an embodiment, step  can be rendered unnecessary and can be skipped by the method .","In step , the method can compare the authorization code with a desired response and determine if authorization should be granted. If the authorization code does not satisfy the requirements of the call authorizer, the method can proceed to step , where the call authorizer can signal that the connectivity request is unauthorized. In step , the authorization manager can then deny access to the remote receiver.","If the authorization code indicates authorization should be granted, however, the method can proceed to step , where the call authorizer can signal that the connectivity request is authorized. In step , the ringback processor can grant access to the remote receiver. In step , a ring signal can be sent to the remote receiver. The ring voltage from the ring signal can activate an actuator within the remote receiver. In step , the remote receiver can be activated and perform an operation on a controlled device. For example, a device can be opened\/closed, locked\/unlocked, or started\/stopped.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","500","500"]},"The method  can begin in step , where a destination switch receives a connectivity request from the originating device. While in many cases, the connectivity request will be for a dedicated circuit-switched voice connection, the method can operate equally as well within a packet-switched environment. In step , the method can send an authorization query to the call authorizer. The call authorizer can determine from the authorization query that additional information is needed from the originating device before authorization can be granted. Accordingly, an authorization requirement can be generated that details the necessary additional information.","In step , the authorization requirement and relevant parameters can be relayed from the call authorizer to the ringback processor. The ringback processor can generate a signal configured to prompt a user of the originating device for the necessary additional information specified by the authorization requirement. This signal generated by the ringback processor can be called an authorization request. Relevant parameters can include, but are not limited to, originating device identification parameters, remote receiver parameters available to the destination switch, and special processing parameters related to the authorization requirement.","In step , the ringback processor can retrieve profile information concerning the remote receiver. For example, profile information can include, but is not limited to, such information as the called telephone number, the calling telephone number, the nature of the remote receiver, capabilities of the controlled device, remote receiver options, security requirements for establishing a connection, and unique connection requirements. The profile information can be located in an external data store, can be contained within the ringback processor, or can be contained within parameters passed to the ringback processor.","In step , the ringback processor can determine originating device parameters. In one embodiment, the type of authorization request can be modified according to the capabilities of an originating device. For example, if an originating device is configured to accept a digitized authorization key, such a key can be constructed and sent to the originating device. If the originating device is not configured to accept such a key, however, an analog voice signal can be generated requesting that a user of the originating device provide authorization data as specified by the authorization requirement.","In step , the ringback processor can generate an authorization request. This authorization request can include analog and\/or digital signals. In step , the ringback processor can send the authorization request to the destination switch. Thereafter, in step  the connection with the ringback processor can be terminated. In step , the ringback transmission can be relayed through the telephony network to the originating switch. Notably, if the originating device and remote receiver are both connected to the same switch, step  is unnecessary. In step , the originating switch can transmit the authorization request to the originating device through a designated ringback channel. This ringback channel can be a frequency range within the voice band designated for ringback signals.","It should be appreciated that while the embodiment described in  includes a ringback processor and extensively utilized its capabilities to transmit the authorization request to the originating device, the invention does not require a separate ringback processor. Instead, the functionality attributed to the ringback processor in  can be incorporated within the call authorizer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","600","600","600","605"]},"In step , the originating device can determine if an encrypted key is contained within the authorization request. In step , the originating device can decrypt data contained within the authorization request as necessary. Notably, cryptography schemes such as symmetric keys and public keys can be utilized for the decryption process within method . In embodiments utilizing key encryption, the originating device can contain a decryption key capable of accessing the data from within the authorization request. In other embodiments, the authorization request can prompt the originating device for a particular code or password required by the call authorizer.","Once necessary decryption actions have been taken, the method can proceed to step , where a data signal can be responsively generated. This data signal can be the authorization code that the call authorizer has requested. In step , the method can convey this data signal across a CNG channel. Notably, the conveyance of the data signal, as well as all previously mentioned steps, can occur before a voice connection is established between the originating device and the remote receiver. Additionally, the CNG channel across which the data signal is conveyed can be the previously detailed frequency range centered at or around 1,100 Hz.","The present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
