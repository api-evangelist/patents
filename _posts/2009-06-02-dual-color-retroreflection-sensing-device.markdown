title: Dual color retro-reflection sensing device
abstract: A system for detection of optical type devices being used by an enemy sniper subject without alerting the enemy is shown. A coherent laser beam of a wave length in the visible color range, is sent along an axis and passing through a beam splitter device. A detection means is arranged to generate a signal when it detects retro-reflections from the target optical devices or subject including clutter reflections in a 180 degree direction relative to axis. The detection means is coaxially mounted with the source of illumination with a second detection means off axis therefrom to generate a second detection signal when it detects clutter reflections from the target optical devices or subject. A comparator means forms a difference signal between the retro-reflected detection signal and the second detection signal and indicates when the difference signal exceeds a predetermined threshold.

Optical augmentation (OA) techniques can be used for sniper detection and interception. In this invention, detection of retro-reflection from a target optics of a transmitted light source is used as the detection approach. Implementation of this retro-reflection approach is by transmitting a light source and observing its reflection from a distant optics co-axially with respect to the illuminating source. Co-axial reflection is from retro-reflection. Other, specular and diffuse type reflections from a targeting optics as well as other reflecting objects would give rise to clutter in the sensor, causing false alarm detections. Clutter error is corrected by using a second sensor that is laterally shifted relative to the axis of illumination of the source. This sensor would collect all reflections such as specular and diffuse reflections that would other wise give rise to clutter. Since the co-axial sensor would receive the desired retro-reflection (though, plus clutter of specular and diffuse reflections), a differential signal of the co-axial and off-axial sensors would tend to yield a true retro-reflection component signal. This differential measurement is expected to vastly reduce false alarms for retro-detection. In addition to detecting the targeting optics, there is capability of discriminating and classifying various different types of optics used by a sniper, e.g., since the reflecting properties of the optics would have a spectral dependence, different wavelengths of illumination would be expected to produce different intensities of the retro-reflections. Select targets for detection in this invention would be of a sniper and especially his\/her weapon. Retro-reflection of various wavelength (colors) may be from a human eyeball (particularly the retina), gun scopes (particularly the reticle on a gun sight telescope), and cameras, e.g., and these have known, target wavelengths. Ordinarily in the noise detected as opposed to retro-reflection detected categories would be stray metals, glass, headlamps of a car, which ordinarily provide only diffuse reflections or mirrors which ordinarily provide only specular type reflections. The illumination sources in this invention can be used either simultaneously or alternatively dictated by the frame rate of the system. Both these sources will provide co-axial illumination of the threat target area. The retro-reflections from the target will be at the spectral wavelengths of the two illumination sources. Each of these sensors will have adequate sensitivity to detect the retro-reflected light at the corresponding wavelength of the illumination source. Thus, a target optics can be detected.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide means for a combat soldier to remotely detect snipers, and optical equipment being used by such snipers, without alerting the enemy.","Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof.","In , a beam  (such as a laser beam) of a first wavelength is projected by a source  in direction of a suspected target . Retro reflected back from target  is beam  (nearly at a 180 degree angle so that it can be sensed at sensor ). Also reflected back is an off line signal which is sensed at sensor , along line , which off line signal is also related in some way to suspected target . The placement of sensor  is such that it gives efficient discrimination of beams  and , otherwise it is positioned as may be convenient. The sensing of signal  at sensor  is more or less considered a retro-reflected full return signal on the originally projected signal  (but also added therein is some unwanted reflected noise signals), however, the reflected signal  sensed at sensor  is considered an off line, completely different type of signal than 4. Signal  might be considered as the background clutter (noise) level caused by random reflections from suspected target . The illumination level detected at sensor  fed to comparator  along line  along with the illumination level detected at sensor . At , through various computational algorithms (not shown here), the illumination levels are differenced as well as added, and a ratio taken of difference to added levels. This ratio is herein termed as a signal to noise ratio. If a threshold signal to noise ratio is crossed a positive signal will appear at Y. The threshold level or the desired signal to noise ratio as defined here will be set depending on the sensitivity of the sensors  and  and other factors such as the background solar flux. As an example, a sought after ratio here would be over 0.75. The difference of the illumination signals indicates retro reflection from  toward targeted device , which is known to respond at that wavelength originally projected out in . Using this formula for general signal to noise ratio, (which is implemented at comparator  through computational means (not shown here), the on signal return (I=illumination amounts, \u03bb is wavelength identifier) from sensor , and the off line signal return from sensor , one could locate presence of a sought after target known to retro-reflect at a unique wavelength, where a relatively higher signal to noise ratio is shown than for other types of targets that were illumined with beam .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["S","N"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb1"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":[{"mi":["I","on","\u03bb1"]},{"mi":["I","off","\u03bb1"]}],"mo":"-"},{"msubsup":[{"mi":["I","on","\u03bb1"]},{"mi":["I","off","\u03bb1"]}],"mo":"+"}]}}}},"br":{},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","2"]},"Source  projects at a different wavelength than does source . If considering certain wavelengths, as for example, in the visible to near infrared light spectrum (400 to 900 nanometers), it could be said that source  projects at a different color of light than source . It is expected to arrange beam projections in alternate step signals from source  and then from source , in this embodiment; in actuality, multiple colors could be projected in one beam, or even broad waveband incoherent white light or other light sources such as light emitting diodes covering a wide spectral range from 400 to 1700 nanometers. However, in such case the detectors  and  still would be searching at a particular different (second) wavelength than would be the particular wavelength being searched by detectors  and , to note. Source  projects a laser signal along beam  which, through beam splitter , is also projected in direction of suspected target , along more or less the same line as was beam . Retro reflected back from target  similarly (through beam splitter ) is beam  (nearly at a 180 degree angle from signal  so that it can be sensed at sensor ). Also reflected back is an off line signal which is sensed at sensor , along line , which off line signal is (similarly to ) also related in some way to suspected target . The placement of sensor  is such that it gives efficient discrimination of beams  and  and also for convenience. Even though a signal such as  could be arranged to be picked up in the field of the beam splitter returns (as was done for ), it can also be done as shown here, not in the field of beam splitter return signals. The illumination level detected at sensor  is fed to comparator  along line  along with the illumination level along line  detected at sensor . At , through computational algorithms (not shown here), the illumination levels are differenced as well as added, and a ratio taken of difference to added levels according to the equation (s) here below. This ratio is here in termed as a signal to noise ratio. If a threshold signal to noise ratio is reached this may appear as a signal at Y. The threshold level or the desired signal to noise ratio as defined here will be set depending on the sensitivity of the sensors  and  and other factors such as the background solar flux. As an example, a sought after ratio here would be over 0.75. A Y result is of course for a different wave length than for a Y result, and hence a different sniper optic would be detected than at Y.","In order to decrease the false alarm rate and improve the rates of detection, a type of differential measurement can be made using the system shown in  to improve discrimination and classification of a target. The signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios of the retro-reflected illumination signals at wavelengths \u03bb and \u03bb, respectively, are plotted against one another on the two axes of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["S","N"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb1"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":[{"mi":["I","on","\u03bb1"]},{"mi":["I","off","\u03bb1"]}],"mo":"-"},{"msubsup":[{"mi":["I","on","\u03bb1"]},{"mi":["I","off","\u03bb1"]}],"mo":"+"}]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-2","num":"00002.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["S","N"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb2"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":[{"mi":["I","on","\u03bb2"]},{"mi":["I","off","\u03bb2"]}],"mo":"-"},{"msubsup":[{"mi":["I","on","\u03bb2"]},{"mi":["I","off","\u03bb2"]}],"mo":"+"}]}}}}],"br":{},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","2"]},"In , a graph is shown receiving four frequencies, for instance, (herein called \u03bb, \u03bb, \u03bb, and \u03bb).
