Because these devices are relatively expensive and offer complementary features, there have been efforts to converge the television technologies with the personal computer\/Internet technologies.","For example, some personal computers have been equipped with television tuner cards, which allow the reception of television programming through the cable or satellite connection. Such television tuner cards can also be equipped with video capture capabilities, to allow later playback of captured programming. However, equipping a personal computer with video capabilities has not gained wide acceptance amongst the general public as a replacement for a television, in part because the typical personal computer monitor is relatively small and, in particular, significantly smaller than the typical family room television. Moreover, the typical personal computer is equipped with a relatively more limited and inferior sound system, which can be disadvantageous when marketing to modern viewers who require, for example, high-fidelity sound or even a Surround Sound system.","Another convergence approach, known as WebTV, has been to provide the television with a set-top box and keyboard to allow, for example, Internet access through the television set and cable connection. While such systems are adequate for simple e-mail communication and limited Web browsing, WebTV also has failed to gain widespread acceptance, at least in part because the resolution of the typical television is much more crude than that of the computer monitor, and can also produce formatting idiosyncrasies which can make it difficult to view many web pages.","Each of these systems suffers from additional disadvantages which may have contributed to the failure to develop an effective converged video system: Personal computers are frequently upgraded and replaced; television sets and home entertainment systems, however, have a significantly longer life span.","As such, there is a need for a multimedia telecommunications system that provides improved convergence of television and personal computer based resources. There is a further need for a convergence system that allows the user to maintain separate television and personal computer based resources.","These and other drawbacks in the prior art are overcome in large part by a system and method according to embodiments of the present invention.","A multimedia telecommunications system according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a media subsystem and a network subsystem. The media subsystem couples a television to a media provider via a digital personal video stream manager. The media subsystem can also include an audio system, a video recording device, and a set-top media interface box. The network subsystem includes a personal computer having a network interface card and coupled to an Internet connection via a modem and a wireless network router. The digital personal video stream manager likewise includes a wireless network control and is adapted to receive control commands from the personal computer for supervising the recording of programming using the video recording device. The digital personal video stream manager can also receive and digitize broadband media from the media provider and transmit it via the wireless network to the personal computer. The personal computer can store the received media files for playback. The media files can be played back either via the personal computer itself or via the digital personal video stream manager on the television. User interfaces on the PC or television can be used to control media file or broadband media playback.","A digital personal video stream manager according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a control processor, a media interface, and one or more control interfaces. The media interface can receive broadband audio and video and convert it into digital file format for transmission on a wireless LAN, such as an IEEE 802.11 based wireless LAN, to a personal computer. The media interface can likewise receive digital media files from the personal computer via the wireless interface, and convert them to a format for playback by the audio system or television. Further, the digital personal video stream manager can receive controls from remote users to supervise media recording. The control interfaces allow control of the digital personal video stream manager, such as via infrared remote controls.","A multimedia telecommunications system according to an embodiment of the present invention implements an integrated audio stream manager in association with the digital personal video stream manager. Such an integrated audio stream manager employs a personal computer to record and store audio such as compact disk tracks. The personal computer can then contact one or more Internet web sites for CD indices to download a list of the tracks and provide a master list of all CDs stored. The digital personal video stream manager can then be used to supervise playback of the audio files via the connected audio system.","In certain embodiments, the multimedia telecommunications system can be provided with and controlled by a wireless 802.11 remote control device to control the digital personal video stream manager from anywhere in the house. The wireless remote may be provided with an LCD screen, an 802.11 interface, and an IP telephony interface. The LCD screen provides the user with a graphical interface that allows a user to interact with the digital personal video stream manager in a manner similar to that employed when using the personal computer. In addition, the IP telephony interface allows the user to make and receive IP telephone calls, such as Internet telephone calls. In such an embodiment, the personal computer may implement an IP telephone gateway.","One embodiment of a multimedia telecommunications system according to the present invention includes a system for e-mail control of the digital personal video stream manager, for example, to program a video recording device.

The DPVSM control plug in is adapted to identify a special DPVSM control e-mail which is then translated by the DPVSM control program. The digital personal video stream manager then activates at the appropriate time to record the program.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes a system for Instant Messaging based control of the digital personal video stream manager, for example, to program a video recording device. A system including Instant Messaging based control of the digital personal video stream manager according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a personal computer having an Instant Messaging client and equipping the Instant Messaging client with a DPVSM control plug in. The DPVSM control plug in is adapted to identify a special DPVSM control Instant Message which is then translated by the DPVSM control program. The digital personal video stream manager then activates at the appropriate time to record the program.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes a system for Short Message Service-based control of the digital personal video stream manager, for example, to program a video recording device. Such a system includes one or more cellular telephones including SMS capabilities and a DPVSM control module in the SMS server of the cellular service provider.

The DPVSM Instant Message or a DPVSM e-mail control message is then transmitted to the user's personal computer, where the IM or e-mail plug in translates it and uses it to control the DPVSM.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes a system for voice portal-based control of the digital personal video stream manager, for example, to program a video recording device. Such a system includes a DPVSM control module at a server of a service provider. The DPVSM control module is adapted to respond to a user calling in a predetermined phone number and using an interactive voice response system, issue prompts and accept inputs for DPVSM control. The DPVSM control module then converts the inputs to a DPVSM Instant Message or a DPVSM e-mail control message. The DPVSM Instant Message or a DPVSM e-mail control message is then transmitted to the user's personal computer, where the IM or e-mail plug in translates it and uses it to control the DPVSM.","A voice portal system according to another embodiment of the present invention includes a voice portal with DPVSM control module provided locally at the user's personal computer. The DPVSM control module is adapted to respond to a user calling in and, using an interactive voice response system, issue prompts and accept inputs for DPVSM control.","Additional embodiments of the present invention include a context-based search system. Such a system may be maintained by a service provider and can identify a program and date and time without receiving complete details thereof; the DPVSM can then control the recording of the program using IM or e-mail based-techniques. The context-based search system includes a message receiver for receiving the DPVSM message; one or more databases for storing keywords and program information; a confirmation message generator for informing the user of identified programming; and a DPVSM control for causing the DPVSM to supervise the media recording once one of the identified results have been selected by the user.","A better understanding of these and other specific embodiments of the invention is obtained when the following detailed description is considered in conjunction with the following drawings.","Turning now to the drawings and, with particular attention to , a multimedia telecommunications system according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown and generally identified by the reference numeral . As will be discussed in greater detail below, the multimedia telecommunications system provides users with a bridge between their personal computer and their home entertainment system. The multimedia telecommunications system receives broadband media (e.g., audio and video) streams from a broadband signal source, and digitizes, encapsulates and transmits to and from a personal computer using a local area network technology, such as a wireless LAN, for intelligent processing, recording and control from the personal computer. Digital video can also be captured from the Internet and sent for playback on the home entertainment system.","In particular, shown is a multimedia telecommunications system including a media stream manager, referred to as a digital personal video stream manager (DPVSM), according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system includes a media or home entertainment subsystem and a network or computer subsystem . As will be described in greater detail below, the media subsystem is based around a television and other broadband media devices, while the network subsystem is based around a personal computer and other local area network devices.","As shown, the DPVSM is coupled via a cable set-top box to a house cable connection . The cable set-top box may be any standard cable box or broadband media interface such as, for example, a satellite dish interface. The house cable connection typically may be a connection for a coaxial cable, but other connections are contemplated. As shown, the DPVSM further may couple to an audio system , and, via a video recorder to a television . The video recorder may be embodied, for example, as any of a variety of video recording devices, including, for example, a videocassette recorder (VCR) or an optical disk recorder. In addition, an infrared (IR) remote control  may be provided for control of the DPVSM and various of the other components of the system. The IR remote  may be any remote capable of interacting with a television-screen based interface and allowing the user to make selections therefrom.","The DPVSM may be adapted to control various functions of the various components of the media subsystem , such as turning on and off the various devices, or programming the video recorder for future program recording. The DPVSM may program the devices via their coaxial cable connections, in much the same way a cable company controls operation of the cable set-top box. In other embodiments, separate control interfaces, such as wireless interfaces or infrared interfaces, may be provided. For example, if the video recording device has an infrared interface, the DPVSM could similarly send infrared control signals to the video recording device for control thereof.","As will be described in greater detail below, the DPVSM can communicate with elements of the network subsystem wirelessly over a local area network  via an 802.11 antenna . In particular, in the embodiment illustrated, the network subsystem couples to the house cable connection via an Internet access device such as a cable or DSL modem . It is noted that, in embodiments in which the modem is a DSL modem, an Internet connection separate from the cable connection would be provided. The modem couples to a home 802.11 router and a personal computer , which may be a laptop or desktop computer. In the embodiment illustrated, the router couples to the modem and the PC via CAT5 cable. It is noted, however, that other interfaces, such as wireless interfaces, could be used instead of CAT5 cable. The PC is equipped with an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) , or other network interface, for communicating with the router . As will be described in greater detail below, the PC is able to communicate, for example, control commands , with the DPVSM via the wireless router , to control various elements of the media subsystem . It is noted that an advantage of certain embodiments of the DPVSM  is that it need not provide its own mass storage device for storing media files; rather, it can make use of the personal computer 's storage.","More particularly, turning now to , a block diagram of the exemplary DPVSM of  is shown. In the embodiment illustrated, the DPVSM includes a control processor  and an audiovisual or multimedia interface . The multimedia interface  receives audio and\/or video over the cable connection () or other audio\/video input to a multimedia interface such as an audio\/video analog-to-digital converter . The video signal is then received at a compression circuit  for conversion into, for example, MPEG format. The MPEG video is then provided to an Ethernet interface  for packing into Ethernet packets. The Ethernet packets are then provided to a local area network interface, such as a wireless 802.11 interface  for transmission to the 802.11 router, if desired. The video can then be transmitted to the personal computer  (). Thus, the DPVSM provides an interface for receiving video signals from the cable or satellite TV connection, and converting them into a digital format readable by the personal computer .","Similarly, Internet audio and video content can be received by the 802.11 router  from the personal computer and displayed over the television or recorded on the video recording device . Thus, the data is unpacked from the Ethernet packets at . If in, for example, MPEG format, the resulting data is decompressed in the decompression unit  and provided to the video recording device or television via the audio\/video digital-to-analog converter . It is noted that, in certain embodiments, the audio-video signal arriving over the cable connection and cable box may already be in digital format. Thus, the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters ,  may not be necessary, although conversion between digital formats may be required.","The control processor , which may be embodied as a Pentium-type or other microprocessor or microcontroller, provides a supervisory function for the other components of the media subsystem and can receive and store commands in memory  for later execution, such as recording a program using the video recording device , as will be explained in greater detail below. The control processor  is thus coupled to send and receive control signals via the wireless 802.11 interface . The control processor  may also be coupled to or implement other control interfaces, such as an infrared module interface , a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface , and a television user interface .","The USB interface  allows peripheral devices to be coupled in and played back; for example, a camera could be coupled to the USB interface . The television user interface  is used to generate a user interface for display on the television screen, in much the same way that a videocassette recorder or digital versatile disk (DVD) player provides a control interface. The IR module  allows reception of commands and selections using an IR remote control  in conjunction with the television user interface .","As noted above, a multimedia telecommunications system according to embodiments of the present invention includes a media subsystem and a network subsystem .

As will be described in greater detail below, the user interface module  allows video to be displayed on the computer monitor (not shown) and for various files and controls to be executed. The DPVSM controller module  permits viewing or playback of locally stored media files, such as audio or video files, and control of the DPVSM A (). The video editor  allows editing of local video files and may be implemented as any of a variety of video editing programs. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the media files may be media files downloaded from the Internet or may be captured from the media subsystem .","The processor  may couple to a wireless LAN interface  (e.g., a 802.11 Ethernet NIC) to receive audio and video streams from the house cable connection and the media subsystem (). In addition, the processor  couples to a memory  for storing media files  and programs (not shown). The personal computer also may include an infrared interface  for using an infrared mouse or keyboard control. Finally, in certain embodiments, a service provider may maintain a web site that allows use of the personal computer  to download upgrades to the DPVSM 's control programs and modules.","As noted above, a multimedia telecommunications system according to embodiments of the present invention may take a variety of configurations.
