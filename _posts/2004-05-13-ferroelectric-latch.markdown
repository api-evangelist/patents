{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and more particularly to an improved ferroelectric latch.","In semiconductor memory devices, data is read from or written to the memory using address signals and various other control signals. In random access memories (\u201cRAMs\u201d), an individual binary data state (e.g., a bit) is stored in a volatile memory cell, wherein a number of such cells are grouped together into arrays of columns and rows accessible in random fashion along bitlines and wordlines, respectively, wherein each cell is associated with a unique wordline and bitline pair. Address decoder control circuits identify one or more cells to be accessed in a particular memory operation for reading or writing, wherein the memory cells are typically accessed in groups of bytes or words (e.g., generally a multiple of 8 cells arranged along a common wordline). Thus, by specifying an address, a RAM is able to access a single byte or word in an array of many cells, so as to read or write data from or into that addressed memory cell group.","Two major classes of random access memories include \u201cdynamic\u201d (e.g., DRAMs) and \u201cstatic\u201d (e.g., SRAMs) devices, both of which do not maintain the stored data when power is removed. For a DRAM device, data is stored in a capacitor, where an access transistor gated by a wordline selectively couples the capacitor to a bit line. DRAMs are relatively simple, and typically occupy less area than SRAMs. However, DRAMs require periodic refreshing of the stored data, because the charge stored in the cell capacitors tends to dissipate. Accordingly DRAMs need to be refreshed periodically in order to preserve the content of the memory. SRAM devices, on the other hand, do not need to be refreshed. SRAM cells typically include several transistors configured as a latch or flip-flop having two stable states, representative of two binary data states. Since the SRAM cells include several transistors, however, SRAM cells occupy more area than do DRAM cells. However, SRAM cells operate relatively quickly and do not require refreshing and the associated logic circuitry for refresh operations.","A major disadvantage of SRAM and DRAM devices is volatility, wherein removing power from such devices causes the data stored therein to be lost. For instance, the charge stored in DRAM cell capacitors dissipates after power has been removed, and the voltage used to preserve the latch data states in SRAM cells drops to zero, by which the latch loses its data. Accordingly, SRAMs and DRAMs are commonly referred to as \u201cvolatile\u201d memory devices. Non-volatile memories are available, such as Flash and EEPROM. However, these types of non-volatile memory have operational limitations on the number of write cycles.","Another form of non-volatile memory is ferroelectric RAM devices, sometimes referred to as FERAMs or FRAMs. FERAM cells employ ferroelectric cell capacitors including a ferroelectric material between a pair of capacitor plates. Ferroelectric materials have two different stable polarization states that may be used to store binary information, where the ferroelectric behavior follows a hysteresis curve of polarization versus applied voltage. FERAMs are non-volatile memory devices, because the polarization state of a ferroelectric cell capacitor remains when power is removed from the device. Ferroelectric memories provide certain performance advantages over other forms of non-volatile data storage devices, such as Flash and EEPROM type memories. For example, ferroelectric memories offer short programming (e.g., write access) times and low power consumption. However, access times in SRAM and DRAM type memories are significantly shorter than in FERAM devices.","Hybrid memory devices have been developed, which include volatile and non-volatile portions. For example, memory cells have been constructed combining an SRAM cell or latch with ferroelectric capacitors for non-volatile data storage, which are sometimes referred to as ferroelectric latches or FE latches. An FE latch may be operated as an SRAM, with the capability to backup or save the volatile SRAM data to ferroelectric capacitors. In one mode of operation, the latched data is stored to the ferroelectric capacitors each time the data is written. Alternatively, the cell may be operated as an SRAM cell, with the data being stored to the ferroelectric capacitors only in certain conditions, for example, prior to removing power from the device. Upon powerup, the non-volatile data may be retrieved or restored from the ferroelectric capacitors and transferred to the SRAM cell latch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","1","2","1","2","1","2","4","1","3","2","4","1","2","1","3","4","2","1","2","5","6","1","2","5","6","1","2","1","2"]},"In operation, the plateline signal PL is generally held low (e.g., at ground or Vss), whereby the volatile SRAM latch  operates as a normal SRAM cell, with data being accessed along the bitlines BL and BLB for read or write operations via the transistors T and T, respectively, according to the wordline signal WL. To store the SRAM data to the ferroelectric capacitors C and C, a plateline pulse signal is applied by decoder control circuitry (not shown), by which the capacitors C and C are polarized to opposite states. In one example, where the SRAM data is such that NODE is low (Vss) and NODE is high (Vdd), the ferroelectric capacitor C is polarized in a first direction or polarization state since the plateline signal PL is initially low. The plateline signal PL is then pulsed high to polarize the other ferroelectric capacitor C to a second opposite polarization state or direction, after which the plateline goes low again. In this manner, the high node NODE of the SRAM cell  corresponds to C being programmed to the \u201chigh\u201d polarization state, and the low level at NODE has been written as a \u201clow\u201d polarization state to C. Similar operation is found where the data in the SRAM is of an opposite binary value, such as where NODE is at a low voltage level (Vss) and NODE is at a high voltage level (Vdd).","If power is thereafter removed, and is then re-established, the differences in capacitance at the internal nodes due to the opposite polarization states of C and C allow the SRAM latch  to be restored to its previous data state when the supply voltage Vdd returns to the normal operational level. To read the non-volatile data into the SRAM  upon return of the supply voltage Vdd, the plateline PL is held low with the wordline WL deactivated (e.g., low). In one mode of operation, the capacitance difference between the oppositely polarized ferroelectric capacitors C and C causes T and T to turn on before T and T can turn on, whereby NODE is pulled low by T and NODE is pulled high by T, thereby restoring the data state to the SRAM latch . In another possible restore operation, the plateline signal PL is brought high and then low (e.g., pulsed) to provide voltages across the ferroelectric capacitors C and C such that the ferroelectric capacitor having a \u201chigh\u201d polarization state will experience a polarization reversal, with the resulting transferred charge causing the corresponding internal node to rise faster than the other internal node, whereby the non-volatile data state is latched in the SRAM latch .","The reliability of the restore operation in the FE latch  is only ensured if the threshold voltage Vt of the two inverters (T, T and T, T) are well matched. If they are not, the latch  can return into an incorrect data state. Accordingly, there is a need for improved FE latch memory devices combining SRAM or other volatile memory cells with non-volatile ferroelectric capacitors for storing data in a semiconductor device.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of one or more aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention, and is neither intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention, nor to delineate the scope thereof. Rather, the primary purpose of the summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. The invention relates to FE latch memory devices in which internal nodes coupled with ferroelectric capacitors are driven to voltages representing an input data state and the capacitors are then polarized according to the input data state. In retrieving the non-volatile data from the ferroelectric capacitors, the internal nodes are floated and then coupled to a supply voltage to charge the ferroelectric capacitors, with the restored data state being determined according to the which internal node voltage rises fastest. In this manner, the invention avoids the situation in conventional FE latches where the restored data state was susceptible to threshold voltage variations in the latch transistors.","In one aspect of the invention, a memory device is provided, that comprises an input circuit with first and second internal nodes coupled with first and second ferroelectric capacitors, a control circuit, a restore circuit, and an output circuit. The input circuit provides a selectable data latch that can selectively store data from an input, which is then transferred to the ferroelectric capacitors for non-volatile (e.g., recoverable) storage. The input circuit operates in a first mode to provide the input data state as first and second voltages on the first and second internal nodes, respectively. The control circuit operates to selectively provide a plateline signal (e.g., a plateline pulse to the lower terminals of the ferroelectric capacitors) to store the data state as opposite polarization states on the ferroelectric capacitors according to the first and second voltages when the input circuit is in the first mode. In a second mode, the input circuit allows the internal nodes to float for restoration of the data state from the ferroelectric capacitors. The restore circuit operates in the second mode to restore the data state from the ferroelectric capacitors to the first and second internal nodes, and the output circuit provides a restored data state as an output in the second mode.","Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for providing non-volatile data storage in a memory device. The method comprises providing an input voltage signal representative of a data state, providing first and second voltages at first and second circuit nodes, respectively, according to the input voltage signal, polarizing first and second ferroelectric capacitors according to the first and second voltages, respectively, allowing the first and second circuit nodes to float after polarizing the first and second ferroelectric capacitors, coupling the first and second circuit nodes with a first supply voltage, and latching a data state from the first and second circuit nodes while the first and second circuit nodes are coupled with the first supply voltage.","The following description and annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and implementations of the invention. These are indicative of only a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed.","One or more implementations of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout, and wherein the timing diagrams and waveforms thereof are not necessarily drawn to scale.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2C","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["102","130","15","16","102","110","120","130","140","1","2","1","2","1","2","130","140","120"],"sub":["FE","FE","FE","FE"]},"The input circuit  comprises an input node INPUT receiving an input voltage representative of a binary data state, which is high (e.g., Vdd) or low (e.g., Vss or ground) in the illustrated example. Like the other digital voltage levels of the illustrated device , any two-state voltage levels or dual mutually exclusive voltage ranges may be employed for binary signal voltages in the memory devices of the invention, wherein all such variant implementations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the invention and the appended claims.","The input circuit  also comprises a pair of tri-state inverters  and  with enable or set control inputs, and a third inverter . The device input node INPUT is coupled to the inverter inputs of the second and third inverters  and , and the output of the third inverter  is coupled to the input of the first inverter . The first inverter  has an output coupled with the first internal node N, and the output of the second inverter  is coupled with the second internal node N. In one possible alternative implementation, the input may be received on a pair of complementary bitlines (e.g., like BL and BLB in  above), with access transistors coupling BL to the second inverter input and BLB to the first inverter input according to a wordline signal (not shown), in which case the third inverter  may be omitted.","In a first operational mode, the tri-state inverters  and  are enabled via a SET enable signal from the control system , and operate essentially as a latch or SRAM cell, where the SET signal is high in the first mode, and low in a second mode discussed below. In the first mode, the input circuit  provides the data state of the input as first and second voltages on the nodes N and N, respectively. For example, if INPUT is high, node N is high and N is low in the first mode, and vice versa if INPUT is low. Conversely, in the second mode, the tri-state inverters  and  allow the internal nodes N and N to float.","The control circuit  provides a plateline signal PL to store the input data state as opposite polarization directions or states to the ferroelectric capacitors C and C according to the voltages latched at the nodes N and N in the first mode, wherein the control circuit  can be any suitable circuitry or system to generate the various control signals as illustrated and described herein. The plateline node is initially held low by the control circuit  (e.g., ground) in the first operational mode as an input voltage is received at the input node INPUT. As such, the ferroelectric capacitor associated with the high internal node will be polarized in a first direction or data state. In the above example with a high input voltage, N is high and N is low in the first mode, and consequently, C is polarized in a first direction while the plateline PL is low.","Thereafter, the plateline signal is brought high by the control circuit , thereby polarizing the other ferroelectric capacitor C in a second opposite direction, after which the plateline signal PL returns low. Thus, the polarization states of the ferroelectric capacitors C and C in indicative of the input data state. In the other possible case where the input is low, N will be low, N will be high, and the capacitor C is polarized in the first direction when PL is low, and then C is polarized in the second opposite direction when PL goes high.","Once the data (e.g., non-volatile data state) has been stored by polarizing the capacitors C and C, the control circuit  switches the input circuit  to a second operational mode by discontinuing the SET signal (e.g., SET goes low), thus placing the first and second inverter outputs of inverters  and  in a high impedance state, whereby the internal nodes N and N are allowed to float. Alternatively, the input circuit  may be continuously operated as a latch or SRAM cell with the SET signal high until power is removed or until the stored non-volatile state needs to be retrieved. In either case, once the data has been stored into the ferroelectric capacitors C and C, power can be removed from the device (e.g., Vdd goes to ground), and the non-volatile data state is preserved in the ferroelectric capacitors C and C.","The non-volatile data state can be restored or retrieved from the capacitors C and C in the second mode, wherein the SET signal is low and the plateline PL is low. The restore circuit  operates to restore the data state from the first and second ferroelectric capacitors C and C to the first and second internal nodes N and N in the form of rising node voltages as illustrated and described further below with respect to , and the output circuit  provides a restored data state at an output node OUT according to the data state from the capacitors C and C when the input circuit is in the second mode. Although the exemplary device  is illustrated as having a single output node OUT, alternative implementations are possible in which two complementary outputs are provided by the output circuit  having opposite data states (e.g., one high and one low), wherein all such variant implementations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the invention.","The exemplary restore circuit  comprises a pair of discharge transistors M and M for initially grounding the previously floating internal nodes N and N, as well as a pair of charging transistors M and M for selectively coupling the nodes N and N to the supply voltage Vdd, although other implementations are possible wherein the discharging transistors M and M and the PRIME control signal are omitted. Furthermore,  illustrates an alternative implementation in which the restore circuit  includes a current mirror, as described in greater detail below. In the implementation of , a control signal RESTORE is provided to the restore circuit  by the control circuit  and is passed through an inverter . This inverter  provides an output to the gates of the transistors M and M, whereby the charging transistors M and M turn on to couple the nodes N and N to Vdd when the RESTORE signal is high. In addition, a PRIME control signal is provided to the gates of M and M by the control circuit .","A first discharge transistor M is coupled between ground or Vss or other second supply voltage and the first internal node N, and a second discharge transistor M is coupled between ground and the second internal node N, wherein the transistors M and M are operable in the second mode to ground N and N, respectively according to a PRIME signal (e.g., PRIME high) from the control system . To read the non-volatile data in the exemplary device , the control circuit  initially pulses PRIME high to ensure that the previously floating internal nodes N and N are returned to ground prior to charging the capacitors C and C.","The control circuit  then returns PRIME to ground and raises RESTORE to Vdd, where RESTORE may go high before or after PRIME is lowered, or the PRIME and RESTORE signals may be switched concurrently, wherein all such variant implementations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention. For extracting the non-volatile data state from the capacitors C and C, a first charging transistor M is coupled between Vdd and N, and a second charging transistor M is coupled between Vdd and N. When the control circuit  brings the RESTORE control signal high (e.g., thus turning transistors M and M on while the SET input is low in the second mode), the internal nodes N and N are brought up to the supply voltage Vdd, thereby charging the ferroelectric capacitors C and C.","The output circuit  comprises a flip-flop circuit  and an optional output inverter , where the flip-flop  comprises first and second cross-coupled or latch-connected NAND gates  and , respectively, with a first flip-flop input S is coupled with N and a second flip-flop input R is coupled with N. In a read operation to retrieve the non-volatile data state from the ferroelectric capacitors C and C, the flip-flop  of the output circuit  is set or reset (e.g., a flip-flop output Q goes low or high) according to which of the internal node voltages N or N rises fastest. In the illustrated example, the output Q goes low (e.g., the final inverted output OUT from inverter  goes high) where N rises faster than N. Thus, the final output OUT (high) corresponds to the originally stored input data state (high). Conversely, if the opposite data state was stored in the capacitors C and C, N will rise faster than N, whereby the flip-flop output is set low, and the final output OUT is set high. In one possible alternative implementation, the final output OUT may be directly driven by the complementary flip-flop output QB (), in which case, the inverter  may be omitted.","The various transistors of the device  may be of similar channel width and length dimensions to facilitate fabrication processing. In one preferred implementation, the charging transistors M and M are matched with one another and have longer channel lengths to provide drive currents to charge the ferroelectric capacitors C and C relatively slowly, thereby facilitating detection by the output circuit  of which internal node rises faster. Compared with the conventional FE latch  of , it is noted that recovery or restoration of the correct non-volatile data state is no longer inhibited by threshold voltages of the input latch inverters  and . Rather, the charging transistors M and M are both activated by the same signal from the inverter , and the propriety of the restored data state is only limited by the matching of the charging currents through M and M (e.g., or by the matching of currents  and  in the current mirror implementation of  below).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["102","111","112","110","113","114","134","148","144","146","110","130","140","102","120"]},"In the input circuit , the first tri-state inverter  comprises a CMOS inverter formed by a PMOS transistor M and an NMOS transistor M, as well as transistors M and M for selectively coupling the inverter M, M to the first and second supply voltages (e.g., Vdd and ground or Vss in this example) according to the SET enable control signal from the control circuit . Thus, when SET is high, the inverter  provides a low output signal to the gate of M, whereby M couples the inverter PMOS transistor M to Vdd and M couples the inverter NMOS transistor to ground or Vss. With the tri-state inverter  thus enabled, the output internal node N is driven high or low by the inverter  according to the device input. The second tri-state inverter  is constructed in similar fashion using transistors M\u2013M, wherein a high SET signal enables the inverter  to drive the second internal node N low or high according to the device input. The other inverters  and  of the input circuit  are comprised of transistors M, M (inverter ) and M, M (inverter ).","In the output circuit  of , the final output OUT is driven by a CMOS inverter  formed of transistors M and M, which receive an input from the flip-flop . The flip-flop  is an R-S flip-flop comprising first and second NAND gate circuits  and  receiving S and R inputs from the first and second internal nodes N and N, respectively. The first NAND gate  comprises transistors M\u2013M, with a first input (e.g., from N) coupled to the gates of the PMOS transistor M and the NMOS transistor M. The NAND gate output is coupled to source\/drains of transistors M\u2013M, and a second NMOS transistor M is coupled between ground and M, with a gate of M being coupled to the gate of the PMOS transistor M, as well as to the output of the second NAND gate circuit . The second NAND gate  is similarly constructed of transistors M\u2013M, with inputs coupled to the second internal node N and the output of the first NAND gate , and with the second NAND gate output being coupled as an input to the first NAND gate .","An alternate implementation of the memory device  is illustrated in , wherein the input circuit , the output circuit , and the control circuit  are the same as described above in . In the implementation of , however, a restore circuit comprises a current mirror operable in the second mode to provide first and second generally equal currents  and  to the nodes N and N for charging the ferroelectric capacitors C and C according to the RESTORE control signal. The current mirror is a PMOS current mirror comprising PMOS transistors M\u2013M and a resistor R. When the control signal RESTORE is brought high by the control circuit , the inverter  provides a low signal to the gate of M, whereby the upper source\/drains of M\u2013M are coupled with the supply voltage Vdd. M has a lower source\/drain and a gate coupled with a first terminal of the resistor R, where the other resistor terminal is grounded to Vss. The resistor establishes a current through M, which is then mirrored to M and M according to the relative sizes of M\u2013M, wherein the transistors M and M are preferably the same size to provide generally equal charging currents  and  to the nodes N and N, respectively, in the second mode.","Referring also to , timing waveform diagrams , , and , respectively, illustrate various control signals and circuit node voltages to further illustrate operation of the exemplary FE latch memory device  of , and  illustrates a plot of the internal nodes N and N rising during restore read operation in the device  for the case when the stored non-volatile data represents an input high state.  provides a waveform diagram  illustrating set and read (e.g., restore) operations in the device  with power being removed between the set and read operations, wherein the control circuit provides a high SET input signal to place the input circuit  in the first operational mode during at least a portion of the set operation, and lowers the SET input during the read operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["300","1","2","111","112","110","1","2","1","2","1","2","111","112","1","2","122","1","2","102"],"sub":["FE","FE","FE","FE"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["500","1","2","120","1","2","120","15","16","1","2","140"],"sub":["FE","FE"]},"Referring also to , another waveform diagram  illustrates the internal node voltages at N and N for the above-described case where the non-volatile data stored in the ferroelectric capacitors C and C corresponds to a high input voltage.

It is noted in , B, and , that the drive current capability of the charging transistors can be adjusted to control the rise times of the internal nodes N and N during the RESTORE signal, and further that the switching thresholds of the NAND gates  and  can be adjusted through sizing of the various transistors M\u2013M to advantageously optimize the restore operation of the device  such that the node voltage separation is maximized when the higher of the node voltages reaches the flip-flop input signal switching threshold.","Referring now to , another aspect of the invention relates to methods for providing non-volatile data storage in a memory device, wherein a method  in  provides for initially storing or setting the device data state, and a method  of  provides for retrieving the non-volatile data state.
