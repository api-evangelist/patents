{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example 1","Example 2","Example 3"],"p":["This application relates generally to campaign management and more specifically to previewing email templates assigned to a marketing campaign.","Emails are sent out by enterprises for several purposes such as notification, acknowledgement, authorization, etc. Some enterprises market their products, services and offers to a large number of customers through various modes of marketing campaigns such as email campaign, mail campaign, phone campaign, short message service (SMS) campaign, etc. In many instances, the marketing email is created using an email template personalized for individual recipients. For example, certain dynamic portions of the email template are replaced with attributes personal to the recipient. Oftentimes, it may be prudent to preview the email template to ensure that the content of the email is accurate and relevant to the current campaign. However, the content of the email template rendered in the preview may include certain information in a markup language which is unfamiliar to the user.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for customizing a preview of the email templates assigned to marketing campaigns are described herein. In an aspect, the method involves receiving a request to preview an email template. In response to the request, a content of the email template including placeholders is invoked. The invoked email content is then parsed to identify HyperText markup language (HTML) elements for the placeholders. Further, the method involves deriving descriptive names for the identified HTML elements according to a correspondence language of the user. In an aspect, the correspondence language of the user is determined based on the user's language selection at the time of login. In an aspect, the identified HTML elements in the email template are replaced with the derived descriptive names and the preview content is rendered on an output interface.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments-will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for customizing a preview of the email templates assigned to marketing campaigns are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d, \u201cone aspect\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Software as a service (SaaS) sometimes referred to as \u201con-demand software\u201d is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are centrally hosted on the cloud. SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), management information systems (MIS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), etc. SaaS applications are hosted centrally where software and data are stored on host servers. The applications can be run on a PC with an internet connection and a web browser. One such SaaS offering is SAP@ Business ByDesign\u2122 from SAP AG.","The SAP\u00ae Business ByDesign\u2122 solution offers several modules designed to track end-to-end business processes. Customer relationship management (CRM) is one such module designed to support processes that span marketing, sales and service activities. Marketing includes a variety of activities such as creating and running marketing campaigns across multiple channels, connecting with target customers, generating leads, etc. One of the marketing functions supported by SAP CRM module is Campaign Management to execute marketing campaign processes including design, execution, coordination, optimization, and monitoring. A marketing campaign would typically send a message to several hundreds of recipients referred to as bulk messaging. Bulk messaging is dissemination of large number of messages to people across the globe. Typically, in such message campaigns, bulk messaging is processed in batches referred to as batch processing. Batch processing is execution of series of programs or jobs on a processing unit without manual intervention.","Release Feature Pack (FP) 4.0 of SAP\u00ae Business ByDesign\u2122 solution provides for the use of email templates for generating emails for campaigns. The email templates have a pre-defined text as well as placeholders for receiving personal data pertaining to a recipient. The placeholders in the template allow for the personalization of the email sent to the target recipients of the campaign. In an aspect, the email templates are created at an external source (3party) using state-of-the-art tools as a file and uploaded into the CRM system. The content of the email is personalized by simply adding personal data relating to the recipient in place of the placeholders. In certain scenarios, prior sending out the email to thousands of recipients, a user may want to ensure that the content of the email is accurate and relevant to the current campaign. Accordingly, the user may request for a preview of the email template before sending the email template out as a personalized email. However, since the email template is embodied as an HTML text, the email template preview may display the placeholders as HTML elements which may be difficult for the user to interpret and understand. One or more embodiments described herein provide for replacing the HTML elements in the email template with descriptive names, in the language of correspondence of the user, for the preview. The example embodiments illustrated below using  to , describe in detail the customizing of email template previews in marketing campaigns.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","130","140","150","120","120","100","120","110","100","100","120","100","110"]},"In some embodiments, one or more client devices may be associated with administrators of the environment, and may be capable of accessing and interacting with the settings and operations of one or more business applications, and\/or other components of the illustrated environment . Additionally, there may also be one or more additional client devices external to the illustrated portion of environment  capable of interacting with the environment  via network . Further, the terms \u201cuser,\u201d \u201cclient,\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d may be used interchangeably as appropriate and refer to a person or entity. Moreover, while the client device  is described in terms of being used by a single user, this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one computer, or that one user may use multiple computers. For example, several employees of a company, called users, can use the applications deployed on the corresponding client device. For instance, the term \u201cclient device\u201d refers to a system providing a set of business applications belonging to or rented by a particular customer or business entity. Several employees of that particular customer or business entity can be users of that client device and use the business applications provided by or available on this client device.","The environment  is an example and, in alternative implementations, the elements illustrated in  may be included in or associated with different and\/or additional servers, clients, networks, and locations other than those as shown. For example, one or more of the components within the web application server  may be located in multiple or different servers, cloud-based or cloud computing networks, or other locations accessible to the web application server  (e.g., either directly or indirectly via network ). The client device  can access certain business applications built upon a similar, or common, on-demand platform. For example, the client device  may request certain data or data objects of a business application running on the web application server .","In an embodiment, a user logs into the campaign management application from the client device , and creates a new marketing campaign for sending personalized emails to the members of an assigned target group. The creation of a new marketing campaign is part of a campaign definition phase in which an email template (an HTML email form) for generating the personalized emails is uploaded and assigned to the marketing campaign being created. In an aspect, the template may be created external to the environment  by 3party tools. The externally created email template is then uploaded into the campaign management application and maybe stored in a local file. Email templates are the basis on which e-mails, letters, electronic messages like SMS, and faxes are generated and sent to the members of the target group. The content of the email template can be personalized by adding personal data relating to the customer into designated placeholders in the template.","At certain moments such as prior to executing the campaign, i.e., prior to sending out the email template as a personalized email to members of the target group, the user may want to preview a particular email template. The user may request a template for a preview by e.g., selecting a Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) for the email template on a user interface (UI). In an embodiment, the email body of the email template contains placeholders in a certain HTML syntax, as shown in Example 1,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<span class=\u201cvariable\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\/ FormCampaignExecutionPlaceholder\/Account\/FormattedName"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/span>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u201cDear, \/FormCampaignErecutionPlaceholder\/Customer\/AdditionalNameOrLastName, you are invited to . . . . \u201d\n\nAs given in Example 2, the HTML element \u201cCustomer\/AdditionalNameOrLastName\u201d is prefixed with a semantic name \u201cFormCampaignExecutionPlaceholder.\u201d\n"}}}},"In order to provide a preview that is \u201cuser-friendly,\u201d i.e., easy to interpret and understand by the user, one or more embodiments described herein provide for replacing the HTML placeholder elements with descriptive names which are in simple and plain text.

The customization involves, identifying the HTML placeholder elements in the preview content, deriving the associated descriptive names for the elements in the preferred language of the user, and replacing the HTML placeholder elements with the derived descriptive names. The customized preview content is then rendered as a preview to the user on the client device . In an aspect, an application developer may implement a new Form Message type for placeholders e.g., \u201cAPCRM_FORM_CPG_EXE_PLACEHOLDER\u201d having semantic name e.g., \u201cFormCampaignExecutionPlaceholder.\u201d In the new Form Message type, the supported placeholders are added as HTML elements. Each element is assigned a \u2018descriptive name\u2019 which is a language dependent description of the placeholder. The term \u201cdescriptive name\u201d as used herein refers to a UI text which is a description of the attribute for which the placeholder holds the place. The descriptive name is devoid of HTML semantic name, HTML element, and HTML syntax. In an aspect the descriptive name is rendered within \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d in the customized preview content.","In an aspect, the request for preview is provided as a standard HTTP request. In an example, the user interface calls a certain ICF service of the web application server by addressing it via a URL. In response to receiving the request for preview, the campaign management application creates an instance of class \u201cCL_TT_HTML_MERGE\u201d. A constructor of this class invokes the email template as Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) string. This string comprises the email body including the placeholders. The constructor of class \u201cCL_TT_HTML_MERGE\u201d parses the XHTML string into an Extensible markup language (XML) document object model (DOM) tree. Using the XML DOM tree, the class \u201cCL_TT_HTML_MERGE\u201d identifies the HTML placeholder elements within the XHTML string. Subsequently, the application calls method \u201cREPLACE_WITH_DESCRIPTIVE_NAMES\u201d which determines the UI texts i.e., the descriptive names for the identified HTML elements. The identified HTML placeholder elements are then replaced with the corresponding descriptive names and the customized preview content is placed in a context buffer as an XHTML string. The preview handler (class \u201cCL_TT_PREVIEW_HANDLER\u201d) which handles the request retrieves the customized preview content from the content buffer and provides the preview as a HTTP response to the request. The customized preview is displayed in a new browser window.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","100","100","200","210"]},"Upon receiving the request for previewing a particular email template, a content of the email template is invoked as an XHTML string at process block . The string comprises the email body including the placeholders. Further, at process block , a correspondence language of the user is determined. In an aspect, the correspondence language of the user is determined from the user's account settings. In another aspect, the correspondence language of the user is determined from the language preference selected by the user at the time of logging into the application. For example, at the time of login, the user may provide his\/her login name\/ID, password and a language of correspondence, e.g., German. At process block , the preview content is customized according to the user's language setting and rendered on an output interface, at process block . The method  of customizing the preview content is described with reference to .","As shown in , at process block , the application identifies the HTML elements for the placeholders in the email template by creating an instance of class CL_TT_HTML_MERGE. The constructor of class CL_TT_HTML_MERGE invokes the email template as an XHTML string and parses the XHTML string into a XML data object model tree and identifies the HTML placeholder elements within the XHTML string from the DOM tree. Further, at process block , the equivalent descriptive names for the identified HTML elements are derived from metadata information of the Form Message Type.

In an example, a user having a language preference for \u2018German\u2019 may request for a preview of an email template expressed in English language. Typically, a preview of the email template will return the preview content including the HTML placeholder elements in English language. However, according to the embodiments disclosed herein, the customized preview content not only has the HTML placeholder elements replaced by descriptive names, but has the descriptive names expressed in German language according to the user's language of preference.","Referring back to , the preview content which is customized according to the method  is rendered on a UI of the client device .
