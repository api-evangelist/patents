DE-AC26-07NT42677 awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to water treatment. In particular the present invention is directed to the field of plasma spark discharge treatment of water and apparatus therefor.","2. Description of the Related Technology","Produced water refers to water that comes out of shale wells during the production of oil or gas, through a drilling process called hydraulic fracturing. During the drilling phase, the produced water is called flowback. Produced water can contain high concentrations of microorganisms, hydrocarbons, suspended solids, and dissolved inorganic solids.","Plasma spark discharge generators are used in the treatment of water. However, it is a challenge to produce a short-duration spark discharge in produced water because of the high electrical conductivity of produced water. The electrical conductivity of produced water is in the range of 100-200 mS\/cm, which is approximately two to four times larger than that of sea water. As a result of this, the generation of a plasma spark discharge in the produced water is a significant challenge.","Previously, a number of researchers used gas bubbles in the generation of pulsed plasma spark discharge between two electrodes (i.e., HV electrode and ground electrode) in liquids. When externally supplied gas bubbles pass through the space between the HV electrode and ground electrode, a plasma spark discharge is more easily generated due to the lower conductivity of the gas in the bubble. In this case, however, the generation of the plasma spark discharge depends to some extent on the fluid dynamic motion of the gas bubbles. This motion is difficult to control since control must be exerted over each of the size, location and frequency of the bubbles. Thus, a better system than those employing gas bubbles from an external source is required to generate a highly reliable, pulsed plasma spark discharge at a predetermined location, time and frequency (for example, at 10 pulses per second).","The previous methods of using gas bubbles in a liquid to generate a pulsed plasma spark discharge utilized two electrodes, a HV electrode  and a ground electrode , as shown in , with their active surfaces facing each other. The gas bubbles  are provided by the gas injector  and pass between the HV electrode  and ground electrode . When a properly sized gas bubble  passes at a specific location between the HV electrode  and ground electrode , a pulsed plasma spark discharge is generated. However, if the size of a gas bubble  is too small, the pulsed plasma spark discharge may not be generated. Additionally, if the gas bubble  passes the HV electrode  and ground electrode  too quickly, the plasma spark discharge may not be generated. Since the size and velocity of a gas bubble  are not easily controlled in a water-carrying pipe, the HV electrode  and ground electrode  must be specially adapted to provide reliable plasma spark discharge. However, even the proposed geometry using a HV electrode  and ground electrode  facing each other with gas bubbles  passing between them does not provide an environment that can be precisely controlled in order to permit generation of a reliable plasma spark discharge.","Therefore, there is a need to control the introduction of gas bubbles to an apparatus for generating a plasma spark discharge more precisely. More specifically, it is desirable to provide more precise control of, for example, the size of the gas bubbles and the location of the gas bubbles relative to the HV electrode and ground electrode. More precise control would be able to provide a reliable plasma spark discharge in water such as is requried for consistent water treatment.","Additionally, there is a need for a more durable electrode in the application of plasma spark discharge to water and produced water. Specifically, some electrodes made of a sharp needle shape currently suffer from the problem of electrode erosion when employed in a plasma spark discharge reactor of the type shown in .","A durable electrode that is free of erosion, together with a high degree of control of the gas introduced to the system to facilitate generation of a plasma spark discharge is needed.","Such an improved plasma spark discharge reactor will permit generation of reliable pulsed plasma spark discharges at a more precise location in even a highly conductive liquid medium at a predetermined time and\/or frequency (i.e., the number of pulses per second), as desired for effective water treatment.","An aspect of the present invention may be a plasma spark discharge reactor comprising: a HV electrode having a rounded head; a ground electrode substantially surrounding at least a portion of the HV electrode; and a gas passage extending to an outlet proximate to the head of the HV electrode.","Another aspect of the present invention may be a water treatment system comprising, a chamber for holding produced water; and a plasma spark discharge reactor comprising: a HV electrode having a rounded head; and a ground electrode substantially surrounding at least a portion of the HV electrode and a gas passage extending to an outlet proximate to the rounded head of the HV electrode.","Still yet another aspect of the present invention may be a plasma spark discharge reactor comprising: a HV electrode having a rounded head; a ground electrode substantially surrounding at least a portion of the HV electrode; and a gas passage extending to an outlet proximate to the rounded head of the HV electrode.","For illustrative purposes, the principles of the present disclosure are described by referencing various exemplary embodiments. Although certain embodiments are specifically described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be employed in other systems and methods.","Before explaining the disclosed embodiments of the present disclosure in detail, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not limited in its application to the details of any particular embodiment shown.

The HV electrode  and ground electrode  may be made of stainless steel. In  the HV electrode  and ground electrode  are arranged coaxially.

The rounded head  of the PSD reactor  greatly reduces or altogether eliminates the problem of head erosion when compared with a conventional needle-tip electrode, such as that shown in . The coaxial geometry of the HV electrode  and ground electrode  means that both electrodes located on the same side of chamber  and not facing each other as in the embodiment of . These novel geometric arrangements of the HV electrode , the ground electrode  and the gas passage  in accordance with the present invention allow the PSD reactor  to supply gas bubbles more precisely to a location between the HV electrode  and the ground electrode  to enable more reliable generation of plasma spark discharges.","Further, the PSD reactor  of the present invention is also able to reliably supply the gas bubbles at a desired frequency. Certain of these inventive arrangements of the parts in the PSD reactors  confer the ability to generate pulsed plasma spark discharges at multiple locations in a chamber  (such as that shown in ) with a reliable degree of control.","Additionally, the coaxial HV electrode  and ground electrode  configuration allows the PSD device to be inserted through a single orifice in the wall  of a chamber . By creating a single-piece coaxial HV electrode  and ground electrode  set, the installation of multiple PSD devices along a wall  of a chamber  is facilitated. Having multiple HV electrode  and ground electrode  sets permits larger volumes of liquid to be treated within the PSD reactor  per unit time. This arrangement is preferable to devices arranged with the HV electrode  and ground electrode  facing each other, wherein an enclosed reactor of a given volume is only capable of accommodating one set of HV electrodes and ground electrodes.","In preferred embodiments the ground electrode  extends to at least the same plane as head  of HV electrode  and, as shown in , preferably extends somewhat beyond head  of HV electrode . This creates a semi-enclosed space between an interior surface of ground electrode  and head  of HV electrode . The injection of gas into the liquid that is confined in the semi-enclosed space created by the combination of the HV electrode  and ground electrode  causes the gas to displace liquid from the semi-enclosed space. As a result, the injection of the gas into the semi-enclosed space increases the reliability of the PSD device by using confinement of the gas, in combination with gravitational and buoyancy forces to provide a more consistent generation and location of gas bubbles relative to head . Once sufficient gas is introduced to the confined space surrounded by the HV electrode  and ground electrode , the gas will fill at least a portion of the confined space thereby bridging the HV electrode  and ground electrode . The buoyancy of the gas in the liquid is used to direct the flow of gas bubbles in a desired direction and to help confine or trap the gas in the semi-enclosed space since, in various embodiments, a surface of the HV electrode  or ground electrode  acts as a ceiling that prevents a portion of the gas from rising further in the liquid. A pulsed plasma spark discharge is initiated at the precise moment when the gas sufficiently fills the confined space to bridging the HV electrode  and ground electrode .","The coaxial arrangement of the HV electrode  and ground electrode  with the gas passage  provides a more powerful and intense ultraviolet (UV) component as a result of the more precise control of the gas injection into the space that is semi-confined by the HV electrode  and ground electrode . A series of reliable plasma spark discharges initiated at a predetermined or desired frequency enables the intensity of the UV component to be increased, thereby enhancing the performance of the water treatment and microbiological inactivation. The composition of air or the injection of different gases, such as air, nitrogen, oxygen, etc. may be controlled to produce a certain combination of active species as a result of spark plasma discharge. The active chemical species generated by plasma spark discharge in air enhances the intense UV effect thereby increasing microbial deactivation.","The coaxial arrangement of the HV electrode  and ground electrode  with the gas passage  provides spark discharges in water, generating powerful shock waves at a frequency of approximately 8-10 Hz. The shock waves help water to be mixed inside the PSD and rupture the fragile membrane of microorganisms such as sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and acid-producing bacteria (APB), assisting the disinfection process of plasma.","By using different gases (for example, air or nitrogen gas), the pH of the treated liquid can also be controlled. For example, the pH of the liquid may be decreased to a relatively low or acidic pH level such as pH 3, thereby further enhancing the liquid treatment by adding the effect of pH to the treatment regimen.","Discussed below is an example showing the use of a PSD reactor  in accordance with the present invention.","Reference is made to  in relation to the following example. A study was performed in order to determine the effectiveness of plasma spark discharge treatment on the inactivation of acid-producing bacteria (APB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in produced water. Produced water was treated by plasma spark discharge generated using the arrangement shown in . The PSD reactor  used a high-voltage center electrode  and a grounded outer cylindrical electrode . In order to enhance the effectiveness of the spark discharges, small amounts of water and gas were introduced to the plasma spark discharge reactor  through a gas passage  inside the high voltage electrode , which was itself submerged in a volume of produced water.","Both static and dynamic tests were conducted using a plasma reactor containing 1.8-L of produced water. In the static test, produced water was treated over a period of 10 minutes, and samples were taken at discrete time intervals for APB and SRB concentration measurements using the most probable number (MPN) method. In the dynamic test, produced water was pumped through the PSD reactor  in a once-through mode at three different flow rates of 1, 3, and 5 gpm, and samples were taken before and after the treatment by the PSD reactor . In addition, the residual effect of the plasma spark discharge treatment was assessed by two different incubation schedules: (1) incubation started immediately after the completion of the plasma spark discharge treatment and (2) incubation started 24 hours after the completion of the plasma spark discharge treatment.","In the static test, both water samples (i.e., immediate and 24-hour delay incubation) showed a total of a 4-log reduction of SRB based on cfu counts in cases of 10 minutes of plasma treatment, indicating complete inactivation of SRB. In the dynamic test, a 2-log reduction of APB was observed for the case of semi-transparent produced water at flow rates of 1 and 3 gpm, whereas 1-log to 1.5-log reductions of APB were observed for the case of dark produced water at flow rates of 1, 3, and 5 gpm.","In the dynamic test, the energy cost varied within a range of 1.5-10 kJ\/L\/1-log reduction, decreasing with increasing flow rate. The best energy cost for APB treatment was a 1.5 kJ\/L\/1-log reduction, which was achieved in the dynamic test. In general, spark discharge produced strong anti-microbial effects, which increased with plasma treatment time in the case of static tests, and increased with higher flow rates in dynamic tests.","Plasma inactivation is one of the most promising physical water treatment methods for the inactivation of microorganisms in water. The inactivation effect has been attributed to the presence of active plasma species, i.e., OH, O, O*, O, HO, N atom, NO, NO, UV radiation, shock waves, and electric fields produced by plasma discharge [1-3]. Each of these plasma species may play a role in the inactivation of microorganisms [2]. However, most of these active species have a very short half-life on the order of microseconds or less, except for Oand HO[4-6]. The plasma spark discharge of the present invention is able to generate a large amount of active plasma species because of its unique plasma properties and the controlled gas flow introduced within the PSD reactor .","Maximizing concentrations of reactive species in water, as well as maximizing UV irradiation generated by the plasma spark discharge are desirable for bacterial inactivation. When a volume of produced water is treated in a static test by plasma spark discharge for a prolonged period of time, it is possible to achieve maximum exposure of the entire volume to the UV radiation emitted by the spark discharge with a relatively small energy cost of 0.4 kJ\/L\/1-log reduction if the water is transparent [7].","In the case of dark or darker produced water, the penetration depth of the UV radiation is reduced, rendering the UV radiation less effective. In addition, since the most reactive species produced by the plasma spark discharge have extremely short half-lives of microseconds, the water molecules very close to the actual plasma spark discharge are the only ones that come into contact with these active species. Accordingly, effective treatment in a static system is not expected as the entire volume is not expected to have uniform contact with the reactive species produced.","On the other hand, when the water is treated in a dynamic system, most of the water molecules can actually pass very close to the plasma spark discharge, thereby coming in contact with the UV radiation and active species generated by the plasma spark discharge. However, the residence time of the water is decreased significantly within the plasma spark discharge reservoir due to the flow of the water in the dynamic system. Thus, it is expected that the treated water will have a significantly lower exposure time, for example, to the UV radiation, than in the static system, but that the exposure in the dynamic system will be more effective than in the static system due to mixing of the water that occurs in the dynamic system. Furthermore, the mixing of the produced water in the dynamic system will result in a substantially larger portion of the volume of produced water that comes in contact with the reactive species than would be the case in the static system.","Accordingly, the present study was based on the hypothesis that the inactivation of bacteria by the UV radiation can be accomplished instantaneously [8], while the inactivation by the reactive species requires direct contact (i.e., via a diffusion process), whereby mixing of produced water should be a determinative condition for effective inactivation of bacteria.","Thus, the objective of the study of dynamic liquid treatment was to investigate the effectiveness of spark discharge treatment on the inactivation of both APB and SRB in produced water. In addition, the study also investigated the plasma energy cost of the plasma spark discharge treatment of produced water, including a study on the residual effects of anti-microbial properties of plasma-treated produced water.","The experimental setup utilized in the present study for the dynamic liquid treatment system is illustrated in . This test setup consisted of three major parts: the first part being comprised of a PSD reactor  driven by its own power supply  and contained within a 1.8 L reservoir. The second part was made of air- and water-transport systems to provide controlled flows of air and water to the PSD reactor . These two parts are shown in . The third part comprised two holding reservoir tanks\u2014one to store the pre-treated bacteria-containing produced water and the second to store the aerated plasma-treated produced water. The basic approach in the study for this dynamic system was to have both air and produced water pass through the coaxial HV electrode  and ground electrode  configuration, which was itself immersed in a volume of the same produced water. In this configuration, the plasma was discharged at the gas-liquid interface at the end of the coaxial electrode, allowing it to come in direct contact with the contaminated water which was circulated through the plasma reactor from reservoir A to reservoir B via a standard centrifugal pump.","In order to provide a fixed airflow of 10 standard cubic feet per hour through the PSD reactor , an air compressor was used. The airflow rate was controlled with a valve and a pressure regulator. Similarly, to provide a fixed water flow of 30 mL\/min. through the same configuration of the HV electrode  and ground electrode , a micro flowmeter was used.","The experimental setup that was utilized in the present study for the static treatment system is illustrated in . This test setup consisted of two of the three major parts listed in the dynamic system setup\u2014(1) PSD reactor  driven by its own power supply and contained within a 1.8 L reservoir, and (2) the air- and water-transport systems through the coaxial HV electrode  and ground electrode  to provide controlled flows of air and water to the PSD reactor . The basic approach for this static system was similar to the dynamic system approach, except that a static, uncirculated 1.8 L of produced water was plasma-treated within the PSD reactor .","The PSD reactor  shown in  used a three-dimensional plasma spark discharge setup. In order to generate plasma spark discharges, a vertically positioned, coaxially arranged HV electrode  and ground electrode  were used. The coaxially arranged HV electrode  and ground electrode  consisted of a negative high voltage center HV electrode  connected to an HV power supply  and an outer cylindrical ground electrode  with a gap distance of 5 mm between the HV electrode  and the ground electrode  measured in the radial direction. The gap distance may be between 1-10 mm, preferably between 3-8 mm. Both ground electrode  and HV electrode  were made of 316 stainless steel tubes and electrically separated by an insulating material (i.e., glass-filled Teflon) for safe operation. It is noted that produced water to be treated in the PSD reactor  was not permitted to make direct contact with the high voltage electrode  in order to ensure safe operation.","In order to initiate and sustain plasma spark discharges, the vertically positioned coaxially arranged HV electrode  and ground electrode  were operated with a mixture of air and water discharged into the space between the HV electrode  and the ground electrode . In order to discharge the mixture of air and water into the space between the HV electrode  and the ground electrode , a small amount of produced water was injected into the compressed air line at a location upstream of the PSD reactor . Then, the mixture of air and water was radially discharged through six small holes in the rounded head  of the HV electrode . The flow rate of water was 30 mL\/min, while the airflow rate was 10 standard cubic feet per an hour, an optimal condition for the PSD reactor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"220"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},"The energy in a spark pulse was calculated using two different methods: (1) Energy (J per pulse)=0.5 CV=0.5(8 microF)(3 kV)=36 J\/pulse, and (2) Energy (J per pulse)=\u222bU(t)l(t)dt=80 J\/pulse.","Reservoirs A and B were repeatedly cleaned after each test with Clorox bleach solution and tap water and dried. Initial concentrations of APB and SRB varied from 10to 10cfu\/mL for both static and dynamic tests. The cfu counts in all water samples were estimated using the most probable number (MPN) method. Prior to the start of each dynamic test, produced water was recirculated through reservoir A via a bypass line for 5 minutes in order to provide a uniform dispersion of bacteria. Pre-treated produced water samples were taken from both reservoir A and the line just before spark discharge, and were immediately incubated. Three repeat samples were then taken from reservoir B (post spark discharge) for each dynamic test, and left to sit for 24 hours before being incubated.","In the static tests, two water samples were collected at each time interval for cfu counts at t=1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 minutes during the plasma treatment. One of each set of two samples was incubated immediately, while the other of each set of samples was left to sit for 24 hours before being incubated, to test for residual effects of the plasma treatment.","In the case of APB, concentration, measurements were made using a serial dilution of each sample 7 times, with phenol red dextrose added to each dilution vial. The samples were then incubated for 14 days at 35\u00b0 C. After the incubation period, the APB concentration in cfu\/mL was determined by how many of the vials within the serial dilution had turned from red to yellow (dark to light colored), indicating a positive reading of the presence of APB, as shown in .","In the case of SRB, concentration measurements were made by adding a modified postgate's medium B to the water sample, then incubating it for 10 days at 35\u00b0 C. The sample was deemed positive for SRB if the color of the water had changed from its original semi-transparent state to completely opaque and black, as seen in . the exact concentration of SRB within the sample was determined based on how many days it took the sample to become opaque.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},"The SRB concentrations consistently dropped during the period of plasma treatment for both the 0-h and 24-h groups of samples. In the case of immediate incubation (with an initial SRB concentration of 10cfu\/mL), there was a 4-log reduction in the cfu count after a plasma treatment of 10 minutes, resulting in the complete inactivation of SRB in the produced water.","The APB concentrations also consistently dropped during the period of plasma treatment for both 0-h and 24-h groups of samples. In the case of immediate incubation (with initial APB concentration of 10cfu\/mL), there was a 2-log reduction in the cfu count after a plasma treatment of 3 minutes. However, unlike the SRB concentration, the APB was not completely inactivated.","The energy cost [kJ\/L per 1-log reduction] for the plasma treatment was determined using the value of energy density [kJ\/L] and dividing it by the total number of microbial logs reduced. For the aforementioned static plasma treatment test, the energy cost of a 21.3 and a 64.0 kJ\/L\/1-log reduction were obtained for each of the 0-h and 24-h incubation cases, respectively.","Of 25 total static plasma-treated samples, varying plasma treatment time from 1 to 15 minutes and where both 0-h and 24-h samples were incubated, 4 sample times showed a decrease in APB concentration between 0-h and 24-h samples. In the case of SRB, 10 of 25 sample times showed a decrease in concentration between 0-h and 24-h samples.","In summary, the spark discharge in the static treatment tests was shown to be effective in dramatically reducing the microbial cfu count. The residual 24-hour time did not prove to consistently be a major factor in further reducing microbial counts. In one case, the plasma spark discharge was able to completely inactivate SRB, albeit at a relatively high energy cost.","APB cfu results before and after applied plasma spark discharge in dynamic treatment tests applied to relatively clear, semi-transparent produced water can be seen in . These tests were run at 1 and 3 gpm for 60 seconds (with an initial APB concentration of 10cfu\/mL in both cases). Each test was repeated three times, giving a 2\u00b11 log reduction of APB concentration after plasma treatment for both the 1 and 3 gpm flow rates. This resulted in corresponding energy costs of 5.1 and 1.7 kJ\/L\/1-log reduction, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 20","sup":["4 ","4 ","5 "]},"It is noted, however, that SRB concentrations remained unchanged in all dynamic treatment tests, maintaining a constant 10cfu\/mL throughout. Hence, the energy costs for the dynamic tests were strictly based on APB reductions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},"Experimental results in the study indicate that both reactive species and UV radiation produced from spark discharge play a key role in the inactivation of APB and SRB in produced water. The study also evaluated the residual effect of the reactive species in plasma-treated water after the plasma treatment was completed. In static spark discharge experiments, it was shown that a 4-log reduction in bacterial concentration could be achieved, completely inactivating SRB in this case. In dynamic spark discharge experiments, it was shown that an energy cost of 1.5 kJ\/L\/1-log reduction for APB can be achieved. There have been a number of studies on inactivation by plasma with corona, capillary discharge and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) employed directly in water. The energy costs varied from 3.3 to 33.3 kJ\/L per 1-log reduction in these methods.","The most efficient energy cost was 1.5 kJ\/L per 1-log reduction in this study, indicating that the present method of bacterial inactivation has the potential to be the most energy-efficient system for bacterial inactivation.","The results of the present study showed that dynamic flow tests gave more uniform and efficient APB inactivation as compared to the static discharge tests, indicated by the greatly improved D-values for the higher flow rates. This may be attributed to the fact that both the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by the spark discharge were able to be dispersed throughout the entire volume of produced water, as a result of better and more uniform mixing. In addition, the energy cost results from dynamic tests indicate that UV radiation produced from spark discharge also plays a key role in APB inactivation. This is supported by the smaller energy costs obtained in semi-transparent produced water.","However, when comparing SRB reductions obtained in static and dynamic treatment tests, it becomes apparent that the main mechanism of SRB inactivation is UV radiation. In static tests, SRB reductions were first seen after 3 minutes of plasma treatment (3-5 min. of UV exposure). In dynamic tests, the maximum UV exposure time for SRB located in the water was roughly 30 seconds, at a flow rate of 1 gpm, which was too short for meaningful reductions in SRB concentration.","Since no consistent additional residual reductions were seen when sample incubation was delayed 24 hour for both APB and SRB, it can be said that reactive species with longer half-lives, i.e. HOand O, either were not sufficiently produced by the spark discharge, or were not major contributors the bacterial inactivation.","It is to be understood that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the method, composition and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.","Although the invention has been described using relative terms such as \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cout,\u201d \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cover,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cunder\u201d and the like in the description and in the claims, such terms are used for descriptive purposes and not necessarily for describing permanent relative positions.
