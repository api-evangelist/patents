The government has certain rights in the invention.","The size of silica-based nanoparticles affects their physical, chemical, electrical and optical properties. Traditionally, micrometer sized silica particles have been used as catalyst substrates, pigments, stationary phase in chromatography columns, etc. Recently, nanometer sized silica nanoparticles have developed rapidly and become an important class of nanomaterial. By themselves, the size-dependent properties of pure, nanoscale silica nanoparticles are not remarkable. However, when these nanoparticles are combined with various functional molecules, the impact of size becomes significant\u2014especially for analysis applications. The role of silica nanoparticles in these cases is usually as a supporting or entrapping matrix. Two major reasons make silica a useful matrix in this regard and particularly relevant in bioapplications. First, the surface of silica nanoparticles is easily modified based on well-established chemistry. With appropriate surface and internal functionality, these nanoparticles can be linked to a variety of biorecognition agents in many different ways (e.g., antibodies, protein complexes, nucleic acids, etc.). Second, the negatively-charged silica matrix itself provides numerous electrostatic binding sites to physically dope (i.e., adsorb) a wide variety of positively-charged molecules. When doped with bioactive molecules and medicines, these nanoparticles can serve as drug delivery vehicles capable of controlling the quantity and time of release. When doped with dye molecules, these nanoparticles become intensely luminescent reagents capable of sensitively signaling biological targets.","Variations in the size of luminescent silica nanoparticles are needed for effective imaging of a wide variety of biological samples and processes. In cell imaging, the recognition reaction occurs either on the cell surface or inside the membrane. When a nanoparticle is used as a tag, the size of the nanoparticles may affect whether it can reach a target site or not, such as a cell nucleus, for example. Furthermore, the size of a luminescent silica nanoparticle primarily determines its luminescence intensity at the optimal concentration of dye molecules. To enhance the detection levels to meet the required sensitivity of a measurement, various sizes of luminescent nanoparticles are essential.","The size-dependent properties of nanoparticles are varied but can be tied to three mainly beneficial effects. In general, smaller sized nanoparticles provide a higher surface area to volume ratio, faster reactivity and greater mobility than their larger counterparts. However, in some cases, the small size of nanoparticles allows for their enhanced penetration into biological and environmental substrates, which can sometimes lead to negative effects such as cell toxicity or environmental pollution. Thus, in some cases, larger sized nanoparticles are needed for achieving desired properties. Even a small change in size can result in a large difference in several important properties of nanoparticles. Therefore, the precise size of the nanoparticles on a continuous scale is needed for different applications.","The common methods of synthesizing silica nanoparticles are the St\u00f6ber method and the water-in-oil microemulsion method. Although these methods have led to production of nanoparticles of various sizes, the sizes are limited, discrete, and not precisely tunable on a continuous range.","A method for producing nanoparticles of a selected size includes selecting an organic solvent based upon a molar volume of the organic solvent, the selected nanoparticle size, and a known relationship between the molar volume and the selected nanoparticle size, and producing nanoparticles having the selected size in a water-in-oil microemulsion comprising the selected organic solvent.","The methods of the present disclosure are based on the discovery that nanoparticle size can be controlled by the particular organic solvent or blend or organic solvents used in a water-in-oil microemulsion synthesis process. In particular, it has been discovered that molar volume of the organic solvent\/s has a relationship to the resulting nanoparticle size. A method of producing nanoparticles of a selected or desired size in a water-in-oil microemulsion includes selecting an organic solvent for use in the microemulsion based upon the molar volume of the solvent and a known relationship between the molar volume and the selected or desired nanoparticle size. A precise and continuous range of nanoparticle sizes may be produced based on an average molar volume of two or more solvents selected for the microemulsion, rather than limited by the specific molar volume of just one solvent. Here, molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of an organic solvent molecule at a given temperature and pressure, and will increase with an increase in the alkane chain length, or the molecular size, of the molecule. Thus, under the method of the present disclosure, the size of the nanoparticle produced in a water-in-oil microemulsion can be precisely controlled based on the alkane chain length of the organic solvent or solvents used in the microemulsion, with larger nanoparticles produced as the alkane chain length and molar volume increases as described in more detail below.","A water-in-oil microemulsion is an isotropic and thermodynamically stable single-phase solution. It consists of a small amount of water, a large volume of organic solvent (oil), and a surfactant. The surfactant molecules lower the interfacial tension between water and the organic solvent, resulting in the formation of a transparent solution. Water droplets are formed in the bulk organic solvent and serve as nanoreactors for the synthesis of nanoparticles from various precursors. Tetraethylorthosilicate is a typical water soluble precursor for the synthesis of silica nanoparticles. Upon the polymerization of tetraethylorthosilicate, a silica core is formed in the water droplet. As the polymerization is carried out, the silica core grows, and finally a stable nanoparticle is produced in the water droplet. Nanoparticles are not limited to silica based particles and other like materials may be used such as tetra-tert-butyl orthotitanate for forming titanium dioxide nanoparticles, as an example.","The organic solvent, often an alkane, is an essential component to form a stable water-in-oil microemulsion. It was surprisingly discovered that the molecular size or molar volume of the organic solvent molecule has an important effect on the size of the nanoparticle. Prior to this discovery, parameters such as the water to surfactant ratio, the type of surfactant used, the amount of tetraethylorthosilicate, and the amount of catalyst (such as ammonia hydroxide) were altered to produce nanoparticles of various sizes, but the effect of the molar volume of the organic solvent was ignored and unknown. However, it was discovered that by using a variety of organic solvents having differing molar volumes, a significant change could be made in the size of the nanoparticle produced as a function of the molar volume of the solvents. Furthermore, unlike prior methods, the method of the present disclosure relying on the average molar volume created by two or more organic solvents was found to produce nanoparticles of any desired size along a smooth size continuum, rather than the limited and non-continuous nature of sizes produced under prior methods. Additionally, the size of nanoparticles produced under the method of the present disclosure produced nanoparticles having an extremely low standard deviation for each size. The theoretical principle of this discovery can be described as follows.","The size of nanoparticles produced by the water-in-oil microemulsion method is directly influenced by the water droplet size. Thus, to explain the effect of molar volume of the organic solvent on nanoparticle size, it is necessary to explain the same effect on water droplet size in the water-in-oil microemulsion. For this purpose, a simple physical model was adopted which describes the geometric constraints imposed on water droplets of a stable water-in-oil microemulsion. Equation (1) describes that the radius (R) of a water droplet in related to three factors when R is below the critical value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"3","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03d5"},{"msub":{"mi":["C","S"]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03a3"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"The geometric constraints in this model are the number of surfactant molecules per unit volume (C) and the area occupied per surfactant molecule (\u03a3). Also considered is the volume fraction (\u03c6) of the dispersed (water) phase. The term \u03c6\/Cis usually referred to as the water to surfactant ratio and is fixed by stoichiometry. However, the \u03a3 term provides useful insight into the effect of organic solvent, particularly through its changes to the surface area occupied by surfactant molecules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","3"],"sub":"S "},"In addition to the above effect, the molar volume of an organic solvent also affects the number of silica cores formed in the water-in-oil microemulsion synthesis. As the amount of tetraethylorthosilicate, water-to-surfactant ratio, and the type of surfactant and co-surfactant are fixed, the size of the silica nanoparticles is primarily determined by the number of the silica cores formed in the initial state. Because nearly all tetraethylorthosilicate can be polymerized and the amount of tetraethylorthosilicate is fixed, the more silica cores formed the smaller the final size of the silica nanoparticles. Based on the nanoparticle formation process previously described, the number of water droplets determines the number of silica cores, and the ultimate size of the silica nanoparticles is limited by the boundary of the water droplet. Thus, both the number and the size of water droplets in the microemulsion are determining factors for the size of silica nanoparticles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"i":["U","r","R ","U","r","kT","R\u2212r","R+r\/","R\u2212\u03be<r<","R ","U","r","r<","R\u2212\u03be"],"sup":"2"},"Here, U(r) is the potential of inter-droplet percolation, r is the distance between the two water droplets, R is a radius of the water droplet, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and \u03be is a parameter to characterize the penetrable length of the interfacial layer. \u0394\u03c1 is related to molar volume of the organic solvent. A large molar volume corresponds to a large \u0394\u03c1 value. In the range of 2R\u2212\u03be<r<2R as shown in , the value of (2R\u2212r) is very small. However, the potential for percolation will increase as the size of the droplet (R) increases. Therefore, the inter-droplet percolation occurs easily in organic solvent having a large molar volume when the inter-droplet distance (r) is in the range of 2R\u2212\u03be<r<2R as shown in . Therefore, it follows that the size of a silica nanoparticle will rise with an increase of the molar volume of an organic solvent used in the water-in-oil microemulsion.","Under prior water-in-oil microemulsion methods, only a non-continuous spectrum of nanoparticle sizes could be produced by adjusting water to surfactant ratios, the type of surfactant used, the amount of tetraethylorthosilicate, and the amount of catalyst (such as ammonia hydroxide), for example. However, the method of the present disclosure is able to overcome this limitation by mixing two or more organic solvents to produce a continuous range of U(r) and generate a continuous spectrum of nanoparticles that are correlated to the U(r). Particles of a desired size are generated by mixing two or more organic solvents at a specific percentage where each solvent has a different molar volume to produce a desired average molar volume. Under this method, a particle of any desired size is produced by fine-tuning the mixture of the two organic solvents, and a wider range of specific sized particles is available using a wide range of organic solvents having differing molar volumes. For example, as described in the examples below, nanoparticles from about 20 nm to about 100 nm can be produced including all sizes in between.","Luminescent silica nanoparticles were synthesized using different organic solvents and surfactants in the water-in-oil microemulsion, and were doped with fluorescent Ru(bpy). The procedure was similar to standard water-in-oil microemulsion methods except for varying the organic solvents. Briefly, in the quaternary system, besides water and an organic solvent, Triton X-100 and n-hexanol were employed as a surfactant and a co-surfactant, respectively. Triton X-100 is octylphenol ethylene oxide condensate, having the chemical formula CHO(CHO)where n=9-10. 7.5 ml of an organic solvent, 1.8 ml of n-hexanol and 1.77 ml of Triton X-100 were mixed together under vigorous stirring for 20 min. Then, 480 \u03bcl of 1.70 mM Ru(bpy)aqueous solution, 80 \u03bcl of tetraethylorthosilicate and 60 \u03bcl of 28% ammonia hydroxide were added in 20 min intervals. The reaction proceeded under darkness for 24 h. Next, 20 \u03bcl of tetraethylorthosilicate and 20 \u03bcl of N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)-ethylenediamine, triacetic acid trisodium salt (45% in water) were added to the microemulsion for an additional 24 h to form a \u2014COOH group on the nanoparticle surface to prevent aggregation. Finally, the nanoparticles were collected by centrifuging at 11,000 rpm for 15 min. A Hitachi 7500 transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to take images of the developed nanoparticles.","A ternary microemulsion is composed of three components: a surfactant (NP-5), an organic solvent, and the water. NP-5 is a polyoxyethylene nonyl phenol ether, having the chemical formula CHO(CHO). 10 ml of organic solvents and 460 \u03bcl of NP-5 were combined and stirred for 20 min. Then, 90 \u03bcl of 1.70 M Ru(bpy)aqueous solution was added.

Using this ratio, silica nanoparticles with 87\u00b14 nm in diameter were formed. When the volume percentage of hexadecane was reduced and the cyclohexane was increased, the size of the isolated nanoparticles decreased significantly as shown in . When hexadecane constituted less than 20% of the solution, the size of the silica nanoparticles changed very little and remained about 50 nm. Overall, the cyclohexane\/n-hexadecane binary solvent system provided an adjustable silica nanoparticle size range of 50-100 nm in diameter by simply changing the volume ratio of n-hexadecane to cyclohexane. When a ternary microemulsion was used, the size of silica nanoparticles could be continuously adjusted in a smaller size range of 20 nm to 50 nm using a binary solvent system.
