No. 10\/320,529, filed Dec. 17, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,947,028 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/342,382, filed Dec. 27, 2001, each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to handheld data entry devices and, more particularly to an active keyboard system for handheld electronic devices. The active keyboard system dynamically presents available choices on a display grouped to effect unambiguous selection of the available choices through use of input means, thereby providing users of handheld electronic devices with a consistent set of techniques to perform all commonly used functions including entering alphanumeric text and data into the device using only one hand.","2. Description of the Related Art","Portable electronic devices are rapidly becoming smaller while their capabilities are continually increasing. Shrinking size has limited the ability of the user to physically manipulate the keyboard in order to input information into the electronic device and access information from the device. Some electronic devices have been produced with miniature keyboards, but these have proven difficult to use and the keys are too small for fast entry of data with the fingers. Using normal size keys for a complete keyboard limits how small a device can be due to the necessary width of the keyboard. Some companies have created normal size keyboards that break into overlapping pieces when the computer is not in use, but even then the device must still be relatively large.","Today many electronic devices are small enough to fit into the palm of the hand. With such small size it would be desirable to be able to quickly enter data, or to navigate the Internet with one hand, where that one hand not only supports the device but is also able to quickly enter data or commands using all five digits. A device for quickly and efficiently entering data, including full text, with a limited number of keys, such as that provided by the present invention, is needed in order to fully utilize the power of these small electronic devices.","The prior art has shown several methods of data entry using a limited number of full size keys. One such method is the \u201cmulti-tap\u201d method. This method involves using twelve or more keys with several letters or symbols assigned to each key. The user taps each key until the desired letter appears on the device's display. This system allows the user to input complete text messages using a limited number of keys, but it is a time consuming system due to the excessive number of keystrokes and timeouts required, it has no Internet browsing capability, and it forces the user to shift the position of his fingers from key to key, further reducing keystroke efficiency.","Another method of inputting data using a limited number of keys are the systems described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,818,437, issued Oct. 6, 1998 to Dale L. Grover et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,554, issued Jan. 4, 2000 to Martin T. King et al. These systems also assign each key a plurality of values, but eliminate the need to press each key multiple times. The user simply presses each desired key once and the computer attempts to decipher what word the user intended to input out of the several possible words which could be formed from the several letters on each key. If the computer comes up with the wrong word the user can scroll through a number of other possibilities. These systems are effective in reducing the number of keystrokes as compared to the multi-tap method. They cannot, however, be used to input uncommon words and names due to a limited vocabulary, they have no application to Internet browsing, and they cannot be used without the user changing finger position on the keys.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,624, issued Dec. 29, 1998 to Jeffrey A. Grant, is an example of a pocket-sized interface for Internet browsing. The Grant '624 device uses a touch sensitive switch and several keys to allow a user to interface with the Internet. While the Grant '624 device does function to allow a user to navigate the Internet, it shows no way of entering data such as text and numbers, and is not designed for one hand operation.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,853, issued Dec. 26, 2000 to Lisa L. Foote, is also relevant in that it discloses an ergonomic housing for a handheld device. The Foote device fits over a standard electronic device such as a remote control and allows the user to comfortably operate such a device using only one hand. The Foote device does not, however disclose any method for quickly entering a variety of data, nor show any method of navigating the Internet.","Additional relevant art includes U.S. patent application Publication No. 2002\/0060699 A1, published May 23, 2002 for Giovanni D'Agostinin (character input device based on a two-dimensional movement sensor); U.S. patent application Publication No. 2002\/0163504 A1, published Nov. 7, 2002 for Matthew G.

Obviously, other phraseology having substantially the same meaning may be utilized, such as disambiguating an ambiguous keystroke by correlating between keys, selectors, and display readings.","Major components of an active keyboard system  according to the invention include a display  showing a grid , a processor and memory , a first selector , a second selector , and keys , as shown in . Two dimension sensors are sufficient for most applications, but three dimension sensors may be implemented as desired. Active keyboard system software is carried on and\/or is embodied in the memory of the active keyboard system .","The keys  are configured to be operated by fingers without obstructing the display . Either the first selector  or the second selector  may be configured to interpret motion of the system  as input. For example, the first selector  may be a wheel, a track ball, a joystick, a rocker pad, a touch pad, a selector switch, a toggle switch, a key button, an N-state button (e.g., a multi-state button), an N-state selector (e.g., a multi-state selector), or the like. Preferably, the first selector is configured and positioned to be operated by a thumb, but may be operated by any part of a user's hand or a tool.","The second selector  may be configured to interpret motion of the system  as an input, and may be a set of one or more movement sensor(s) configured to sense motion in different dimensions. One such selector may include two or more sets of movement sensors configured to filter out effects of external forces applied to the system . The movement sensor(s) may be configured to filter out effects of external forces applied to the system  by aligning a sensitivity axis of a second set of movement sensor(s) to a first set of movement sensor(s).","In addition, the system  may be configured for ambidextrous use by providing partial or full duplication of the input means on the system . The system  may be configured for ambidextrous use by allowing a user to rotate, reattach, slide, or move parts of the system .

User input  represents hardware status of the selectors(s) and keys, and may be initially processed by an optional microcontroller. The user input  then passes through a motion filter, buffers and timers, and is then evaluated using the adaptive threshold code, the sliding zero code, and the step motion code in the filter . Calibration code may be utilized to control the buffers, timers, and\/or adaptive thresholds. Images on the presentation  are determined by an active application. The user input results in movement of the selection pointer over the grid, a change in the grid outline, and\/or selection of one of the presented choices. The software can produce sound announcement for an available selection, a confirmation for a completed action, or an alert for a failed one. The software is capable to provide a feedback to the filter  for threshold adaptation to improve useability. The application state and user input is continuously reported between the presentation  and the active application .","Effects of movement are shown in the flow charts  and  shown in .  shows how movement of the device  may be interpreted and\/or processed as user input  after determining and\/or ignoring external forces  and\/or accidental movement , thereby separating intentional user input based on the analysis of the forces applied to the device. The flow chart  of  shows how after a reference zero is established , a determination is made as to whether the device has been moved . If the determination is negative, no further activity occurs. If the determination is positive, a determination is made whether the movement was made by the user. If the determination is negative, no further activity occurs. If the determination is positive, a determination is made whether the movement is intentional. No further activity occurs if the determination is negative. Further processing occurs if the determination is positive.","The selector  of  may be configured in a variety of ways, some of which are shown in . A four triangular button configuration of the selector  is shown in . Each triangular button has two legs  and a hypotenuse . The buttons are positioned so that one leg  from each triangular button is positioned next to a leg  of one other triangular button. In this way the hypotenuses  of the four triangular buttons form a rectangle. Each triangular button is also sloped, as shown in , so that the thickness of each button is greatest along its hypotenuse  and least where the two legs  intersect.","A track ball configuration of the selector  is shown in . Track balls are well known in the art and include a spherical ball  which is rotatably secured inside the housing . The spherical ball is in contact with two rotational sensors  and  and a push down contact . When in use, a user moves the portion of the spherical ball  that extends outside of the housing and the rotations are detected by the rotational sensors  and . The user can also press the spherical ball  toward the push down contact . Once the spherical ball  touches the push down contact  the motion of the ball  is detected.","A rocker pad configuration of the selector  with multiple contacts is shown in . The rocker pad has a panel  connected to five push down contacts  (three shown in ). The contacts are positioned one at each corner of the panel  and one in the center of the panel . When a user presses near a corner of the pad or in the middle of the pad the pressure is detected by one of the contacts .","A joystick configuration of the selector  is shown in . Joysticks are well known in the art and have an elongated stick member  which has a bottom and top portion. The bottom portion is moveably connected to a push down contact . When the joystick is operated the user places one of his\/her digits on top of the stick member and tips the stick forward, back, left, or right. These motions are detected by contacts  arranged in front, behind, and to the left and right of the stick member, respectively. The user may also press the top of the stick member  toward the push down contact . This motion is detected by the push down contact .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A\u20136D","FIGS. 5A\u20135E","FIG. 6D","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C"],"b":["68","98","50","54","98","98","104","30","102","100","30"],"i":"c "},"All functions of the active keyboard system software (to be discussed infra) can be controlled through the combined use of both the keys \u2013and the selector  shown in . As described above, the active keyboard system may also, however, incorporate one or more movement sensors to perform many of the functions performed by the selector  through physical movements of the handheld device.","When equipped with one or more movement sensors, the active keyboard system can be configured to sense one or more substantially orthogonal component(s) of movement (e.g., pitch, roll, and\/or yaw of the system) by having the sensor(s) periodically sample the movement component(s) of the system, as shown in . Directions  and\/or  represent pitch (clockwise or counterclockwise about a horizontal axis through the device), directions  and\/or  represent roll (clockwise and counterclockwise about a vertical axis through the device), and directions  and  represent yaw (clockwise and counterclockwise about an orthogonal axis through the device) These types of movements are consistent with the type of movement a handheld device would undergo if the holder of the device flexed, extended, and\/or rotated his\/her wrist.","There are several different types of movement sensors that can be incorporated into the active keyboard system to sense the movement of the active keyboard system, all of which are well known in the art and will only be discussed briefly here as they relate to the functional aspects of the active keyboard system. Movement sensors may be configured to sense a change in one, two, or three substantially orthogonal components of an acceleration, velocity, displacement, and\/or electromagnetic field of a moving object to which the sensor(s) are attached (e.g., the pitch, roll, and\/or yaw of the active system keyboard system) and cause the processor to calculate the movement of the system as a sequence of location changes. Such movement sensors may use gravity, inertia, oscillation, magnetic fields, acoustics, optics, gyroscopics, or other physical effects and principles.","In addition, such movement sensors may configured in the form of \u201csets\u201d of one or more one dimensional, two dimensional, or three dimensional sensors for detecting multidimensional movement. For example, acceleration sensors may be configured as one dimensional sensors. As such, a \u201cset\u201d of three separate one dimensional acceleration sensors can be attached to an object and used to sense movement of the object in each orthogonal direction.","Two or more sets of movement sensors, for example, acceleration sensors, gravitational field sensors, gyroscopic sensors, etc. (e.g., inertial type sensors that track object movement independently from the location of the object), may be incorporated into the housing of the active keyboard system to filter out effects of external forces applied to the system. Placement of the movement sensors is not critical as long as the sensors are capable of detecting their assigned range of movements. It would be beneficial to keep sensors of both sets closely aligned over their sensitivity axis. A second set of sensors may also be external to the active keyboard system.","The active keyboard system software includes a plurality of computer instructions and may be carried on any type of computer useable medium, such as electronic memory, optical memory, magnetic media memory, or the like. The active keyboard system software works with the processor to output information to the display and interpret commands and data entered by the user. When power is applied to the active keyboard system the user has the option to select one of several modes of operation. The modes of operation vary depending on the capability of the active keyboard system. The active keyboard system software has two selection techniques, row selection and column selection. The column selection, made by a selector, selects one of the three vertical columns , , and  by selection pointer  effecting unambiguous input from finger keys of any of the four boxes , , , , located at a crossing between a selected column and row, as shown in . The selected boxes , , , , initiate different possible modes of operation startup, but the same selection techniques may be used to input a variety of values into the active keyboard system.","The active keyboard system can operate in an Internet navigation mode, or can work with applications, such as Windows based applications or the like, with a single selector or two selectors. With a single selector, as shown in , when the active keyboard system is in the Internet navigation mode the display shows a portion of a particular web page. The user can move the displayed view  of the page by using a selector or through the use of the movement sensors. In the Internet mode a cursor  appears in the middle of the displayed web page image. As the user navigates through a web page the cursor  stays centered in the display until the image reaches the edge of the web page. At that point the motion of the image stops and the cursor continues  toward the edge of the screen. This allows the user to \u201cclick\u201d on portions of the web page that are close to the edge of the page. With two selectors, one of the selectors can control the motion of the displayed window over the web page and the second selector can control the pointer.","A grid  with three translucent panes  for typing, dialing, and icon selection of an active keyboard system is shown in . More than three panes  can be used, but only three panes  are visible at a time, the selected pane, the pane behind the selected pane, and the pane on top of the selected pane.","While each pane  of the grid  includes a three column by four row matrix of cells , the grid panes  may be configured with a matrix having any number of rows and columns of cells . Usually, only three columns are visible, the selected column, the column to the left of the selected column, and the column to the right of the selected column. And, in most applications, the number of keys of a particularly configured active keyboard system equals the number of rows in the grid pane of the particular active keyboard system. The keys may be configured to be protected from unintentional engagement (e.g., by the palm of a hand) by being positioned in a groove, by being separated by bars, by being positioned in a pit, etc. The panes  of the grid  are selected through the use of up and down commands, and a desired column is selected by moving the selection pointer  to the associated column through the use of left and right commands. Each cell  can contain a variety of items, such as an alphanumeric character, a symbol, a music note, an icon, an ideogram, a logogram, etc.","The active keyboard system software effects step motion movement of the viewed area and selection pointer which is functionally illustrated as  in . When the viewed area begins at a particular position and the user tilts the system left, the selection pointer moves left, when the device is returned to the middle, the visible grid subsequently moves left. When the user again tilts the system left, the selection pointer moves left. The active keyboard system software effects circular motion movement of the viewed area and selection pointer which is functionally illustrated as  in . When the viewed area begins at a particular position, the selection pointer is on column B and the user tilts the system left, the selection pointer moves left to column A and when the device is returned to the middle, the visible grid subsequently moves left and the selected column A is centered. When the user again tilts the system left, the selection pointer moves left to column D. If column D is the farthest left column the selection pointer remains on column D and the viewed area centers on column D by moving columns B and C to the left of column D.","Step motion movement may be used to move the selection pointer over any image, such as a map image as illustrated as  in . In this example, the viewed image is divided into a number of squares according to the desired zoom level of the map image (e.g., 1:1\u21923\u00d74; 1:2\u21926\u00d78; 1:10\u219230\u00d740, etc.). The desired viewed area is selected through the use of up and down commands, and left and right commands. Step motion movement may be used with a calendar as illustrated as  in . For example, the calendar configuration is done for the active keyboard system in landscape mode. By tilting the active keyboard system to the left, the selection pointer moves one column to the left and a shadow remains. The shadow subsequently catches up to the selection pointer when the device is tilted back, and the process can be repeated.","As described above, the active keyboard system software includes step motion code, sliding zero code, adaptive threshold code, and step or scroll resolution code. The step motion code is functionally illustrated with images  shown in  and with the flow diagram  shown in . A reference zero is established when the system is powered on or awakened. During use, when the actual tilt (acceleration) of the active keyboard system has a value that is greater than reference zero and lower than a predetermined first threshold, no decision is made regarding movement of the selection pointer and the selection pointer remains in position.","A tilt is determined based on periodic movement sensor input over predetermined time intervals (e.g., fractions of a second). When the tilt value exceeds the first threshold tilt value and the average of the next \u2018n\u2019 tilt values is over the second threshold tilt value, the step motion code causes the selection pointer to move over the viewed image in the direction corresponding to the direction of the tilt. As long as the tilt angle remains over the first threshold tilt value, no further movement of the selection pointer is allowed. The user has to return the device into a position with a tilt value below the first threshold in order to be allowed to do the next \u201cstep\u201d.","The step motion code may also be configured to effect a scroll or continuous motion of the selection pointer, and will be referred to herein as \u2018rock-n-scroll\u2019 motion. The rock-n-scroll motion operates when a special key or timer is activated, and\/or an application specific step or scroll flag is set, and causes continuous motion or multiple steps to occur per recognized tilt.","The sliding zero code is functionally illustrated in . When tilt angle value averages of a predetermined number of moves \u2018m\u2019 are consistently skewed as shown by left and right tilt averages, a new reference zero is updated to correspond to the middle tilt value between the left and right tilt value averages. The reference zero may be automatically reset after a period of inactivity, an enforced reset may be effected by depressing a button. A sound confirmation may be emitted for each move and may be different for left\/right moves, up\/down moves, and from a side key. In some cases selections may be preempted by a sound announcement. The reference zero may also be adjusted based on the position of an optional \u2018bubble\u2019 (see  in ).","The adaptive threshold code is functionally illustrated in . The adaptive threshold code may be effected when the user is using the backspace too often, is making too many jumps to get from one grid cell to another, etc. When such activity occurs the first and second thresholds may be lowered or increased, and different thresholds may be effected to move back and forth.","The active keyboard system  shown in  includes a display  with a grid , a processor and memory , a first selector , a second selector , keys , and illustrates the use of an optional virtual bubble . The display  can be external (e.g. in remote controls). The bubble  shows the position of a pointer image and is a part of an application programming interface (API) for other applications.","The active keyboard system  shown in  includes a display  with a grid , a processor and memory , a first selector , a second selector (one or more movement sensors) , keys , and illustrates the use of an optional additional sensors . The display  can be external (e.g. in remote controls). The additional external sensors  can be utilized to determine the true user input as a differential signal between internal and external sensors. For example, the external sensors  may be located in a vehicle carrying the user and the active keyboard system .  illustrates a handheld active keyboard system  configured for use with external sensor(s)  over a wireless communication link.

User input may be rotational movement over the pitch, roll, and\/or yaw axes, and signals received by two sets of identical sensors, properly aligned and separated by space in all three dimensions may be processed by motion filter software. The vehicle movement results in a sliding motion and can be easily filtered out. The system  may have an optional signal equalizer(s) to adjust for the normal dispersion of the movement sensor(s) parameters.","Handheld active keyboard systems may be configured for ambidexterity. A handheld active keyboard system  is shown in  and is configured as a PDA with keys or buttons on the left side of the PDA  and there are two rocker pad or joystick selectors on the top and bottom of the PDA  that enables ambidextrous use by right and left handed individuals by inverting the PDA  so the keys or buttons are on one side or the other.
