{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE 1"],"p":["The invention relates to cleaning compositions and methods of use which employ synergistic combinations of linker co-surfactants and extended chain nonionic surfactants. Detergent compositions according to the invention are useful for removing a number of challenging stains such as those from non-trans fats and fatty acids through the formation of stable emulsions or microemulsions with such oily and greasy soils.","Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water by adsorbing at the liquid-gas interface. They also reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water by adsorbing at the liquid-liquid interface. Surfactants are a primary component of most detergents. When dissolved in water, surfactants give a product the ability to remove dirt from surfaces. Each surfactant molecule has a hydrophilic head that is attracted to water molecules and a hydrophobic tail that repels water and simultaneously attaches itself to oil and grease in dirt. These opposing forces loosen the dirt and suspend it in the water.","Surfactants do the basic work of detergents and cleaning compositions by breaking up stains and keeping the dirt in the water solution to prevent re-deposition of the dirt onto the surface from which it has just been removed. Surfactants disperse dirt that normally does not dissolve in water.","Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) are predominantly used as industrial and domestic detergents as a surfactant. However, while effective, NPEs are disfavored due to environmental concerns. For example, NPEs are formed through the combination of ethylene oxide with nonylphenol (NP). Both NP and NPEs exhibit estrogen-like properties and may contaminate water, vegetation and marine life. NPE is also not readily biodegradable and remains in the environment or food chain for indefinite time periods.","An alternative to NPEs are alcohol ethoxylates (AEs). These alternatives are less toxic and degrade more quickly in the environment. However, it has recently been found that textiles washed with NPE free and phosphorous free detergents containing AEs smoke when exposed to high heat, e.g., in a steam tunnel in industrial laundry processes, or when ironed.","Surfactants are often incorporated into an oil-in-water microemulsion to make the products appear more homogenous. These cleaning products contain a variety of different surfactant systems in 5-20% solubilized oil which are then diluted with water prior to use. The surfactant systems generally employed in these cleaning products include a mixture of anionic or non-ionic surfactants and a short chain alcohol to help solubilize the oil phase and prevent liquid crystal formation. While short chain alcohols are effective, they also contribute to the volatile organic solvent content (VOC) of the product and pose flammability problems.","As can be seen there is a continuing need to develop effective, environmentally friendly, and safe surfactants and surfactant systems that can be used in cleaners of all kinds. This is particularly so in light of several new cleaning challenges that have emerged.","Health authorities have recently recommended that trans fats be reduced or eliminated in diets because they present health risks. In response, the food industry has largely replaced the use of trans fats with non-trans fats. These types of non-trans fats are the most difficult to remove from surfaces. The food industry has also experienced an unexplained higher frequency of laundry fires. Formulas and methods of cleaning to better remove non-trans fats, are prone to cause fire due their substantial heat of polymerization. Non-trans fats have conjugated double bonds that can polymerize and the substantial heat of polymerization involved can cause fire, for example, in a pile of rags used to mop up these non-trans fat soils.","As can be seen, there is a need in the industry for improvement of cleaning compositions, such as hard surface and laundry detergents and particularly the surfactants used therein so that difficult soils can be removed in a safe environmentally friendly and effective manner.","The invention meets the needs above by providing surfactant systems, mixtures or blends including extended chain nonionic surfactants in combination with linker co-surfactants. The mixtures form stable microemulsions with oils and fatty acids which can be the resultant product, such as lubricants, sunscreens, or triglyceride based products. According to the invention these emulsions or microemulsions are stable, irreversible, and can be created at low temperature, for example, room temperature.","In another embodiment the surfactant system or mixture can be used in a cleaning composition to emulsify and precipitate oils and greasy soils, such as non-trans fats and fatty acids. The surfactant system can be used alone as a pretreatment, or as a part of a cleaning composition such as a laundry detergent, hard surface cleaner or other emulsion or microemulsion.","The invention has many uses and applications, which include but are not limited to laundry cleaning, reduction of laundry fires due to non-trans fats, hard surface cleaning such as manual pot-n-pan cleaning, machine warewashing, all purpose cleaning, floor cleaning, CIP cleaning, open facility cleaning, foam cleaning, vehicle cleaning, etc. The invention is also relevant to non-cleaning related uses and applications such as dry lubes, tire dressings, polishes, etc. as well as triglyceride based lotions, suntan lotions, potentially pharmaceutical emulsions and microemulsions.","The surfactant mixture of the invention includes a synergistic combination of one or more extended chain nonionic surfactants combined with one or more linker co-surfactants. The linker so-surfactants comprise mono- and di-glycerides and\/or fatty acid and fatty diacids. This system is highly effective at creating microemulsions with fatty acids and non-trans fats at relatively low temperatures. This system can be used in formulations for laundry detergents, hard surface cleaners, whether alkali or acid based or even by itself as a pre-spotting\/pre-soaking agent.","In a further aspect of the present invention, a laundry detergent composition is provided which includes the surfactant system of the invention, and other detergent components such as builders, enzymes and the like. The laundry detergent product being adapted according to the invention to readily dissolve and disperse non-trans fats in commercial, industrial and personal laundry washing processes or in a pre-spotting treatment.","These and other objects, features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims.","So that the invention maybe more readily understood, certain terms are first defined and certain test methods are described.","As used herein, \u201cweight percent\u201d, \u201cwt-%\u201d, \u201cpercent by weight\u201d, \u201c% by weight\u201d, and variations thereof refer to the concentration of a substance as the weight of that substance divided by the total weight of the composition and multiplied by 100.

The linker co-surfactant is an additive which \u201csticks to\u201d or \u201cassociates with\u201d the extended chain nonionic surfactant and links it with the molecules in the bulk phase, and hence increase the \u201creach\u201d of the surfactant molecules which are adsorbed at interface, thus enhancing their performance. Linker co-surfactants which may be used according to the invention include mono- and di-glycerides, and\/or fatty acids and fatty diacids. Suitable fatty acids are saturated and\/or unsaturated and can be obtained from natural sources such a plant or animal esters (e.g., palm kernel oil, palm oil, coconut oil, babassu oil, safflower oil, tall oil, tallow and fish oils, grease, and mixtures thereof), or synthetically prepared (e.g., via the oxidation of petroleum or by hydrogenation of carbon monoxide via the Fisher Tropsch process).

The optical brightener can include any brightener that is capable of eliminating graying and yellowing of fabrics. Typically, these substances attach to the fibers and bring about a brightening and simulated bleaching action by converting invisible ultraviolet radiation into visible longer-wave length light, the ultraviolet light absorbed from sunlight being irradiated as a pale bluish fluorescence and, together with the yellow shade of the grayed or yellowed laundry, producing pure white.","Fluorescent compounds belonging to the optical brightener family are typically aromatic or aromatic heterocyclic materials often containing condensed ring systems. An important feature of these compounds is the presence of an uninterrupted chain of conjugated double bonds associated with an aromatic ring. The number of such conjugated double bonds is dependent on substituents as well as the planarity of the fluorescent part of the molecule. Most brightener compounds are derivatives of stilbene or 4,4\u2032-diamino stilbene, biphenyl, five membered heterocycles (triazoles, oxazoles, imidazoles, etc.) or six membered heterocycles (cumarins, naphthalamides, triazines, etc.).","Optical brighteners useful in the present invention are known and commercially available.

The composition may be in the form of a unit dose product, i.e. a form which is designed to be used as a single portion of detergent composition in a washing operation. Of course, one or more of such single portions may be used in a cleaning operation.","Solid forms include, for example, in the form of a tablet, rod, ball or lozenge. The composition may be a particulate form, loose or pressed to shape or may be formed by injection moulding or by casting or by extrusion. The composition may be encased in a water soluble wrapping, for, example of PVOH or a cellulosic material. The solid product may be provided as a portioned product as desired.","The composition may also be in paste, gel or liquid form, including unit dose (portioned products) products. Examples include a paste, gel or liquid product at least partially surrounded by, and preferably substantially enclosed in a water-soluble coating, such as a polyvinyl alcohol package. This package may for instance take the form of a capsule, a pouch or a moulded casing (such as an injection moulded casing) etc. Preferably the composition is substantially surrounded by such a package, most preferably totally surrounded by such a package. Any such package may contain one or more product formats as referred to herein and the package may contain one or more compartments as desired, for example two, three or four compartments.","If the composition is a foam, a liquid or a gel it is preferably an aqueous composition although any suitable solvent may be used. According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention the composition is in the form of a tablet, most especially a tablet made from compressed particulate material.","If the compositions are in the form of a viscous liquid or gel they preferably have a viscosity of at least 50 mPas when measured with a Brookfield RV Viscometer at 25\u00b0 C. with Spindle 1 at 30 rpm.","The compositions of the invention will typically be used by placing them in a detergent dispenser e.g. in a dishwasher machine draw or free standing dispensing device in an automatic dishwashing machine. However, if the composition is in the form of a foam, liquid or gel then it may be applied to by any additional suitable means into the dishwashing machine, for example by a trigger spray, squeeze bottle or an aerosol.","Processes of Making Cleaning Compositions","The compositions of the invention may be made by any suitable method depending upon their format. Suitable manufacturing methods for detergent compositions are well known in the art, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,879,584; 5,691,297; 5,574,005; 5,569,645; 5,565,422; 5,516,448; 5,489,392; and 5,486,303. Various techniques for forming detergent compositions in solid forms are also well known in the art, for example, detergent tablets may be made by compacting granular\/particular material and may be used herein.","In one aspect, the liquid detergent compositions disclosed herein may be prepared by combining the components thereof in any convenient order and by mixing, e.g., agitating, the resulting component combination to form a phase stable liquid detergent composition. In one aspect, a liquid matrix is formed containing at least a major proportion, or even substantially all, of the liquid components, with the liquid components being thoroughly admixed by imparting shear agitation to this liquid combination. For example, rapid stirring with a mechanical stirrer may usefully be employed. While shear agitation is maintained, substantially all of any anionic surfactant and the solid ingredients can be added. Agitation of the mixture is continued, and if necessary, can be increased at this point to form a solution or a uniform dispersion of insoluble solid phase particulates within the liquid phase. After some or all of the solid-form materials have been added to this agitated mixture, particles of any enzyme material to be included, e.g., enzyme prills are incorporated. As a variation of the composition preparation procedure described above, one or more of the solid components may be added to the agitated mixture as a solution or slurry of particles premixed with a minor portion of one or more of the liquid components. After addition of all of the composition components, agitation of the mixture is continued for a period of time sufficient to form compositions having the requisite viscosity and phase stability characteristics. Frequently this will involve agitation for a period of from about 30 to 60 minutes.","Reduction of Smoking in Laundry Fabrics","There have been reports of undesirable smoking issues for laundry particularly when a washed fabric comes in contact with a hot iron. This is due to a switch from nonyl phenol ethoxylate (NPE) based detergents to alcohol phenol ethoxylate (APE) based detergents. The problem is due to the residual unreacted long chain alcohols which are highly soluble in APE based detergents. It is well known in the surfactant industry that APEs are more monodisperse and have less unreacted alcohol than the AEs, because the starting alkyl phenols are more reactive than the starting linear alcohols. The use solution cannot suspend all the highly insoluble unreacted alcohol, which deposits onto a washed fabric and can cause smoking when the fabric comes in contact with a hot iron.","The extended surfactants and microemulsions of the present invention undergo two steps of alkoxylation (first propoxylation or butoxylation, then followed with ethoxylation) and therefore have reduced levels of residual (unreacted) alcohol, specifically below 0.1%.
