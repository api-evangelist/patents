title: Mobile device capture and display of multiple-angle imagery of physical objects
abstract: Methods and systems for capturing and displaying multiple-angle imagery of physical objects are presented. With respect to capturing, multiple images of an object are captured from varying angles in response to user input. The images are analyzed to determine whether at least one additional image is desirable to allow generation of a visual presentation of the object. The user is informed to initiate capturing of the at least one more image based on the analysis. The additional image is captured in response to second user input. The presentation is generated based on the multiple images and the additional image. For displaying, a visual presentation of an object is accessed, the presentation having multiple images of the object from varying angles. The presentation is presented to the user of a mobile device according to user movement of the device. The user input determines a presentation speed and order of the images.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software and data as described below and in the drawings that form a part of this document: Copyright 2011, eBay Inc. All Rights Reserved.","This application relates generally to software development and, more specifically, to systems and methods for the capture and viewing of three-dimensional imagery of objects using a mobile or portable device.","The Internet has facilitated the ability of millions of computer users to post and view still photographs and video images across essentially unlimited distances for many different purposes, such as retail shopping, second-hand sales, general informational exchange, and the like. Further enhancing this capability is the advent of Internet-connected mobile devices, such as, for example, smart phones, Internet-enabled personal digital assistants (PDAs), and tablet computers, which now allow users to access this visual information without being located at a stationary computer system.","An overwhelming majority of Internet-related imagery employed for shopping, sales, and other activities involves the use of one or more isolated two-dimensional images to provide the user with at least a basic view of a physical item or location of interest. Recently, various parties have begun providing sets of related images that present more realistic views of the item or location of interest by way of images taken from multiple angles relative to the item or location.","For example, some websites provide examples of panoramic views of favorite indoor or outdoor locations. These views are often accomplished by way of \u201cstitching\u201d together multiple photo images taken at various orientations from a stationary location to yield a 360-degree view of the surrounding area. A user viewing such a photograph may then control the current viewing orientation by way of a mouse or a set of directional buttons.","Some websites may provide a set of images of a particular item, such as a product for sale, that provide a view of the item from a variety of angles or vantage points. In some cases, these images are taken using a stationary camera while the object rests on a turntable that is rotated through a series of angles. The photographs may then be presented to the user over the Internet as a series of related images through which the user may scan, again by way of a mouse or a set of directional buttons.","Example methods and systems for capturing and displaying multiple-angle imagery via a mobile device are presented herein. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. It will also be evident that the types of software development described herein are not limited to the examples provided and may include other scenarios not specifically discussed.","Example Capture and Display Systems and Methods","In accordance with an example embodiment,  illustrates an example mobile device  with an image capture component  that may allow a user of the mobile device  to capture multiple images of a physical object  from a variety of angles relative to the object  and to generate a multiple-angle visual presentation of the object  based on the images. The mobile device  may also be configured to present the visual presentation to the user of the mobile device  according to inputs provided by the user. The mobile device  may be configured to provide either or both of the capture and display functions described in greater detail hereinafter. The physical object  may be any physical object, natural or manmade, of any size and shape, of which multiple images, such as a set of single still images, or one or more video clips, may be taken.","In one example, a user may employ the mobile device  to capture the multiple images of the physical object  through some range of angles about the object, such as, for example, 180 degrees or 360 degrees, via the image capture component . The user may then initiate an operation via a user interface  of the mobile device  to generate a visual presentation of the object , which will allow a viewer to peruse the object  from any of a number of angles as controlled by the viewer. In one implementation, the user of the mobile device  may upload the resulting visual presentation to a communication node , such as a network server, via a communication network , such as, for example, the Internet or another wide area network (WAN). In one example, the physical object  is an object that the user of the mobile device  owns and is interested in selling via an online marketplace website, which may be associated with the communication node . More specifically, the communication node  may make the visual presentation available to other mobile devices for retrieval and viewing for ultimate purchase. Further, the mobile device  may retrieve visual presentations provided by other users for perusal by the user of the mobile device . In other examples, the physical object , as well as the capturing and viewing of visual presentations thereof, may not be associated specifically with an online marketplace website, but may instead be utilized for any other purpose.","In one example, the user of the mobile device  may utilize the mobile device  to capture images of the physical object  from multiple angles, such as by walking 360-degrees around the image and taking a still photo image at every few degrees about the object . In another example, the user may capture the multiple images of the object  by way of one or more video clips or segments taken as the user walks around the object . In another example, the object  may be placed on a turntable or similar device and rotated while the user remains stationary and captures the images via the mobile device . While capturing the images about the object  in such a manner involves a horizontal plane of rotation about the object , angles relative to the object  other than those describing a horizontal plane may be utilized in other examples.","As shown in , the example mobile device  may include at least one processor , memory , a user interface , a communication interface , and an image capture component . The processor  executes instructions provided by one or more software modules stored in the memory , which are described in greater detail below in conjunction with . The memory  may also store other data such as the various images, as well as one or more visual presentations of the physical object  and other physical objects.","Generally, the user interface  facilitates the reception of input to the mobile device  from the user, as well as the outputting of information from the device  to the user. As shown in , the user interface  may further include a display component  and a motion detection component . In embodiments described in greater detail below, the display component  may be employed to provide the generated visual presentation of the physical object  to the user, to provide feedback to the user regarding the capture of images to be used to generate the visual presentation, and to provide other information. In one example, the motion detection component  (such as, for example, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and\/or other motion detection means) detects movement imparted upon the mobile device  by the user while the visual presentation is being presented to the user via the display component  to control various aspects of the visual presentation, as is described in greater detail below.","The communication interface  facilitates communication between the communication node  and the mobile device  via the communication network , as mentioned above. In one example, the communication interface  includes an interface for communicating via a cellular phone network, such as a 3G or 4G cellular network coupled with the Internet. In another embodiment, the communication interface  may be an IEEE 802.11x (Wi-Fi\u2122) interface capable of communicating with a wireless router coupled with the Internet, such as by way of a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or cable gateway. Other types of wired and\/or wireless communication interfaces may be employed as the communication interface  in other examples.","The image capture component  may be any component or system capable of capturing still images and\/or video clips or segments of the physical object  for use in generating the visual presentation of the object . The image capture component  may include, in one example, an image array and one or more optical lenses for capturing light from the object  used to generate the one or more images.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["106","102","104","182","184","186","188","182","116","150","150","184","116","182","150","184","108","150","186","150","150","102","188","108","112","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","150","150","102","200","200","200","150","150","202","150","150","204","150","206","150","208","210"]},"In another example, the method  may be encoded as instructions on a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, such as, for example, an integrated circuit, magnetic disk, or optical disk, which are readable and executable by one or more electronic processors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","102","150","150","304","102","302","150","102","102","302","150","102","102","102"]},"After capturing the images of the physical object , the mobile device  may analyze the images of the object  to determine whether any additional images of the physical object  should be captured, such as to improve the quality of the visual presentation to be generated. In some embodiments, the mobile device  may determine whether at least one additional image at or around an additional angle  should be captured. For example, no images may have been captured of the object  at or near the additional angle , thus resulting in a \u201cgap\u201d in the overall image coverage of the object  from multiple angles. In another example, one or more images may have been captured at or near the additional angle , but the quality of those images may be poor (for example, inadequate lighting, overexposure, and\/or so on) compared to the images taken at the other angles .","In response to such an analysis, the mobile device  may request the user to capture at least one additional image of the object  at or near the additional angle . In addition, the mobile device  may indicate the additional angle  relative to the object  at which the one or more images are to be captured. In one example, the mobile device  may present the images that were captured at angles  adjacent to the additional angle , and indicate to the user that the additional images should be taken at angles  between those indicated in the presented images. Other methods by which the mobile device  may indicate the additional angle  to the user may be utilized in other implementations, such as by way of Global Positioning System (GPS) data. In other examples, the mobile device  may also provide guidance as to how the at least one additional image is to be captured, such as for example, by suggesting photographic flash settings, aperture or capture speed settings, zoom settings, and\/or other settings related to the capturing of the at least one additional image.","In response to the request, the user may then cause the mobile device  to capture the image at the requested additional angle . In response to the at least one additional image being captured, the mobile device  may analyze the previously captured images, along with any additional captured images, and determine if any more images should be captured. If so, the mobile device  may then request more images be taken at one or more angles relative to the object . Otherwise, the mobile device  may then proceed to generate the visual presentation of the object  based on the captured images.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","150","400","150","150","402","500","150","502","150","102","150"]},"Also in the method , at least some of the plurality of images may be selected as a basis for the visual presentation (operation ). For example, less than all of the images may be selected for inclusion in the visual presentation in cases in which some of the images are of poor or unacceptable quality. In another example, at least some of the images may be somewhat duplicative of other images, thus allowing the duplicative images to be ignored, or remain unselected, when generating the visual presentation. A video clip of the object  may include groups of images which are nearly identical. As a result, less than all of these images may be included in the visual presentation in order to simplify and reduce the overall size of the visual presentation.","At least some of the remaining selected images may then be processed at the mobile device  (operation ) to render the images more suitable for inclusion in the visual presentation. In one example, additional images may be interpolated from existing selected images to provide a smoother, or more seamless, visual presentation. For example, two images taken in close proximity in terms of the relative angle to the object  may be combined to form a third virtual image representing a relative angle between those angles associated with the two original images.","In another example, interpolation may be employed within one or more images to enhance the resolution of each image as provided in the visual presentation of the object . In yet other implementations, the resolution of one or more images may be reduced to facilitate viewing of the visual presentation on a relatively low-resolution display device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","150","150","500","500","150","500","500","150","102","102","150","500"]},"By detecting the physical object  within each image , other processing may occur to enhance the visual presentation to be generated. For example, one or more of the images  may be processed to center the physical object  within the image . If most or all of the images  to be incorporated in the visual presentation are processed in such a manner, the physical object  will appear to remain stationary from image  to image  of the visual presentation, thus enhancing the viewing experience.","In some examples, one or more of the images  may be processed so that the size of the physical object  may be rendered consistent from image  to image . In one implementation, the mobile device  may \u201czoom in\u201d and\/or \u201czoom out\u201d on each of the images  so that the overall apparent size of the physical object  may appear to remain constant while a user views the resulting visual presentation. This processing may include, for example, rescaling of the image , either up or down in resolution, to effect a corresponding change in the apparent size of the physical object  within each image .","In at least some cases, centering and\/or resizing of the physical object  within one or more images  may result in the captured portion of the image  occupying less than all of the viewable image area available to the user of the mobile device . To address this issue, the mobile device  may replace one or more portions of the background area  of the image  (see ) with other visual information, such as a solid color or some visual pattern. In some examples, the entirety of the background area  may be replaced in such a manner to enhance or emphasize the physical object  within the image . In one instance, at least part of the background area  may be replaced with a generated or created \u201cshadow\u201d for the object  to provide the image  with some implied depth.","In other examples, instead of replacing the background area , the mobile device  may deemphasize the background area  of the image  by any number of techniques, such as, for example, converting the background area  from color to black-and-white, blurring or defocusing the background area , and\/or reducing the brightness or contrast of the background area .","To further enhance the viewing quality of the visual presentation, the mobile device  may correct or adjust other aspects of the physical object  and\/or the background area  of at least some of the incorporated images . These aspects may include, in some examples, brightness, contrast, color, hue, and the like of the physical object , the background area , or both.","While several different forms of processing of the images  in generating the visual presentation are discussed above, other types of processing, either in addition to, or in substitution of, those forms of processing explicitly described herein, may be employed in other embodiments. In another example, any of the identification operation , the selection operation , and the processing operation  of  may be employed to determine whether the user should capture additional images for the presentation, as described above in reference to the method  of .","Returning to the method  of , the visual presentation of the physical object  may then be generated using the processed images  (operation ). In one example, the various images  may be linked together, or combined, in a single file, or in a collection of files. The user of the mobile device  or another computing system would be able to access and control the display of the visual presentation.  provides a graphical example of a visual presentation , in which multiple images A, B, C (collectively, ) are linked together in a predetermined order so that the user may traverse the images  as directed in the visual presentation . In the example of , the images  are linked in a linear fashion so that the user may progress from one adjacent image  to another according to their angular position relative to the physical object . In one implementation, the images  may be linked in a circular arrangement, such as if the images  collectively describe a 360-degree view of the physical object . While the example visual presentation  of  provides a view of the physical object  from multiple angles lying in a horizontal plane in which the object  is located, in other embodiments, one or more planes of angles, including one or more vertical and\/or horizontal planes in which the physical object  lies, may be represented by the images  of the visual presentation . In such an implementation, the various images  may be linked in a multi-dimensional array or similar data structure so that progressing through the images  in both vertical and horizontal directions relative to the object  may be possible.","In addition, the user of the mobile device  or other computing device employed to view the visual presentation  may also be configured to receive input from the user to zoom in and\/or out of one or more images  of the visual presentation to enhance the viewing of the physical object . In one example, a single image  may be employed for each angle relative to the object , with the zooming function being applied to that single image . In another implementation, at least two images  may have been captured and processed for each angle relative to the object , in which case zooming in or out at a particular angle may involve displaying a particular one of the images  associated with a selected zoom level. In other examples, a combination of image selection and zooming in and out within the selected image  may be utilized.","In addition to the actual images , the visual presentation  may also include various metadata, including, but not limited to, linking information that couples the various images  together in a predetermined arrangement, information describing the range of angles about the object  represented in the visual presentation , information describing the range of zooming available, and information describing the physical object .","While the majority of the image processing and other aspects of generating the visual presentation  are described above as occurring in the mobile device , at least some of these aspects may be accomplished in another electronic system. In one example, the mobile device  may communicate with the communication node  via the communication network  () in any manner to allow the communication node  to perform at least some of the image processing and\/or other aspects of generating the presentation . In doing so, such processing may be performed more quickly, and with less computational burden on the mobile device .","After the visual presentation  of the physical object  is generated, the visual presentation  may be viewed by way of the mobile device , another mobile device not specifically described herein, or any other computing or electronic device capable of displaying the visual presentation to a user. In the examples to follow, the mobile device  of  is employed to display the visual presentation  under the control of the user, primarily via translational and\/or tilting (or rotational) movement of the device  by the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","600","700","150","102","702","102","170","150","102","102","704","706","700","704","706","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIG. 8A","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["102","102","800","110","102","102","802","800","102","800","150","602","602","602","102","102","804","800","102","800","150","602","602","602"]},"In one embodiment, the amount of tilt or rotation applied to the mobile device  may determine the speed at which the images in the visual presentation  are scanned through when displayed to the user. For example, the more extreme the tilt of the mobile device  from a nominally horizontal position, the faster the individual images of the visual presentation  are displayed in succession via the display  to the user. Accordingly, maintaining the mobile device  in an essentially horizontal position (as shown in ) may cause the visual presentation  to provide a constant or near-constant display of an image of the presentation  associated with a particular angle relative to the physical object .","In an alternative example, the user may rotate the mobile device  about a vertical axis (in other words, a \u201cyaw\u201d rotation) to cause the visual presentation  to scan through the images to the left or right, depending on the direction of rotation the user imposes on the mobile device .","In the example of , the mobile device  may be tilted forward or backward from the perspective of the user to cause the device  to present a zoomed-in or zoomed-out version of the presentation image currently being displayed to the user. More specifically, tilting the top of the mobile device  away from the user (or, similarly, tilting the bottom of the device  toward the user) may cause the device  to perform a zoom-in operation  on the current image being presented on the display . Oppositely, tilting the bottom of the mobile device  away from the user (or, correspondingly, tilting the top of the device  toward the user) may cause the device  to perform a zoom-out operation  on the current image. Similar to scanning from image to image, as described above, the speed at which the mobile device  zooms in or out of the current image may be associated with the magnitude of the tilt of the device , forward or backward. Maintaining the mobile device  in a vertical orientation (as viewed from the side of the device ) may thus maintain the visual presentation  at the current zoom level of the image currently being presented via the display .","In addition, tilting of the mobile device  to the left or right, as shown in , may then cause the device  to progress through the images of the visual presentation  in the corresponding direction at the same zoom level for each of the images being displayed. For example, if the current image of the presentation  is being shown at the most zoomed-in level, tilting the device  to the left may cause the device  to scan through the images to the left relative to the object , all at the same zoomed-in level.","In the preceding example, as well as any of the examples discussed more fully below, tilting or rotating the mobile device  in two or more different ways simultaneously (such as, for example, tilting the device  both forward and to the left at the same time) may cause the operations associated with each of these directions to be performed concurrently (such as scanning left in the visual presentation  while increasing the zoom-in level of the images).","In visual presentations  that include images that are captured from both horizontal and vertical angles relative to the physical object  so that upper and lower views of the object  may be seen, tilting of the mobile device  in a forward and\/or backward direction (as shown in ) may cause the device  to scan through the images associated with the upper and lower views of the object  instead of altering the zoom level of an image. For example, when the user tilts the mobile device  forward, the mobile device  may scan through images that progress from a view associated with a side view of the object  toward a view associated with a top view of the object . Similar to the examples described above, the greater the magnitude of the forward or backward tilt, the faster the scanning through the images associated with the higher or lower views of the object . Furthermore, tilting the mobile device  both left or right and forward or backward simultaneously may cause the device  to progress through the images of the visual presentation  in both the vertical and horizontal directions relative to the physical object .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIG. 9A"],"b":["102","800","102","102","800","150","904","102","102","800","150","902","102","102","800","110"]},"In a related example shown in , movement of the mobile device  in an upward direction may cause the mobile device  to execute a scan up operation , in which images associated with upper views of the object  may be displayed, while downward movement of the device  may cause a scan down operation , whereby lower views of the object  are displayed. Further, the magnitude of the movement of the device , such as measured by distance, acceleration, or another metric, may be associated with faster scanning through the various images of the presentation  in the corresponding direction. For example, moving the device  quickly to the left may cause scanning through the images of the presentation  in an apparent leftward direction in an accelerated fashion. Also, similar to the compound movements described above in conjunction with , moving the device  in both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously may cause a corresponding scan through images of the presentation  relative to the physical object .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 9B","b":["102","800","110","102","102","906","102","102","908","102"]},"While certain scan directions or zooming operations are associated with specific tilt or translational movements of the mobile device  in the examples described above, these or other scan or zoom operations may be associated with different movements of the mobile device  in other implementations.","As a result of at least some of the embodiments discussed herein, a mobile electronic device may be employed to facilitate the capturing and\/or viewing of images for an integrated visual presentation of a physical object. In one example, the visual presentations may be associated with the posting and viewing of presentations of objects to be sold or purchased via an online marketplace website via a mobile device, thus allowing users to interface with the online marketplace in a more mobile environment. However, the visual presentations, as well as the objects connected therewith, may be associated with tasks or applications other than those involved with an online marketplace in other implementations, such as social networks, personal web pages, and other computer- and communication-related environments.","Modules, Components, and Logic","Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client, or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)).","Electronic Apparatus and System","Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, or software, or in combinations thereof. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product (e.g., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier in a machine-readable medium) for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus (e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers).","A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communications network.","In example embodiments, operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by, and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)).","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on their respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system, it will be appreciated that both hardware and software architectures may be considered. Specifically, it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware (e.g., an ASIC), in temporarily configured hardware (e.g., a combination of software and a programmable processor), or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set forth hardware (e.g., machine) and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.","Example Machine Architecture and Machine-Readable Medium",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"1000"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), or both), a main memory , and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .

The instructions  may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the static memory , the main memory , and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by the computer system , the main memory  and the processor  also constituting machine-readable media.","While the machine-readable medium  is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d may include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more instructions  or data structures. The term \u201cnon-transitory machine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present subject matter, or that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term \u201cnon-transitory machine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of non-transitory machine-readable media include, but are not limited to, non-volatile memory, including by way of example, semiconductor memory devices (e.g., Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), and flash memory devices), magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks, magneto-optical disks, and CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) and DVD-ROM (Digital Versatile Disk Read-Only Memory) disks.","Transmission Medium","The instructions  may further be transmitted or received over a computer network  using a transmission medium. The instructions  may be transmitted using the network interface device  and any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, mobile telephone networks, Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) networks, and wireless data networks (e.g., WiFi and WiMAX networks). The term \u201ctransmission medium\u201d shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying instructions for execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.","Conclusion","Thus, a method and system to facilitate the capture and viewing of multiple-angle imagery of physical objects have been described. Although the present subject matter has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader scope of the subject matter.
