No. 13\/623,832 filed Sep. 20, 2012, which claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 61\/590,758 filed Jan. 25, 2012, and 61\/537,422 filed Sep. 21, 2011, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","Power utilities all over the world are heavily investing and deploying Smart Meters to enable two-way meter reading. As an extension of automatic meter infrastructure (AMI), power utilities are investing in home area network (HAN) solutions that will enable them to increase the awareness of energy usage among its customers in an effort to be able to charge its customers Time-of-Use (TOU) rates and manage its loads to prevent rolling black outs or brown outs due to peak usage. Wireless is currently the technology of choice among power utilities as the connectivity solution from under the glass of the Smart Meter to the HAN devices in the home. Although wireless is sufficient in most single-family homes, it becomes more challenging due to range and interferences in various environments such as multi-dwellings buildings, rural areas where the Smart Meter is far from the house as well as homes that are built with cement or steel frame.","From the above, it is seen that techniques for improving AMI and how the Smart Meter connects to HAN is highly desirable.","The present invention relates to power meter techniques. In particular, the present invention provides a method and system for extending the automatic meter infrastructure (AMI) for Smart Grid and Demand Response applications in multi-dwelling buildings and rural markets where the Smart Meter is located far away from the individual dwelling or house. More specifically, the present invention relates to the wireless and power-line carrier bridging techniques used to extend an AMI where the Smart Meter cannot connect to Home Area Network (HAN) devices such as in-home displays (IHDs), programmable communicating thermostats (PCTs), and load control switches inside a dwelling or home for power utilities to provide energy monitoring to customers and deploy demand response programs.","As background, conventional Smart Meter technology allows for a wireless connection to a home area network using ZigBee. Each conventional Smart Meter has a digital certificate, commonly called, elliptical curve certification, or \u201cECC.\u201d In typical cases, a HAN device is configured to only a single Smart Meter with associated ECC.","The present invention may be embodied as a wireless and power-line carrier bridge for extending an AMI. The system includes a wireless and power-line carrier bridging data concentrator that connects to a Smart Meter wirelessly and convert the signal to the existing AC wiring in the meter room. The system further includes another wireless and power-line carrier bridge that plugs into a standard AC wall outlet in the individual dwelling or house for converting the power-line carrier signal from the AC wiring to a wireless signal.","In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method for processing electrical use from a plurality of power meters.

But they are fast becoming outdated and it presents a troublesome and expensive burden for Power Utilities to have to replace the meters again, having just spent billions in upgrade costs. The Present Advanced Meter Extension Solution (\u201cAMES\u201d) was developed specifically to help Power Utilities to bridge the meter to the home area network (\u201cHAN\u201d) whilst minimizing cost and resources to do so. See, for example, .","AMES is a revolutionary, patent-pending ZigBee and HomePlugPower-line bridging solution. It converts a ZigBee Smart Energy Profile (SEP) 1.1\/2.0 signal from the meter, injects it over the existing electrical wires of a building using HomePlugPower-line technology, and then converts that signal back into a ZigBee SEP 1.1\/2.0 signal. It offers a secure, reliable and \u201cno-wires\u201d communication link between the meter and the HAN. Although there is technically only one electrical wiring scheme in a given building, each apartment dwelling is segregated from the others through advanced 128-bit AES encryption, so security and privacy is maintained between apartment dwellers.","AMES is designed to be an add-on adapter solution to the existing Smart Meters that are currently being rolled out. It can be used with any third-party meter that embeds ZigBee SEP 1.1\/2.0 as the communication link to the HAN. AMES does not rely on any changes or modification to the existing Smart Meter. It includes a 3G backhaul to a Utility Management Platform (\u201cUMP\u201d).","AMES can also function as a SEP 1.0\/1.1 to 2.0 bridge for Power Utilities that have already deployed ZigBee SEP 1.0\/1.1 and need a way to connect to emerging HAN devices that are SEP 2.0 enabled. AMES consists of three basic components: (1) Concentrator; (2) Bridge; and (3) UMP.","The Concentrator is a utility-grade, single-phase meter concentrator that can be installed in the meter closet. It is capable of connecting up to eight (8) ZigBee-based Smart Meters, converting the signal to a HomePlugPower-line signal and then injecting it into the existing electrical wires. The Concentrator also connects to the UMP for network and device management. There are two forms of Meter Concentrators: One for the ANSI North American market and the other for the IEC worldwide market. The technology is the same and the only differentiation is the form factor suited to each market. The ANSI version is housed in a socket-base compartment that installs between the meter socket and the Smart Meter making installation a snap. The IEC version is mounted below the meter terminal cover.","The Bridge is a device to be installed inside a home, and converts the signal from HomePowerPower-line back to a ZigBee wireless signal. The Bridge appears in different form factors. The basic form is that of an Appliance Module, a wall module that also functions as a Smart Plug for direct response programs. A more advanced Bridge is an energy management gateway that not only performs bridging from HomePlugPower-line to ZigBee, but also acts as the home energy management gateway connecting to the broadband network.","UMP is the network- and device-management server software for AMES. It provides an overview of all devices on the network, details current device network status, and allows for firmware upgrades to AMES and other HAN devices connected to AMES. UMP can be a fully managed to be deployed in a Power Utility's own data center. Integration to a utility back office can be easily achieved through standardized REST API in XML and JSON formats.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"These IHD\/PCT devices can interact with the one or more smart meters via a gateway interface. The smart meters can be connected to a cloud interface or the Internet via a wired, wireless, 3G, or other electronic communication means. One or more of the smart meters can also be coupled to computer processing units connected in series, parallel, or a combination of both. These computer processing units can be which can be configured to respond to various input\/output signals, such as those represented by Phase A, Phase B, Phase C, etc.","The present invention can include a system for monitoring power information. The system can include a power meter bank and a remote data collection device. In an embodiment, the power meter bank can include a plurality of power meter devices numbered from 1 through N, where N is an integer greater than 2. Each of the power meter devices can include a ZigBee transceiver device, which can be configured to communicate the power meter. In an embodiment, the remote data collection device can include a power line communication device, a central processing device, and a ZigBee transceiver. The ZigBee transceiver can be configured to communicate between each of the power meter devices to exchange information between the remote data collection device and any one of the power meter devices.","In a specific embodiment, the remote data collection device can include one or more memories coupled to the ZigBee transceivers. The one or more memories can include a ZigBee network setting information for the ZigBee transceivers for their respective power meter devices. The ZigBee network setting information can include a channel identification information, a PAN identification information, and an optionally extensional PAN identification information. Additionally, each of the ZigBee transceivers can be configured in computer code to a permit joining state and a deny joining state. Furthermore, each of the memories of the remote data collection device can include one or more meter tables. The remote data collection device and each of the power meter devices can be configured to perform a variety of operations.","As an example, the configured operations can include reading a meter table from a memory on the remote data collection device to determine a network connection information. In a specific embodiment, the remote data collection device can provide an interface to the operator to view\/add\/edit\/delete network settings of one or several smart meter devices. The meter table can be stored in a non-volatile memory of the remote data collection device. The configured operations can include setting ZigBee joining information starting with the power meter numbered . The remote data collection device can connection to the power meter numbered , which can be done via issuing a ZigBee start join request in the ZigBee transceiver of the remote data collection device. A time information can be synchronized between the remote data collection device and the power meter numbered . The time information can include reading time status, time of time cluster from meter, or setting the time to the ZigBee transceiver of the remote data collection device.","A check information event can also be performed for the power meter numbered . This check can include retrieving information related to any messages, price, demand response and load (DRLC), and other related information to energy\/power use. For example, once the ZigBee transceiver of the remote data collection device is connected to a smart meter device, it can send a Get Last Message, Get Scheduled Event, Get Last Price command to the smart meter device. The smart meter device can be configured to respond with the appropriate responses to these commands. If these information events are available, they can be stored and forwarding to a corresponding home device. These home devices can include personal computers, hand held computer devices, home area network (HAN) devices, and the like. HAN devices can include the previously mentioned IHD devices, PCT devices, and the like. The metering data, such as energy usage per home, can be read and stored from the power meter numbered . For example, the ZigBee transceiver can issue a global read command to read consumption delivered and receiver from the smart meter device numbered .","The configured operations can also include disconnecting from the power meter device numbered . In a specific embodiment, this can include restoring a pre-configured link key for the remote data collection device. The pre-configured link key can be a 16 byte hex string which is used for encryption application level packets in the ZigBee network. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) can be implemented with the pre-configured link key. The previously mentioned operations can be repeated for the any or all power meter devices. As an example, following the disconnection from the power meter numbered one, these operations can be performed for each of the remaining power meter devices numbered  through N. Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.","In a specific embodiment, the remote data collection device can be coupled to each of the power meter devices in a serial manner from the power meter device numbered  to the power meter device numbered N, then back to the power meter device numbered  to the power meter device numbered N in a continuous loop pattern. Also, the remote data collection device can be provided within a spatial vicinity of the power meter bank. The spatial vicinity can be about two meters and less. The previously mentioned power meter bank can be provided in a spatial region of two meters square or less. Also, the power meter devices can each act as a host device.","In a specific embodiment, the system can include a network device configured with a power line network. The power line communication device can be configured to exchange information between the ZigBee transceivers and the network device through the power line network. In a specific embodiment, the system can also include a utility server configured with a power line network coupled to a world wide network of computers. The remote data collection device can be coupled to the utility server via the power line network and can be coupled to the world wide network of computers. The remote data collection device can also be coupled to a wireless network that is coupled to the Internet.","The present invention also includes a method for processing electrical use from a plurality of power meters.
