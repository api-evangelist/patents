{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates to the field of providing a low heat and flame transfer damper fitting to close an opening in a fire rated barrier having a sleeve or the like. The sleeve housing data transmission lines, such as telephone lines, fiber-optic lines, Cat 5, 5e or 6 data transmission lines or any other sensitive data transmission lines. The low voltage lines can be either conventional copper lines or fiber optic lines. The damper fitting having a vertically sliding cover plate which is attached to the front of the damper by a set screws so that the cover plate slides perpendicularly to the damper and sleeve wherein the damper fitting can provide access to the lines inside the sleeve, when the cover plate is raised. The lines encased in malleable putty which does not harden.","Traditional means of maintaining the integrity of a firewall having a sleeve is comprised of placing a fire rated caulking compound in a sleeve, where such caulking hardens to maintain the integrity of the firewall. A commonly used product in the field of firewall barriers which has an acceptable UL listed fire rating is FIRE CEMENT\u2122, which is made by the 3M corporation and is a synthetic polymer latex caulk which hardens to a cementius like consistency. The placement of such caulking in a sleeve does not allow access to the sleeve so that more wire or other connections through the firewall can be made at future dates, since the caulking hardens and is not readily removable. When more wires are needed through the sleeve, the caulking must be chipped away or drilled through, so as to access the sleeve since the caulking must be placed over the entire sleeve opening in order to insure that the sleeve is not a point of heat or flame transfer through the fire barrier. The chipping or drilling of the hardened caulking exposes the data transmission lines present in the sleeve to potential damage when more data transmission lines are needed through the sleeve, since the data transmission lines are encased in the caulking material. This is a particular point of caution since data transmission lines such as high-speed CAT 5, 5e and CAT 6 data transmission lines are highly sensitive to bending or crimping. CAT 5e and CAT 6 data lines are the most sensitive since they cannot be spliced when severed and great care must be taken to insure they are not damaged when trying to access the sleeve after the sleeve is initially sealed with the caulking since the rate at which data transferred through these lines is diminished or stopped if the lines are damaged. Also, CAT 5e and CAT 6 lines cannot be spliced. If CAT 5e and CAT 6 lines are damaged, the lines must be replaced in their entirety since they cannot be repaired. High-speed data transmission lines, when functioning properly ensure efficient data transfer, yet if damaged must be replaced. Replacement of such lines provides a high cost alternative to the simple act of adding more lines to a sleeve through a fire barrier. Therefore, there does not currently exist a means by which to access a sleeve having existing data transmission lines without risking damage to the lines present in the sleeve and providing an efficient removable fire barrier. Currently, it is not convenient or possible with traditional sealing methods to provide a means by which a sleeve can be accessed so as to insert more data transmission lines in the sleeve, and also provide a fire-rated sealing of the sleeve while preventing damage to existing low-voltage data transmission lines.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a fire-rated damper fitting, which easily accesses a sleeve which accommodates data transmission lines through the firewall.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a damper fitting which can be easily affixed to an existing sleeve so as to provide a device, which does not damage existing low-voltage data transmission lines in the sleeve.","It is further an object of the present invention to provide a damper fitting which is simple in construction and easy to install and remove.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a device, which can be firmly affixed to a sleeve and incorporates a fire-rated putty to inhibit the passage of fire through the sleeve, yet can be easily removed without chipping or drilling.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a damper fitting which does not compress, crimp or bend data transmission lines so as to inhibit data transfer.","The instant invention relates to a device for maintaining the integrity of a firewall having a sleeve. The features and advantages of the present invention are achieved by providing a damper fitting over a sleeve opening through a firewall which can be compression clamped, threaded or attached by body set screws onto an end of a sleeve, and which is capable of releaseably supporting sensitive low-voltage data transmission lines through the sleeve. The damper fitting being comprised of a ring-shaped damper body which can be releaseably clamped on the end of a sleeve by means of a damper having a two-piece design. The two-piece design of the damper body being comprised of an upper portion and a lower portion having a pair of clamping bolts which provide a means by which the body of the damper can be clamped over the end of the sleeve. The damper body also having internal threads on the inside portion of the fitting, which can be mated to external threads on the end of the sleeve so that the damper can threadingly engage the end of the sleeve if the sleeve is threaded. The damper fitting can also be comprised of a one-piece body where the body is slidingly engaged to the sleeve and fixedly attached to the sleeve by means of body set screws. The body set screws locking the damper fitting over the sleeve. The damper body lastly having a perpendicularly protruding planar lip portion on the lower portion of the damper body which does not encroach on the inside diameter of the fitting, thus making usable the entire sleeve and damper fitting opening for the insertion of data transmission lines. The damper fitting also being comprised of a sliding vertical cover plate, slidingly engageable with the damper body portion opposite the threaded end where the sliding vertical cover plate is further comprised of a perpendicularly protruding lip portion. The lip portions of the damper body and the cover plate being slideably engageable so that the data transmission lines rest upon the protruding lip of the damper body and the protruding lip of the vertical sliding cover plate presses against the lines and the protruding lip portion of the damper body so as to hold the data lines between the protruding lip portions. The cover plate sliding by means of a pair of set screws threadingly engaged and axially aligned to the damper body. The cover plate traveling along vertical slots on the face of the vertically sliding cover plate aligned with the set screws so as to be able to slide the cover plate lip portion away from the damper body lip portion.","In use, the data transmission lines rest upon the lip of the damper body portion and the lip of the sliding plate lightly presses down on the low-voltage data transmission lines to minimize the opening to the space between the conductors. A bead of fire rated putty such as SPECSEAL FIRESTOP PUTTY\u2122 made by STI industries or any other similar putty which does not harden and is fire-rated is placed along the inside face of the lip portions so as to encase the data transmission lines in putty, prior to mating the lip portion of the cover plate to the lip portion of the damper body. The cover plate and subsequently the protruding lip portions being fixedly held together by tightening the set screws onto the damper body.","The use of the damper fitting of the instant invention to access the low-voltage data transmission lines in the sleeve efficiently provides a fire-rated closure of the sleeve while providing access to the sleeve for future use in that the set screws can be backed away since they are remotely located and do not come in contact with the putty on the lip portions. The sliding plate can be subsequently lifted to expose the inside of the sleeve, since the putty is malleable, so that repairs can be made or new low-voltage data transmission lines can be threaded through the sleeve. The configuration of the sliding plate, specifically, the attachment of the cover plate onto the damper body provides for a tight fit between the protruding lip portions of the damper fitting to prevent heat and fire transfer through the sleeve without over-compressing the lip portions and subsequently the low-voltage data transmission lines, thus not retarding or damaging data transfer through the transmission lines.","In another aspect of the instant invention, the inside face of the lip portions of the sliding cover plate and the damper body are fitted to accommodate pads so that the fire-rated putty does not come into contact with the inside face of the lip portions. The clamping pads provide for the lifting of the cover plate lip portion away from the damper body lip portion without minor prying of the lips due to the adhesive tendencies of the putty compound thus leaving the existing transmission lines encased in the putty and not subject to damage.","In a second embodiment of the instant invention, the inside face of the protruding lip portion of the damper body is provided with a trough which extends the length of the lip so that the putty is placed in the trough. The trough providing a defined area in which the putty can be placed to insure that the lines are encased in the putty material, thus providing an efficient heat and flame barrier.","In a third embodiment of the instant invention, the lips of the body portion and the sliding cover plate are provided with a curvature to match that of the sleeve and damper fitting. The curvature of the lip portions provide for a cradling of the lines and a means by which to measure the minimum amount of putty that can be used to insure that the firewall damper effectively prevents flame and heat transfer through the sleeve. Further, the curved lip portions are capable of accommodating pads so as to more readily separate the lip portions from the data lines encased in putty.","The foregoing and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the invention.","Referring to the drawings in detail, there are illustrated therein various exemplary embodiments of the damper fitting made in accordance with the teachings of the instant invention. These exemplary embodiments should not be construed as limiting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["3","1","2","1","3","1","2","1","3","2","1","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["30","20","20","4","20","5","6","7","7","7","7","8","8","30","5","9","9","14","3","6","10","20","10","11","20","9"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","a ","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","30","14","15","16","9","5","20","16","12","13","20","9","14","17","15","10","10","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["1","14","20","9","17","10","30","1","3","10","19","3","14","17","14","19","9","14","20","9","17","10","14","19","30","1"],"i":["a","a ","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 and 6","b":["30","21","10","17","20","14","21","17","21","10","20","21","19","14","17","14","17","14","3","21"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 and 8","b":["22","20","14","22","19","22","19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 9 and 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 10"],"b":["30","10","17","20","14","3","10","11","20","18","17","14","21","10","17","21","21","21"],"i":["a","a ","a ","a ","a","a ","a","a ","a ","a ","a ","a","a","a ","a","a ","a"]},"The instant invention as described above provides for a damper fitting which can be easily removed and retrofitted onto existing sleeves, thus negating the high cost of replacing sleeves and data transmission lines that are damaged due to trying to chip out a caulking compound intended to cover the entire opening of the sleeve.
