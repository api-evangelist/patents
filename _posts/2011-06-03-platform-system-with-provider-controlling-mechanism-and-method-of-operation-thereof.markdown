No. 61\/407,152 filed Oct. 27, 2010 and the subject matter thereof is incorporated herein by reference thereto.","The present invention relates generally to a platform system, and more particularly to a system for service architecture.","A platform provides a service gateway for software, hardware, and likes to interface. A service gateway may be an OSGi-compliant host server, server software installed and running on server computer hardware. \u201cOSGi\u201d refers to the Open Services Gateway Initiative, a computing industry organization developing specifications for service gateways, including specifications for delivery of \u201cservice bundles.\u201d OSGi service bundles are software middleware providing compliant data communications and services through service gateways. The Open Services Gateway specification is a Java\u2122 based application layer framework that gives service provider, network operator device makers, and appliance manufacturer's vendor independent application and device layer Application Program Interface (API) and functions. An \u201cAPI\u201d is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.","A service gateway is a separate computer coupled for data communications through a local area network or \u201cLAN\u201d to client devices. Client devices include any device capable of adaptation for data communications.","A service gateway usually is an embedded server inserted in a LAN not only for providing data communications among client devices, but also to connect a wide area network or \u201cWAN,\u201d such as an external internet or extranet, to internal client devices within a home, office, or business setting. A service gateway often is an embedded server installed and running in the same physical device, cabinet or close proximity with a client device.","However, a platform system without has become a paramount concern for the consumer. The inability decreases the benefit of using the tool.","Thus, a need still remains for a platform system. In view of the increasing mobility of the workforce and social interaction, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.","Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.","The present invention provides a method of operation of a provider controlling platform system including: determining a provider criterion for selecting a service provider; determining a device capability for selecting a device service for a peripheral device; generating a selection threshold based on the provider criterion, the device capability, or a combination thereof for executing the device service; and generating a service command based on the selection threshold meeting or exceeding a service request for commanding the peripheral device to execute the device service.","The present invention provides a provider controlling platform system, including: a criteria module for determining a provider criterion for selecting a service provider; a capability module, coupled to the criteria module, for determining a device capability for selecting a device service for a peripheral device; a threshold module, coupled to the capability module, for generating a selection threshold based on the provider criterion, the device capability, or a combination thereof for executing the device service; and a command module, coupled to the threshold module, for generating a service command based on the selection threshold meeting or exceeding a service request for commanding the peripheral device to execute the device service.","Certain embodiments of the invention have other steps or elements in addition to or in place of those mentioned above.

Similarly, although the views in the drawings for ease of description generally show similar orientations, this depiction in the FIGs. is arbitrary for the most part. Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation.","Where multiple embodiments are disclosed and described having some features in common, for clarity and ease of illustration, description, and comprehension thereof, similar and like features one to another will ordinarily be described with similar reference numerals.","The term communication means transfer of information between software and software, hardware and hardware, software and hardware, or a combination thereof.

The second device  can have a means for coupling with the communication path  to communicate with the first device . The first device  can couple to the communication path  to communicate with the second device  to communicate with the third device .","The third device  can be of any of a variety of electronic devices, such as printers, fax machines, scanners, display monitors, MFPs, or other multifunctional image generating electronic devices. The third device  can couple to the communication path  to communicate with the second device . The second device  can have a means for coupling with the communication path  to communicate with the third device .","For a specific example, the first device  can be a particularized machine, such as a portable computing device, a thin client, a notebook, a netbook, a smartphone, personal digital assistant, or a cellular phone, and as specific examples, an Apple iPhone, Palm Centro, or Moto Q Global.

For another example, the third device  can be a particularized machine, such as a printer or an MFP, and as a specific examples, Samsung CLX 3175, Canon LC MF8350, or Xerox Phaser 4180MFP\/N.","The communication path  can be a variety of networks. For example, the communication path  can include wireless communication, wired communication, optical, ultrasonic, or the combination thereof. Satellite communication, cellular communication, Bluetooth, Infrared Data Association standard, wireless fidelity, and worldwide interoperability for microwave access are examples of wireless communication that can be included in the communication path .

For example, the communication path  can include direct connection, personal area network, local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network or any combination thereof.","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the provider controlling platform system  managing a selection process . An application environment  can manage the selection process  to select a peripheral device  for executing a device service  for meeting or exceeding a service request . The application environment  is defined as collection of a computing interface  that enables the management of the selection process . For example, the application environment  can include the extensible open architecture.","The computing interface  is defined as a point of interaction between components of the provider controlling platform system , such as software, hardware, or a combination thereof. For example, the computer interface can represent an application programming interface (API). The second device  can represent the host system that hosts the application environment . The host system is defined as the computing system that executes the modules of the present invention.","The selection process  is defined as series of steps performed by the provider controlling platform system  to determine the selection of the device service  that meets or exceeds the service request . The peripheral device  is defined as an electronic device offered by a service provider  that is capable of executing the device service  to meet or exceed the service request . For example, the peripheral device  can include a variety of electronic devices, such as an MFP, printer, scanner, fax machine, video player, audio player, or combination thereof. The peripheral device  can include the third device .","The device service  is defined as a function of the electronic device that can be executed by running software, hardware, or a combination thereof of the electronic device, such as processing, compressing, storing, printing, communicating, displaying, or a combination thereof of digital data. The service request  is defined as a demand made by the first device  to access the third device , such as the peripheral device , to execute the device service . For example, the service request  can request the provider controlling platform system  to command the peripheral device  to execute the device service  representing color printing.","The selection process  can include a variety of steps to determine the selection of the device service . For example, the selection process  can consider a provider criterion . The provider criterion  is defined as a rule specified by a service provider  that defines when the device service  should be selected to meet or exceed the service request .","The service provider  is defined as an entity that offers the peripheral device  with the device service  who registers the provider criterion  with the provider controlling platform system . For example, the service provider  can communicate via the communication path  to submit the provider criterion  to register when the device service  can be executed on the provider controlling platform system . In this example depicted in , the provider controlling platform system  can communicate with three of the service provider .","The provider criterion  can include a variety of conditions to trigger the selection of the device service . For example, the provider criterion  can define the selection of the device service  based on a manufacturer of the peripheral device . For example, the manufacturer can represent the maker of the electronic devices, such as Canon\u2122, Samsung\u2122, or Xerox\u2122. For a specific example, the provider criterion  can define that only the peripheral device  manufactured by Canon\u2122 can meet the service request . Although the peripheral device  manufactured by others is also available to execute the device service  to meet the service request , the provider criterion  can restrict the selection of the device service  for the peripheral device  manufactured by Canon\u2122 to meet or exceed the service request .","For a different example, the provider criterion  can define the selection of the device service  based on a device status . The device status  is defined as a state or condition of the peripheral device . For a specific example, the provider criterion  can define that if the device service  representing printing for the peripheral device  representing an MFP in the first floor copy room is unavailable, then the peripheral device  representing a printer in the second floor break room will be selected to meet the service request  for printing.","The selection process  can consider a device capability  to determine if the peripheral device  should be selected to meet or exceed the service request . The device capability  is defined as an ability of the peripheral device  to perform a particular function. The ability of the peripheral device  can represent the device service , such as processing, compressing, storing, printing, communicating, displaying, or a combination.","For example, the peripheral device  can be a fax machine and the device capability  can be faxing documents. The service request  is for printing documents. Based on the device capability , the peripheral device  will not be selected to meet the service request .","The selection process  can include a platform criterion . The platform criterion  is defined as a rule specified by the application environment  that defines when the device service  should be selected to meet or exceed the service request .","The platform criterion  can include a variety of conditions to trigger the selection of the device service . For example, the platform criterion  can define the selection of the device service  based on an execution order . The execution order  is defined as the order of priority for selecting the multiple numbers of the service provider  to execute the device service  for meeting or exceeding the service request . For example, the execution order  can prioritize the execution of the device service  offered by the service provider  located in South Korea before the execution of the device service  offered by the service provider  located in China.","For a different example, the platform criterion  can define the selection of the device service  based on a set of inputs. For example, the set of inputs can include the multiple numbers of the service request  made by multiple numbers of the first device . If the number of the service request  and the number of the first device  making the service request  exceeds a predefined threshold, the platform criterion  can trigger the provider controlling platform system  to activate the peripheral device  with the device status  of idle to meet or exceed the service request .","For another example, the provider criterion  can designate the execution of the device service  for the peripheral device  manufactured by a particular manufacturer. For a specific example, the provider criterion  can designate the execution of the device service  for the peripheral device  manufactured by Canon\u2122.","However, the platform criterion  can prioritize the manufacturer specified in the service request . For example, the service request  seeks the device service  of the peripheral device  manufactured by Samsung\u2122. The platform criterion  can override the provider criterion  and permit the provider controlling platform system  to execute the device service  of the peripheral device  manufactured by Samsung\u2122.","The selection process  can include a selection threshold . The selection threshold  is defined as the condition required by the provider controlling platform system  to select the device service  for meeting or exceeding the service request . The selection threshold  can be generated by a variety of combinations of inputs, such as the provider criterion , the device capability , or a combination thereof.","For example, the selection threshold  can include the device capability  representing color printing and the provider criterion  representing the peripheral device  manufactured by Xerox\u2122. The service request  seeks the peripheral device  to execute the device service  representing a black monochrome printing. Because the selection threshold  does not meet the service request , the provider controlling platform system  cannot command the peripheral device  manufactured by Xerox\u2122 to execute the device service .","In a different example, the service request  seeks color printing by the peripheral device  manufactured by any of the manufacturer. Because the selection threshold  exceeds the service request , the provider controlling platform system  can generate a service command  to command the peripheral device  to execute the device service . The service command  is defined as the demand made by the provider controlling platform system  to the peripheral device  for executing the device service  to meet or exceed the service request .","Continuing with the previous example, if the selection threshold  fails to meet the service request , the provider controlling platform system  can execute a default service  to respond to the service request . The default service  is defined as the device service  provided when the selection threshold  fails to meet the service request .","For example, the service request  seeks the color printing of documents. However, the device capability  is limited to black and white printing. The default service  can represent black and white printing. The provider controlling platform system  can execute the default service  to respond to the service request  to print documents black and white printing.","The selection process  can consider a device configuration . The device configuration  is defined as the properties of the peripheral device  for registering the peripheral device  to the provider controlling platform system . The property of the peripheral device  is defined as the makeup of the peripheral device , such as the device capability  of the peripheral device , manufacturer of the peripheral device , information related to the service provider , or a combination thereof.","The selection process  can include a service listing . The service listing  is defined as the compilation of the device service , the peripheral device , the service provider , or a combination thereof registered to the provider controlling platform system  that are available for the first device  to make the service request . For example, the service listing  can include the device service  offered by each of the service provider . For another example, the service listing  can include the peripheral device  offered by each of the service provider .","The selection process  can include a collection criterion . The collection criterion  is defined as the rule specified by the provider controlling platform system  to collect a command result  for executing the service command . The command result  is defined as the effect from executing the service command .","The collection criterion  can include a variety of conditions to trigger the collection of the command result . For example, the collection criterion  can define the collection of the command result  for meeting or exceeding the service request  for printing documents. For another example, the collection criterion  can define the collection of the command result  for executing the device service  offered by one the service provider . For a different example, the collection criterion  can define the collection of the command result  for failing to meet the service request , but responding to the service request  by executing the default service .","It has been discovered that the present invention provides the selection process  with the ability to consider multiple factors to command the execution of the devise service  automatically and dynamically for meeting or exceeding the service request . More specifically, the consideration of the platform criterion , the selection threshold , or the combination thereof by the selection process  improves efficiency and productivity for the provider controlling platform system  to meet or exceed the service request . As a result, the sender of the service request  can expect the execution of the device service  that is best suited with minimal involvement in selecting the device service .","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the computing interface  of the application environment  interacting with the first device  and the service provider . The first device  and the service provider  can communicate with the computing interface  via the communication path .","The computing interface  can include a client interface . The client interface  is defined as a point of interaction between the provider controlling platform system  and the first device . Furthermore, the provider controlling platform system  can provide the APIs for the first device  to send the service request  to access the peripheral device  for executing the device service  of . The client interface  can include a client framework interface  and a client service interface .","The client framework interface  is defined as the point of interaction between the first device  and the service provider  registered to the provider controlling platform system . The client service interface  is defined as the point of interaction between the first device  and the device service  of . Details regarding the client framework interface  and the client service interface  will be discussed later.","The computing interface  can include a provider interface . The provider interface  is defined as the point of interaction between the provider controlling platform system  and the service provider . Furthermore, the provider interface  provides the APIs for the service provider  to define provider criterion , the device capability , or a combination thereof to the provider controlling platform system . The provider interface  can include a provider framework interface  and a provider service interface .","The provider framework interface  is defined as the point of interaction between the service provider  and the provider controlling platform system  where the service provider  can access the APIs provided by the provider controlling platform system . The provider service interface  is defined as the point of interaction between the service provider  and the provider controlling platform system  where the service provider  can expand the APIs for the provider controlling platform system  based on registering the provider criterion , the device capability , or a combination thereof.","The application environment  can conceal the APIs available in the provider interface  from the user of the first device . In contrast, the service provider  has visibility to the APIs available in the client interface  and the provider interface . The details regarding the provider framework interface  and the provider service interface  will be discussed later.","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the client interface . The client interface  can include APIs for the first device  of  to access the service provider  of , the device service  of , or the combination thereof registered to the provider controlling platform system .","For example, the client framework interface  can include the IProviderManagerService. The first device  can access the device service  by interfacing with the APIs for IProviderManagerService to access the device service  registered to the provider controlling platform system  for all of the service provider . Furthermore, the first device  can interface with IProviderManagerService to discover the service provider  registered to the provider controlling platform system .","For another example, the client service interface  can include the IProvider. The first device  can access the device service  by interface with the APIs for IProvider to access the device service  registered by the service provider  individually.","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the provider interface . The provider interface  can include APIs to register the provider criterion  of , the device capability  of , or a combination thereof by the service provider  of .","For example, the provider frame work interface  can include IProviderManagerSpiService to register or unregister the service provider  from the provider controlling platform system . Furthermore, the service provider  can interface with IProviderManagerSpiService to access the provider criterion  registered on the provider controlling platform system .","For another example, the provider service interface  can include the IEvaluatorCriteriaSpiService. The service provider  can specify the provider criterion  by interfacing with the APIs for IEvaluatorCriteriaSpiService to the provider controlling platform system .","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the selection process  for selecting the device service  of  to meet or exceed the service request . The selection process  can be represented by a logical block representing elements introduced in . The logical sequence is also represented by a first decision block , a second decision block , and a third decision block . The first decision block , the second decision block , and the third decision block  can determine which sequence will follow after each of the decision blocks results in \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d result.","For example, the first device  can send the service request  for the device service  of  to the second device . The application environment , represented by a logical block, can receive the service request  to determine whether the provider controlling platform system  can meet or exceed the service request .","The application environment  can first consider the platform criterion  represented in a logical block. If the rules set by the platform criterion  are met, the result to the first decision block  will be a \u201cYes.\u201d Subsequently, the device service  designated by the platform criterion  will be returned to the application environment . The application environment  can generate the service command  to command the third device  to execute the device service  designated by the platform criterion .","However, if the rules set by the platform criterion  are not met, the result to the first decision block  will be a \u201cNo.\u201d Subsequently, the logical sequence will move on to a provider logical block .

The device peripheral interface  can also be used for communication that is external to the third device .","The device peripheral interface  can receive information from the other functional units or from external sources, or can transmit information to the other functional units or to external destinations. The external sources and the external destinations refer to sources and destinations external to the third device .","The device peripheral interface  can include different implementations depending on which functional units or external units are being interfaced with the device peripheral unit . The device peripheral interface  can be implemented with technologies and techniques similar to the implementation of the first control interface .","The device communication unit  can enable external communication to and from the third device . For example, the device communication unit  can permit the third device  to communicate with the second device , an attachment, such as an electronic device or a computer desktop, and the communication path . The device communication unit  can send the command result  of , can receive the service command  of , or a combination thereof.","Referring now to , therein is shown a control flow of the provider controlling platform system . The provider controlling platform system  can include a registration module . The registration module  registers the service provider  of  and the peripheral device  of  offered to execute the device service  of . For example, the registration module  can receive the device configuration  of  for registering the service provider . For a more specific example, the registration module  can include the provider interface  of  for the service provider  to register the device service .","The registration module  can register the service provider  in a number of ways. For example, the registration module  can receive the device configuration . The device configuration  can be represented by an Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The registration module  can register the service provider  by placing the device configuration  under the system directory of the provider controlling platform system . The system directory is defined as the file system for the provider controlling platform system  that contains executable files, Java Archive (JAR) files, or a combination thereof.","For example, the system directory can represent a META-INF directory. META-INF directory is defined as a system directory that contains JAR files. For a specific example, the device configuration  can be represented as a JAR file. By placing the device configuration  under the META-INF folder, the registration module  can register the device service , the peripheral device , the service provider , or a combination thereof to the application environment  of  of the provider controlling platform system .","For an example of an XML file, provider.meta-data.xml can provide the details of the device configuration
