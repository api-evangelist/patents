CRM software is used to support these processes in addition to storing information on current and prospective customers. Information in the system can be accessed and entered by employees in different departments, such as sales, marketing, customer service, training, professional development, performance management, human resource development, compensation and others. Details on any customer contacts can also be stored in the system. The rationale behind this approach is to improve services provided directly to the customers and to use the information in the system for targeted marketing and sales. CRM software reduces operating costs and helps all customer-facing personnel of the company make better and timely decisions. Companies or organizations in almost every industry try to use customer information to manage relationships.

CRM software reduces operating costs and helps all customer-facing personnel of the company make better and timely decisions. Companies or organizations in almost every industry try to use customer information to manage relationships.","Most of the CRM applications available today support transmission of SMS messages that are configured to a single SMSGateway or Service Provider and do not provide an option to change or choose the SMS Gateway from the CRM application's GUI before sending out the SMS message to the customers and prospects. With the present technologies available today, the only way this purpose can be achieved is through back end configuration or selection of the SMS Gateway while installing or deploying the system.","However, based on some constraints like geographical location of the Customer, the ability to choose a country specific SMS Gateway, depending upon customer's network\/country, is a critical requirement because when an SMS message is sent to a different country using a Short Code, choosing a local SMS Gateway will reduce the cost per SMS to a great extent as compared to an SMS message sent through an international SMS Gateway. An SMS message transmitted through an international SMS Gateway that can deliver to multiple countries involves a higher cost per SMS message since it will be treated as an international SMS message. Similarly, when a Customer (commonly known as a contact in a CRM application) responds to the organization\/institution using the Short Code or Long Code via a local SMS Gateway, the cost of the SMS message to the Customer will be much lower as compared to an SMS transmitted via an international SMS Gateway. Thus what is needed is a system and method that may provide an option to choose a SMS Service Provider (depending upon the geographical location of the recipient Customer) from a list before sending out the SMS Message.","The invention meets the above needs and overcomes one or more deficiencies in the prior art by providing an option to the CRM user to select the SMS Service Provider from a list on the CRM User Interface, depending upon the geographical location of the Customer. More specifically, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method to transmit SMS message to an SMS Service Provider selected from a list on the GUI component, depending upon the geographical location of the Customer.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method to transmit SMS message to the SMS Gateway (belonging to selected Service Provider), depending upon the geographical location of the Customer includes selecting SMS Service provider from a list on the GUI component of the CRM application, converting SMS message to XML format, retrieving web service details from the application configuration file stored in the application database, identifying the service provider configured to the web service, retrieving the service provider details from the configuration file stored in the application database, checking priority of the outbound SMS message, retrieving SMS message based on priority by calling different predefined methods for each priority, loading service provider specific XML structure that defines rules accepted by the service provider, converting the SMS message to the service provider specific XML format by using XSLT transformations, transmitting XML format of the SMS message to the service provider, fetching time stamped status report from the service provider, updating the application database with latest status report.","According to another aspect of the invention a system is provided for transmitting SMS message to the Service Provider selected from a list on the GUI component in a CRM application, depending upon the geographical location of the Customer. The system includes at least one computing device running a CRM application; at least one messaging device; a web service; an application server; at least one SMS service provider supported by the CRM application; an SMSC (Short Service Messaging Center) for storing, sending and receiving SMS messages to and from the messaging device; the computing device being connected to the interne and being configured to send and receive SMS messages through CRM application running on the computing device; the application server further comprising a computer having a machine readable storage, having stored thereon one or more computer programs comprising a plurality of code sections executable by a machine for maintaining a plurality of identification and authentication information about the configured SMS service providers in application database, for routing SMS messages to the identified SMS service provider; the application server being configured to transmit SMS message from the CRM application to the SMS service provider; the messaging device comprising a messaging device registered to the SMS service provider whereby an SMS message transmitted by the user through the computing device, may be sent to the SMS service provider, and the SMS service provider may forward the SMS message to the messaging device through SMS service provider; the service provider receives SMS messages from the computing device and further transmits SMS message to the SMSC; the web service being configured to the service provider.","The invented method disclosed herein, provides the flexibility to configure multiple SMS Gateways and Service providers in a CRM application, so that while sending an SMS message, a user may choose the SMS Gateway or Service Provider based on the Customer's geographical location. This results in cost reduction to the organization, as well as the Customers who receive and respond to the SMS message via same SMS Gateway that belongs to their own network\/country. A CRM user may select an appropriate SMS Gateway for Campaigns as well as for normal communication with the Customer, based on the Customer's geographical location. Choosing an SMS Gateway which is regional or country specific will not consider SMS messages sent as international, and will be charged at local rates that helps in reducing the cost of bulk SMS message to Customers spread across various geographic locations of the world. As most of the organizations\/institutions have various offices across the globe and cater to global customers, it is very critical to help organizations using a software application, including a CRM application, reach and interact with its Customers through SMS, irrespective of their location, at the lowest rate. The present invention helps bring in better Return On Investment (ROI) on communication and Campaigns.","The methods and systems disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects and may be executed in the form of a machine readable medium embodying a set of instructions that when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform any of the operations disclosed herein. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.","Other features of the present embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.","In the following description of various embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments of practicing the present invention. While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to an illustrative embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in the form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and soul of the invention.","The present invention is directed to a system, method and a computer program product to send SMS messages to multiple SMS Gateways in a CRM application, depending upon the geographical location of the customer. The invented method enables a CRM user to send outbound SMS messages to the contacts by selecting a Service Provider from a pull down menu provided on the GUI of the application. SMS messages may be sent to contacts about requests made to company\/organization, or to promote organization's product\/services.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a method (i.e. the method as described in ) to transmit SMS message to a service provider selected from a list on the GUI component of a CRM application includes steps of selecting SMS Service provider from a list on the GUI component (, ) of the CRM application, converting SMS message to XML format ( of ), retrieving web service details from the application configuration file stored in the application database ( of ), identifying the service provider configured to the web service ( of ), retrieving the service provider details from the configuration file stored in the application database ( of ), checking priority of the outbound SMS message ( of ), retrieving SMS message based on priority by calling different predefined methods for each priority (,  of ), loading service provider specific XML structure that defines rules accepted by the service provider ( of ), converting the SMS message to the service provider specific XML format by using XSLT transformations ( of ), transmitting XML format of the SMS message to the service provider ( of ), fetching time stamped status report from the service provider ( of ), updating the application database with latest status report ( of ).","In another embodiment of the invention a system  () is provided for transmitting SMS message to the Service Provider  selected from a list on the GUI component in a CRM application, depending upon the geographical location of the recipient Customer. The system  includes at least one computing device  running a CRM application; at least one messaging device ; a web service ; an application server ; at least one SMS service provider  supported by the CRM application; an SMSC (Short Service Messaging Center)  for storing, sending and receiving SMS messages to and from the messaging device ; the computing device  being connected to the internet and being configured to send and receive SMS messages through CRM application running on the computing device ; the application server  further comprising a computer having a machine readable storage, having stored there on one or more computer programs comprising a plurality of code sections executable by a machine for maintaining a plurality of identification and authentication information about the configured SMS service providers  in application database , for routing SMS messages to the identified SMS service provider ; the application server  being configured to transmit SMS message from the CRM application to the SMS service provider ; the messaging device  comprising a messaging device  registered to the SMS service provider  whereby an SMS message transmitted by the user through the computing device , may be sent to the SMS service provider  and the SMS service provider  may forward the SMS message to the messaging device  through SMS service provider ; the service provider  receives SMS messages from the computing device  and further transmits SMS message to the SMSC ; the web service  being configured to the service provider.","The method disclosed herein addresses some web technologies that include some major technologies described in more details below.","A Web Service is a software application that describes a standardized way of integrating web-based applications using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) open standards over an Internet protocol backbone. Web services are accessed via ubiquitous web protocols and data formats, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and XML. Thus, at present, the basic Web Service platform is XML plus HTTP. XML is a text-based markup language that is currently used extensively for data interchange on the Web. As with HTML, data is identified using tags, which are collectively known as \u2018markup\u2019. XML tags identify the data, and act as a field name in the program. XML is a language that allows complex interactions between clients and services, as well as between components of a composite service, to be expressed. HTTP is an application protocol, and more particularly is a set of rules for exchanging files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on a network such as the World Wide Web. While the examples set forth herein are generally described in connection with XML and HTTP, it should be recognized that this is for illustrative purposes, and current and future types of protocols and data formats may also be employed. SOAP is a lightweight XML-based messaging protocol specification that defines a uniform manner of passing XML-encoded data and is mainly used to transfer the data as well as defines a manner to perform RPCs (a remote procedure call, a type of protocol that allows a program on one computer to execute a program on a server computer) using HTTP as the underlying communication protocol. SOAP messages are independent of any operating system or protocol and may be transported using a variety of Internet protocols. WSDL is an XML-formatted language used to describe a Web service's capabilities as collections of communication endpoints capable of exchanging messages. WSDL is an integral part of UDDI, an XML-based worldwide business registry. WSDL is the language that UDDI uses. UDDI is a Web-based distributed directory that enables businesses to list themselves on the Internet and discover each other, similar to a traditional phone book's yellow and white pages. Used primarily as a means for businesses to communicate with each other and with the clients. Web Services allow organizations to communicate data without intimate knowledge of each other's information systems behind the firewall. Unlike traditional client\/server models, such as a Web server\/Web page system, Web Services do not provide the user with a GUI but instead share business logic, data and processes through a programmatic interface across a network. Developers can then add the Web service to a GUI (such as a Web page or an executable program) to offer specific functionality to users. One of the main features of the Web services is that it allows different applications from different sources to communicate with each other without time-consuming custom coding, and because all communication is in XML, Web services are not tied to any one operating system or programming language. For example, Java can talk with Perl; Windows applications can talk with UNIX applications.","An SMS Service Provider is a business entity that provides SMS messaging services between two wireless communication channels. It works as a gateway between the cellular network and an organization intranet or SMS messaging service users e.g. a cellular telephone user. An SMS Service Provider usually signs agreements with a lot of mobile network operators to obtain their permission to exchange SMS messages with their cellular networks and offers an interface for users to send and receive SMS messages. SMS Service Providers are also known as SMS Gateway Providers. An SMS Service Provider provides an SMS Gateway for its users to forward simple SMS messages to a cellular phone recipient and vice versa. This SMS Gateway routes the SMS messages to another SMS Gateway that may further transmits the SMS message to the Short Message Service Center (SMSC). SMS Gateways are proxies between the SMSC and Service Providers which transform the complex telecommunications protocol interfaces to more simple interfaces used by the content providers. The SMS Gateway is based on web server architecture, exposing its functionality as Web Services and issuing Web Service calls to notify client applications. The implementation is standalone and provides its own Web server without requiring integration within other web servers. Protocols\/interfaces commonly supported by SMS gateway providers for sending and receiving SMS messages may include HTTP, HTTPS, XML over HTTP or HTTPS, SMTP (email to SMS\/SMS to email), FTP (for sending bulk SMS messages) and SMPP (Short Message Peer to Peer). The SMPP protocol is a telecommunications industry protocol for exchanging SMS messages between SMS peer entities such as SMSC. It is often used to allow third parties (e.g. value-added service providers like news organizations) to submit messages, often in bulk. An SMS Gateway provides a communication path between fixed protocol type, e.g. between HTTP protocol messages and SMPP protocol messages. Separate gateway Application Programming Interface (APIs) may be developed to communicate with other protocol types. An API is a set of routines, data structures, object classes and\/or protocols provided by libraries and\/or operating system services in order to support the building of applications. In general, APIs may be used to facilitate development of the methods which may be used to accomplish the function described herein such as for each service provider configured to the CRM application, a new API may be developed.","Most of the SMS Gateway providers also provide a web-based account management system. Some account management systems are accessible via HTTPS. With an HTTPS connection, the data transmitted between a computer and the web server over the interne is encrypted. Some account management systems provide detailed reports of the SMS messages sent and received. Reports of a certain day or date range may be provided by them on request. The reports usually include fields such as the total number of SMS message sent or received, the date and time at which an individual SMS message was sent or received, and the originating\/recipient cellular phone number.","If the users of several network operators are to be served, the Service Providers have to connect their services to various SMSCs in many countries, and even have to connect to many SMSCs in one country. As the number of supported SMS centers increases, one SMS Gateway cannot handle all the SMSCs. There have to be several SMS Gateways distributed throughout the world. These SMS Gateways need to interact if global services are to be developed. For some time now, these transactions have been carried out using HTTP, but since each Service Provider creates its own standards for implementation, leading to interoperability problems. These problems are solved by using either SMAP (Short Message Application Part) or MMAP (Mobile Message Access Protocol) wherein SMAP is an XML format for the messages themselves and MMAP is a SOAP-based protocol for sending those messages. MMAP provides a standard XML-based framework for mobile messaging over SOAP and HTTP. It provides a mechanism whereby applications can initiate \u2018one-shot\u2019 requests or more complex peer sessions over SOAP and HTTP. SMAP is an application part of MMAP, providing a transport-independent set of XML primitives for handling Short Messages. SMAP provides XML operations for: (1) Submission of short messages to a Short Message Service Centre; (2) delivery of short messages and delivery receipts to an application; (3) management of messages after submission. When compared to the binary form that SMS messages generally take, this XML-based format is more interoperable in the short-term and easier to convert to other formats later on, if necessary. XML technology has been widely used to encode, store and transfer various types of data including SMS messages over the internet and the corresponding Document Type Definition (DTD) for the message structure is described for such codes. In addition, the companion XSLT (eXtensible Style sheet Transformations) specification provides template-based transformation mechanism on XML documents. SMS Gateways are responsible for extracting information from the SMS messages and presenting it to the devices. Different Service Providers may require different types of XSLT templates or transforming rules to meet the specific presentation capacities. Thus, XSLT is used for transforming one XML format into another XML format. Whenever a message is sent from the CRM application, it is first converted into XML format. This XML format of the SMS message is further converted into the another XML format by using XSLT template provided by the SMS Service Provider and similarly each SMS message received from the Service provider is first converted into XML format as specified and understood by the CRM Application.","Short Message Service (SMS) is the term used for short messages (typically less than 160 characters) that are sent between cellular phones, or other applications. SMS messaging has been gaining popularity because of its low cost and quick message transfer. In addition to messaging between cellular phones, SMS facility can be incorporated into CRM applications for various purposes. SMS messages are generally exchanged between two terminals via SMSC. The SMSC is a software that resides in the operator's networks and manages the processes including queuing the messages, billing the sender and retrieving receipts etc. SMSC is responsible for handling the SMS operations of a wireless network. Whenever an SMS message is sent from a cellular phone, it reaches the SMSC first that further forwards it to the SMS Gateway configured with the cellular network. An SMS message may need to pass through more than one network entity (e.g. SMSC and SMS Gateway) before reaching the destination. The main duty of an SMSC is to route SMS messages and regulate the process. If the recipient is unavailable (for example when the mobile phone is switched off) the SMSC will store the SMS message. It will forward the SMS message when the recipient is available. Generally, Short Codes are widely used for value-added services via SMS messaging, such as television voting, ordering ringtones, marketing campaigns, notifications, alerts and other mobile services. Short Codes make it easy for consumers to respond to and engage with an advertising and marketing program. Short Code, also known as short numbers, are special telephone numbers, significantly shorter than full telephone numbers (also known as Long Code), which can also be used to address SMS and MMS messages from cellular phones or fixed phones. They are designed to be shorter to read out and easier to remember than normal telephone numbers. While similar to telephone numbers, they are, at the technological level, unique to each Service Provider. Generally, messages sent to Short Code can be billed at a higher rate than a standard SMS message. An SMS message sent to an international Short Code via various SMS Gateways may cost even more to a Customer. When using a shared Short Code, a number of Customers share the same Short Code, with their messages identified by their unique keyword. A keyword is a unique term (letters and or numbers), that a customer may text to a shared Short Code. When a Customer sends out reply SMS message using Short Code, the SMS message is delivered to the CRM application by the SMS Service Provider. A keyword may be any of the universal commands such as STOP, QUIT, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, STOP ALL, and HELP or may be any specific command such as ACC BAL for account balance, ADD INFO for seeking admission information and so on that may vary from application to application. Depending upon the keyword the SMS message may be forwarded to the relevant department within the organization\/institution.","The aforementioned, and other, technologies, protocols, data formats, etc. may be used in employing Web services. However, these known technologies are referenced in order to provide exemplary technologies currently available in the development and use of Web services. The invention thus may utilize these known technologies, but is also applicable to other existing and\/or future technologies, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from an understanding of the description provided herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","107","101","104","103","101","101","101","101","102","103","103","100","105","101","105","105","104","101","105","104","106","106","107","105","106","107","107","107","107","107","106","105","103","103","103","102","107","102","101","101","107"]},"When an organization\/institution desires to utilize the method disclosed herein, it has to tie up with a particular SMS Service Provider present in the country where the Customer is located. There can be any number of such SMS Gateways that can be configured with a CRM Application. In an embodiment of the present invention, a unique Service Provider ID may be assigned to Service Provider. This Service Provider ID may be used to identify the SMS Gateway to which out bound message has to be sent from the CRM application. The same Service Provider ID may be used to identify SMS Gateway when a message is to be pulled from the Web Server of a Service Provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["202","203","204","204","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["301","204","302","303","304","303","305","303"]},"All SMS messages may be generally defined two or more levels of priority. In the exemplary embodiment, two type of priorities are defined that may include normal priority SMS messages and high priority SMS messages. The SMS messages with normal priority may be submitted to the outgoing queue. The high priority SMS messages may also be submitted to the outgoing queue but may be sent before all the normal priority messages in the queue. Thus at step  the priority of the SMS messages in the outbound messaging queue in checked. At step , another method may be called that may fetch and process normal priority SMS messages whereas, simultaneously at step , another method may be called that may fetch and process high priority SMS messages in the outbound messaging queue. In both the cases, the control may proceed to the next step , wherein the methods called, may perform similar functions after fetching the normal priority and high priority messages. After segregating the SMS messages based on their priorities, the next step is to convert the SMS messages to the Service Provider specific XML format that may be understood and compatible with the DTD rules defined by the Service Provider. The XSLT trans-formations are used to convert one form of XML format into another XML format and these XSLT style sheets may be compiled into DLL i.e. Dynamic Link Library. Creating such DLLs is quite well known in the art. These DLLs may be loaded and run later using standard classes known in the art and required function may be accomplished likewise. While configuring a new Service Provider, the Service Provider specific component (DLL) may be saved in the Application Database and the required XSLT transformation can be used whenever the appropriate DLL is called. At step , the Service Provider specific component (DLL), may be loaded. In the next step , the XML format of the SMS messages is converted into service provider specific XML structure by using XSLT transformations specified in the DLL. The control may then proceed to  where the XML format of the SMS message may be transmitted to the Service Provider that further forwards it to the corresponding SMS Gateway that belongs to the network\/country of the intended recipient i.e. the Customer. The SMS Gateway, upon receiving the SMS message, transmits it to the corresponding Short Message Service Center (SMSC). The SMSC within the network further transmits the SMS message to the cellular device of the Customer and at the same time, the SMSC generates and issues a time stamped status report which may be sent back to the SMS Gateway via the internet. At step , this time stamped status report may be fetched by the SMS Web Service and saved in the Application Database. The status report may indicate the delivery time and status of the SMS message. At Step , the Application Database may be updated with the latest status reports for record and future use. After this step the method concludes.","Referring now to , that illustrates an exemplary process flow of the actions performed by the Web Service upon receipt of an SMS message from the Service Provider. A detailed description of the process is provided in order to explain the 2-way SMS messaging system across various SMS Gateways and enable complete understanding of the invented method to a person skill in the art.","Upon receipt of an SMS message from the organization\/institution, the Customer (as explained above with reference to ,  and ) may choose to reply using Short Code via his Cellular Device  (). When the SMS message is transmitted from the cellular device, it may be first received by the SMSC that may further transmit it to the corresponding SMS Gateway in that region. In a typical client\/server model, a client requests a service or information from a server, which then responds in transmitting information to the client. This is generally referred to as \u2018pull\u2019 technology, where client pulls the information from the server. For example, entry of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) at a client device which is then dispatched to the server to retrieve the associated information is a pull transaction. One particular service feature available for communicating information is a \u2018push\u2019 feature (also known as a \u2018notification\u2019 feature or \u2018alert\u2019 feature). The \u2018push\u2019 technology generally refers to a means to transmit information to one or more devices without previous information to one or more devices without a user action. Thus, there is no explicit request from previous user before the server transmits its information and therefore push technology essentially includes server initiated transactions. The installed Web Service may either pull that SMS message from the Service Provider or the message may be pushed by the Service Provider to the Web Service.","The Web Service provides the Application Server with the SMS messages received (either by push or pull mechanism) from messaging device via Web Services Protocols. The messages thus received by the Application Server are saved in the Application Database that can be accessed by the computing device and subsequently sent to various departments depending upon the keyword and may be processed accordingly. The method to pull SMS message from the Service Provider may be integrated with the SMS Web Service. The Web Service after a specific time interval (generally in minutes) checks for the incoming SMS message received by the Service Provider. In order to run the installed SMS Web Service, its details may be retrieved from the configuration file stored in the Application Database at step . The configuration file may store information such as Web Service ID, ID(Identifier) of the team to which the SMS message has to be routed, the date and time when the SMS Web Service was last run to pull SMS message or to receive push messages. It may further include information such as Identification code of the Service Provider i.e. Service Provider ID or the time interval and frequency at which the Web Service may be configured to run. The Short Code from where the message was received and the information about the URL of the Service Provider may also be included in the configuration file. It may further have information whether the SMS Web Service is configured to pull the SMS messages from the SMS Service Provider or to receive the SMS messages from the SMS Service Provider as and when the mobile originated\/inbound messages arrive at the SMS Gateway. At step , when the method starts, it may check whether the Web Service is configured to Pull SMS message or it is configured to receive push SMS messages from the Service Provider. In case the Web Service is configured to Pull the SMS messages the control may proceed to step , denoted by letter \u2018A\u2019, where a method (explained with reference to ) may be called that pulls the messages from the Service Provider whereas if the Push Service is configured, the control may proceed to step  denoted by letter \u2018B\u2019, where another method (explained with reference to ) may be called to receive the pushed SMS messages from the Service provider.","Referring now to , that illustrates an exemplary process flow for the method of pulling SMS messages from various Service Providers. Each Service Provider assigns unique login information consisting of a unique username and a unique password to its client in order to access its services and for the purpose of authentication. This username and password may be stored in the configuration file which may be further saved in the Application Database.","At step , this password, corresponding to the username provided by the Service Provider, may be decrypted in order to access its services. The SMS message received from the Service provider is generally in the XML format. Thus, in the next step , the Service Provider specific XML structure file may be loaded that may parse the incoming SMS message at a later stage when the SMS message is actually received from the Service Provider. At step , different methods may be called, based on specific Service Provider ID that may process the incoming SMS massages. At step , the Service Provider Gateway URL may be invoked through HTTP protocol via internet so that incoming SMS messages may be pulled from after authentication. At step , a request may be posted by the Web Service to receive SMS messages from the Service Provider Gateway URL. Upon such request and user authentication, the Service provider transmits the SMS messages (in XML format) to the CRM user at step . In the next step , the incoming SMS message may be parsed using the Service Provider specific XML structure loaded at step . At step , depending upon the Service Provider ID, the XML format of the received SMS message may be converted to XML format (by using the appropriate XSLT transformation) that may be understood by the CRM application. At step , the received SMS message in XML format may be sent to another method , denoted by letter \u2018C\u2019 (explained with reference to ). At step , the Application Database may be updated with the date and time when the SMS Web Service was last run to Pull SMS messages or to receive the Pushed SMS messages from the Service Provider. After this step, the method may be repeated from step  to step , after a fixed time interval (defined in the configuration file) and frequency at which the Web Service is configured to run. After this step the method concludes.","Referring now to , that illustrates an exemplary process flow of the method of receiving SMS messages Pushed by various Service Providers. As explained at step  (), the SMS message is pushed by the Service provider to the Web Service. The control may further proceed to step  () where the incoming SMS message pushed by the Service Provider, may be received by the Web Service. The Service Provider that Pushed the SMS message is identified at step  and a corresponding Service Provider specific XML Structure is loaded at step . Since the SMS message received is coded in XML format specified by the Service Provider, thus at step , it is parsed using the loaded XML structure. After parsing the message, it is sent to other methods at step , denoted by letter \u2018C\u2019 (as explained with reference to ). After this step the method concludes.","Referring now to , that illustrates an exemplary process flow for the method of processing the SMS message Pulled by the Web Service or Pushed by the Service Provider to the Web Service. The SMS message Pulled by the Web Service (as explained in ) and the SMS message Pushed by the Service provider (as explained in ), may be received by the method explained with reference to . Before starting the method, all of the retrieved SMS messages may be saved in the Application Database as backup at step . If the Application Database is not accessible at some point of time, the method of pulling SMS messages from various Service Providers as explained in  is temporarily stopped until the Application Database is accessible. In the case where SMS messages are pushed by the Service providers, the retrieved SMS messages may be stored as a physical file onto the hard disk of the computing device  (). If the SMS message is stored successfully in the Application Database as backup, the actual processing of the SMS messages may be done. In the next step , the method processes the SMS message based on the keyword present in the SMS message text. There may be multiple SMS Web Services configured for different SMS Short\/Long Code communicating with this method. For every SMS Short Code from where the SMS messages are received, a separate internal process may be created so that each of these internal processes may have their own methods of processing the SMS messages depending upon the keyword present in the SMS message text. As a result, all the SMS messages from different SMS Short codes may be processed in parallel. At step , each process may perform similar steps from  to . At step , the details about the Short Code from where the messages have been received and details about the Service Provider (Service Provider ID) may be retrieved from the Application Database. At step , a message queue may be created to queue up all of the SMS messages in the queue defined in the respective Short Code process. At step , various internal methods may be created that may process the SMS messages based on the keyword present inside the message text. At step , a helper thread may be created that may read the SMS message queue. The helper thread may be configured to decide and assign different tasks to the internal methods depending upon the keyword. At step , the XSLT transformation file may be loaded for transforming the received XML format of the SMS message to the XML format compatible with the organization\/institution's XML structure. At step , the helper thread created at step , may be initiated to perform the decided tasks. As and when the SMS message queue is filled up with the incoming SMS messages, at step , these messages may be extracted and transformed into XML format compatible with the XML format stored in the Application Database. Whenever a message is sent, an interaction may be created and this message may be added to the interaction whereas upon receiving reply SMS message from the customer, it may be added to the same interaction and the message may be associated with the contact that has sent the SMS message. At step , an interaction may be created and saved in the Application Database. Finally at step , the transformed SMS messages may be forwarded to the other methods for further processing. After this the method concludes.","It will be appreciated that more or fewer processes may be incorporated into the methods illustrated in , , ,  and  without departing from the scope of the invention and that no particular order is implied by the arrangement of blocks shown and described herein.

This results in cost reduction to the organization, as well as the Customers who receive and respond to the SMS message via same SMS Gateway that belongs to their own network\/country. A CRM user may select an appropriate SMS Gateway for Campaigns as well as for normal communication with the Customer, based on the Customer's geographical location. Choosing an SMS Gateway which is regional or country specific will not consider SMS messages sent as international, and will be charged at local rates that helps in reducing the cost of bulk SMS message to Customers spread across various geographic locations of the world. As most of the organizations\/institutions have various offices across the globe and cater to global customers, it is very critical to help organizations using a software application, including a CRM application, reach and interact with its Customers through SMS, irrespective of their location, at the lowest rate. The present invention helps bring in better Return On Investment (ROI) on communication and Campaigns."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["Example embodiments are illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
