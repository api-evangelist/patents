{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to smart card products and more particularly to the management of smart card products.","Cards, such as credit cards, with built-in processing capabilities are generally referred to as smart cards. Smart cards may have many differing uses. For example, it has been proposed that smart cards be used for a wide array of uses ranging from access to networks through a network computer to on-line banking through the storage of encrypted banking information on the card. Such uses have, generally not been widespread, however, possibly as a result of the expense of manufacturing and maintaining smart cards. However, as costs are reduced, it is expected that smart card usage will increase.","A smart card product is comprised of many interrelated components, both physical and logical. Physical components include the plastic card, the embedded chip, ink, logos, or holograms applied to the plastic, and optional magnetic stripe and bar codes. Logical components are made up of software programs and data, including the card operating system, applications and application data, and security mechanisms such as keys and certificates. As used herein, the term \u201csmart card\u201d is used to refer to a card having processing capabilities and the term \u201csmart card product\u201d is used to refer to a smart card configured with the logical and physical components for a particular use of the smart card.","To produce a smart card product, each of the interrelated logical and physical components should be taken into account in the production and distribution process. However, various aspects of the smart card product may be controlled by different business enterprises. For example, the business enterprise which manufactures the smart card may differ from the business enterprise which controls the applications or data to be loaded on the smart card product. Furthermore, each of these enterprises may differ further from the enterprises responsible for card issuance or card security. Furthermore, for smart card products which may be field programmed, the application or applications loaded on the smart card may be changed, update, deleted or otherwise modified after the card has issued. Such modifications may be performed by a further business enterprise. As can be seen from this brief example, the manufacture, issuance and maintenance of smart card products may be a complex task. Such tasks may involve different enterprises which may coordinate their efforts to provide a smart card product.","Embodiments of the present invention include methods, systems and computer program products which provide for managing a smart card product by providing a plurality of generic definitions, at least a portion of which have a predefined relationship to others of the generic definitions, so as to provide a hierarchy of generic definitions. Generic definitions are selected from the plurality of generic definitions and associated with an instance of a card product definition so as to define characteristics of the smart card product associated with the instance of the card product definition. The selected generic definitions are populated with data associated with the smart card product so as to provide instances of the generic definitions which define the characteristics of the smart card product.","The smart card product may be managed utilizing the hierarchy of instances of the generic definitions so as to provide the smart card product having the defined characteristics. In particular, one or more of registration of card product holders, smart card product enablement, smart card product personalization, smart card product application data, smart card product hot lists and smart card product post-issuance application updates may be managed utilizing the hierarchy of instances of the generic definitions so as to provide the smart card product having the defined characteristics.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the selected generic definitions may be selectively linked to each other to further define the hierarchy of generic definitions associated with the instance of the smart card product so as to further define the smart card product. In such embodiments, the selection and linking of the selected definitions to the smart card product definition may be provided by establishing an instance of the card product definition and associating one or more chip definitions with the instance of the card product definition. One or more process definitions is also associated with the instance of the card product definition. Furthermore, one or more task definitions, one or more enterprise definitions and one or more application definitions are also associated with the instance of the card product definition.","In such embodiments, the association of process definitions with the instance of the card product definition may be provided by associating an enablement process definition, a registration process definition and a personalization process definition with the card product definition. Furthermore, one or more task definitions may be associated with the enablement process definition so as to carry out the enablement process. One or more task definitions may be associated with the registration process definition so as to carry out the registration process. One or more task definitions may also be associated with the personalization process definition so as to carry out the personalization process.","In further embodiments, associating process definitions with the instance of the card product definition may be provided by associating a hot list definition with the instance of the card product definition. In such embodiments, one or more task definitions may be associated with the hot list process definition so as to carry out the hot list process.","In additional embodiments of the present invention, associating process definitions with the instance of the card product definition may be accomplished by associating an application load definition with the instance of the card product definition. Furthermore, one or more task definitions may be associated with the application load process definition so as to carry out the application process.","In still other embodiments of the present invention, an enterprise definition is associated with the a process definition if the process definition utilizes resources of an enterprise outside the domain of a smart card management server. Furthermore, a connection definition is associated with the process definition so as to define a mechanism for establishing a connection between the smart card management server and an enterprise associated with the enterprise definition associated with the process definition.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the plurality of generic definitions include process definitions which define smart card management tasks so as to manage the attributes of the smart card product.","In additional embodiments, the plurality of generic definitions include one or more of a chip definition, a platform definition, a card product holder definition, a device definition, a certificate definition, a key definition, an application definition and a process definition.","While the invention has been described above primarily with respect to the method aspects of the invention, both systems and\/or computer program products are also provided.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a method, data processing system, or computer program product. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code means embodied in the medium. Any suitable computer readable medium may be utilized including hard disks, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or magnetic storage devices.","Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java\u00ae, Smalltalk or C++. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","Smart card product management systems according to embodiments of the present invention may provide the functions and processes necessary to support the life cycle of smart card products or portions of the life cycle of a smart card product. The smart card product management system may manage the smart card product from its initial creation and distribution to an end user, to the time when the smart card product is expired, withdrawn, or replaced by the card issuer or portions thereof. During a smart card product's useful life, the smart card product management system may support the capability to dynamically update the smart card product's content, adding and deleting applications, replacing keys and certificates, or, in the event of a lost or stolen card, preventing its unauthorized usage.","As described in more detail below, in embodiments of the present invention, the smart card product management system captures the characteristics of each component of a smart card product in a component \u201cdefinition.\u201d Each component is represented by a definition, which encapsulates the component's characteristics, interrelationships with other components, and unique work processes in a single program object. The use of component definitions to provide the \u201cblueprint\u201d for each different smart card product provides a mechanism for expressing the hierarchical relationship of the smart card product's components, and for simplifying the selection and performance of management functions against individual smart card products. Once created and activated, a set of definitions for a smart card product can be used repeatedly to manage the potentially millions of individual cards issued of that product type. Furthermore, the hierarchical relationship of the definitions is well suited for implementation using a relational data repository, thus availing the card issuer to the security, transactional integrity, and archival capabilities of the variety of relational database products available in the marketplace.","An example of a smart card product environment in which embodiments of the present invention may be utilized is illustrated in FIG. . In this environment, the Card Issuer  is the central point of control. The Card Issuer  establishes business relationships with other enterprises in order to support the issuance and usage of its card products. Although all of the enterprises in  are shown as separate entities, some of them may actually be part of the same enterprise. For example, the Customer Support Services will typically be a part of the Card Issuer's enterprise, and a Card Issuer  can be an Application Provider  if they are deploying their own applications.","As illustrated in the example of , the Card Issuer  (CI) establishes the policies that control the smart card product management system, and therefore have a significant influence over the overall card management scheme. The Card Issuer  may also own the card and be legally responsible for it. The Application Provider(s)  (AP) may develop and own one or more applications, and may be legally and technically responsible for them. The Application Provider  establishes business relationships with one or more Card Issuers , which will put the Application Provider's application on their cards.","A Certificate Authority (CA) generates, manages, and administers public key certificates for both cards and applications. The CA is typically an external service provider for the Card Issuer  or Application Provider . The Card Issuer  and the Application Provider  may be responsible for issuing certificates. One or more CAs may operate within a smart card product management system. A Trusted Third Party (TTP) provides cryptographic services for the Card Issuer , the Application Provider , and the Personalization Agency . The TTP is typically responsible for the secure generation and storage of cryptographic keys. As illustrated in , the CA and TTP may be the same enterprise. Furthermore, the CA and TTP may be associated with a Card Issuer  or an Application Provider . Thus, in , a Card CA\/TTP  is illustrated as communicating with the Card Issuer  and an Application CA\/TTP \u2032 is illustrated as communicating with the Application Provider .","A Card Manufacturer, which may also be referred to as an Initialization Agency, performs the initialization of smart card chips during module production. The information that is needed to initialize the chip is provided by the card and application issuing functions within the smart card product management system. The Card Manufacturer may also act as a Personalization Agency (PA). The PA , which may also be referred to as a Card Bureau, personalizes both the chip and the plastic on a card. In some systems, the Personalization Agency  may interface directly with the TTPs or the CAs on behalf of both the Card Issuers  and the Application Providers . The Personalization Agency  may also provide related services, such as production and mailing of card letters.","The Registration Authority  (RA) may operate the registration process for card product holders that have been defined by the Card Issuers , the Application Providers , and the Certificate Authorities. The RA  may be a part of the Card Issuer , the Application Provider  or the Certificate Authority , or it may be a separate organization. In any case, it may be considered a logical extension of these enterprises and, therefore, may operate a portion of the smart card product management system.","A customer support services center , which is also referred to as a call center or service center, may be the Card Issuer  and the Application Provider  point of contact for a card product holder. A Card Terminal Server  may provide access points for use, update, distribution and\/or activation of the smart card product.","In addition to the enterprises described above and illustrated in , other enterprises may also play a role in the development, production and deployment of a smart card product. For example, Card Operating System (OS) providers may contribute the information, such as product specifications, that are required to implement card capabilities management for a specific card or set of cards. Card distributors may be responsible for the distribution of newly issued smart card products to an outlet(s) that will subsequently sell or distribute the cards to an end user. Examples of such distribution may include anonymous cards stocked and sold from vending machines, distributed to retail outlets, or delivered to organizations that may distribute the cards as part of a promotional program.","As is clear from the exemplary environment of , the complex nature of the smart card product environment may make the use of a smart card product management system beneficial. Smart card product management includes providing the management support for multi-application, card-based products within a multi-enterprise environment. A smart card product may be the business product that a Card Issuer  plans to market. For example, the business product could be a corporate campus card, loyalty card, or corporate traveler card. The functions provided by a smart card product management system may include issuance, life-cycle management, post-issuance support, security services, and information exchange for the objects that are managed by a smart card product management system. Cards, applications, keys, certificates, enterprises and card product holders are examples of these objects. The smart card product management system provides the basis for developing smart card product management solutions using a component-based design. As is described in more detail herein, embodiments of the smart card product management system according to the present invention may provide a set of core card management components. These components may be assembled and\/or extended (or built upon) to produce a customer specific implementation of a complete smart card product management system.","Embodiments of the smart card product management system of the present invention may provide the facilities to manage each smart card product through its life-cycle, from initial creation and issuance, to activation and intended usage, and ending when the card is replaced or withdrawn. In addition to the card itself, applications, application data, certificates, and keys which reside on the card may also be managed by the smart card product management system. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the smart card product management system may provide support for a multi-application card that has the capability to contain more than one executable application or more than one set of application data (single application smart card products may also be supported). Embodiments of smart card product management system, according to the present invention may also support existing multi-application card operating systems, as well as future operating systems. For example, embodiments of the present invention may support Java Card (with Open Platform support), multi-application operating system for smart cards (MULTOS) or Smart Card for Windows.","Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may provide support for multiple card issuers and\/or application providers, as well as the enterprises with which card issuers and\/or application provides interact (e.g. registration authorities and certificate authorities).","An example of a smart card product management system according to embodiments of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. . As seen in , a smart card product management system may include a card management server , an application management server , and a key and certificate management server . The smart card product management server  may be controlled by the Card Issuer  and may control the operation of the other management systems. The Card Issuer  has the primary responsibility for card product definition, card product issuance and card product management. The application management server  may be controlled by the Application Provider  which has the primary responsibility for the application data management functions, which are utilized in the card product issuance process. The application management server  provides the platform for implementing the application data management functions. These servers provide access to application personalization data and assist with key management for applications. Finally, the key and certificate management server  may be operated by enterprises external to the Card Issuer  or Application Provider . These servers provide the functions utilized to generate and store both keys and certificates. The key and certificate management server  is usually operated by a Trusted Third Party for key management and a Certificate Authority for certificate management.","As is further illustrated in , the smart card product management system may interface with various clients . For example, a customer support services client  may be utilized by the customer support service enterprise , a personalization agency client  may be utilized by a personalization agency  to perform the card personalization service and a system administration client  may provide access to the smart card product management system to carry out administrative functions. Additionally, a card server\/terminal client  may provide terminal functions and a registration authority client  may be provided to perform registration operations.","Embodiments of the smart card product management system may utilize a standard method for communication both between management systems ,  and  and from clients  to the management systems. These communication methods may, for example, encapsulate a transaction request and response using a standard message format, such as a message format based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). Thus, transactions that occur between external enterprises may have a well defined XML data format.","Referring now to , an exemplary embodiment of a data processing system  suitable for use as a server or a client in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is illustrated and may include input device(s)  such as a keyboard or keypad, a display , and a memory  that communicate with a processor . The data processing system  may further include a storage system , a speaker  and an I\/O data port(s)  that also communicate with the processor . The storage system  may include removable and\/or fixed media such as floppy disks, ZIP drives, hard disks or the like as well as virtual storage such as a RAMDISK. The I\/O data port  can be used to transfer information between the data processing system  and another computer system or a network (e.g., the Internet). Such data processing systems may include, for example, personal computers, laptop computers, mainframe computers, pervasive computing devices such as personal digital assistants, smartphones or the like, or even embedded processing systems. The components of a particular data processing system may be conventional or custom components, such as those used in many conventional computing devices, which may be configured to operate as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00066","num":"00066"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["238","236","248","238","236","230","236"]},"As shown in , the memory  may contain several categories of software and data used in the data processing system : the operating system ; the application program(s) ; the input\/output (I\/O) device drivers ; and the data . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the operating system  may be any operating system suitable for use with a data processing system, such as OS\/2, AIX or OS\/390 from International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y., WindowsCE, WindowsNT, Windows95, Windows98 or Windows2000 from Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash., PalmOS from Palm, Inc., MacOS from Apple Computer, UNIX or Linux, proprietary operating systems or dedicated operating systems, for example, for embedded data processing systems.","The I\/O device drivers  typically include software routines accessed through the operating system  by the application programs  to communicate with devices such as the input devices , the display , the speaker , the storage system , the I\/O data port(s) , and certain memory  components. The application program(s)  is illustrative of the programs that implement the various features of the data processing system . Finally, the data  represents the static and dynamic data used by the application program(s) , operating system , I\/O device drivers , and other software programs that may reside in the memory .","As is further seen in , application program(s)  may include smart card product management system application(s)  which may carry out some or all of the functions described herein. Furthermore, the data  may include smart card product definition objects  which, as described herein, may be utilized in a hierarchical manner to define smart card products which may be produced utilizing embodiments of the present invention. The operation of the smart card product management system application  and the smart card product definition objects  is described in detail below.","Embodiments of the present invention may provide a smart card product management system which may be defined based on the business rules and relationships established by the Card Issuer . As illustrated in , the smart card product management system  may provide management of smart card product deployment in utilizing one or more of three components of the smart card product management system: a definitions component ; a management tasks component ; and a management services component . The definitions component  contains the basic attributes for the card products that are managed by the smart card product management system . As seen in , these, definitions may include platform definitions, chip definitions, application definitions, key definitions, certificate definitions, enterprise definitions, card holder definitions, application holder definitions, device definitions, process definitions and the like. These definitions are utilized by the smart card product management system to specify and control a smart card product.","The management tasks component  defines the basic functions that are performed by the smart card product management system . Embodiments of the present invention may, in addition to other management tasks, provide one or more of three management tasks: card product issuance , application data management , and card product management . The card product issuance  function may provide for initial card issuance and reissuance while the application data management  and the card product management  functions may provide for post-issuance and multi-enterprise management support.","The management services component  may provide the foundation services that may be utilized by both the definitions component  and the management tasks component . Such services may include, for example, policies and rules management , management events , security, auditing and reporting , legacy system interfaces , enterprise connections , database interfaces  and transaction support .","As described above, smart card product management systems according to embodiments of the present invention may include a set of management systems that communicate with one another. Generally, these management systems include a data repository that contains the entities that they manage. Thus, as illustrated in , the smart card product management system  includes a data repository  which may be accessed by the card management server .","As illustrated in , the smart card product management server  may incorporated several components including the smart card product management system , an application server  and an operating system . The components of the smart card product management system  may be implemented so that they run in conjunction with an application server . Application servers may provide a scalable runtime environment for business applications, integration with other enterprise systems, and an environment for rapid application development. The application server  provides a platform that contains the runtime environment for an application's business logic. In particular embodiments, applications run as servlets and\/or Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and communicate with clients and other applications, or application components, using HTTP and IIOP (Internet InterOrb Protocol). Servlets are protocol and platform-independent server side components which are typically written in Java. Since servlets are written in Java, they are typically more flexible and stable than CGI scripts and provide an interface that can be used on different platforms without additional porting. Enterprise JavaBeans are JavaBeans that deliver reusable, reliable, business application middleware. Enterprise JavaBeans provide a component model for server applications which allows an application to be easily partitioned into user interface and business logic. The user interface or client side of the application can be written in Java, HTML, C\/C++, or Visual Basic or other suitable programming languages. Because the server side business logic is packaged as Enterprise JavaBeans, it can be deployed anywhere in the network, reused with other business applications running on different platforms, and managed from a remote console.","As is further illustrated in , the application server  may contain a set of foundation services. An application can utilize the functions provided by the foundation services, such as database and transaction support, as well as the directory and security services provided by the network infrastructure. The foundation services provide the core functionality to support the applications that are running on an application server. These services may include an HTTP server , database services , transaction services , and messaging services .","The HTTP server  provides basic web-based services. This may include coordinating, collecting, and assembling Web pages composed from static and dynamic content which is then delivered directly to clients. The HTTP server  can also provide access to applications that are implemented as servlets. The transaction services  may extend the functionality of the application server  to provide scalable and secure transaction application execution environment. The database services  may provide a standard interface to relational databases. For example, the database services  may provide an interface to DB, Oracle, Sybase, Informix or other relational databases. The messaging services  may provide access to Message Oriented Middleware (MOM). These types of services may be used for messaging between applications, which can be running on clients or servers.","In addition to the smart card product management system  and the application server , the card management server  also includes an operating system . Both the smart card product management system  and the application server  may be run on top of an operating system  which may, in Java embodiments of the present invention, provide the services of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Suitable operating systems may include, for example, Windows NT, AIX, Solaris, Linux and OS\/390.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00078","num":"00078"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["50","700","702","702","704"]},"The generic components  may also include standard extensions  which are built on top of the core components . The standard extensions  represent functions that will be used in most, but not necessarily all implementations of a smart card product management system. Many of the management tasks described herein may be implemented as standard extensions. An example of a standard extension is support for a specific card operating system or support for a specific Personalization Agency interface. A library of standard extensions may be provided with a basic smart card product management system. The set of standard extensions in this library may be sufficient to build a complete smart card product management system, but some of them may be enhanced or replaced by custom extensions to fulfill a specific customer requirement.","The custom extensions  are built on top of the core components , the standard extensions  or both. These extensions may be unique to a specific customer and will typically not be distributed as part of a basic smart card product management system. An example of a custom extension is an extension used to access data that is located outside of the smart card product management system. As an example, when a specific customer maintains their card product holder data outside of the smart card product management system, a custom extension may be used to access this data.","As described above, a core component of a smart card product management system according to embodiments of the present invention are the definition objects. The definitions are used to describe the characteristics and functionality of an object that is managed by the smart card product management system. Definitions can be compared to a template. When the template is filled in, it becomes part of the knowledge-base that is used by the smart card product management system. This knowledge-base provides the basis for issuance and management functions that are processed by the smart card product management system. An implementation of a definition may be used to create multiple instances of the object that is represented by the definition. For example, a card product definition may be used to create instances of card products, and an application definition may be used to create instances of applications. All definitions may be considered core components and, therefore, may not be changed. However, a definition extension can be used to create new definitions and enhance a core definition's function. A definition extension can be implemented as either a standard extension or a custom extension.","Each definition has a life-cycle, which is a set of states that a definition transitions through. A typical life-cycle for a definition is shown in  definition will move from one state to the next when a specific event occurs. For example, when a definition is in the process of being completed, it is in the CREATED state . When the definition contains all of its required information and this information is saved in a definitions database, the definition moves to the DEFINED state . The event that triggered the state change was the completion and storage of all required information for the definition.","Definitions may also have some state transitions that can not be reversed. For example, when a definition is approved for usage, for example, by entering and exiting the TEST state , it will move from the DEFINED  to the ACTIVE state . Once a definition is in the ACTIVE state , the contents of the definition can not be changed. This means that a definition can not transition from the ACTIVE state  back to the DEFINED state . A definition is updated by creating a new version of the definition.","Thus, the life of a definition, as illustrated in the embodiments of , begins with creating the definition when the definition is in the CREATED state . When all required information has been created and saved, the definition will move to the DEFINED state . From the DEFINED state , the definition will enter the TEST state  where the definition is tested before activation. If modifications are need to the definition the definition may return to the CREATED state  for updating. When the test is complete, the definition may exit the TEST state  and return to the DEFINED state . When the definition is approved for use, it will enter the ACTIVE state . The definition may be temporarily suspended by placing the definition in the DISABLED state . From the DISABLED state , the definition may return to the ACTIVE state  or be withdrawn from usage and enter the WITHDRAWN state . The definition may also be withdrawn directly from the ACTIVE state . If the definition has been withdrawn, it may exit the WITHDRAWN state  and be deleted by entering the DELETED state . Similarly, the definition may be deleted as a result of testing and, therefore, the definition may enter the DELETED state  directly from the TEST state .","In particular embodiments, definitions may have a common set of attributes: definition ID, version number, type, description, life-cycle state, and valid usage dates. Some definitions will have additional attributes.","The definition ID attribute is a unique identifier (ID), so that a reference to a definition will not be ambiguous. The definition also include a version number attribute that may be used to update a definition's content after it has been activated and used. A new version of a definition can be created from the current version. Initially, the new version will contain the same attribute values, which includes definition references. The type attribute of definition may be used to classify or group definitions which have similar characteristics or usage. The description attribute of the definition is an explanation of the definition usage which is specified using free-form text.","As described above, definitions have a specific life-cycle. The life-cycle is a set of states that a definition can progress through. A definition will move from one state to the next when a pre-defined event occurs. The possible states for all definitions are the same. The life-cycle attribute specifies the current life-cycle state of the definition.","The valid usage date attribute defines the dates within which the definition can be used. This includes a start date and an expiration date. The start date is when the definition can transition to the ACTIVE state. The expiration date is when the definition's usage will expire. On the expiration date, the definition's life-cycle state will transition to the WITHDRAWN state, so that it can no longer be used.","In addition to common attributes, the definitions also support a common set of functions, which includes create, update, delete and query. Some definitions will require additional functions. The create function creates a new definition with a unique identifier. The update function updates the attributes of an existing definition. The delete function deletes a definition The List function lists all versions of a definition, or all definitions for a particular type of definition. The view function views the attributes of a specific definition the link\/unlink function link (associate) or unlink an instance of another type of definition to a definition. When linking a definition, the definition that is being linked should be in a DEFINED state.","Definitions also share a common management process and may be stored in the database . Definitions may be managed through an administrative user interface that may be provided as part of the administration client  and is used to process functions such as create, modify, delete or list definitions. The user interface may be web-based, so that it can be run on a broad range of clients. As the definitions are created, the data associated with the definitions are stored in the smart card product management system database . Definitions may contain both the common attributes and definition specific attributes. Some definitions may contain references to other definitions.","Definition versioning may be used to implement change control for updates to a definition, because a definition, in the illustrated embodiments of , cannot be changed after it is activated. The definition versioning function may ensure that the smart card product management system can provide consistent management of the deployed card base. Updates to an existing definition may be initiated by creating a new version of the definition. When a new version of a definition is created, a copy of the definition is created with a new version number and the definition is put into the DEFINED state. All versions of a definition have the same definition identifier (ID), and new versions can be created only from the last active version. All versions of a definition are implicitly linked together. This implies that a new version of a definition must be backward compatible with all old definition versions. This ensures that instance objects that are created from an old definition version can be migrated to a new definition version, if it is required.","Backward compatibility may be accomplished by allowing only a subset of changes to a new definition version. Whereas a completely new definition can be changed in any way that is required, the changes to a new version of a definition must be restricted to ensure compatibility. For example, updates to the definitions that are associated with a new version of a definition may be restricted to adding new definitions and upgrading to new versions of the linked definitions. As an example, after a new version of a card product definition is created, a new application definition can be added to this definition and an existing application definition can be upgraded to the latest version. When these changes are approved and the card product definition is moved into the ACTIVE state, the card product objects that were created from the old definition version can be migrated to the new definition version. After the migration is completed, the new application can be requested and downloaded onto the existing card products.","Definitions may also be imported into the smart card product management system, for example, in XML format. The import function allows other enterprises to provide the information that is related to their participation in the overall scheme. As an example, a chip definition can be provided by the Card Manufacturer, and an application definition can be provided by an Application Provider. When a definition is imported into the smart card product management system, its state will be set to CREATED if the definition is incomplete, or it will be set to DEFINED if it contains all of the definition's required information.","A definition extension can be used to extend the data attributes that are associated with a specific type of definition. A definition extension is implemented as a definition. It will have all of the same characteristics as a core definition, such as an identifier and version number, but it can not be extended using a different definition extension. The primary purpose of a definition extension is to add definition attributes that are not included in the core set of definitions.","As an example, a definition extension can be used to define a card's physical appearance and layout. The definition extension contains the results of designing the card layout. The definition extension may then include the text, images (including logos), and barcodes that will be printed on the card, as well as the data that will be encoded on the magnetic stripe of the card. This type of definition extension can be associated with both the card product and the application definition. By doing this, an application can personalize the physical layout of a card if it is required. For example, a credit\/debit application can be loaded onto the chip, and can encode data on the magnetic stripe in order to maintain compatibility with the existing infrastructure of magnetic stripe readers.","As shown in , a hierarchy of definitions may be utilized to describe a smart card product. Such a hierarchy may begin with a smart card product definition . The smart card product definition  contains the business properties that will affect the issuance and usage of a card-based product. A card product may correspond to the business product that a Card Issuer plans to market. For example, if a Card Issuer wants to issue a Corporate Traveler card, then the card product is the Corporate Traveler card and the card product definition will contain all of the information needed to issue and manage that card product.","The data associated with all of the definitions are stored in the smart card product management system database . The definitions may contain references to data that is stored outside of the smart card product management system database , such as application management, key and certificate management, and\/or legacy databases. For example, the application data that is required to personalize an application may exist only in the application management database. The application definition will contain a reference to the location of the application data, and this reference will reside in the database.","As mentioned above, all of the definitions within the smart card product management system are logically associated with the card product definition . The smart card product definition , as shown in , contains references to other definitions. Some of the definitions that are referenced by the card product definition may contain references to additional definitions.  illustrates one such set of relationships between the definitions. Some definitions have a one-to-one relationship, and others have a one-to-many relationship. As an example, only one platform definition  is associated with the smart card product definition , but one or more application definitions  can be associated with the same card product definition.","Examples of definitions which may be associated with the card product definition  include a platform definition , a card product holder definition , an enterprise definition , chip definitions , application definitions , key definitions , certificate definitions , device definitions , and process definitions . These definitions may have a one-to-one or a one-to-many relationship with the smart card product definition . Furthermore, the definitions may be optional or required in a smart card product definition .","As is seen in , multiple instances of a single definition may be associated with a card product definition . Furthermore, these instances may be linked to other definitions so as to further define the hierarchy. Thus, for example, as seen in , an enterprise definition  is linked to the card product definition , a second enterprise definition \u2032 is linked to the chip definition  and a third enterprise definition \u2033 is linked to the application definition . Similarly, the process definitions  and \u2032, the certificate definitions  and \u2032, the key definitions  and \u2032, and the device definitions  and \u2032 may be linked to the card product definition  and the application definition  respectively. Thus, as seen in , links between instances of definitions may be utilized to further define the characteristics of the smart card product associated with the card product definition .","Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with respect to a hierarchy of definitions which may provide a hierarchy as illustrated in FIG. .

A process definition  is used to identify the set of tasks that represent a complete process. The process can be executed using, for example, an entry-level process service or enterprise-based workflow manager. An example of a process definition  is a card issuance order, or a post-issuance order to update one or more cards. The process definition  provides the basis for identifying and executing the card product issuance or post-issuance update tasks.","Tasks can execute entirely within the domain of the card management server , or they may require communication with other systems. The amount of time that is required to complete a task will depend on the work items that it needs to complete, and the processing that is required outside of the smart card product management system.","The process definition  can reference to a set of tasks using one of the following methods. First, the process definition  can contain a reference to one or more task definitions . Each task definition  contains the information that is needed to execute a single task. Alternatively, with an enterprise workflow manager, task definitions  may not be required, because the tasks are defined and imported using the facilities provided by the workflow manager. As task definitions  are not required, the process definition  may contain the information that is required by the workflow manager to locate and run the process.","An entry-level process service may be used to execute a set of tasks in a serial order. Tasks in a process may be executed in a serial sequence with the work completed by one task provided as a prerequisite to start the next task. Using the card issuance order as an example, the task that issues the order to manufacturer cards must be completed before starting the task that will personalize the card. Although the tasks are processed in a serial order, this does not imply that the output from one task is required to be used as input into the next task. In general, all input required for a task is obtained from the smart card product management system database , and all output from a task is stored in the smart card product management system database .","An entry-level process service may be utilized in certain embodiments of the present invention as a simple work flow process may be all that is needed in particular system, such as systems which do not require integration with other enterprise work flow processes. For example, an employee badge issuing system that is located in the local security office may only need simple, serial process flows for fulfillment of a personalization request for a single card.","In larger enterprises a more comprehensive workflow process may be need, for example, if the card management processes are integrated into an existing workflow product. Thus, when a process is executed within the context of a large enterprise, it may require a more complex flow than provided by an entry-level process service. For example, instead of executing the tasks of a process in a serial order, some tasks may have to be processed in parallel to one another, with the workflow manager responsible for synchronizing the completion of these tasks. A task may also require that data from one or more previous tasks be passed to it as input. This type of inter-task communication may be handled by the workflow manager. In addition, an enterprise process flow may include both automated operations as well as operations that require interaction directly from the enterprise's employees. For example, an automated operation would be the collection of required data from the smart card product management system database . An interactive operation would be an approval process for a new card order.","An example of a product that provides this type of workflow management function is IBM MQSeries Workflow. This product is a workflow management system that provides the capability to define, manage, and execute business processes. These processes are executed by software whose order of execution is driven by a computer representation of the workflow logic. The MQSeries workflow management system includes a process definition function, through which the workflow is modeled, a control function, which manages the flow of work at run time, and interfaces which enable human users and applications to perform the specific business actions within the workflow. These aspects of the workflow management system may be controlled by the process definition .","In light of the above discussion, in addition to the standard attributes, the process definition  may further include a task list attribute. The task list attribute provides the list of tasks that will be executed by this process. Each task will be executed in the order that they appear in the list.","A process definition  can be associated with one or more card product definition , application definition , key definition  and certificate definition . The only definition that can be associated with this definition is the task definition . A task definition  is used to define the functions that are executed in the context of a task. The task definition  is required only if it is required by the service that will control the execution of the process.","A task definition  contains a reference to executable code and the initialization parameters for that code. A task is a single step within a process. The list of tasks that make up a process are specified in a process definition  as task definitions . In addition to the standard attributes, the task definition  may have a System Extension attribute which provides the executable code and initialization parameters that are used to process a specific task. A task definition  can only be associated with one or more process definitions . The only definition that can be associated with the task definition  is the connection definition in an optional one-to-one relationship.","The smart card product management system may also include a set of standard definition extensions, such as support for customizing the physical components for a smart card product. The card component definition may contain a description of the card's physical components, which includes its appearance and layout. This definition is not used to design a card layout. Instead, it can be viewed as a template that contains the results of designing the layout. This definition will include the text, images (including logos), and barcodes that will be printed on the card, as well as the data that will be encoded on the magnetic stripe of the card. A card component definition can be associated with both the card product definition  and the application definition . By doing this, an application can personalize the physical layout of a card if it is required. For example, a credit\/debit application can be loaded onto the chip, and can encode data on the magnetic stripe in order to maintain compatibility with the existing infrastructure of magnetic stripe readers.","The card component definition can be used to define different types of physical layout attributes for a card.

Some of the management tasks, such as the enablement and personalization processes, may be encapsulated in process definitions. A process can be initiated either manually by a person who has the required authorization, or it can be started automatically. The processes that are started automatically are usually triggered by a management event.","The management tasks rely on a complete set of definitions. In particular, they utilize the definitions to create the objects that will be managed by the smart card product management system. All of the objects that are managed by the smart card product management system are representations of real world objects within the scheme. For example, a card product definition  is used to create one or more card product objects. The card product object is used to represent a single instance (or occurrence) of a real (physical) card which will be enabled, personalized, and used by a person referred to as a card product holder. Thus, the card product is an instance of a card that is defined by a specific card product definition . A chip object results from the completion of the card manufacturing process. This object is used to carry the unique card ID from the enablement process into the personalization process. An application represents a single occurrence of an application that has been loaded onto a card product. A card product holder is the person who is given a card product to use. An application holder object corresponds to the person who uses a specific application that has been loaded onto a card product. A key holder object is an instance of a key that is used on a card product. A certificate is an instance of a certificate used by a card product.","The objects that are managed by the management tasks may have a life-cycle that consists of a set of states that the object will transition through over a period of time. Each type of object may have a different definition for its life-cycle, which includes different processing when moving from one state to the next state. All managed objects will have a default set of states and state transitions that define its life-cycle. Both the states and states transitions can be either partially modified or completely replaced so that they adhere to a specific customer's requirements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00145","num":"00145"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1000","1002","1002","1004","1006","1006","1008","1006","1006","1010","1008","1010","1016","1018","1022","1020","1012","1014"]},"An application is another example of a managed object that has a specific life-cycle. An example life-cycle is illustrated in FIG. . The application states may change based on factors such as the card operating system, Card Issuer and Application Provider requirements. In the example illustrated in , the application initially begins in the AVAILABLE state  and upon loading enters the LOADED state . When the application is installed, the application enters the INSTALLED state  and when the application is personalized, the application enters the PERSONALIZED state . When the application is issued to the card holder the application enters the ISSUED state  and enters the ACTIVE state  upon activation. The application may also enter the BLOCKED state  prior to activation. From the ACTIVE state , the application may enter the LOST state  or the STOLEN state  prior to entering the BLOCKED state .","As illustrated in , the issuance process contains three primary functions: registration for card products and applications , the card enablement process , and the personalization process . In , the inputs and outputs of each process are also illustrated. The registration function  creates an association between a request for a card product and card product holder, as well as an application and application holder. This process will also create objects that are required for a card product issuance request. The card enablement process  creates a card with an unique card identifier, and associates a card with a specific Card Issuer . After a card is enabled, only the Card Issuer  can authorize changes to the contents of the card. The personalization process  makes a card and its applications specific to a card and application holder. Together these functions are used to initially issue and reissue a card-based product. The card product issuance components can support different types of issuance processes, such as centralized, mass issuance or decentralized, single issuance.","The complete card product issuance process has a specific flow that usually starts with the registration process, and is followed by the card enablement and personalization processes. The issuance process as described with reference to  assumes that the card product and its applications have an associated card product holder and application holder.","Generally, all card products and applications will have a corresponding card product and application holder. The card product holders and application holders are created during the registration process. Registering card product and application holders is optional only if the card product holder will be anonymous. A card with an anonymous card product holder can be personalized to a specific card product holder after the card is issued.","The card enablement and personalization processes are initiated using a card product issuance order. The issuance order can be initiated using an automated process or it can be started manually. The automated ordering process can be triggered based on hitting a threshold of pending card product requests, or it can be started at specific time intervals. When a time interval is used, an order is initiated only when there are pending card product requests that need to be processed.","The registration process  is provided by either the Card Issuer or Registration Authority. The primary purpose of this function is to register a person for a card product, and one or more applications associated with the card product. From the Card Issuer's perspective, the person that is associated with a card product is called a card product holder. The Application Provider view of the card product holder is represented by the entity called the application holder. The registration process  results in the acquisition of personal card product holder and application holder data.","The card product holder and application holder data may be used to personalize the smart card chip, as well as the external card plastic. Address data may be used for PIN mailings and smart card product distribution. This data may also be used to correlate the card product holder with an application, for example a bank account number. The smart card product management system manages the creation and maintenance of this data.","The registration process  is shown in more detail in FIG. . As seen in , the card product holder and application holder data can be obtained through a registration process or from data that already exists in a legacy database or from other sources. Potential card product holders can register for a card product using different methods. The acceptable methods will be defined by the Card Issuer. For example, registration may be by mailing a registration form to the Card Issuer, walk-in to a Registration Authority, calling a Customer Service Center or on-line registration through, for example, the Internet. This information may be utilized to create an instance of a requested card product.","As is further seen in , the Registration Authority may use an administrative user interface to create, modify, delete, or list instances of card and application holders. When a card product or application holder is created, a new instance of this object is created and the data associated with the card product or application holder is stored in the smart card product management system database .","A card product holder is associated with a specific instance of a requested card product, and an application holder is associated with an instance of an application that resides on the card product. The requested card product is a separate object from a card product, and is used only to track requests for a card product. After the request is fulfilled, the requested card product object is deleted, since it is no longer required.","The card enablement process  is defined using a process definition, which contains a set of tasks. As an example, a enablement process according to one embodiment of the present invention is described below. Since this process is defined using a process definition, it can be customized to meet a specific Card Issuer's requirements.","In the example enablement process three tasks are provided.","1. Request Cards: Order a batch of cards from a card manufacturer.","2. Request Control Key: Obtain or generate the control key that will be used to enable the card and make it card issuer specific.","3. Enable Card: Send the control key information to the card manufacturer to enable one or more cards.","Data that is common to all cards of a card type may be loaded onto the card when it is enabled. The card enablement tasks result in a set of enabled cards that can be personalized under the authority of the Card Issuer.","With Java Card, a Card Manager unique to the Card Issuer is loaded onto each card to control subsequent authorized and secure installation of applets on the card, card global data personalization, card life-cycle management, and mapping of an Application Provider's Security Domains.","With MULTOS, the cards are enabled by loading the MULTOS Security Manager (MSM) Controls Data onto the chip. All enabled cards can be referenced using a unique card ID.","The functions performed by the card enablement tasks are illustrated in FIG. .

One card object is created for each card ID in the list."}}}},"The personalization process is defined using a process definition, which contains a set of tasks. This process must follow the card enablement process, since the personalization process requires an enabled card (a card under the control of the Card Issuer). The personalization process takes a card that is owned and controlled by a Card Issuer and updates it to make it specific to a card product holder.

For each Java Card, Application Provider Security Domain(s) and applets from the Application Provider, as well as personalization data for each applet are sent to the Personalization Agency. For either type of card, the smart card product management system may support the acquisition, preparation and distribution of this data to a Personalization Agency.","When a card is lost, stolen, or damaged and needs to be replaced, the application personalization process during reissuance may access the latest updates to the application data. This data may be stored in the Application Provider's database and accessed there during reissuance, or it can be periodically synchronized to the Card Issuer's database so that it can be retrieved there during reissuance.","Generation and maintenance of keys for secure transport, installation and access of on-card applications may also be supported in embodiments of the smart card product management system according to the present invention.","The card product management function provides the post-issuance and\/or multi-enterprise management support.","The Customer Support Service function of the card product management, also referred to as a Call Center or Service Center, is usually the card holder's initial point of contact when they have problems with a card product or they need to request administrative functions for a card product.  illustrates an overview of embodiments of the customer support service interface. The customer support services may utilize the following functions:","1. Query Card Management Data:\n\n","2. Request Status Change:\n\n","3. Update Database:\n\n","A hotlist represents a set of card products or applications that require state changes at their next attempted usage. The most common usage of states change are to disable or resume usage of a card product or application. Hotlist entries may be removed when the state change is reflected on the card, or when an entry is deleted from the hotlist by the Card Issuer. There are several reasons why an entry would be deleted from a hotlist. For example, a card product that was reported lost would be put on the hotlist to block its usage. If the card product holder finds the card later, the hotlist entry would be deleted by the Card Issuer so that the card product holder can continue to use the card product.","Cards may also be put on a hotlist because they have been reported stolen and must be disabled to prevent unauthorized usage. An application may be put on a hotlist for a variety of reasons. For example, it may appear on the hotlist to disable usage by a card product holder until a bill or charge has been settled. After an application has been disabled, it can appear on the hotlist again to resume usage after the bill or charge has been settled.  illustrates embodiments of hot list processing and utilizes the following set of hotlist management functions:","1.

The policies and rules are the functions that are required for true multi-application card management within a multi-enterprise environment.","Policies may be set by the smart card product management solution owner and are used to control functional processing and interactions within a smart card product management solution. Policies may set the rules that control the interactions between enterprises, and establish the roles and responsibilities of each enterprise, so that transactions can be routed to the correct location. This function is usually controlled by the Card Issuer, and generally involves encoding the business relationships with other enterprises into scheme policies.","A policy manager is used to control all of the smart card product management solution policies. The policies are viewed and updated through the policy manager. The policy manager is consulted prior to processing a function which is policy driven. All of the processing within the smart card product management system adheres to the policies.","An example of a policy is the requirement for data synchronization. It may be important for a smart card product management system to maintain the location of all information required to reissue a card. The policies can be used to determine if this information should be synchronized to one central location periodically, or if it should be requested as needed.","A smart card product management solution may also contain a set of distributed events that can be received by one or more event listeners. The core set of events will be the state changes that occur within definitions and instance objects. For example, an event will be generated when a card product's state changes from ACTIVE to STOLEN, or when an application's state changes to INSTALLED. Event processing is one way to easily extend the base functionality of the system based on the requirements of the Card Issuer or to encode the business relationships between the Card Issuer and its business partners. Hotlist management processing can be implemented using this type of function. The hotlist management process could be an event listener for card product state changes such as ACTIVE to STOLEN, or ACTIVE to LOST. When the state change event is received by the hotlist management process, it can prepare an entry in the hotlist report which will be distributed devices or device servers.","Another example of an event listener could be a billing program run by the Card Issuer. The billing program is responsible for charging an Application Provider each time an application is installed on a card. This type of program could be an event listener that receives events when an application's state changes to INSTALLED.","An event monitor may be used to process distributed events within the smart card product management system. The event monitor is responsible for starting and stopping all event processors, and for routing events to the event processors that are listening for the event.","An event processor can process one or more events, by registering for the events and implementing event listeners. The core set of events will be the state changes that occur within an entity type. An event processor can register and listen for any number of state changes.","Security and auditing services may also provide system access security, transaction logging, error logging, system backup and recovery, and system management hooks. System access security may ensure the security and integrity of a smart card product management system's data and processing logic. In general, security policies may be defined based on session-level authentication and transaction-level authorization requirements.","There may be several types of users that will use client interfaces to access the smart card product management system. Each user may have different levels of authority which will restrict the functions that they can access.

The legacy system interfaces provide a connection from the smart card product management system to these existing enterprise systems. The application connections allow disparate applications to communicate with each other.","The components of a smart card product management system can be operated by different enterprises on different systems. For example, the smart card product management system may provide the capability to manage the communication between the enterprises and delegate management responsibilities to an enterprise based on the policies defined by the Card Issuer.","When communicating directly between components of the system, the CORBA Internet InterOrb Protocol (IIOP) may be used. This method can also be used by other systems which need to communicate with components within the smart card product management system. These other systems can be written in any language that uses CORBA\/IIOP, as long as its components are deployed in a manner that makes them accessible through CORBA interfaces.","When components of the smart card product management system must communicate with other systems that do not support CORBA interfaces, messages may be used as the means of communication. Generally, messages are requests that are processed by a server in the context of a transaction. A transaction is a unit of work (or a collection of operations) that interacts with one or more shared databases.","Within a smart card product management solution, the enterprise interfaces may indicate the transaction data that needs to flow between enterprises and may also specify how the data is transferred between enterprises. Enterprise interfaces may include an Application Provider interface, a Card Bureau interface, a Certificate Authority interface, a Registration Authority interface, a Trusted Third Party interface, a Customer Support interface and a Card and Card Terminal interface. For each interface that requires a transaction between enterprises, both the transaction request and the transaction response may be defined in a standard message format using XML. Examples of these interfaces are briefly described below.","Application Provider Interface (API)","The API ensures that the interface adheres to overall policies established by the Card Issuer. The API also provides a method to synchronize application data between enterprises as dictated by the scheme policies. The API may also provide for sending card hotlist notification to the Application Provider. The API may be used to process application suspend requests from the Application Provider and send notification that the application has been suspended. The API may also receive the information that is required to register an application with the MULTOS CA so that it can be put onto a card owned by the Card Issuer. The API may also provide for receiving the application code, static data and key needed to create the Application Load Unit (ALU) or Load Commands. Additionally, the API may provide for processing add, update, and delete application requests based on requests received from the Application Provider.","Card Bureau Interface (CBI)","The CBI may be utilized to send the information that is required for card personal ization. The CBI may also provide for sending information that is required to mail card letters. The CBI may also be utilized to optimize card requests based on Card Domain (Product ID) or Control Data Date. The CBI may exchange information that can be used for card inventory tracking. The CBI may further be used to request M-ULTOS Carrier Device (MCD) Ids needed to request certificates and send MULTOS Security Manager(MSM) Controls Data.","Certificate Authority Interface (CAI)","The CAI may provide for requesting generation of certificates for both cards and applications and may also be used to reissue a certificate for a card or application. The CAI may securely transmit certificates between enterprises and exchange information that is required to revoke a certificate. The CAI may provide for registering to become a MUTOS Card issuer. The CAI may also be used to register applications so that they can be loaded onto a card and request Application Load Certificates (ALC) and Application Delete Certificates (ADC).","Registration Authority Interface (RAI)","The RAI may provide for registering a card product holder for a specific type of card and registering a card product holder to add applications to a card. The RAI may also handle the requirement for anonymous card holders.","Trusted Third Party Interface (TTPI)","The TTPI may provide for requesting key generation for both cards and applications and securely transmitting keys from one enterprise to another.","Customer Support Center Interface (CSCI)","The CSCI may be utilized to report lost, stolen, damaged or defective cards, update card product holder related information and request a card replacement.","Card and Card Terminal Interface (CCTI)","The CCTI may be used to securely transmit the application load or delete request. The CCTI may also be used to activate a card or block a cards usage, suspend a single application (which is not the same as deleting the application) and track card utilization.","The database interfaces may be used to add, update, delete, and query data that is in the database. Databases may be used by the card management servers for different purposes, so functional capabilities may vary according to specific customer requirements. For card product and application management, a relational database may be used to manage the complex relationships between data objects. The basic database interface provides the function required to support relational databases, such as DB, Oracle, Informix, and Sybase. The database interfaces may also provide interfaces to existing customer databases.","The smart card product management system may also provide for transactional database control. A transaction is a unit of work (or a collection of operations) that interacts with one or more shared databases. Embodiments of the smart card product management system according to the present invention may provide transactions with the following characteristics:","Atomicity: A transaction will either execute completely or all of its effects will be undone (rolled back).","Consistency: A transaction must produce consistent results, by maintaining the internal consistency of each database.","Isolation: A transaction's intermediate states are not visible to other transactions. Transactions appear to execute serially, even if they run concurrently.","Durability: The effects of a completed transaction are persistent. An example of a transaction is transferring money from a checking account to a savings account. The unit of work consists of two operations:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00311","num":"00311"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},"1. Card Product Administration:\n\n","2.

As seen in , a smart card product may be produced by providing generic definitions which may have predefined relationship to other generic definitions so as to provide a hierarchy of generic definitions (block ). Such definition may be as illustrated in FIG.  and may describe various characteristics of smart card products and\/or processes which may be used to manage smart card products. Particular definitions from these generic definitions are selected and associated with a card product definition so as to define characteristics of particular smart card product associated with an instance of the card product definition (block ). The selected generic definitions may also be linked to other selected definitions to further define the hierarchy of generic definitions associated with the instance of the smart card product definition (block ). The selected generic definitions may be populated with data associate with the smart card product so as to provide instances of the generic definitions which define the characteristics of the smart card product (block ). The smart card product may then be managed utilizing the hierarchy of instances of the generic definitions so as to provide the smart card product having the defined characteristics (block ). Management of the smart card product may include the various processes and operations for any period up to and including throughout the life of the smart card product. Examples of such management include those aspects of the smart card product management system described above with referent to  as well as those described below with reference to .","Illustrated in  are operations carried out by smart card product management systems according to embodiments of the present invention to initiate the manufacture and enablement of cards and to perform post-processing after the process completes. These exemplary processes include card enablement, card holder registration, card personalization and issuance, hot list management, and post-issuance application loads. Each of these processes will be described below. For each step, references to Smart Card component definitions are shown in bold.","Card Enablement","As seen in , operations for card enablement begin by the card issuer preparing an order for some number of cards to be enabled (block ). A list of CardProduct definition IDs may be used to assist in interactive order preparation. Chip definitions (if more than one) associated with a CardProduct definition may be presented as well.","The card enablement transaction is submitted to the management system (block ) and the smart card product management system invokes a Card Enablement Process (block ). The CardProduct definition is used to locate the Process definition with Type \u201cEnablement\u201d. Task definitions associated with the Process definition are interrogated and an initial task's Connection definition is used to locate and initiate the initial task execution.","A task associated with the enablement process definition prepares a bill of materials for the order (block ). Such a bill of materials may be created by a task or tasks which traverse the CardProduct definition to find Application and Key definitions which may be required to acquire application code to be initialized in EEPROM and to locate issuer's security controls. The order may then be sent for approval(s) (block ). A task definition may be used to find and initiate an executable interface to approval personnel. The CardProduct definition may be used by approval personnel to interrogate the data repository(ies) for inventory numbers and to verify order preparation details. When approved, the order with bill of materials is sent to a Card Manufacturer (block ). The CardProduct definition may be used to find an Enterprise definition for the Card Manufacturer and its associated Connection definition to initiate the transaction. When the task is complete, a response is received from the Card Manufacturer (block ). A task definition may also be used to initiate post-processing. CardProduct, Application and Chip definitions may be used to create records to represent actual cards and their enabled contents.","Card Holder Registration","As seen in , the registration process may begin by a user applying for a card via a Registration Authority, on-line registration or other such methods (block ). The CardProductHolder definition may be used by the RA to validate applicant data. The CardProduct definition may also be used to find Application definitions which specify whether an application is optional and may be selected. The ApplicationHolder definition determines what unique application data (e.g. Employee serial, account number, etc.) needs to be obtained from applicant. When the data is gathered, a Card Holder registration transaction is submitted (block ). The smart card product management system executes the Card Holder registration transaction (block ). The CardProductHolder definition is used to create a new card product holder record. The ApplicationHolder definition is used to create a new application holder record for each application selected by applicant.","Card Personalization and Issuance","As seen in , a Card Issuer prepares an order for some number of cards to be issued (block ). This order may be for all registered card holders waiting for an issue of the specific card product or for particular card holders. A list of CardProduct definition IDs may be used to assist in interactive order preparation, or to select all registered card holders waiting for a card to be issued. The card issuance transaction is submitted to the smart card product management system (block ). In response, the management system invokes the card personalization and issuance process (block ). The CardProduct definition is used to locate a process definition with Type \u201cPersonalization\u201d. Task definitions associated with the Process definition are interrogated and an initial task's Connection definition is used to locate and initiate execution of the initial task.","Personalization data is gathered as the bill of materials for the personalization aspects of issuance (block ). Using the CardProduct definition, the CardProductHolder, Application and ApplicationHolder definitions are accessed to begin acquiring personalization data for the card. An Enterprise definition and its associated Connection definition are used to interact with each application provider to acquire the personalization data for the application which they support. Key and Certificate definitions associated with each application are used to determine security data for personalizing the card.","When complete, the order is sent for approval(s) (block ). A Task definition may be used to find and initiate an executable interface for approval personnel. The CardProduct definition may be used by the approval personnel to interrogate the data repository(ies) for inventory numbers and to verify order preparation details.","When approved, the order with a personalization bill of materials, is sent to the Card Issuer's Personalization Agency (block ). The CardProduct definition is used to find the Enterprise definition for PA and its associated Connection definition to initiate the transaction. When the task is complete, a response is received from the PA (block ). The Task definition may be used to initiate post-processing. The CardProductHolder and Application records are associated with an enabled CardProduct record. Key and Certificate records are created and associated with Applications records as required.","Hot List","An additional smart card product management function which may be provided by a management system is the capability to report that a card has been lost or stolen, and to prevent subsequent unauthorized use of that card. Typically, a management system will produce a list of cards which is then distributed and made available to the card terminals for real-time detection.","As illustrated in , the hot list operations may be initiated by receiving notification that a card has been lost or stolen (block ) from, for example, a Call Center or other form of customer support service. Using some form of customer or card identification and card product type, the CardProduct and CardProductHolder definitions are used to find the card holder and card product record and to validate the report. If valid, a stolen card or lost card transaction is submitted to the system (block ). The stolen or lost card transaction results in the Hot List process being initiated (block ). The CardProduct definition may be used to find the Process definition with type \u201cHotList\u201d. Task definitions associated with the Process definition are interrogated and an initial task's Connection definition is used to locate and initiate task execution.","A Hot List entry is prepared (block ). The CardProduct record is marked \u201cStolen\u201d or \u201cLost\u201d. The serial number of the card and any other data required is prepared for distribution. The Hot List entry is then distributed (block ). The Task definition and Connection definition are used to determine how to execute the distribution of the Hot List entry. Device definition(s) might be used to determine a distribution destination(s). If the card is utilized again, the management system may be notified of this subsequent usage (block ). The CardProduct definition may be used again to locate the subject card product record, which is then updated to reflect that the card has been \u201cblocked\u201d or possibly suspended.","Post-issuance Application Load","Multi-application smart cards may offer the capability to dynamically load (or delete) applications after the card has been issued to a card holder. Typically, the card holder will initiate a request to add a new application using an interface or procedure provided by the card issuer or by an application provider.  illustrates operations which may be carried out by the smart card product management system to accomplish the post-issuance load of an application in response to a card holder request.","As seen in , a card holder prepares a request to load a new application on the card product (block ). The CardProduct definition and associated Application definitions could be used by the interface to present appropriate selections to the card holder for the card product to be updated. An application load transaction is then submitted to the smart card product management system (block ). The application load transaction results in the Application load process being invoked by the smart card product management system (block ). The CardProduct definition may be used to find the Process definition with type \u201cApplicationLoad\u201d. The Task definitions associated with the Process definition are interrogated and an initial task's Connection definition is used to locate and initiate task execution. The application load request is also validated (block ). The CardProduct, Application, Chip and Platform definitions are used to validate the request, determining if the requested application is valid for the card, whether there is enough memory (EEPROM) on the card, whether this card holder is authorized for the application, etc.","If valid, the application load is prepared (block ). The Application and ApplicationHolder definitions may be used to prepare the application code to be installed and to access any personalization data for the application for this holder. The Application definition may have associated Enterprise and Connection definitions which determine how to request personalization data from the application provider. Key and Certificate definitions may be interrogated to determine the security requirements for the applications and to acquire these items if necessary. Finally, the application load unit may then be distributed for installation (block ). The Task definition and its Connection definition may be used to determine how to execute the distribution of the new application load unit to the card terminal which can perform the installation.","The operations for smart card product management illustrated in  may provide core functions which provide for creation and control of smart card products. Thus, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, these core functions may be further manipulated to provide additional smart card product management functions. Accordingly, the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular definitions and processes described herein but the definitions and processes are provided as examples of the uses of embodiments of the present invention.","The flowcharts and block diagrams of  illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products for smart card product management. In this regard, each block in the flow charts or block diagrams represents a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.","In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00018","num":"00018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00032","num":"00032"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00033","num":"00033"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00039","num":"00039"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00040","num":"00040"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00043","num":"00043"},"figref":"FIG. 28"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
