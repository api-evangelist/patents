title: System and method for automatic detection of collocation mistakes in documents
abstract: A method and computer-readable medium are provided that construct a collocation mistake pattern database for use in writing in a first language by a person whose native language is a second language. The method includes obtaining a bilingual corpus having sentences in first and second languages and extracting second language word pairs from the second language sentences in the corpus. For each second language word pair extracted from the corpus, a corresponding first language word pair is extracted from the corresponding first language sentence in the corpus to determine a correct first language translation for the second language word pair. Also, for each second language word pair extracted from the corpus, a set of combinations of first language translation words corresponding to the second language word pair is created. Finally, for each second language word pair extracted from the corpus, the correct first language translation is removed from the set of combinations of first language translation words such that the set of combinations represent a set of collocation mistake first language word pairs corresponding to the second language word pair.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to machine aided writing systems and methods. In particular, the present invention relates to systems and methods for aiding users in writing in non-native languages.","With an ever increasing global economy, and with the rapid development of the Internet, people all over the world are becoming increasingly familiar with writing in a language which is not their native language. Unfortunately, for some societies that possess significantly different cultures and writing styles, the ability to write in some non-native languages is an ever-present barrier. When writing in a non-native language (for example English), language usage mistakes are frequently made by the non-native speakers (for example, people who speak Chinese, Japanese, Korean or other non-English languages). These kind of mistakes can include both grammatical mistakes and improper usage of collocations such as verb-object, adjective-noun, adverb-verb, etc.","Many people have the ability to write in a non-native language using proper grammar, but they still may struggle with mistakes in collocations between two the words. Still others struggle with both grammar and other mistakes such as collocations between two words. While spell checking and grammar checking programs and systems are useful in correcting grammatical mistakes, detection and\/or correction of mistakes in collocations between two words can be difficult, particularly since these mistakes can be otherwise grammatically correct. Therefore, grammar checkers typically provide very little assistance, if any, in detecting mistakes relating to the collocation between words. English is used as an example of the non-native language in the following discussion, but these problems persist across other language boundaries.","For example, consider the following sentences which contain collocation mistakes which cause the sentences to not be native-like English, even if otherwise grammatically correct.\n\n","As an example of the barriers faced by non-native English speaking peoples, consider the plight of the Chinese user. By culture, background and thinking habits, Chinese people often produce English sentences which may be grammatical, but not natural. For example, Chinese people tend to directly translate subjects in Chinese into subjects in English, and do the same with objects and verbs. When writing in English, Chinese people often experience difficulty in deciding the collocations between verbs and prepositions, adjectives and nouns, verbs and nouns, etc. Moreover, in specific domains like the business domain, special writing skills and styles are needed.","Common dictionaries are mainly used by non-native speakers for the purpose of reading (a kind of decoding process), but these dictionaries do not provide enough support for writing (a kind of encoding process). They only provide the explanation of a single word, and they typically do not provide sufficient information to explain relevant phrases and collocations. Moreover, there is no easy way to get this kind of information from dictionaries, even if some of the information is provided in the dictionaries. On the other hand, current widely used grammar checking tools have some limited ability in detecting apt-to-make grammatical mistakes, but are not able to detect the collocation mistakes.","Although the aforementioned problems are described with reference to English language writing by native Chinese speaking people, these problems are common for people who are writing in a first (non-native) language, but who are native speakers of a second (native) language. In light of these problems, a system or method which aids non-native speakers in preparing documents without collocation mistakes would be a significant improvement in the art. Further, an improved method of constructing a collocation mistake pattern or template database, for use by such a system or method would be a significant improvement.","A method and computer-readable medium are provided that construct a collocation mistake pattern database for use in writing in a first language by a person whose native language is a second language. The method includes obtaining a bilingual corpus having sentences in first and second languages and extracting second language word pairs from the second language sentences in the corpus. For each second language word pair extracted from the corpus, a corresponding first language word pair is extracted from the corresponding first language sentence in the corpus to determine a correct first language translation for the second language word pair. Also, for each second language word pair extracted from the corpus, a set of combinations of first language translation words corresponding to the second language word pair is created. Finally, for each second language word pair extracted from the corpus, the correct first language translation is removed from the set of combinations of first language translation words such that the set of combinations represent a set of collocation mistake first language word pairs corresponding to the second language word pair.","The invention is directed toward systems and methods which detect typical language usage mistakes frequently made by non-native speakers of the language being written in. The invention includes systems and method for constructing a collocation mistake database for use in this process. The invention is described with reference to people whose native language is not English. (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.), but who are writing in English. However, the invention applies to similar problems persisting across other language boundaries. These kinds of mistakes include improper usage of collocations such as verb-object, adjective-noun, adverb-verb, etc. Unlike the spelling check and grammar check used widely in word processing systems, the present invention focuses on detection of mistakes in collocations between two words. These mistakes can be grammatical or non-grammatical.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Under one aspect of the invention, an improved method of constructing a collocation mistake detection\/suggestion pattern database is disclosed. Under another aspect of the present invention, a matching algorithm and the database are used to detect collocation mistakes in the written document and to provide suggestions for correcting the collocation mistakes.","1. Construction of a Detection\/Suggestion Pattern Database","The database construction or acquisition process is supported with the use of a large sentence aligned bilingual corpus (Chinese-English in this example). The Chinese sentences in the bilingual corpus are parsed in order to get the dependency structure between words. For the Chinese words in the corpus, word alignment techniques are used to determine their correct English translation words from the corresponding English sentences in the corpus. Word pairs of specified dependency-structures and their corresponding translations are then extracted. For example, all of the pairs of words having verb-object dependency and adjective-noun relation, as well as their corresponding English translations, can be extracted from the corpus. An example is shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Dependency",{},{}]},{"entry":["relations","Explanation","Examples"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Verb-","Contains Chinese word",{"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001","he":"3.56mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US07031911-20060418-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"3.56mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US07031911-20060418-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}]}]},{"entry":["Object","pair of verb and its"]},{"entry":[{},"object, and its English"]},{"entry":[{},"translation"]},{"entry":["Adjective-","Contains Chinese word",{"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003","he":"3.56mm","wi":"7.03mm","file":"US07031911-20060418-P00003.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004","he":"3.56mm","wi":"4.91mm","file":"US07031911-20060418-P00004.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}]}]},{"entry":["Noun","pair of subject and"]},{"entry":[{},"its predicate, and its"]},{"entry":[{},"English translation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In this way, a large database describing Chinese phrases and their correct translations can be obtained. The correspondence between Chinese word pairs and their correct English language translations are annotated. The English words by are then replaced by the various possible English translations of the corresponding Chinese words. For each Chinese word pair of the particular dependency structure, all possible combinations of the English translation words, except for the combination corresponding to the correct translation identified using sentence and word alignment, are saved in the mistake pattern database.","The process of constructing a collocation mistake pattern database, which is described generally above, is illustrated in greater detail in the flow diagram  shown in . The method of constructing a mistake pattern database is illustrated in  both generically with reference to construction of a database which aids in the process of writing in a first language by native speakers of a second language, and more specifically, with reference to construction of a database which aids native Chinese speaking people in correcting collocation mistakes while writing in English.","As shown at , a sentence aligned bilingual corpus is obtained. Generally, a large bilingual corpus is more useful in generating the collocation mistake pattern database than would be a smaller corpus. Also, the bilingual corpus should be sentence aligned to allow correlation of the words and phrases contained in each sentence for the two languages. The sentence aligned bilingual corpus can be either constructed using existing techniques, or it can be obtained from other sources.","Then, word alignment techniques are used to align words or phrases between sentences in the first language (for example English) and sentences in the second language (for example Chinese), as shown at . Steps  and  can be combined in various embodiments, so long as a sentence and word aligned bilingual corpus is created or obtained. Word alignment between the sentences in the first language (e.g., English) and sentences in the second language (e.g., Chinese) can be accomplished using any of a wide variety of word alignment technologies or techniques. Generally, these techniques correlate words or groups of words in sentences in the first language with corresponding words or groups of words in sentences of the second language within the bilingual corpus. A brief discussion of an example word alignment technique is provided with reference to , but the methods of the present invention are not limited to any particular word alignment technique.","Referring for the moment to , shown is a data flow diagram illustrating a word alignment technique which can be used in some embodiments of the present invention.  shows that in one word alignment process, the source language input sentence  and an example under consideration  are input to a first alignment component which operates as a bilingual dictionary aligner . Aligner  describes how two words in different languages can possibly be translated into one another. There are a wide variety of different ways in which this has been done. Some metrics for evaluating this type of translation include a translation probability such as that found in Brown et al., Computational Linguistics, 19(2), pp. 263\u2013311 (1993), a dice coefficient such as that found in Ker et al., -, Computational Linguistics Vol. 23, Num. 2, pp. 313\u2013343 (1997), mutual information such as that found in Brown, P. F., , COLING-88, Vol. 1, pp. 71\u201376 (1998), and t-score such as that found in Pascale, , Computational Linguistics, 21(4), pp. 226\u2013233 (1995).","Bilingual dictionary aligner  thus establishes high confidence single word anchor points which are direct word translations from source language input sentence  to example sentence . These can be used later during phrase alignment.","Next, in cases where example sentence  is in a non-segmented language (such as Chinese) example sentence  undergoes word segmentation. This can be done in any of a wide variety of different, known ways and the present invention is not limited to any specific word segmentation technique. Word segmentation of the example sentence  is indicated by block  in .","A distortion model aligner  is then employed. Distortion model aligner  describes how likely one position in the source language sentence  can be aligned to another position in the target language example sentence . As with the bilingual dictionary aligner , there are a wide variety of different distortion model aligners  which can be employed. Some such models include absolute distortion (such as in Brown, cited above), relative offset (such as in Brown), hidden markoff model (HMM)-based systems and structure constraint systems (also found in Brown).","Even after word alignment and distortion modeling, there is still likely to be some unaligned portions of the input sentence. Therefore, a monolingual dictionary is accessed to merge characters into words and words into phrases. This is indicated by block  in . In other words, even if the bilingual dictionary is very large, its coverage is still very limited because of the basic complexity of language. Using a monolingual dictionary, some separate words (that should not be separate because they are part of a phrase) can be identified as a phrase. Thus, phrase merging is implemented.","Similarly, any known statistical alignment component can be used in an effort to align unaligned words. This is indicated by block . Such statistical alignment techniques are known and are simply provided with a threshold to constrain the statistical alignment space.","Taking all of these items into account, the word alignment results  are output by the word alignment system.","While, in the embodiments shown in , the word alignment mechanism includes translation information from bilingual dictionary aligner , distortion aligner model , phrase merging component  and statistical alignment component , other sources of information can be used as well. For example, the t-score mentioned above can be used as can contextual information. In any case, the word alignment results  can provide anchor points which reflect high confidence alignments between the source language input sentence  and example sentence . These anchor points can be used during phrase alignment.","Referring now back to , after a sentence and word aligned bilingual corpus is obtained or produced, the sentences in the second language (e.g., Chinese) are dependency parsed to obtain the dependency structures between words in the sentences of the corpus. This is shown at step  in . After the dependency structures between words in the second language (e.g., Chinese) sentences in the corpus are identified, word pairs having a particular dependency structure (e.g., verb-object, object-noun, etc.) are extracted from the second language (e.g., Chinese) sentences in the corpus. This is illustrated at step  in .","For the word pairs extracted from the second language (e.g., Chinese) sentences in the bilingual corpus, the corresponding translation words are extracted from the first language (e.g., English) sentences in the corpus. For a particular dependency structure, this results in a database of word pairs in the first language, and their correct word pair translations. This is shown in  at .","To construct the collocation mistake pattern database, for each word pair in the second language (e.g., Chinese), a set of corresponding collocation mistake word pairs in the first language (e.g., English) must be identified. This is illustrated at  in . In order to accomplish this, for each word pair in the second language having a particular dependency structure, translate each word of the word pair into all of its corresponding translation words in the first language. This is not limited to the translation words from the correct translation word pairs identified in step , but rather is a separate translation of each of the words in the word pair in the first language into all of its possible translation words. This can be accomplished using a machine readable bilingual dictionary, for example.","Given a word pair in the second language (e.g., Chinese), the set of corresponding collocation mistake word pairs in the first language (e.g., English) is identified by creating a set of combinations of translations of the words from the second language word pair. For example, if a first word of a Chinese word pair has three different English language translation words and a second word of the Chinese word pair had four different English language translation words, twelve separate combinations of translations of the words from the Chinese word pair can be included in the set.","Next, for each set of combinations of translation word pairs in the first language (e.g., in English) corresponding to a word pair in the second language (e.g., Chinese), the correct word pair translation identified in step  is removed from the set to create the mistake pattern database. This is shown in  at . The database correlates the Chinese (or second language) word pair, the correct translation English (or first language) word pair, and the collocation mistake translation English (or first language) word pairs.","A system for creating the mistake pattern database is also disclosed. The system  shown in  is described with reference to an example illustrating the above-described method of creating the mistake pattern database. In this example, the process is discussed with regard to a verb-object relation. However, the process can be repeated for other dependency structures as well.","1. Prepare a Large Chinese-English Bilingual Corpus","As discussed above with reference to , a sentence aligned bilingual corpus  is obtained. However, a bilingual corpus that has not been sentenced aligned can be obtained and sentence alignment can be performed on the corpus if desired.","2. Perform Sentence Alignment and Word Alignment on the Bilingual Corpus","If the corpus is already sentence aligned, only word alignment is necessary. A word alignment component  uses an alignment tool  to align words between the Chinese sentences and their corresponding English sentences in corpus . The word alignment component can be any program, subroutine, module, etc. that uses an alignment tool such as described with reference to  to perform the word alignment. Although a particular alignment tool has been described, word alignment can be performed using any appropriate technique.","For the purposes of this example, consider the bilingual sentence pair:\n\n","Using a Chinese parser  (or more generally a parser for the second language) the Chinese sentences (more generally, the second language sentences) in the corpus are parsed as shown at  in order to obtain the dependency structure between words within the sentences. In the example sentences provided above, dependency parsing results in the following word pairs.","Dependency parsing to the Chinese Sentence:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["(subject-verb, , )","(adverb-verb, , )","(verb-object, , )\n\n4.

For example, for the Chinese sentence used in this example, the corresponding English dependency relations are:\n\n","As shown in , an English translation substitution component  creates a set of mistake English word pairs which are stored in mistake patterns database . This process can be as described with reference to steps  and  shown in . An illustration of these steps is provided below in a pseudocode format.

An example system which uses the mistake pattern or template database  to correct collocation mistakes during the process of writing an English language (or more generally a first language) document is shown in .","System  shown in  can be embodied in a computing environment such as those shown in . As shown in , an input sentence  is entered into the system. In this example the input sentence  is a sentence in the English language which may contain collocation mistakes. The sentence can be input into the system using any desired mechanism, including using a keyboard  or using a microphone  (and a speech-to-text conversion program), both of which are shown in . The input sentence can also be entered into the system using other methods, such as importing the sentence from another system or retrieving the sentence from memory.","As shown at component or step , an English language parser  is used to parse the input English sentence to determine the dependency-structures within the sentence. In the case that entire parsing is not possible because the sentence is too complicated, a partial parse can be used. English parser  can be any of a wide number of parsers which are known in the art.","Then, as shown at , the word pairs or phrases having dependency structures identified during parsing are matched with the mistake patterns in database  created using the method described above. As shown at component or step , if a word pair (to include phrases) is found to have a match with a collocation mistake word pair in the database, the area of the suspected collocation mistake word pair can be highlighted in some manner in the written sentence, while the correction collocation suggestion associated in the database with the particular mistake word pair pattern is presented to the writer. In some embodiments, the system will not correct the translation automatically, but will present the suggestion to the writer for consideration. Using a user interface  such as a keyboard , a pointing device, , etc., the user confirms or accept the suggestion, or rejects the suggestion and keeps the original sentence in tact. This is shown at .","The following example in which (verb, noun) pairs having the verb-object relation dependency structure are checked for collocation mistakes. This process would be similarly used for other dependency structures as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
