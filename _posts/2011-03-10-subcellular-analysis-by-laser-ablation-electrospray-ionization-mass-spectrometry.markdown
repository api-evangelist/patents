No. 12\/323,276, filed on Nov. 25, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,964,834, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/176,324, filed on Jul. 18, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,067,730, which claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/951,186, filed on Jul. 20, 2007, each of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","Portions of this invention were made with United States government support under Grant No. 0719232 awarded by the National Science Foundation and Grant No. DEFG02-01ER15129 awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The apparatuses and methods described herein generally relate to ionization sources for mass spectrometers and methods of mass spectrometry, and in particular, laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) mass spectrometry (MS), as well as methods of making and using the same.","Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that has been successfully used in chemistry, biology, and other fields for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The analysis of single cells and subcellular components by conventional methods of mass spectrometry may be problematic. For example, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) may suffer from time consuming and complex sample preparation, and in situ analysis of a sample under vacuum may be difficult. MALDI also utilizes a matrix that may interfere with the analysis of single cells and subcellular components. Mass spectrometry may be combined with separation techniques, such as capillary electrophoresis and fractionation, however, these techniques may increase the analysis time, complexity and\/or cost. These conventional methods, however, may cause environmental perturbations that may affect the composition of the cell and\/or subcellular components.","Accordingly, more efficient and\/or cost-effective ionization sources for mass spectrometers and methods of making and using the same are desirable.","As generally used herein, the articles \u201cone\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d refer to \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d, unless otherwise indicated.","As generally used herein, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d mean \u201ccomprising\u201d.","As used herein, the terms \u201cLAESI-MS\u201d refer to laser ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.","As generally used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d refers to an acceptable degree of error for the quantity measured, given the nature or precision of the measurements. Typical exemplary degrees of error may be within 20%, 10%, or 5% of a given value or range of values. Alternatively, and particularly in biological systems, the terms \u201cabout\u201d refers to values within an order of magnitude, potentially within 5-fold or 2-fold of a given value.","All numerical quantities stated herein are approximate unless stated otherwise; meaning that the term \u201cabout\u201d may be inferred when not expressly stated. The numerical quantities disclosed herein are to be understood as not being strictly limited to the exact numerical values recited. Instead, unless stated otherwise, each numerical value is intended to mean both the recited value and a functionally equivalent range surrounding that value. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding the approximations of numerical quantities stated herein, the numerical quantities described in specific examples of actual measured values are reported as precisely as possible.","All numerical ranges stated herein include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of \u201c1 to 10\u201d is intended to include all sub-ranges between and including the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10. Any maximum numerical limitation recited herein is intended to include all lower numerical limitations. Any minimum numerical limitation recited herein is intended to include all higher numerical limitations.","In the following description, certain details are set forth in order to provide a better understanding of various embodiments of ionization sources for mass spectrometers and methods for making and using the same. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the embodiments described herein may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures and methods associated with mass spectrometers and methods of mass spectrometry may not be shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the embodiments of this disclosure.","This disclosure describes various features, aspects, and advantages of various embodiments of ionization sources for mass spectrometers and methods for making and using the same. It is understood, however, that this disclosure embraces numerous alternative embodiments that may be accomplished by combining any of the various features, aspects, and advantages of the various embodiments described herein in any combination or sub-combination that one of ordinary skill in the art may find useful.","Eukaryotic cells may be found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Eukaryotic cells may include a cell wall and\/or a cell membrane, and subcellular components that may be enclosed within a membrane. The subcellular components may provide a specific function. Some examples of subcellular components include cytoplasm and organelles including, but not limited to, a nucleus, a mitochondrion, a chloroplast, a ribosome, an endoplasmic reticulum, a Golgi apparatus, a lysosome, a proteasome, a secretory vesicle, a vacuole, and a microsome. Some organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, may have their own genome separate from that found in the nucleus. Prokaryotic cells may be found in microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotic cells generally lack a nucleus, and may include a cell wall and\/or a cell membrane and other subcellular components. Prokaryotic cells may include subcellular components lacking a membrane.","Analysis of subcellular components in single cells, such as the cytoplasm and organelles, may provide insight into the metabolism and\/or metabolites of a living cell.

The subcellular distribution of metabolites in the cell may change depending on its biological state, developmental stage, history, and\/or environment. For example, the metabolic micro-compartmentalization and\/or metabolic channeling may provide means for transporting metabolites and intermediates among active sites of subcellular components. When the metabolites exhibit locally restricted diffusion, the cell may show indicia of intracellular heterogeneity of metabolites and\/or compartmentalization of metabolites in particular organelles and\/or other subcellular components. Identification and analysis of metabolite distribution may facilitate a better understanding of cell function.","In certain embodiments, the sample may comprise a single cell, cells, small cell populations, cell lines, and\/or tissues, each sample comprising water.

In at least one embodiment, the regulated power supply may provide a 3.0 kV to the electrospray emitter. The electrospray emitter may be mounted on a manual translation stage to optimize the LAESI signal by adjusting the relative position of the sample, electrospray emitter, and\/or inlet orifice of the mass spectrometer. The electrospray solution may be applied at an angle from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, such as 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0, into the ablation plume. The angle may be adjusted from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 to optimize ion production. In at least one embodiment, the electrospray solution may be applied at a right angle) (90\u00b0 into the ablation plume.","According to certain embodiments, the mass spectrometer orifice may be on the same or a different axis as the electrospray emitter of the LAESI ion source. The angle between the mass spectrometer orifice and electrospray emitter of the LAESI ion source may be from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, such as 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0. The distance from the mass spectrometer orifice to the electrospray emitter tip may be from 1 mm to 20 mm, such as 5 mm to 15 mm. In at least one embodiment, the distance from the mass spectrometer orifice to the electrospray emitter tip may be 12 mm. The sample may be placed onto a pre-cleaned microscope glass slide (catalog no. 125496, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.). The sample may be placed onto a stepper motor-driven three axis precision flexure stage (NanoMax TS, Thorlabs, Newton, N.J.). The sample may be 1 mm to 30 mm below the spray axis, such as 5 mm to 25 mm, and 10 mm to 20 mm. In at least one embodiment, the sample may be 15 mm below the spray axis. In one experiment, no ions were detected by the mass spectrometer when the ESI was off, indicating that no ions directly induced by the laser were collected.","The ions produced by the LAESI ion source may be analyzed by a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer may comprise an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Premier, Waters Co., MA). The orifice of the mass spectrometer may have an inner diameter from 100 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm, such as 225 \u03bcm to 375 \u03bcm. In at least one embodiment, the orifice of the mass spectrometer may have an inner diameter from 100 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm, such as 127 \u03bcm. The orifice of the mass spectrometer may be extended by a straight or curved extension tube having a similar inner diameter as the orifice of the mass spectrometer and a length from 20 mm to 500 mm. The interface block temperature may be from ambient temperature to 150\u00b0 C., such as 23\u00b0 C. to 90\u00b0 C., and 60\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C. In at least one embodiment, the interface block temperature may be 80\u00b0 C. The potential may be from \u2212100 V to 100 V, such as \u221270 V to 70 V. In at least one embodiment, the potential may be \u221270 V. Tandem mass spectra may be obtained by collision activated dissociation (CAD) with a collision gas, such as argon, helium or nitrogen, at a collision cell pressure from 10mbar to 10mbar, and with collision energies from 10 eV to 200 eV. In at least one embodiment, the collision gas may be argon, the collision cell pressure may be 4\u00d710mbar, and the collision energies may be from 10 eV to 25 eV.","In certain embodiments, the laser pulse may be steered by gold-coated mirrors (PF10-03-M01, Thorlabs, Newton, N.J.) and coupled into the cleaved end of the optical fiber by a plano-convex calcium fluoride lens (Infrared Optical Products, Farmingdale, N.Y.) having a focal length from 2 mm to 100 mm, such as 25 mm to 75 mm, and 40 mm to 60 mm. In at least one embodiment, the focal length may be 50 mm. The optical fiber may be held by a bare fiber chuck (BFC300, Siskiyou Corporation, Grants Pass, Oreg.). The optical fiber may be positioned by a five-axis translator (BFT-5, Siskiyou Corporation, Grants Pass, Oreg.).","In certain embodiments, the optical fiber may comprise at least one of a GeO-based glass fiber, a fluoride glass fiber, and a chalcogenide fiber. The optical fiber may have a high laser-damage threshold due to its high glass transition temperature. The Hytrel and polyimide coatings may be stripped off both ends of the fiber by the application of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (at 130\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C. for 1 min). After stripping off the Hytrel and the polyimide coatings, the fiber ends may be cleaved with a Sapphire blade (KITCO Fiber Optics, Virginia Beach, Va.) by scoring and gently snapping them. Chemical etching of the GeO-based glass fiber tip may be achieved by dipping one of the cleaved fiber ends 0.5 mm deep into 24\u00b0 C. 1% HNOsolution in a wide beaker to provide a low meniscus curvature. The meniscus formed at the fiber end may gradually etch the 450 \u03bcm diameter core into a sharp tip having a radius of curvature (R) of 15 \u03bcm. Prior to use, the etched tips may be washed with deionized water. In certain embodiments, no visible change of the fiber tip may be observed after performing the LAESI technique which may indicate the absence of damage or contamination.","In certain embodiments, the etched end of the fiber may be attached to a micromanipulator (MN-151, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to move the etched end of the fiber closer to the sample. The distance from the etched end of the fiber and the sample may be from contact (0 \u03bcm) to 50 \u03bcm. In at least one embodiment, the coordinate system may be aligned so that the x-y plane coincides with the sample and the x-axis is parallel with the emitter, the optical fiber is positioned at an azimuth angle from 20\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 and a zenith angle from 20\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. In at least one embodiment, the azimuth angle may be 135\u00b0 and the zenith angle may be 45\u00b0. The zenith angle of 45\u00b0 may provide an acceptable trade-off between the shape of the ablation mark and signal intensity reduction by blocking the expanding plume. A thin sample material deposit may be observed on the fiber tip after ablation. In these cases, the fiber may be retracted from the surface and elevated laser pulse energy may be used to clean the tip. In at least one embodiment, the distance between the fiber tip and the sample surface (h) may be twice the tip radius of curvature, 2 R. This may result in an ablation mark with an average diameter of 2.5 R. In at least one embodiment, the distance between the fiber tip and the sample surface may be 30 \u03bcm, resulting in an ablation mark with an average diameter of 37 \u03bcm. Microscope images of the ablation marks may be obtained by an upright microscope (BX 51, Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, Pa.) in either reflected or transmitted mode and by an inverted microscope.","In certain embodiments, the LAESI system may comprise a visualization system. The distance between the fiber tip and sample surface may be monitored by a long distance video microscope (InFocus Model KC, Infinity, Boulder Colo.) with a 5\u00d7 infinity corrected objective lens (M Plan Apo 5\u00d7, Mitutoyo Co., Kanagawa, Japan), and the image may be captured by a CCD camera (Marlin F131, Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany). With the environmental vibration in the low micrometer range, an approximate distance from 30 \u03bcm to 40 \u03bcm may be maintained between the tip and the sample. A similar video microscope system may be used at a right angle to the sample surface to align the fiber tip over the location of interest in the sample for ablation. The visualization system may comprise a 7\u00d7 precision zoom optic (Edmund Optics, Barrington, N.J.), fitted with a 5\u00d7 infinity-corrected long working distance objective lens (M Plan Apo 5\u00d7, Mitutoyo Co., Kanagawa, Japan) or a 10\u00d7 infinity-corrected long working distance objective lens (M Plan Apo 10\u00d7, Mitutoyo Co., Kanagawa, Japan) and a CCD camera (Marlin F131, Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany).","The various embodiments described herein may be better understood when read in conjunction with the following representative examples. The following examples are included for purposes of illustration and not limitation.","HPLC grade water and methanol, acetic acid, and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). Toluidine blue 1% aqueous solution was purchased from Home Training Tools, Ltd. (Billings, Mont.).","According to certain embodiments, the sample comprised () bulbs purchased from Washington, D.C. The bulbs were stored at 4\u00b0 C. prior to the analysis. A monolayer of the epidermal tissue of the bulb was removed from the intact parenchyma tissue. Optionally, the removed epidermis was stained with toluidine blue to improve the visibility of the subcellular components. For example, the epidermis may be stained with toluidine blue to improve the visibility of nuclei. The wet surface of the epidermis may be immersed in a solution of 0.05% toluidine blue in distilled water for one minute. The stained epidermis may be rinsed with distilled water. A microscope image of the stained epidermal cells in the skin of the bulb is shown in . The sample may be placed on a precleaned glass slide about 10-15 mm below the spray axis.","To visualize the sample during microdissection, a video microscope having a 7\u00d7 precision zoom optic (Edmund Optics, Barrington, N.J.), a 2\u00d7 infinity-corrected objective lens (M Plan Apo 2\u00d7, Mitutoyo Co., Kanagawa, Japan), and a CCD camera (Marlin F131, Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany) was placed orthogonal to the sample. Tungsten microdissecting needles having a 1 \u03bcm tip diameter (RS-6065, Roboz Surgical Instrument Co., Gaithersburg, Md.) or 5 \u03bcm tip diameter (72-0424, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Mass.) were placed in a microdissecting needle holder (RS6060 or RS6061, Roboz Surgical Instrument Co., Gaithersburg, Md.) associated with a micromanipulator (MN-151, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). The actuators of the micromanipulator had a course adjustment range of 25 mm in the X and Y axis and 20 mm in the Z axis and a minimum graduation of 5 \u03bcm.","The needle was slowly lowered in the proximity of the outer edge of a single cell at a zenith angle of about 45\u00b0 until the cell wall was pierced. The cell wall was cut along the inner edge and peeled back using the fine adjustment of the micromanipulator to expose the organelles and other subcellular components. As shown in , the tip of the microdissecting needle  was used to pierce and cut the cell wall of a single cell. The microdissecting needle  was used to separate the cell wall and cell membrane from the nucleus  to expose the nucleus . No or minimal damage to the surrounding cells was observed during microdissection. Undisturbed nuclei ,  are shown in intact neighboring cells. Immediately after microdissection, the microdissecting needle  was retracted and the optical fiber  was aligned with the exposed subcellular component, such as the nucleus. As shown in , an etched optical fiber tip  may be positioned near the dissected cell to deliver at least one laser pulse to the nucleus  for LAESI-MS.","According to certain embodiments, the method of LAESI mass spectrometry was performed using a mid-infrared laser system. An optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (Vibrant IR or Opolette 100, Opotek, Carlsbad, Calif.) converted the output of a 100 Hz repetition rate Nd:YAG laser to mid-infrared laser pulses of 5 ns pulse width at 2940 nm wavelength. Individual laser pulses were selected using a high performance optical shutter (SR470, Standford Research Systems, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.). Beam steering and focusing was accomplished by gold coated mirrors (PF10-03-M01, Thorlabs, Newton, N.J.). For the ablation of tissue using conventional mass spectrometry having a laser spot size of 300 \u03bcm diameter, the laser pulse was focused by a single 75 mm focal length plano-convex antireflection-coated ZnSe lens or a 150 mm focal length plano-convex CaFlens (Infrared Optical Products, Farmingdale, N.Y.). For ablation of a single cell and its subcellular components, the mid-infrared laser pulse was applied to the sample by a sharpened germanium oxide (GeO) optical fiber have a core diameter of 450 \u03bcm (HP Fiber, Infrared Fiber Systems, Inc., Silver Spring, Md.). A 50 mm focal length plano-convex CaFlens (Infrared Optical Products, Farmingdale, N.Y.) was used to focus the laser pulse onto the distal end of the optical fiber.","The other end of the optical fiber was chemically etched in 1% HNOsolution to generate a tip radius of curvature of 15-50 \u03bcm, 15-25 \u03bcm, and 15 \u03bcm. To obtain a tip having 15 \u03bcm radius of curvature, for example, the end of the fiber was vertically lowered about 300 \u03bcm into the etchant. After 15 minutes, the generated tip spontaneously detached from the etchant surface. To obtain a tip having a 50 \u03bcm radius of curvature, for example, the end of the fiber was vertically lowered about 1.5 mm into the etchant. After 20 minutes, the tip was removed from the etchant before the tip spontaneously detached from the etchant surface. The tip was rinsed with deionized water to remove any residue of the etchant.","The optical fiber was held in a bare fiber chuck (BFC300, Siskiyou Corp., Grant Pass, Oreg.) that was attached to a micromanipulator (MN-151 or NMN-21, Narishige, Tokyo Japan). The optical fiber was positioned in close proximity to the sample at an inclination angle of about 45\u00b0. The optical fiber was aligned at an angle of 90\u00b0 to the needle. The tip was monitored by a first video microscope positioned orthogonal to the sample. The distance between the tip and the sample surface was monitored by a second video microscope with a 7\u00d7 precision zoom optic (Edmund Optics, Barrington, N.J.), a 5\u00d7 infinity-corrected objective lens (M Plan Apo 5\u00d7, Mitutoyo Co., Kanagawa, Japan), and a CCD camera (Marlin F131, Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany) positioned at about 20\u00b0 angle to the sample surface. The distance between the tip and the sample surface was about 30 \u03bcm.","According to certain embodiments, the electrospray system comprised a low-noise syringe pump (Physio 22, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Mass.) to feed a 50% (v\/v) aqueous methanol solution containing 0.1% (v\/v) acetic acid at 200-300 nL\/min flow rate through a stainless steel emitter with tapered tip having an outside diameter of 320 \u03bcm and an inside diameter of 50 \u03bcm. (MT320-50-5-5, New Objective Inc., Woburn, Mass.). Stable high voltage (2800 V) was generated by a regulated power supply (PS350, Stanford Research Systems, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.). The regulated power supply provided 3,000 V directly to the emitter. The orifice of the sampling cone was on-axis with the electrospray emitter at a distance of 12 mm from its tip.","An orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Premier, Waters Co., Milford, Mass.) having a mass resolution of 8,000 (FWHM) collected and analyzed the ions generated by the LAESI source. No sample related ions were observed when the laser was off. The electrospray solvent spectra were subtracted from the LAESI spectra using the MassLynx 4.1 software (Waters Co., Milford, Mass.). EZinfo software (Version 2.0.0.0, Umetrics AB, Sweden) within the MarkerLynx application manager was used to perform multivariate statistical data analysis, such as orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to analyze the raw data. A two sample t-test, available in Origin software (OriginLab Co., Northampton, Mass.), was used to validate the differences in the normally distributed data sets, and the latter was verified with a normality test. Tentative peak assignments were made by comparing the accurate masses with those in the Plant Metabolic Network database (http:\/\/plantcyc.org\/) and from previously published experimental results. In certain embodiments, the Extended Statistics module in the EZinfo software was used to perform OPLS-DA in order to identify and verify metabolites with strong variance between two subcellular components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":["A. cepa ","A. cepa "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A-C","FIG. 9B","FIG. 9C"],"sub":["2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIGS. 17-18","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIG. 18"],"sub":["p[","p["],"sup":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Degree of",{}]},{"entry":[{},"t statistic","freedom","Probability > |t|"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Equal variance assumed","6.60","8","1.70 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":["No equal variance assumed","6.60","7.62","2.10 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 4"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Degree of",{}]},{"entry":[{},"t statistic","freedom","Probability > |t|"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Equal variance assumed","4.54","8","1.88 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":["No equal variance assumed","4.54","7.07","2.64 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 22"],"i":"A. cepa ","sup":["st ","nd ","rd ","th "]},"No detectable mass spectrometric signal was generated after the fourth laser pulse.
