{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/174,434, filed on Apr. 30, 2009. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates generally to wrenches, and, more particularly, to torque wrenches used to rotate a connector in an implantable medical device.","Many implantable medical devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators and neural stimulators can sense various physiological parameters through medical leads and\/or deliver therapy to tissue. Leads include an elongated flexible lead body. The lead body comprises one or more insulated elongated conductors with one or more electrodes disposed at a distal end of the conductors.","To ensure the lead is properly secured to an implantable medical device, the proximal end of the conductor, referred to as a terminal pin, is passed through a conductor bore in the connector block of a header. A setscrew, which passes through a threaded setscrew bore that intersects with the lead bore, is positioned to contact the conductor. A very small surgical torque wrench is then used to apply a certain amount of torque to the setscrew. Torque applied to the setscrew should provide a retention force between the setscrew and the conductor that is sufficiently large to prevent the conductor from dislodging from the header yet low enough to prevent the torque from damaging the setscrew or conductor. After the setscrew has been tightened, the torque wrench is typically discarded to ensure contaminants from one surgical procedure are not transferred to another procedure. It is desirable to develop surgical torque wrenches that apply appropriate torque to a setscrew when securing a lead to a header and that are also inexpensive in order to reduce the cost of such procedures to patients.","The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, similar reference numbers are used in the drawings to identify similar elements.","The present disclosure relates to a surgical torque wrench. A surgical torque wrench can be used to securely connect a medical electrical lead to an implantable medical device. One or more embodiments of the torque wrench consist solely of a first component and a second component. By forming a torque wrench with two components instead of, for example, nine or more components as that which is used with conventional torque wrenches for IMDs, the torque wrench of the present disclosure is easier to manufacture, assemble and potentially use. Additionally, a lower cost can be realized by patients who undergo surgery using the torque wrench described herein.","In one or more embodiments, a surgical torque wrench includes a first component that has first and second ends and a bore extending between the first and second ends. At the second end of the first component, a plurality of anti-rotation members extend from an inner surface of the bore. The second component includes a middle portion having a first and second ends. A drive shaft extends from the first end while a plurality of fingers extend from an exterior surface of the second component. The second component is received in the bore of the first component, such that the drive shaft partially extends outside the first end of the first component and the plurality of fingers are interdigitate with the anti-rotation members of the first component.","Referring to , an implantable medical device (IMD)  can include implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices, neurostimulators, drug pumps or combinations thereof.

Controller assembly  can include a circuit board having a processor, memory, transmitter, receiver, and\/or other appropriate portions. Connector body  can extend from or be integrated with case . At its distal end, connector body  or header can include one or more ports that interconnects with one or more connector terminals of one or more lead assemblies . Exemplary connector bodies  can include International Standard-1 (IS-1) connectors, IS-4 connectors or other suitable connectors contained within an insulative body.","Lead assemblies can comprise respective lead bodies . Lead bodies include one or more elongated insulated conductive elements. Each conductive element extends from a proximal end  to a distal end . In particular, as shown in , a conductive element for the lead assemblies has a terminal pin  located at the proximal end  and, at the distal end , an uninsulated portion of a conductive element connects with one of the electrodes such as a ring electrode or a tip electrode ","To connect a lead body to the IMD , the terminal pin , which extends from lead body , is placed through a bore in connector body  and inside a setscrew block . Connector , such as a set screw, is dielectrically insulated from body fluid outside the IMD  through a silicone grommet . A torque wrench  contacts the connector  by passing through a slit (not shown) in the grommet . An exemplary torque wrench  for applying an appropriate amount of torque to connector  is depicted in . Torque wrench  can comprise, or consist of, a handle  and a drive shaft member  which are used, in combination, to tighten connector  onto a terminal pin . The proximal end  of drive shaft  can include an integrally formed drive shaft tool interface , which is configured to connect with connector . The drive shaft member  is positioned within a bore of handle  and snaps into place once snap groove  of drive shaft member  connects with snap protrusion  of handle . Drive shaft member  includes a position member  that extends through an aperture (not shown) of handle  and positions the drive shaft member  to rotate about rotational axis . Additionally, flexible fingers , which extend from the drive shaft member  and substantially protrude in a perpendicular direction relative to the drive shaft axis , selectively engage with anti-rotation members  () that extend from the handle . Referring briefly to , the torque wrench handle  can then rotate until its anti-rotation members  connect with the flexible fingers  on the drive shaft member . Further rotation of handle  allows torque to be applied to connector  until connector  is sufficiently tightened against terminal pin , as depicted in . While connector  is shown as a setscrew, connector  can also be a nut, bolt or other suitable fastener.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-5E","b":["170","170","174","176","175","177","184","177","220","175","220"]},"A plurality of anti-rotation members  or protrusions are formed on the inner wall  of handle  near or at the distal end .

Surface , which can be flat, or, substantially flat, is directly contacted by a distal portion  of fingers  of drive shaft member  while curved end  provides sufficient rigidity to secure anti-rotation members  in position. The distal portion  of fingers  can also contact flat surfaces  and\/or curved end .","Anti-rotation members , extending into bore , can be formed by a variety of shapes. For example, anti-rotation members  can possess a shape that is substantially elliptical, substantially cylindrical, substantially rectangular, substantially triangular or other suitable shapes.  depicts an anti-rotation member  with a substantially triangular cross-section.

For example, the rigid tool interface can comprise a metal or alloy while the rest of the drive shaft member  could be a polymer such as plastic. Exemplary polymers can include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polyetherimide (PEI) manufactured by SABIC Innovative Plastics located in Houston, Tex.) and polyaryletheretherketone PEEK commercially available from Solvay located in Houston, Tex.","In one embodiment, a metal drive shaft  is insert molded into a plastic body in which the drive shaft  and the plastic body together form the drive shaft member . In this embodiment and in other embodiments, the flexible fingers  can be integrally formed as part of the drive shaft member  during the molding process.","Drive shaft tool interface , depicted in , is integrally or separately formed to drive shaft . Drive shaft tool interface  can include a distal side (not shown) located adjacent to drive shaft , and a proximal side  as shown in . The proximal side  directly touches or contacts the connector . Proximal side  of torque wrench tool interface  is configured to securely attach to an opposing exterior surface of connector .

Position member , shaped as a cylinder, is configured to extend through an aperture  so that position member  can rotate. The inner diameter of the position aperture  is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the position cylinder .","As shown, plurality of fingers  comprise at least four fingers , however, any number of fingers  can be used. For example, one or more fingers  can be used on the second end  of the drive shaft member . In one or more embodiments, the plurality of fingers  are symmetrically spaced apart from each other. In another embodiment, plurality of fingers  are asymmetrically spaced apart from each other.","Referring to , and -, flexible fingers  are sized such that flexible fingers  typically are unable to touch any part of the handle  except the anti-rotation members . The drive shaft member  has a plurality of flexible fingers  extending from an exterior surface. While flexible fingers  can follow a tortuous path; in one or more embodiments, fingers  protrude in a perpendicular or substantially perpendicular direction relative to the drive shaft axis  such that the generally flat proximal portion of fingers  typically point in a direction that is away from the drive shaft axis . Substantially perpendicular includes perpendicular plus or minus 50 degrees relative to drive shaft axis . In other embodiments, the flexible fingers extend from an exterior surface that is not substantially perpendicular.","Referring to , each relaxed flexible finger  comprises a first portion , a second portion , and a third portion , each of which can be integrally formed as a single finger. In one or more embodiments, the flexible fingers  attach to the first portion base  of the drive shaft member . First portion  extends radially away from the drive shaft axis  of drive shaft member . The drive shaft axis  runs through the middle of the drive shaft member  from the first end  to the second end .","Second portion  is integrally formed to first and third portions , , respectively. In one or more embodiments, second portion  can be curved. In some embodiments, the angle between the first portion  and the second portion  ranges from 0 degrees to 120 degrees. In some embodiments, third portion  (also referred to as a distal portion, gripping portion or a coupling portion) is substantially perpendicular to first and\/or third portions , , respectively. Second portion  typically can move up to 90 degrees from a relaxed position to a stressed position. In some embodiments, second portion  can move up to 150 degrees from a relaxed position to a stressed position. In typical embodiments, each finger -possesses the flexibility to elastically deform until the finger  touches the surface of the drive shaft member  from which the finger  extends and then spring back to about the finger's  relaxed position without breaking. The fingers  do not include a helical spring like conventional torque wrenches.","Polymeric material can be used to form the flexible fingers  as well as the remaining portions of drive shaft member . Typically, the polymeric material selected for forming flexible fingers  provides sufficient flexibility such that fingers  do not relax or creep over time due to compressive forces imparted from the handle  on the flexible fingers  when the torque wrench  is not in use. Exemplary material that can be used to form fingers  can include polyetherimide (PEI), although other polymeric material can be used such as polyaryletheretherketone (PEEK), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Other suitable polymers can also be used. In one or more embodiments, the flexible finger  can bend toward the drive shaft axis  in order to rotate or move past the anti-rotation member .","A fully assembled exemplary torque wrench  is depicted in . In one or more embodiments, the drive shaft member  and the handle  are assembled by simply pushing the drive shaft member  into the proximal end  of opening or bore  located in the handle , which is closest to the snap protrusion . Drive shaft member  can be rotated or moved while being pushed into handle  so that the plurality of fingers  are positioned interdigitate with the anti-rotation members . Once the snap protrusion  of handle  resides in the snap groove  and the position cylinder  resides in the position aperture , the torque wrench  is fully assembled.","The small clearance or gap (not shown) between the drive shaft bearing surfaces  and the handle bearing surfaces  and the small gap (not shown) or clearance between the position cylinder  and the position aperture  ensures the drive shaft axis  is generally aligned with the handle axis  even when the handle  rotates relative to the drive shaft member . The assembler or user can then verify that handle  is able to rotate relative to the drive shaft member . The handle axis  runs through the middle of the handle  from the distal end  to a proximal end .","To rotate handle , torque is applied between the drive shaft member  and the handle , which causes the flexible fingers  to contact the anti-rotation members . If breakaway torque is applied, the flexible fingers  can elastically deform and bend sufficiently to move past the anti-rotation members . Breakaway torque is a maximum level of torque that torque wrench  can apply between the handle  and the drive shaft member . For example, a torque wrench  can have a breakaway torque of 14 ounce-inches. In this case, a user could apply any torque from 0 ounce-inches up to 14 ounce-inches. If the user applied a torque less than 14 ounce-inches and the handle  was engaged with the drive shaft member , the handle  would not rotate more than 360 degrees relative to the drive shaft member . An applied torque that is equal to or greater than the breakaway torque can cause flexible fingers  to sufficiently bend and move past the anti-rotation members  such that the handle  can rotate more than 360 degrees relative to the drive shaft member . If a user tried to apply a torque greater than 14 ounce-inches, the handle  would begin to rotate relative to the drive shaft member , thus limiting the maximum level of torque the user could apply to approximately 14 ounce-inches. Once a user has applied the breakaway torque between the torque wrench  and the connector  to tighten the connector  onto the terminal pin , the lead is securely joined with the header , as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A-D","FIG. 10A","FIG. 11","FIG. 10B"],"b":["150","170","230","150","170","230","230","270","170","270","170","230","270","280","178","170","236","230","170","230","270","270","230","170","230","270"],"i":["a","d","a","d ","a","d","a","d ","a","d","a","d ","a","d","a","d ","a","d "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 10C","FIG. 10D"],"b":["170","150","230","270","170","230","270","170","150","230","270"],"i":["a","d ","a","d ","a","d "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-13B","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B"],"b":["230","230","230","235","150","170","610","150","230","230","270","230","230","270"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"],"b":["230","230","150","235","230","150","235","230","150","170","610","150","230","230","270","230","230","270"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIGS. 14-30","b":["230","170","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIGS. 14-16","FIG. 15","FIG. 14"],"b":["300","230","170","150","230","170","235","270","150","300","15","15","270","150","270","230","230","170","230","170","150","230","170","230","170","230","170"]},"In one or more embodiments, the anti-rotation members  deform less than the fingers .

The combined deformation of each connecting pair should not be sufficient to allow the handle  to rotate relative to the drive shaft member  more than 360 degrees when a torque less than the breakaway torque is applied between the handle  and the drive shaft member . For example, a finger  might deform 70 degrees and an anti-rotation member  that is engaged with the finger  might deform 20 degrees. The deformation of the finger  without the deformation of the anti-rotation member  may be insufficient to allow the finger  to rotate past the anti-rotation member  when a breakaway torque is applied. Yet, the deformation of the finger  combined with the deformation of the anti-rotation member  can be sufficient to allow the finger  to rotate past the anti-rotation member  when a breakaway torque is applied.","Deformation of the fingers  and\/or the deformation of the anti-rotation members  due to an applied torque in at least one rotational direction should not damage the fingers  and\/or the anti-rotation members . Damage may occur when the breakaway torque in a given rotational direction changes by more than 50 percent from one cycle to the next cycle. A cycle involves increasing the torque between the handle  and the drive shaft member  until the handle  moves more than 360 degrees but less than 720 degrees relative to the drive shaft member .","In one or more embodiments, applying the breakaway torque during one cycle in the clockwise direction typically does not change the breakaway torque more than 50 percent in the next clockwise cycle, but exceeding the breakaway torque in the counterclockwise direction will change the breakaway torque more than 50 percent in the next cycle. For example, a torque wrench may not be damaged by clockwise cycles but can be damaged by counterclockwise cycles. In another example, a torque wrench may not be damaged by counterclockwise cycles but can be damaged by clockwise cycles.","In one or more embodiments, fingers  are located near a cap  disposed at the distal end of the torque wrench .
