Field","The following description relates generally to wireless network communications, and more particularly to managing local internet protocol access.","2. Background","Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, . . . ). Examples of such multiple-access systems may include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. Additionally, the systems can conform to specifications such as third generation partnership project (3GPP), 3GPP long term evolution (LTE), ultra mobile broadband (UMB), evolution data optimized (EV-DO), etc.","Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems may simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations may be established via single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth. In addition, mobile devices can communicate with other mobile devices (and\/or base stations with other base stations) in peer-to-peer wireless network configurations.","To supplement conventional base stations, additional base stations can be deployed to provide more robust wireless coverage to mobile devices. For example, wireless relay stations and low power base stations (e.g., which can be commonly referred to as Home NodeBs or Home eNBs, collectively referred to as H(e)NB, femto access points, femtocells, picocells, microcells, etc.) can be deployed for incremental capacity growth, richer user experience, in-building or other specific geographic coverage, and\/or the like. In some configurations, such low power base stations are connected to the Internet and the mobile operator's network via broadband connection (e.g., digital subscriber line (DSL) router, cable or other modem, etc.). Some H(e)NBs provide closed subscriber group (CSG) access that restricts access to certain devices or related users that are members of the CSG. A home subscriber server (HSS), home location register (HLR), or one or more other nodes of a device's home network can store CSG subscription data for the device, which can include one or more lists of CSGs of which the device is a member.","In addition, by virtue of the broadband connection utilized by H(e)NBs, H(e)NBs can additionally acquire access to services or access to resources over a local network. In an example, where an H(e)NB utilizes (or provides) a gateway or router that can allow other devices to access the Internet, the devices and the H(e)NB can participate in a local internet protocol (IP) network that is served by the gateway or router, and can thus provide services or access to resources over the local IP network, such as storage devices, printers or other output devices, etc. In addition, the H(e)NB, in some examples, can provide local IP access (LIPA) to one or more mobile devices communicating with the H(e)NB over a mobile network interface such that the one or more mobile devices can access local resources on the IP network as well (e.g., and\/or devices on the local network can access resources of the one or more mobile devices). In another example, an H(e)NB can implement selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO) for filtering traffic related to one or more devices over the Internet using the router without forwarding the traffic through the mobile network.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure thereof, various aspects are described in connection with managing local internet protocol (IP) offload functionality, such as local IP access (LIPA), selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO), etc., in a wireless network. For example, one or more indicators or permissions related to local IP offload can be verified as part of determining whether to initialize local IP offload for a given device. The indicators or permissions, for example, can correspond to whether the device is allowed to utilize local IP offload, whether a device request for a packet data context relates to local IP offload, whether a corresponding home Node B or home evolved Node B (H(e)NB) or other access point supports local IP offload, whether the device is allowed to utilize local IP offload at the H(e)NB (e.g., or with a related closed subscriber group or other association), whether the device is allowed to utilize local IP offload for a specified access point name (APN), whether local IP offload is supported at the H(e)NB for the APN, and\/or the like. In one example, an H(e)NB can provide an indicator that specifies whether the H(e)NB supports local IP offload. For example, this indicator can include an address of a gateway with which to establish a context for the device to enable local IP offload. In addition, for example, a context established for local IP offload can be deactivated based at least in part on one or more parameters related to the device to allow for continuing local IP offload among associated H(e)NBs.","According to an example, a method for providing local IP offload in wireless communications is provided that includes receiving a request to establish a packet data context for a device at an access point and determining that the packet data context corresponds to a local IP offload. The method further includes determining whether the access point supports the local IP offload based at least in part on a local IP offload indicator and selecting a gateway for establishing the packet data context based at least in part on the determining that the packet data context corresponds to the local IP offload and the local IP offload indicator.","In another aspect, an apparatus for providing local IP offload in wireless communications is provided that includes at least one processor configured to obtain a request to establish a packet data context for a device at an access point and determine that the packet data context corresponds to a local IP offload.

The at least one processor is further configured to deactivate the packet data context based at least in part on one or more parameters of the second access point. In addition, the apparatus includes a memory coupled to the at least one processor.","In yet another aspect, an apparatus for deactivating a packet data context for local IP offload is provided that includes means for receiving a registration request from a device at a first access point and means for determining that the device has a packet data context with a second access point for communicating using a local IP offload.

The apparatus further includes a context deactivating component for deactivating the packet data context based at least in part on one or more parameters of the second access point.","According to yet another example, a method for indicating whether local IP offload is supported is provided that includes receiving one or more local IP offload parameters specifying whether a local IP offload is enabled or disabled for an access point and providing an indicator of a local IP offload support based at least in part on the one or more local IP offload parameters.","In another aspect, an apparatus for indicating whether local IP offload is supported is provided that includes at least one processor configured to receive one or more local IP offload parameters specifying whether a local IP offload is enabled or disabled for an access point. The at least one processor is further configured to provide an indicator of a local IP offload support based at least in part on the one or more local IP offload parameters. In addition, the apparatus includes a memory coupled to the at least one processor.","In yet another aspect, an apparatus for indicating whether local IP offload is supported is provided that includes means for receiving one or more local IP offload parameters specifying whether a local IP offload is enabled or disabled for an access point. The apparatus further includes means for providing an indicator of a local IP offload support based at least in part on the one or more local IP offload parameters.","Still, in another aspect, a computer-program product for indicating whether local IP offload is supported is provided including a computer-readable medium having code for causing at least one computer to receive one or more local IP offload parameters specifying whether a local IP offload is enabled or disabled for an access point.

The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.","As described further herein, local internet protocol (IP) offload functionality, such as local IP access (LIPA), selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO), etc., can be managed for a device based at least in part on one or more indicators or permissions. For example, the one or more indicators or permissions can specify whether the device is allowed to utilize local IP offload, whether a request for a packet data context relates to local IP offload, whether a corresponding home Node B or home evolved Node B (collectively referred to as H(e)NB) or other access point supports local IP offload, whether the device is allowed to utilize local IP offload at the H(e)NB (e.g., and\/or with a related closed subscriber group), whether the device is allowed to utilize local IP offload for a specified access point name (APN), whether local IP offload is supported at the H(e)NB for the APN, and\/or the like. For example, the one or more permissions can be communicated as part of requesting establishment of a packet data context related to utilizing local IP offload. In addition, in one example, one or more of the indicators can relate to an address of a gateway specified for providing local IP offload. In this regard, the various indicators or permissions can be utilized to provide local IP offload at a device.","Furthermore, in an example, an H(e)NB can provide an indicator that specifies whether the H(e)NB supports local IP offload (e.g., for a specific APN or otherwise). In one example, this can be provided as part of a request for a context forwarded for a related device. In addition, for example, the indicator can include an address of a gateway for providing local IP offload at the H(e)NB, and the gateway can be accordingly utilized to provide local IP offload (e.g., where other indicators specify that local IP offload is allowed). Moreover, as described herein, a context related to local IP offload can be deactivated based at least in part on one or more parameters. For example, deactivation of the context can be determined based at least in part on whether the device has a local IP offload capable connection with another H(e)NB, or cell thereof, that is associated with the current H(e)NB (e.g., a member of the same closed subscriber group (CSG) or other association, etc.) or an H(e)NB not so associated. This can mitigate unnecessary activation\/deactivation of contexts related to local IP offload as the device moves among associated H(e)NBs.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem\u201d and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as but not limited to hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.","Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a terminal, which can be a wired terminal or a wireless terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, device, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, terminal, communication device, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE). A wireless terminal may be a cellular telephone, a satellite phone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a computing device, or other processing devices connected to a wireless modem. Moreover, various aspects are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station may be utilized for communicating with wireless terminal(s) and may also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, evolved Node B (eNB), or some other terminology.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other systems. The terms \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM\u00ae, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP). Additionally, cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2). Further, such wireless communication systems may additionally include peer-to-peer (e.g., mobile-to-mobile) ad hoc network systems often using unpaired unlicensed spectrums, 802.xx wireless LAN, BLUETOOTH and any other short- or long-range, wireless communication techniques.","Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","Referring to , illustrated are several nodes of a sample communication system . For illustration purposes, various aspects of the disclosure are described in the context of one or more devices, access points, and network nodes that communicate with one another. It is to be appreciated, however, that aspects herein may be applicable to other types of apparatuses or other similar apparatuses that are referenced using other terminology. For example, access points can be referred to or implemented as base stations, eNodeBs (eNB), Home Node Bs (e.g., in UMTS) or Home eNBs (e.g., in LTE), collectively referred to as H(e)NBs, femtocell or picocell access points, mobile base stations, relay nodes, hot-spots, routers, gateways, etc., while devices may be referred to or implemented as user equipment (UE), mobile devices, access terminals, modems (or other tethered devices), or may be a portion thereof, and so on.","Device  can receive one or more services (e.g., network connectivity) from access point . Device  can be a wired or wireless device installed within and\/or traveling throughout a coverage area provided by access point  and\/or one or more access points of the system . For example, at various points in time, device  can connect to an access point  or some other access point in the system  (not shown) over a wired or wireless interface. Each of these access points can communicate with one or more network nodes (represented, for example, by network node(s) ) to facilitate wide area network connectivity. Network nodes  can include one or more radio and\/or core network nodes in a mobile network, for example. Thus, in various examples, network nodes  can represent functionality such as at least one of: network management (e.g., via an operation, administration, management (OAM), and\/or provisioning entity), call control, session management, mobility management, subscription management, gateway functions, interworking functions, or some other suitable network functionality. Network nodes  can include a mobility manager , which can be a mobility management entity (MME), serving general packet radio services (GPRS) support node (SGSN), mobile switching center (MSC), visitor location register (VLR), etc., a subscription server , which can be a home subscriber server (HSS), home location register (HLR), etc., and\/or the like, that can be part of a one or more public land mobile networks (PLMN) accessible by device .","In some cases, device  can access a restricted group access point (e.g., access point ) associated with a wireless cell set. In general, a wireless cell set comprises a set of one or more cells (e.g., provided by at least one access point, such as access point ) having a defined relationship. An example of a wireless cell set is a closed subscriber group (CSG). For convenience, the discussion that follows may simply refer to the term CSG, rather than the more general term wireless cell set. It should be appreciated, however, that the described concepts may be applicable to other types of defined sets or groups (e.g., restricted groups) of wireless cells or other similar entities. Also, restricted groups can provide a diminished level of access to non-members (which can be referred to as hybrid-mode access, or the cells within the group as hybrid cells), to which aspects described herein can apply as well. In addition, it is to be appreciated that an access point, such as access point , can provide one or more cells within which devices can communicate with the access point.","As depicted, access point  can be coupled to a router  or other device to access Internet , and access point  can allow device  to communicate with network nodes  via Internet . In another example, access point  can connect to Internet  using a direct broadband connection (e.g., via a modem). Moreover, for example, access point  can be coupled to a gateway . Though shown as co-located with access point  in the depicted example, it is to be appreciated that gateway  can be implemented within access point , as a separate entity from access point , and\/or the like. Moreover, for example, router  can be similarly co-located with access point  and\/or gateway , implemented within access point , and\/or the like. In any case, access point  can receive communications from device  intended for nodes in a mobile network and can forward the communications to network nodes  through router . For example, the communications can be associated with one or more communications tunnels, and access point  can determine that the packets are intended for one or more of network nodes  based on the one or more communications tunnels (e.g., based on one or more parameters, such as a tunnel identifier, destination address, etc., in one or more packet headers).","For example, to facilitate communicating between device  and gateway , a radio bearer can be established between access point  and device . For example, a first mobile network bearer between gateway  and another component of the mobile network, such as network node , can be established, as well as a second mobile network bearer between access point  and the other component of the mobile network (e.g., before, after, and\/or as part of establishing the radio bearer). Thus, in one example, communications related to device  intended for gateway  can traverse the other component of the mobile network from access point  to arrive at gateway .","In addition, for example, access point  can provide one or more local IP offload functionalities to facilitate at least one of decreasing load on the network nodes , providing access to local network resources, and\/or the like. In one example, access point  can provide SIPTO to communications from device . In this example, a SIPTO bearer or other communication tunnel can be established between access point  and gateway  for allowing device  communications with one or more nodes over the Internet  without engaging network nodes  or components of the mobile network. In one example, data received over the radio bearer between device  and access point  can be sent over the SIPTO bearer between access point  and gateway . In another example, access point  can utilize the SIPTO bearer between access point  and gateway  to offload communications received over a previously established bearer where access point  determines that the communications are associated with an Internet node that does not require communicating through one or more of the network nodes . For example, this can include determining that the communications are not associated with one or more tunnels related to the network nodes . In this regard, traffic from device  can be offloaded using SIPTO to access Internet  without engaging network nodes  to decrease loading on the mobile network.","In another example, gateway  additionally communicates with local network devices  and  to provide sharing of resources therebetween, access to Internet  via router , and\/or the like. For example, local network devices  and  can be substantially any device operable to communicate in a network, such as a local area network (LAN) or wireless LAN (WLAN) device (e.g., a computer, server, printer, digital video recorder (DVR), mobile device, a portion thereof, or substantially any device with a processor (or access to a processor) and a network interface, etc.), and\/or the like. Moreover, since access point  is coupled with gateway , for example, access point  participates in the local network with local network devices  and , and can thus access resources or services offered by local network devices  and\/or  in the local network, and\/or can allow access to resources related to access point  or provide services thereto. In another example, local network devices  and  can be connected to router , which can similarly provide access thereto.","In this regard, access point  can provide LIPA to device  by similarly establishing a LIPA bearer with gateway . In this example, devices, such as device , can perform actions such as at least one of accessing the services or resources of the local network, providing local network devices with  and  with services or access to resources of the device via access point , and\/or the like through gateway  via access point  without traversing network node  or similar nodes of the mobile network.","As described further herein, mobility manager  can facilitate establishing a LIPA, SIPTO, or other local IP offload context at access point  for allowing device  to directly access resources of gateway . Establishing of the context at mobility manager  can be based at least in part on one or more indicators or permissions regarding whether the local IP offloading is allowed at various levels. For example, the one or more indicators or permissions can relate to one or more of whether the device  is allowed to utilize local IP offload (e.g., based on one or more other parameters), whether a request for a packet data context relates to local IP offload, whether the access point  supports local IP offload, whether the device  is allowed to utilize local IP offload at the access point  (e.g., and\/or with a related CSG), whether the device  is allowed to utilize local IP offload for a specified access point name (APN), whether local IP offload is supported at the access point  for the APN, and\/or the like. The indicators or permissions can be received from various nodes to control local IP offload functionality at access point . In one example, mobility manager  can communicate with subscription server  to receive subscription data for device , and the subscription data can include one or more such permissions. In another example, access point  can provide one or more such indicators to mobility manager  (e.g., an IP address of a gateway, such as gateway , that supports local IP offload, or another indicator).","Turning to , an example wireless communication system  is illustrated that facilitates supporting local IP offload at an access point. System  can include a device  that can communicate with one or more access points to receive access to a wireless network, an access point  that provides open or restricted access or a combination thereof to one or more devices, a gateway  that facilitates communicating with one or more networks, and a mobility manager  that authorizes one or more devices to communicate with one or more core network components. In one example, device  can be a UE, modem (or other tethered device), a portion thereof, and\/or the like, and access point can be a femtocell, picocell, H(e)NB, or similar access point, a portion thereof, etc., as described. In addition, for example, gateway  can be a substantially any gateway or router, such as but not limited to a serving gateway (S-GW) packet data network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN), etc., and mobility manager  can be a MME, SGSN, MSC, VLR, or similar node. In addition, as described, gateway  can be co-located and\/or implemented within access point  in another example. Subscription server  can be an HSS, HLR, or similar component. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that additional components or nodes can be present between those shown (e.g., one or more gateways or routers can be present between access point  and gateway , between access point  and mobility manager , between mobility manager  and subscription server , etc.) to facilitate access.","Device  can comprise a context requesting component  for requesting establishing of a context for local IP offload functionality (e.g., LIPA, SIPTO, etc.), and a local IP offloading component  for utilizing the context to perform local IP offloading. Access point  can comprise a communicating component  for facilitating communicating between one or more devices  and one or more gateways or other components, and an optional local IP offload indicating component  for specifying whether access point  supports local IP offload. Access point  also comprises a bearer establishing component  for establishing a bearer between a various devices and\/or components for communicating local IP offload data therebetween.","Gateway  comprises a communicating component  for receiving data from and\/or transmitting data to an access point and one or more network components, such as a mobility manager, another gateway, one or more nodes in a local network, one or more nodes over a broadband connection, and\/or the like. Gateway  additionally comprises a context establishing component  for generating a context for a device to facilitate communicating local IP offload data. Mobility manager  comprises a context establishing component  for requesting creation of a context for a device for communicating local IP offload data, and a local IP offload support determining component  for determining whether one or more indicators or permissions specify that local IP offload is supported. Mobility manager  also comprises a gateway selecting component  for specifying a gateway to receive and\/or respond to local IP offload data requests from the device, and a bearer establishing component  for indicating establishing a bearer between various components and\/or devices. Subscription server  comprises a subscription data component  for indicating subscription data of a device to one or more nodes in a wireless network.","According to an example, context requesting component  can transmit a packet data context request  to access point . A packet data context, as referred to herein, can comprise a PDN connection, packet data protocol (PDP) context, and\/or the like. For example, the request  can relate to establishing the packet data context for local IP offload, such as LIPA, SIPTO, etc. at access point . Communicating component  can receive and forward the request  to mobility manager . For example, one or more packets encompassing the request  can include a destination address of the mobility manager . In one example, mobility manager  can be part of a similar network (e.g., PLMN) as access point , and can be utilized to authorize device  to use the network, whether the network is a home or visited network of device . For example, as described, access point  can communicate with mobility manager  via one or more gateways in the mobile network (not shown). In any case, context establishing component  can obtain the request  for packet data context from access point .","In one example, subscription requesting component  can formulate a request for subscription data related to device  and can transmit the request to subscription server . It is to be appreciated that this can occur as part of device  initially communicating in a network associated with mobility manager , as part of receiving the request for the packet data context, and\/or the like. Subscription data component , for example, can receive the request for subscription data, and subscription data component  can transmit subscription data stored for device  to mobility manager . For example, the subscription data can include data stored by an HSS or similar subscription server, such as one or more identities related to device  or a subscriber thereof, a list of CSGs of which device  is a member, and\/or the like. In addition, subscription data component  can store one or more local IP offload permissions  for device  that specify whether device  can utilize local IP offload.","For example, the local IP offload permissions  can specify whether device  can utilize local IP offload in general, for certain types of packet data contexts (e.g., based at least in part on an APN), and\/or the like. For example, the local IP offload permissions  can include a data structure that specifies a list of APNs, where each APN can have an associated local IP offload permission. In another example, the local IP offload permissions  can include a list of APNs for which the device is allowed to utilize local IP offload, as described further herein. Thus, for example, local IP offload permissions  can include the list of APNs. In yet another example, it is to be appreciated that subscription requesting component  can explicitly request all local IP offload permissions for device , local IP offload permissions for a specific APN, etc.","In any case, for example, subscription requesting component  can receive the subscription data, which can include local IP offload permissions . Local IP offload support determining component  can additionally or alternatively determine whether the packet data context request  relates to local IP offload based at least in part on whether the subscription data includes permissions for an APN specified in the request  as related to local IP offload. For example, this can include identifying the relevant local IP offload permissions  where more than one is communicated by subscription server . Where one or more APNs with corresponding local IP offload permissions are received, this can include locating a permission for an APN specified in the packet data context request . Where a list of APNs supporting local IP offload are received, for example, this can include locating the APN in the list of APNs.","Where the local IP offload support determining component  determines that the device  is not allowed local IP offload or that the request  does not relate to local IP offload based on the local IP offload permissions  (e.g., where a related APN is not in a list of APNs or has a local IP offload permission that specifies that local IP offload is not supported), context establishing component  can determine to not establish the requested context and can transmit a rejection or other indication that the context is not established to access point  for providing to device . Where the local IP offload support determining component  determines that the device  is allowed to utilize local IP offload based on the local IP offload permissions , gateway selecting component  can determine a gateway for providing local IP offload functionality, as described for example.","In an additional or alternative example, local IP offload indicating component  can optionally insert a local IP offload indicator , which specifies whether access point  supports local IP offload, in requests forwarded from device  (e.g., in each packet data context request, each packet data context request related to local IP offload, and\/or the like). Context establishing component  can receive the local IP offload indicator  in the packet data context request , and local IP offload support determining component  can additionally or alternatively verify that local IP offload is supported at access point  based on local IP offload indicator . In one example, the local IP offload indicator  can be and\/or can include an address of a gateway related to the local IP offload (e.g., a gateway to receive local IP offload data from device ), and thus gateway selecting component  can determine the gateway based at least additionally in part on the address.","The gateway can be gateway  or a different gateway, for example. Where a gateway address is not received in local IP offload indicator , for example, gateway selecting component  can determine the gateway based at least in part on a domain name service (DNS) lookup of one or more identifiers. For example, this can include a DNS lookup of one or more identifiers, such as a routing area identifier (RAI), APN, etc., related to device  or access point  (e.g., based on a fully qualified domain name generated from the identifier(s)). In another example, at least a portion of the one or more identifiers can be received in subscription data for the device , as described. For example, context establishing component  can receive the identifiers as part of the packet data context request  and\/or upon initially communicating with access point  and\/or device . In another example, the identifiers and\/or gateway address can be received in device subscription data. In the depicted example, in any case, gateway selecting component  can determine to select gateway , and context establishing component  can request establishment of a packet data context for device  from the gateway  for device . Context establishing component  can receive the request and can establish the packet data context  for device  to support local IP offload (e.g., LIPA, SIPTO, etc.).","In an example, context establishing component  can notify mobility manager  of successful or failed establishment of the packet data context . Where the establishment fails, context establishing component  can notify access point  of the failure for providing to device . Where the establishment succeeds, for example, bearer establishing component  can request establishment of a bearer from access point  to gateway  for communicating local IP offload data from device  to gateway  related to the packet data context. As described, for example, this can be in addition to bearers established between the gateway  and a mobile network component (e.g., S-GW), and between the access point  and the mobile network component. Establishment of the bearer between access point  and gateway  can allow circumvention of the mobile network when communicating local IP offload data. Bearer establishing component  can receive the request and can attempt to establish a bearer for the local IP offload data from device . Moreover, for example, bearer establishing component  can include a request to establish a corresponding radio bearer with device , as described, and bearer establishing component  can establish the radio bearer with device . Bearer establishing component  can additionally include information regarding the packet data context  in the bearer establishment request to facilitate associating the bearer with the packet data context at access point . If bearer establishment fails, for example, access point  can notify mobility manager , and context establishing component  can transmit an indication of a failed context establishment to access point  for providing to device . Moreover, in an example, context establishing component  can notify gateway  (e.g., and gateway  can delete the packet data context ).","Where bearer establishment succeeds, however, context establishing component  can associate the packet data context  created by gateway  for device  with the bearer. Context establishing component  can provide the packet data context  to device  (e.g., via access point ). Context requesting component  can obtain the packet data context . In this regard, local IP offloading component  can communicate with access point  using the packet data context  and\/or radio bearer with access point  for local IP offload communications. Communicating component  can identify communications related to the packet data context  (e.g., based at least in part on receiving the communications over the radio bearer established for local IP offload communications) and can utilize the corresponding bearer with gateway  to route the local IP offload communications to gateway .","In one example, the local IP offload functionality can be LIPA, as described. Thus, context requesting component  can transmit packet data context requests  for LIPA. In one example, this can include requesting a packet data context for an APN that utilizes LIPA. In this example, context establishing component  can receive the packet data context request , and local IP offload support determining component  can determine whether the device  associates the APN with LIPA based at least in part on the subscription data for device  obtained by subscription requesting component . As described, for example, this can include determining whether one or more local IP offload permissions  specify that LIPA is allowed for the APN. If so, in this example, context establishing component  can determine whether the LIPA request includes a local IP offload indicator , such as a gateway IP address, as described. If the local IP offload indicator  is not included (e.g., and\/or the indicator is set to not allow LIPA), in one example, context establishing component  can refrain from establishing the packet data context and can notify device  of failure in establishing the context, as described.","If the LIPA request does include the local IP offload indicator  and\/or the indicator specifies that LIPA is allowed at access point , local IP offload support determining component  can determine to establish LIPA for device , and gateway selecting component  can select a gateway indicated by the local IP offload indicator  for providing such. As described, bearer establishing component  can establish a LIPA bearer between access point  and gateway  (and\/or a corresponding radio bearer between access point  and device ) associated with a created packet data context for utilizing LIPA. Communicating component  can forward the LIPA requests over the established LIPA bearer for device  to gateway . Communicating component  can receive the LIPA request over the bearer and can accordingly provide LIPA to one or more local network devices (not shown) that communicate with gateway  in an IP or similar network, as described. Similarly, communicating component  can utilize the LIPA bearer to communicate data from local network devices to device  (e.g., through access point using communicating component ).","Moreover, in an example, in addition to device subscription data, subscription data component  can additionally provide, and subscription requesting component  can additionally receive, CSG subscription data for device  that includes one or more CSGs of which device  is a member. The CSG subscription data can include one or more local IP offload permissions  for each APN within a given CSG for which LIPA is supported. As described, this can be a list of APNs associated with a given CSG, each of which have a corresponding LIPA permission, a list of APNs that support LIPA in the CSG, and\/or the like. In this regard, local IP offload support determining component  can determine whether to provide local IP offload to device  further based at least in part on the local IP offload permissions  for the APN and the CSG related to access point . Thus, for example, local IP offload support determining component  can discern whether the CSG subscription data includes parameters related to the CSG of access point . If so, local IP offload support determining component  can retrieve information from the parameters that correspond to the APN.","In this example, if the information includes local IP offload permissions  for the APN in the CSG, local IP offload support determining component  can verify that the APN supports LIPA in the CSG, as described. If no local IP offload permissions  for the APN exist in the parameters for the CSG (e.g., or the permissions specify that LIPA is not allowed), the context establishing component  can refrain from establishing the context and indicate failure to device , as described.","Furthermore, for example, the local IP offload permissions  for a specific APN can specify that the APN is LIPA only (such that LIPA is required to establish the packet data context), LIPA prohibited (such that the packet data context is established through the mobile network), LIPA conditional (such that LIPA can be initialized for the packet data context if supported, otherwise the packet data context is established through the mobile network), etc. For example, where local IP offload permissions  received in device subscription data specify LIPA only for an APN, local IP offload support determining component  can receive and analyze other LIPA indicators to determine whether LIPA is supported (e.g., by access point ), etc. If not, context establishing component  can refrain from establishing the packet data context and can notify device  of failure in context establishment, as described. For example, the other LIPA indicators can include local IP offload indicator , a list of APNs for which LIPA is supported at access point  received from the access point  or other node, permissions that specify whether a CSG related to access point  is a CSG that corresponds to the APN in the CSG subscription data, and\/or the like.","Where local IP offload permissions  specify LIPA conditional, however, and local IP offload support determining component  determines that LIPA is not supported based on other local IP offload indicators, gateway selecting component  can determine a gateway for establishing the packet data context through the mobile network. For example, at least a portion of an identifier or address related to the gateway can be received in subscription data received by subscription requesting component  from subscription data component  (e.g., which may or may not require a DNS lookup of an identifier, such as one or more RAIs, APNs, etc. received in subscription data and\/or from access point ). Thus, the packet data context is still established without using LIPA.","In a specific example, local IP offload permissions  can specify LIPA only for an APN \u201cprinter\u201d related to a printer in a local network related to access point . In this example, where device  is communicating with access point , local IP offload support determining component  can determine whether access point  supports LIPA for the \u201cprinter\u201d APN. As described, this can be based on determining whether the \u201cprinter\u201d APN is present in a supported list of APNs received for access point  (e.g., as part of the CSG subscription information for device , etc.). In another example, this can include determining whether the \u201cprinter\u201d APN is listed for APNs of the CSG of access point  (e.g., as received in the CSG subscription information), and\/or the like. If not, context establishing component  can reject establishing the packet data context, as described. If so, the packet data context for LIPA to the \u201cprinter\u201d APN can be established, as described.","In another specific example, however, local IP offload permissions  can specify LIPA conditional for an APN \u201ccorporate\u201d where access point  is in a network of an enterprise related to the APN \u201ccorporate.\u201d Local IP offload support determining component  can similarly determine whether access point  supports LIPA for the \u201ccorporate\u201d APN based on a list of APNs, verifying the CSG corresponds to the APN, and\/or the like, as received in CSG subscription information for device , for example. If not, gateway selecting component  can determine a gateway of the mobile network (not shown) for facilitating communicating with the \u201ccorporate\u201d APN, and a non-LIPA packet data context can be established. If so, gateway selecting component  can select a gateway indicated by local IP offload indicator  for establishing the LIPA packet data context, as described. Thus, where the device  is within the enterprise and can communicate with access point  in the enterprise network, LIPA can be established to facilitate communicating without engaging the mobile network. Where, however, device  is outside of the enterprise communicating with an access point  not on the enterprise network, a mobile connection can be established for utilizing a virtual private network (VPN) to tunnel communications with the enterprise network.","In another example, the local IP offload functionality can be SIPTO. In this example, the access point may not indicate whether SIPTO is supported at access point  in a local IP offload indicator . Thus, local IP offload support determining component  can determine whether to provide SIPTO to device  based at least in part on whether the device  is allowed to use SIPTO. For example, this can include determining whether an APN in the request for packet data context is a SIPTO APN (e.g., according to subscription data received by subscription requesting component , as described above, which can include one or more corresponding local IP offload permissions ). If so, gateway selecting component  can determine a gateway for providing SIPTO for device  based at least in part on performing a DNS lookup using one or more identifiers of the device  or access point  (e.g., to form a full qualified domain name). In one example, the identifier can be received in device subscription data as an RAI, APN, etc., from access point  (e.g., in the request for packet data context and\/or a subsequent response to a request for the gateway sent by gateway selecting component  or otherwise), and\/or the like. Once gateway  is identified, context establishing component  can request context establishment, bearer establishing component  can request establishment of a bearer between access point  and gateway  (and\/or a corresponding radio bearer between access point  and device , as described) for associating to the context, etc. Local IP offloading component  can then use the context for communicating using SIPTO, as described.","Turning to , an example wireless communication system  is depicted that facilitates deactivating a packet data context for a device. System  can comprise a device  that communicates with an access point  to receive access to a wireless network. Access point  can communicate with gateway , for example, to access a mobile network for device . In an example, gateway  can communicate with mobility manager  or one or more other network nodes, as described. System  also includes another access point  with which device  can communicate to receive wireless network access. In addition, as described, device  can be a UE, modem (or other tethered device), a portion thereof, and\/or the like, and access points  and  can each be a femtocell, picocell, H(e)NB, or similar access point, a portion thereof, etc., as described. In addition, for example, gateway  can be substantially any gateway or router, such as but not limited to a packet data network (PDN) gateway, a GGSN, etc., and mobility manager  can be a MME, SGSN, MSC, VLR, or similar node. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that additional components or nodes can be present between those shown (e.g., one or more gateways can be present between access point  and gateway , between gateway  and mobility manager , etc.) to facilitate access.","Device  can comprise a context requesting component  for requesting a packet data context for local IP offloading (e.g., LIPA, SIPTO, etc.), and a local IP offloading component  for utilizing the packet data context to perform local IP offloading, as described. Mobility manager  can include a context establishing component  for creating a packet data context for a device, as described above. Mobility manager  also comprises a local IP offload status determining component  for discerning whether a device is using local IP offloading with an access point, a context deactivating component  for deactivating a packet data context according to one or more parameters, and a bearer establishing component  for establishing a bearer for a packet data context, as described.","According to an example, context requesting component  can request establishment of a packet data context for utilizing local IP offloading, as described, at access point . Context establishing component  can establish the packet data context and notify device , as described. In this regard, it is to be appreciated that device , access point , gateway , and mobility manager  can be similar to device , access point , gateway , and mobility manager  respectively, and can thus include similar components as described in . In addition, however, device  can reselect among access points in a wireless network (e.g., as device moves throughout the wireless network and receives improved signal quality from different access points, etc.). In one example, device  can reselect access point , which can also communicate with mobility manager  and\/or other components of the wireless network. In one example, access points  and  can be different cells of the same H(e)NB. In another example, access point  can be an H(e)NB, and access point  can be an eNB. Access point  can communicate with mobility manager , for example, using gateway  or one or more other gateways.","Upon reselecting access point , context deactivating component  can determine whether to deactivate the packet data context established with access point . In one example, context requesting component  can request establishment of a packet data context for local IP offloading (e.g., and\/or device  can otherwise request registration with access point ). For example, the packet data context can be requested to continue local IP offloading using the context initialized through access point , as described. In some cases, it can be desirable for mobility manager  to use the same packet data context for device  when communicating through another access point . For example, local IP offload status determining component  can determine whether device  has a packet data context established. For example, this can include analyzing one or more parameters related to the packet data context. If the parameters are present, for example, local IP offload status determining component  can determine device  has a packet data context established with another access point (e.g., access point ), and thus, local IP offload status determining component  can determine whether to maintain or deactivate the packet data context in favor of a new packet data context for device .","For example, local IP offload status determining component  can obtain an address of a gateway received as a local IP offload indicator from access point  in the request for packet data context from device , as described, as well as another address of a gateway received as a local IP offload indicator from access point  in another request for packet data context from device . If the addresses are the same, for example, local IP offload status determining component  can maintain the current packet data context, and bearer establishing component  can request establishment of a bearer between access point  and gateway  and\/or a radio bearer between device  and access point . In this regard, context establishing component  can associate the packet data context with the one or more bearers, and can provide the packet data context to device  and\/or an indication that the current packet data context can continue to be utilized.","Where access point  does not indicate the same gateway address in the local IP offload indicator, for example, context deactivating component  can deactivate the packet data context established based on the request from access point . For example, context deactivating component  can notify gateway  to delete the packet data context, bearer establishing component  can notify access point  that the bearer between device  and access point  associated with the packet data context can be deactivated, etc. In addition, context establishing component  can then create a new packet data context for local IP offload at device  through another gateway (not shown) specified in the local IP offload indicator from access point , as described above. In another example, local IP offload status determining component  can determine whether access point  is within a range or geographic region for providing local IP offload using gateway  (e.g., which can be specified by gateway ). If not, context deactivating component  can deactivate the packet data context established based on the request from access point , etc., as described.","In yet another example, local IP offload status determining component  can maintain an identifier related to access point  upon context establishing component  creating the packet data context for using local IP offload with access point . Upon receiving a request for a packet data context from device  related to access point , local IP offload status determining component  can compare the identifier to a similar identifier of access point . If the identifiers do not match, for example, context deactivating component  can deactivate the context, etc., as described. For example, the identifiers can relate to a global cell identifier of access point  and access point , a CSG identifier of access point  and access point , and\/or the like. Thus, for example, where the identifier is a CSG identifier of access point  and , context deactivating component  deactivates the packet data context when the device  moves from one CSG to another.","Referring to , an example wireless communication system  is illustrated for communicating one or more local IP offload parameters to an access point .

In one example, as described, RNC  can include a local IP offload indicator when forwarding activate PDP context request  (e.g., which can comprise an address of GGSN , etc.). For example, the GGSN  can be a local gateway in a similar local IP network of RNC , or can be co-located in RNC , etc. SGSN  can verify local IP offload permission(s) or indicator(s) .

SGSN  can receive a create PDP context response  from GGSN  verifying establishment of the PDP context. In this regard, SGSN  can request radio access bearer setup  from RNC , which can setup a radio access bearer  with UE  for local IP offload. SGSN  can transmit an update PDP context request  to GGSN  to associate the radio access bearer with the PDP context, and GGSN  can transmit a update PDP context response .

As described, the subscription data can be received from an HSS or similar subscription node.","At , it can be determined whether the access point supports local IP offload based at least in part on a local IP offload indicator. As described, the local IP offload indicator can be received from the access point (e.g., as part of the request for the packet data context forwarded for the device or otherwise). In an example, the local IP offload indicator can be an IP address of a gateway. Thus, based at least in part on receiving an address of the gateway (e.g., in the request for packet data context), it can be determined that the access point supports local IP offload. In this regard, at , a gateway can be selected for establishing the packet data context based at least in part on the determining that the packet data context corresponds to local IP offload and the local IP offload indicator. Where the access point supports local IP offload, for example, and indicates a gateway in the request, the indicated gateway can be utilized for establishing the packet data context, as described. Where the access point does not support local IP offload and\/or the packet data context does not correspond to local IP offload, for example, a gateway can be selected using DNS or other procedure for selecting a gateway within the mobile network for establishing the packet data context.","Turning to , an example methodology  is displayed that facilitates determining whether to establish a packet data context for a device. At , a request to establish a packet data context can be received. As described, this can be received by a device and can relate to local IP offload. At , device subscription data can be obtained. It is to be appreciated that this can be performed upon receiving the request, upon initially communicating with the device, etc. At , it can be determined whether an APN in the request is LIPA only. For example, the APN can be located in the subscription data and can have a permission that specifies whether the APN relates to LIPA (e.g. whether the APN is LIPA only, LIPA conditional, LIPA rejected, etc.). As described, in another example, the APN can be present in a corresponding list of APNs that are LIPA only, LIPA conditional, or LIPA rejected. If the APN is LIPA only, it can be determined at  whether the H(e)NB supports the L-GW. For example, this can include determining whether the H(e)NB includes an address of the L-GW in the request for the packet data context from the device. If so, then at , it can be determined whether the CSG subscription data supports LIPA. As described, this can be obtained from CSG subscription information for the related device. If so, then at , it can be determined whether the APN is supported at the CSG. If so, then at , a LIPA context can be established. If the H(e)NB does not support the L-GW at , CSG subscription data does not support LIPA at , or the APN is not supported at the CSG at , the context establishment request can be rejected at .","Similarly, if the APN is not LIPA only at , it can be determined whether the APN is LIPA conditional at . If so, it can be whether the H(e)NB supports the L-GW at . For example, this can include determining whether the H(e)NB includes an address of the L-GW in the request for the packet data context from the device. If so, then at , it can be determined whether the CSG subscription data supports LIPA. As described, this can be obtained from CSG subscription information for the related device.

If the H(e)NB does not support the L-GW at , CSG subscription data does not support LIPA at , or the APN is not supported at the CSG at , a non-LIPA context can be established at . For example, this can include leveraging a gateway in the mobile network, as described.","Referring to , an example methodology  for deactivating a packet data context is illustrated. At , a registration request can be received from a device at a first access point. At , it can be determined that the device has a packet data context with a second access point for communicating using a local IP offload. As described, for example, the device can have established the packet data context with the second access point, and can be reselecting the first access point. In this regard, it can be desirable to continue utilizing the packet data context where possible. At , however, the packet data context can be deactivated based at least in part on one or more parameters of the second access point. In one example, where the first access point is outside of a range specified for the second access point by a gateway for utilizing local IP offload, the context can be deactivated and reestablished. In other examples, where the first and second access points report different gateways in forwarding requests for packet data contexts, have different global cell identifiers, different CSG identifiers, and\/or the like, the packet data context can be deactivated in favor of a new packet data context established through the first access point.","Turning to , an example methodology  is depicted for providing an indicator for local IP offload support.

In addition, an access terminal  can be capable of operating both in macro environments and in smaller scale (e.g., residential) network environments. Thus, for example, depending on the current location of the access terminal , the access terminal  can be served by an access node  or by any one of a set of femto nodes  (e.g., the femto nodes A and B that reside within a corresponding user residence ). For example, when a subscriber is outside his home, he is served by a standard macro cell access node (e.g., node ) and when the subscriber is at home, he is served by a femto node (e.g., node A). Here, it should be appreciated that a femto node  can be backward compatible with existing access terminals .","A femto node  can be deployed on a single frequency or, in the alternative, on multiple frequencies. Depending on the particular configuration, the single frequency or one or more of the multiple frequencies can overlap with one or more frequencies used by a macro cell access node (e.g., node ). In some aspects, an access terminal  can be configured to connect to a preferred femto node (e.g., the home femto node of the access terminal ) whenever such connectivity is possible. For example, whenever the access terminal  is within the user's residence , it can communicate with the home femto node .","In some aspects, if the access terminal  operates within the mobile operator core network  but is not residing on its most preferred network (e.g., as defined in a preferred roaming list), the access terminal  can continue to search for the most preferred network (e.g., femto node ) using a Better System Reselection (BSR), which can involve a periodic scanning of available systems to determine whether better systems are currently available, and subsequent efforts to associate with such preferred systems. Using an acquisition table entry (e.g., in a preferred roaming list), in one example, the access terminal  can limit the search for specific band and channel. For example, the search for the most preferred system can be repeated periodically. Upon discovery of a preferred femto node, such as femto node , the access terminal  selects the femto node  for camping within its coverage area.","A femto node can be restricted in some aspects. For example, a given femto node can only provide certain services to certain access terminals. In deployments with so-called restricted (or closed) association, a given access terminal can only be served by the macro cell mobile network and a defined set of femto nodes (e.g., the femto nodes  that reside within the corresponding user residence ). In some implementations, a femto node can be restricted to not provide, for at least one access terminal, at least one of: signaling, data access, registration, paging, or service.","In some aspects, a restricted femto node (which can also be referred to as a Closed Subscriber Group H(e)NB) is one that provides service to a restricted provisioned set of access terminals. This set can be temporarily or permanently extended as necessary. In some aspects, a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) can be defined as the set of access nodes (e.g., femto nodes) that share a common access control list of access terminals. A channel on which all femto nodes (or all restricted femto nodes) in a region operate can be referred to as a femto channel.","Various relationships can thus exist between a given femto node and a given access terminal. For example, from the perspective of an access terminal, an open femto node can refer to a femto node with no restricted association. A restricted femto node can refer to a femto node that is restricted in some manner (e.g., restricted for association and\/or registration). A home femto node can refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is authorized to access and operate on. A guest femto node can refer to a femto node on which an access terminal is temporarily authorized to access or operate on. An alien femto node can refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is not authorized to access or operate on, except for perhaps emergency situations (e.g., 911 calls).","From a restricted femto node perspective, a home access terminal can refer to an access terminal that authorized to access the restricted femto node. A guest access terminal can refer to an access terminal with temporary access to the restricted femto node. An alien access terminal can refer to an access terminal that does not have permission to access the restricted femto node, except for perhaps emergency situations, for example, 911 calls (e.g., an access terminal that does not have the credentials or permission to register with the restricted femto node).","For convenience, the disclosure herein describes various functionality in the context of a femto node. It should be appreciated, however, that a pico node can provide the same or similar functionality as a femto node, but for a larger coverage area. For example, a pico node can be restricted, a home pico node can be defined for a given access terminal, and so on.","A wireless multiple-access communication system can simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless access terminals. As mentioned above, each terminal can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link can be established via a single-in-single-out system, a MIMO system, or some other type of system.","The various illustrative logics, logical blocks, modules, components, and circuits described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but, in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration. Additionally, at least one processor may comprise one or more modules operable to perform one or more of the steps and\/or actions described above. An exemplary storage medium may be coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. Further, in some aspects, the processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. Additionally, the ASIC may reside in a user terminal. In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal.","In one or more aspects, the functions, methods, or algorithms described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored or transmitted as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium, which may be incorporated into a computer program product. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage medium may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, substantially any connection may be termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs usually reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","While the foregoing disclosure discusses illustrative aspects and\/or embodiments, it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the described aspects and\/or embodiments as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, although elements of the described aspects and\/or embodiments may be described or claimed in the singular, the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated. Additionally, all or a portion of any aspect and\/or embodiment may be utilized with all or a portion of any other aspect and\/or embodiment, unless stated otherwise."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The disclosed aspects will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the appended drawings, provided to illustrate and not to limit the disclosed aspects, wherein like designations denote like elements, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
