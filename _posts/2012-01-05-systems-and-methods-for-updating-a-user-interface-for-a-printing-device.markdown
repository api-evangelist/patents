{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/010,460, filed on Jan. 20, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure relates generally to updating user interfaces for a printing device.","2. Description of the Related Art","In the field of print processing, it is a challenging task for Independent Software Vendors (also referred to herein as \u201cISVs\u201d) to provide a consistent user interface for receiving a desired print intent from a user while supporting private settings for the printers of multiple Independent Hardware Vendors (also referred to herein as \u201cIHVs\u201d). The communication between the Windows\u00ae print sub system, an IHV's plug-in driver, and an ISV's application causes part of the difficulties, because the communication is done thru indexed based binary DevMode and binary DevCaps.","Microsoft\u00ae introduced a new XML based print schema to address the problems associated with communication between the print subsystem and external applications. The print schema technology uses an XML based public schema to describe printer capabilities, device configuration, and job formatting settings. Applications can use the XML based schema to provide print dialogs to change print settings. Whenever a user changes a selected option for a setting, the changed setting and the respective option is added to a delta (also referred to herein as \u201c\u0394\u201d) PrintTicket and merged and validated with a specified base PrintTicket to produce a resulting PrintTicket, which is used to get a corresponding resulting PrintCapabilities document. The resulting PrintCapabilities document is then used to re-populate the user interface (also referred to herein as a \u201cUI\u201d).","In one embodiment, a method for updating a user interface that indicates printing capabilities for a printing device comprises reading one or more first printing capabilities from first printing capabilities data, generating a user interface including a plurality of interface elements, wherein one or more interface elements of the plurality of interface elements are associated with the one or more first printing capabilities, reading one or more second printing capabilities from second printing capabilities data, the one or more second printing capabilities including at least one printing capability different from the one or more first printing capabilities, generating delta printing capabilities data indicating changed printing capabilities based on the one or more first printing capabilities and the one or more second printing capabilities, wherein the delta printing capabilities data includes the at least one printing capability different from the one or more first printing capabilities, and updating the one or more interface elements associated with the changed printing capabilities indicated by the delta printing capabilities data, including the at least one printing capability different from the one or more first printing capabilities, wherein at least one interface element is independent from the changed printing capabilities.","In one embodiment, a device for updating a user interface that indicates print capabilities for a printing device comprises a computer readable storage device, an output interface configured to communicate with a printing device, a display interface configured to communicate with a display device, and one or more processors configured to execute one or more modules. The device further comprises a print capabilities module configured to read one or more first print capabilities of an associated printing device from first print capabilities data, generate a user interface including a plurality of interface elements, wherein one or more interface elements of the plurality of interface elements are associated with the one or more first print capabilities, read one or more second print capabilities from second print capabilities data, the one or more second print capabilities comprising at least one print capability different from the one or more first print capabilities, generate delta print capabilities data indicating changed print capabilities based on the first print capabilities and the second print capabilities, wherein the delta print capabilities data includes the at least one print capability different from the one or more first print capabilities, and update the one or more interface elements associated with the changed print capabilities indicated by the delta print capabilities data, including the at least one print capability different from the one or more first print capabilities.","In one embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium stores instructions that, when executed by one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to perform operations comprising reading base print capabilities from base print capabilities data, generating a print dialogue interface including one or more fields associated with respective print capabilities, wherein the respective print capabilities are set to the base print capabilities, reading one or more updated print capabilities from updated print capabilities data, and determining different print capabilities based on the base print capabilities and the updated print capabilities. The operations further comprise updating one or more fields in the print dialogue interface that are associated with the different print capabilities, and maintaining one or more fields in the print dialogue interface that are not associated with the different print capabilities.","Though the following description is of certain illustrative embodiments alternatives, equivalents, and modifications are included within the scope of the claims. Additionally, the illustrative embodiments may include several novel features, and a particular feature may not be essential to practice the systems and methods described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","180","190","190","180","180"]},"A user and the printing device  communicate via the printing user interface device . Information is presented to the user via the display device , including information sent by the printing device . The printing user interface device  receives user provided information (e.g., user selections) and relays the information to the printing device .","The printing user interface device  includes a print dialogue application  and a printer driver . The print dialogue application  generates a user interface that presents information to the user and that receives information from the user. The user interface may present the information in the form of a graphical interface that shows printer settings and capabilities and that receives user selections, such as selections of an option for a respective setting. The information may also be presented in any other manner that allows a user to view the information and\/or select one or more options. The display device  presents the user interface to the user.","The printer driver  receives information, performs requested operations, and returns requested information (if any). For example, the print dialogue application  invokes the functionality of the printer driver  via a function call, passes information to the printer driver  in the form of parameters of the function call, and receives the information returned by the printer driver . The interaction between the print dialogue application  and the printer driver  may conform to an application programming interface.","The printer driver  may convert received information into a format readable by the printing device . For example, the printer driver  may receive a print job from a software application, convert the print job into PDL data for the printing device , and transmit the PDL data to the printing device . The printer driver  also communicates with the printing device  about the status of the printing device (e.g., paper, level, ink level, toner level, errors, selected paper size, colors).","The printer driver  also adjusts the configuration of the settings of the printing device  and tracks the capabilities of the settings. Settings include, but are not limited to, media size, borderless printing, duplexing, media type, resolution, colors, orientation, copying, collating, media quality, print quality, and margins. An option defines a configuration for a setting (e.g., gray scale is an option for color, letter size is an option for media size, landscape is an option for orientation), and a set of some or all of the available options for a setting are the capabilities of the respective setting.","The printer driver  may be configured with the relationships between the settings, capabilities, and the selected settings options of the printing device . Thus, the printer driver  can determine which print capabilities are or are not available based on the selected options of one or more settings and determine which setting options are constrained based on the selected options of one or more other settings.","For example, the printing driver  may be configured with the priorities of different settings and adjust printer capabilities according to selected options for the settings. Thus, if the selected option of a lower priority setting is changed, the printer driver  does not change the capabilities of the higher priority settings. However, if the selected option of a higher priority setting is changed, the printer driver  adjusts the capabilities of the lower priority settings, if necessary.","Following the above example, a printer driver may be configured to assign the medium size setting a lower priority than the medium type setting or the borderless printing setting. Thus, if the selected option for the medium size setting is changed, the capabilities for the medium type or borderless printing settings will not be changed because they are a higher priority. However, if the option selected for the medium type setting or the borderless printing setting is changed, then the capabilities for the medium size (and other lower priority settings) will be changed, if necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","290","280","200","280","270","200","270","290","270"]},"The printing user interface device  includes one or more processors  (also referred to herein as \u201cCPU \u201d), which may be a conventional or customized microprocessor(s). The CPU  is configured to read and execute computer readable instructions, and the CPU  may command\/and or control other components of the printing user interface device .","The printing user interface device  also includes I\/O interfaces , which provide communication interfaces to other devices, including a keyboard, a display device, a mouse, a printing device, a touch screen, a light pen, an optical storage device, a scanner, a microphone, a camera, etc. The printing user interface device  also includes memory , which may be volatile or non-volatile, such as ROM, RAM, and flash memory. The printing user interface device  further includes a network interface  that allows the printing user interface device  to communicate with the network . The storage device  stores data or modules and may include, for example, a hard drive, an optical storage device, a diskette, and\/or a solid state drive. The components of the printing user interface device  are connected via a bus. The printing user interface device  includes an operating system, which manages the hardware, the processes, the interrupts, the memory, and\/or the file system of the printing user interface device .","The printing user interface device  also includes a user interface module , a printer driver , and lookup table(s) . A module may be executed by the printing user interface device  to cause the printing user interface device  to perform certain operations, though for ease of description a module may be described as performing the operations. Modules may include logic and\/or computer readable instructions and may be implemented in software, firmware, and\/or hardware. In other embodiments, the printing user interface device  may include more or less modules, the modules may be combined into fewer modules, or the modules may be divided into more modules.","The user interface module  includes instructions that, when executed, cause the printing user interface device  to generate a user interface that includes printing information, such as printing device settings and capabilities. The user interface may include any combination of text and graphics and may receive data from a user, such as via a text field or by user selection of a control on the interface (e.g., a menu, a button, a check box). As discussed above, the printer driver  communicates with a printing device (e.g., printing device ). The user interface module  may implement the print dialogue application, as discussed above. In the embodiment shown in , the printing user interface device  also includes lookup table(s) . The lookup table(s)  includes information about printing device settings, and the printing user interface device  may use the lookup table(s) to determine changes to the capabilities of one or more settings in response to a change in the selected option of one or more settings of the printing device .","For example, the lookup table(s)  may map selected print options to print capabilities (e.g., map a PrintTicket to a PrintCapabilities). The lookup table(s)  may include a column for each setting (e.g., media size, media type, color, duplexing, stapling, font) and each capability and row for each permutation of setting options, and a row of the lookup table may indicate the printing capabilities for a printing device when the printing device is set to the settings options indicated in the respective row. In other embodiments, the printing user interface device  determines changes in print capabilities by other means, including logic, data trees, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","210","220","225"]},"Beginning in block , base print capabilities are obtained, for example, from a printer driver. The base print capabilities may be associated with base print settings options. Additionally, the base print capabilities may be received from a printer driver, such as in response to providing print settings data (e.g., an object, a file, a pointer, a data structure), which defines one or more base print settings options, to a printer driver. The print settings data may be provided to the printer driver in the form of markup language data, and, in some embodiments, the data is a PrintTicket. The base print capabilities may be obtained from the driver in the form of markup language data, and may be in the form of a PrintCapabilities.","Next, in block  a user interface is generated based on the base print capabilities, and when displayed the user interface presents one or more of the base print capabilities to the user. The selected options for one or more print settings may also be displayed. The method proceeds to block , where updated print capabilities are obtained, such as after one or more of the selected options for the print settings are changed. For example, the updated print capabilities may be received from the printer driver, such as in response to calling the printer driver and passing the printer driver data that includes the updated selected options for the print settings. In one embodiment, the data that includes the updated selected options for the print settings is a PrintTicket (e.g., a delta PrintTicket). The printer driver may return data that includes only updated print capabilities and\/or that identifies the updated print capabilities, for example by tagging the updated print capabilities or storing the updated print capabilities in a predetermined location in the data.","Once the updated print capabilities are obtained, in block  \u0394print capabilities are generated that indicate the differences between the base print capabilities and the updated print capabilities, such as by comparing the base print capabilities with the updated print capabilities. The \u0394print capabilities for specific updated print settings options (e.g., a \u0394PrintTicket) may be generated using lookup tables, hash tables, document object models, grammars, DevCaps structures, DevMode structures, etc., and the generation may involve parsing, text comparison, binary comparison, hashing, etc.","Finally, in block , one or more portions of the user interface that are associated with the \u0394print capabilities are updated, and the other portions of the user interface may be maintained. Thus, only part of the user interface may be updated in response to a change in print capabilities, in particular the part of the user interface that displays the changed print capabilities. Furthermore, if there are no changes to the print capabilities then there may be no updates to the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","480"]},"In this illustrative embodiment, the base print settings data  is a base PrintTicket  (\u201cbase PT \u201d). Also, by way of illustration and not limitation, in this embodiment other print settings data are PrintTickets and other print capabilities data are PrintCapabilities, though other embodiments of this method may not include PrintTickets and PrintCapabilities. The base PT  is used to obtain the base PrintCapabilities  (\u201cbase PC \u201d). For example, the base PT  may be passed to a printer driver and the printer driver may return the base PC . Next, in block , an initial user interface is generated. The initial user interface may include one or more of the print settings and respective selected options in the base PT  and respective one or more of the base print capabilities in the base PC . A user may change one or more selected options of the print settings via the user interface, and the selected options may be added to a delta PrintTicket  (\u201c\u0394PT \u201d).","Proceeding to block , the base PT  is merged and validated with the \u0394PT  to generate a resulting PrintTicket (\u201cresulting PT \u201d). Thus, the resulting PT  integrates the changed settings with the base settings. Next, in block , the resulting PT  is used to obtain the resulting PrintCapabilities  (\u201cresulting PC \u201d). The resulting PC  indicates the print capabilities that are available while the associated printing device is configured according to the selected options in the resulting PT .","Moving to block , a delta print capabilities  (\u201c\u0394PC \u201d) is generated based on the resulting PC  and the base PC . The resulting PC  may be compared with the base PC  to determine the changes in print capabilities, and the changed capabilities are added to the \u0394PC . The \u0394PC  may indicate no changes, one change, or a plurality of changes, depending at least in part on the changes to the selected options for the print settings in the \u0394PT  and on the printing device. In block , the parts of the user interface that are associated with the changed print capabilities in the \u0394PC  are accordingly updated. The parts of the user interface that are not associated with the changed print capabilities may be maintained in their current state, thus avoiding unnecessary changes to the user interface, which may save time and computing resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510"]},"Proceeding to block , resulting PC data is parsed. In block , a \u0394PC is generated. To generate the \u0394PC, in one embodiment, upon receiving the start indicator of each markup element from the parser, a markup element name and stream pointer to the markup element are retrieved and pushed onto a stack. When an end markup element indicator is received, the markup element name and stream pointer are popped from the stack, and the corresponding node (if any) is found in the base PC lookup table. The XML string of the base PC element node is then compared with the XML string of the resulting PC element node. If a difference is found, the element node is added to a \u0394PC DOM and the entry is removed from the base PC lookup table. If no difference is found, then the entry is removed from the base PC lookup table and the markup element node is not added to the \u0394PC DOM. This proceeds until the end document indicator is reached, and \u0394PC is generated using the \u0394PC DOM.","Also, in block  a resulting PC lookup table is generated. Block  is performed by building a resulting PC DOM upon receiving each event from the parser and building a lookup table that refers to the resulting PC DOM. Blocks  and  may be performed during a single parsing of the resulting PC, and thus may be performed substantially simultaneously. Finally, in block  the resulting PC lookup table is identified as the base PC lookup table. Thus, if another resulting PC is received, flow returns to block  and the resulting print capabilities from the previous iteration are used as the base print capabilities when generating a \u0394PC for the next iteration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1","600","603","650","2","650","605","600","600","691","603","605","3","691","690"]},"In stage  the print dialogue application  passes a \u0394PT  to the printer driver .
