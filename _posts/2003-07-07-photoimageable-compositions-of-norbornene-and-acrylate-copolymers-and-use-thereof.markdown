No. 09\/930,197 filed Aug. 16, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,440, which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 09\/565,137, filed May 5, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,440, which is a division of Ser. No. 09\/099,070, filed Jun. 17, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,111,041, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional No. 60\/050,107, filed Jun. 18, 1997.","This invention was made with support from the Government under Grant\/Contract number DE\/FG02-84ER13295. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to photo-imageable compositions encompassing copolymers prepared from norbornene-type and acrylate-type monomers, and more specifically to the use of such photo-imageable copolymers in providing pattern transfer to an underlying layer(s).","Considerable interest has existed in the copolymerization of acrylates with norbornenes because of the potential benefits of combining the useful properties of the homopolymers of the two monomers. For example, polyacrylates are valued for their extreme hardness and adhesive properties, and are used to form clear, glass-like materials such as Lucite\u2122 and Plexiglas\u2122. In addition, polymers formed using acrylate-type monomers have been found useful in microelectronic fabrication, for example, in advanced photoresist compositions where high-resolution images are desired. Polynorbornenes, on the other hand, are capable of resisting high temperatures and, thus, typically are employed in applications that necessitate high-temperature stability. In addition, polymers formed using norbornene-type monomers have been found useful in microelectronic fabrication, for example, in advanced photoresist compositions where high selectivity during plasma etching processes is desired.","Polymerization of acrylic derivatives is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,849,488. In that patent, certain phosphorus compounds are used as polymerization catalysts. Preferred acrylic derivatives that are polymerized in accordance with that patent are acrylates and methacrylates of monovalent and polyvalent alcohols. Copolymers of at least two different acrylic derivatives are also disclosed. There is no disclosure in that patent relevant to the possibility of copolymerizing an acrylic derivative with norbornene or a norbornene derivative or the use of such a copolymer in a photoresist composition.","Some attempts to copolymerize acrylates with norbornenes are known but have met with only modest success. Such modest success has been thought to be a result of a disparity in the mechanisms by which the respective monomers polymerize. U.S. Pat. No. 3,697,490, for example, discloses copolymers of alkoxy alkyl acrylates, alkyl acrylates and substituted norbornene, wherein the copolymers contain only about 0.5 to about 5.5 percent by weight substituted norbornene compounds. The copolymers described in that patent typically are prepared in batch reactions, or the monomers may be proportioned to a reactor containing water and other desired polymerization additives. The patent indicates that best results are generally obtained at polymerization temperatures in the range of 5\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. in the presence of water containing a free radical generating catalyst and surface active agents. There is no disclosure in the '490 patent relevant to the use of the described copolymers for photoresist compositions.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,259 broadly discloses a process for polymerizing ethylene, acyclic olefins, and\/or selected cyclic olefins, and optionally selected olefinic esters or carboxylic acids. The polymerization reactions are catalyzed by selected transition metal compounds, and sometimes other co-catalysts. Also described in that patent is the synthesis of linear alpha-olefins by the oligomerization of ethylene using as a catalyst system a combination of a nickel compound having a selected alpha-diimine ligand and a selected Lewis or Bronsted acid, or by contacting selected alpha-diimine complexes with ethylene. The '259 patent also discloses polymerization of substituted norbornenes using the disclosed alpha-diimine-containing catalysts systems. However, such patent does not disclose or suggest the use of the described copolymers for photoresist compositions.","Japanese publication JP040063810 relates to copolymers that contain units derived from three essential monomers, namely: (i) an acrylic ester and\/or methacrylic ester monomer, (ii) a monomer that possesses a norbornene skeleton, and (iii) a monomer that can be radical-polymerized with the monomer that contains the norbornene skeleton. The copolymers must contain from about 0.5 to about 35 mole % of units derived from radical-polymerizable monomer (iii). The compounds that are disclosed as being suitable for use as the monomer (iii) include esters of maleic acid and an aliphatic alcohol which contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, maleic anhydride, N-substituted maleimides, \u03b1-cyanocinnamic acid, esters of \u03b1-cyanocinnamic acid and an aliphatic alcohol which contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and esters of fumaric acid and an aliphatic alcohol which contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The copolymerization reaction that is described in the Japanese publication typically is conducted in the presence of a free radical polymerization initiator, such as acetyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, 2,2\u2032-azobiscyclopropylpropionitrile, or the like. Such publication does not disclose or suggest the use of the described copolymers for photoresist compositions.","Typically, acrylates polymerize in the presence of radical or anionic initiators, whereas norbornenes do not readily follow radical pathways or respond to such anionic initiators. Rather, norbornene-type monomers are typically polymerized by cationic or insertion mechanisms. Therefore, in order to affect the copolymerization of acrylate-type monomers with norbornene-type monomers, it would be desirable to develop processes that would be effective for polymerizing both types of monomers. In addition, it would be desirable to formulate photo-imageable compositions that incorporate acrylate-norbornene polymers formed using any of the available processes for forming such polymers to take advantage of the properties of each monomer.","Embodiments in accordance with the present invention are described herein below. Such embodiments encompass copolymers of acrylate-type and norbornene-type monomers and are characterized by advantages and properties attributable to the respective acrylate and norbornene monomers from which they are derived. Such copolymers can be tailored in norbornene to acrylate ratio by varying the ratio of the respective monomers in the reaction mixture. Where a neutral or cationic palladium (Pd) based catalyst system is used to initiate polymerization, varying the ligands utilized in the catalyst system can be used for tailoring the norbornene to acrylate ratio to provide a specific set or range of such advantages and properties. Embodiments in accordance with the present invention encompass photo-imageable compositions of such imageable acrylate-type\/norbornene-type copolymers that include a photoacid generator (PAG) and a suitable solvent. Such compositions form images as a result of an acid-catalyzed process that is the result of exposing selected portions of the composition to a radiant energy source. In addition, some embodiments also encompass one or more optional additives such as base quenchers, dyes and\/or sensitizers, and dissolution rate modifiers (DRMs). Embodiments in accordance with the present invention also include methods of using the aforementioned photo-imageable compositions, for example to form structures from such compositions and to transfer the pattern of such structures to layers underlying such structures.","Some of the imageable copolymer embodiments of the present invention are advantageously prepared by reacting one or more acrylate monomers with one or more norbornene monomers in the presence of a neutral Pd(II)-based catalyst system. While both acrylate and norbornene monomers are necessary to form acrylate-norbornene copolymers, additional monomers can be added to the polymerization mixture, provided that they do not interfere with the desired polymerization. Thus, while there may be some instances where it would be desirable to add monomers that can be radical-polymerized with the norbornene monomer, such as the monomers described above in connection Japanese publication JP040063810 as radical-polymerizable monomer (iii), it is generally more desirable to use the neutral Pd(II)-based catalyst system to prepare the copolymers of embodiments in accordance with the present invention in the absence of such added monomers.","It will be noted that while use of the neutral Pd(II)-based catalyst system mentioned above is desirable for forming the copolymers utilized in the embodiments of the present invention, such acrylate-norbornene copolymers can also be prepared by free radical and living free radical methods as well as cationic Pd(II) systems. Such other catalyst systems are also in accordance with embodiments of the present invention and are described more fully below.","As used in this specification and claims, the terms \u201cacrylate\u201d or \u201cacrylate-type\u201d are meant to include compounds of the general formula HC\u2550CRCOOR, where Ris hydrogen, methyl or trifluoromethyl and Rrepresents hydrogen or a linear or branched (C\u2013C)alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, i-butyl, pentyl, t-pentyl and neopentyl or an aryl group, such as phenyl or p-tolyl and lactones such as tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-furanyl, and tetrahydro-5-oxo-3-furanyl.

For example, copolymers containing from about 5 to about 95 mole % acrylate-derived units and from about 95 to about 5 mole % norbornene-derived units may be prepared in accordance with this invention. In some embodiments, copolymers containing from about 15 to about 90 mole % acrylate-derived units and from about 85 to about 10 mole % norbornene-derived units are prepared; and in other embodiments, copolymers containing from about 25 to about 80 mole % acrylate-derived units and from about 75 to about 20 mole % norbornene-derived units are prepared. In still other exemplary embodiments, copolymers containing from about 35 to about 55 mole % acrylate-derived units and from about 65 to about 45 mole % norbornene-derived units are prepared.","The polymerization preferably is carried out in the liquid phase using a solvent, such as dichloromethane (CHCl), benzene (CH), chlorobenzene (CHCl) or hexane (CH). Other solvents that may be used as the polymerization medium include, for example, pentane (CH), toluene (CH), and chloroform (CHCl).","The polymerization in accordance with this invention may be carried out at temperatures ranging from about 0 to about 200\u00b0 C. Typically, however, the polymerization will be carried out at a temperature of from about 30 to about 80\u00b0 C., e.g., about 50\u00b0 C. The pressure at which the polymerization is carried out has not been found to be critical.","Other palladium containing catalysts useful for making the copolymers utilized in this invention, for example cationic Pd(II) systems, can be prepared as preformed single component catalysts or prepared in situ by admixing a palladium containing procatalyst with an activator in the presence of the desired monomer(s) to be polymerized.","Where a preformed cationic Pd(II) catalyst is desired, it can be prepared by admixing the catalyst precursors, such as a procatalyst and activator, in an appropriate solvent; allowing the reaction to proceed under appropriate temperature conditions, and isolating the preformed catalyst as the reaction product. By procatalyst is meant a palladium containing compound that is converted to an active catalyst by a reaction with a cocatalyst or activator compound. The description and synthesis of representative procatalysts and activator compounds, as well as cationic Pd(II) catalysts formed thereusing, are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,455,650, the pertinent parts of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Exemplary palladium procatalysts suitable for the polymerization of the monomers of the invention are represented by the formula:\n\n(Allyl)Pd(P(R)3)(L\u2032)\n\nwherein Ris selected from isopropyl and cyclohexyl; and L\u2032 is selected from trifluoroacetate, and trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate).

In addition, other suitable activator compounds are described in the aforementioned '650 patent","In another embodiment in accordance with the present invention, a palladium compound, for example Pd(OC(O)CH)or Pd(OC(O)CF), a phosphine compound, and the activators, LIFABA or DANFABA referred to above, can be mixed in situ with the desired monomer(s) to be polymerized. Other suitable palladium compounds are described in the aforementioned '650 patent, and other representative phosphine compounds are phosphines such as described for the neutral Pd(II) catalyst system above.","In one embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of palladium procatalyst (based on the palladium metal) to activator is 1 to 2. In another embodiment, the ratio is 1 to 4, and in another embodiment the ratio is 1 to 1. It should be noted that the order of addition of the various catalyst components mentioned above to the reaction medium has not been found to be important.","Free radical polymerization techniques useful for forming copolymers in accordance with the present invention are set forth in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science, John Wiley & Sons, 13, 708 (1988).","Generally, in a free radical polymerization process, the monomers are polymerized in a solvent at an elevated temperature (about 50\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C.) in the presence of a free radical initiator. Suitable initiators include but are not limited to azo compounds and peroxides. Representative examples of free radical initiators are azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), benzoyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, azobisisocapronitrile, azobisisovaleronitrile and t-butylhydroperoxide.","In some embodiments in accordance with the invention the free radical catalyst initiators are particularly useful when polymerizing the polycycloolefin monomers set forth under Formula I and\/or Formula Ia in combination with a monomer selected from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and linear and branched (C1\u2013C5)alkyl esters of acrylic acid, sulfur dioxide, and mixtures thereof.","In some embodiments of the present invention controlled living free radical (LFR) polymerization is employed. Such LFR polymerization offers advantages over traditional free radical techniques such as providing for the formation of polymer products having well-controlled molecular weights with low molecular weight polydispersity and monomer composition. Of the living free radical techniques that have been developed some of the more well-known include, but are not limited to: reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT); atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP); and iniferter polymerization such as nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization.","It will be recognized that when it is desired to incorporate latent crosslinking moieties into the polymer backbone via free radical or LFR polymerization, care should be taken not select monomers that contain pendant free radically polymerizable carbon-carbon unsaturation, as the polymer will crosslink during the free radical polymerization reaction.","Suitable photo acid generators (PAGs) for embodiments in accordance with the present invention include triflates (e.g., triphenylsulfonium triflate), pyrogallol (e.g., trimesylate of pyrogallol), onium salts such as triarylsulfonium and diaryliodium hexafluoroantimonates, hexafluoroarsenates, trifluoromethanesulfonates, esters of hydroxyimides, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-bis-sulfonyl-diazomethanes, sulfonate esters of nitro-substituted benzyl alcohols and napthoquinone-4-diazides and those PAGs disclosed in Reichmanis et al., Chem. Mater. 3, 395, (1991). Compositions containing triarylsulfonium or diaryliodonium salts are advantageous due to their sensitivity to deep UV light (193 to 300 nm) and are found to give very high resolution images. Of such triarylsulfonium or diaryliodonium salts, unsubstituted and symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted diaryliodium or triarylsulfonium salts are generally the most advantageous. Photo-imageable compositions in accordance with the present invention generally encompass from about 1 to about 100, desirably from about 1.25 to about 50, and preferably from about 1.5 to about 5 parts by weight PAG based upon 100 parts by weight of the polymeric binder or resin.","Photo-imageable embodiments of the present invention contain a solvent prior to their application to a desired substrate. Exemplary solvents that have been found suitable include, but are not limited to, PGMEA (propylene glycol methylether acetate), ethyl lactate, cyclohexanone, and the like, where the solvent selected does not have significant adverse effect on the performance of the photo-imageable coploymer.","Some photo-imageable embodiments in accordance with the present invention can additionally encompass one or more optional components or additives in addition to the aforementioned copolymer, PAG and solvent. Such components include base quenchers, dyes and\/or sensitizers and dissolution rate modifiers (DRMs).","Suitable base quenchers include, but are not limited to, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, triethanolamine, triisopropylamine, N-methylpyrrolidone, and the like. Such suitable base quencher additives are generally weak bases which can scavange trace acids generated by the PAG component and thereby improve image resolution and profiles of the photo-imageable copolymer.","Suitable dyes and\/or sensitizers are capable of sensitizing the PAG to specific desired wavelengths or ranges of wavelengths that are dependant on the intended application. Such sensitizers include, but are not limited to, polycyclic aromatics such as pyrene and perlene. The sensitization of PAGs is well-known and is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,250,053; 4,371,605; and 4,491,628 which are all incorporated herein, in pertinent part, by reference.","Generally a DRM is used to promote dissolution of radiation exposed portions of the photo-imageable composition applied to the substrate. Some examplary DRM's that are suitable for embodiments in accordance with the present invention include bile acid esters derived from cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, ursocholic acid, lithocholic acid, and the like.","The photo-imageable compositions of the present invention are prepared by combining the imageable copolymer, PAG and solvent with any one or more of the aforementioned optional components or additives using conventional methods. Generally such photo-imageable compositions contain between about 0.5 to 20 wt. % PAG (based on the total weight of the imageable copolymer employed) are initially about 50 to 90 wt. % solvent (based on the total of the photo-imageable composition). Where a base quencher is employed, generally 1 wt. % or less of such additive (based on the total weight of the imageable copolymer employed) is provided. Where a DRM is employed, generally from about 5 to 25 wt. % (based on the total weight of the imageable copolymer employed) is provided.","The general use of the photo-imageable compositions in accordance with embodiments of the present invention as a photoresist composition in photolithography for semiconductors is generally known","Typically, the photo-imageable composition containing solvent is applied to the desired substrate using a spin coating technique, although other application techniques can be employed. The substrate with a coating of the photo-imageable composition is then heated (pre-exposure bake) prior to being exposed to a radiation source to remove the solvent. The thickness of the layer after the solvent is substantially removed is generally as thin as possible with the proviso that such thickness is substantially uniform and that the layer is of sufficient thickness to withstand any subsequent processing as may be needed to transfer a pattern to a material layer disposed over the substrate.","After the solvent is substantially removed during the pre-exposure bake, the layer is then exposed to the radiation source where such exposure is controlled to form a pattern therein. For example, where a wavelike radiation form such as ultraviolet radiation is employed, the exposure is conducted through a mask which is placed between the radiation source and the layer such that only selected portions of the layer are exposed to the radiation source. It will be understood that the total exposure energy needed to form the aforementioned pattern is a function of multiple factors, for example the nature of the photo-imageable composition in its entirety, that is to say all of the components thereof, the wavelength of the radiation employed for the exposure and size of the smallest dimension of the pattern being formed and the thickness of the layer. Despite this seemingly complex inter-relationship of factors, it will be recognized that such total exposure energy is readily determined both by routine experimentation and\/or by computer modeling, such as are known.","After the layer is exposed, it is typically baked (post-exposure bake) to further complete the acid-catalyzed reaction and to enhance the contrast of the exposed pattern. After post-exposure bake, the layer is contacted with an alkaline solution which selectively dissolves the areas of the layer which were exposed to the radiation. Suitable alkaline solutions (developers) are aqueous solutions of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, generally having a conventional concentration equal to 0.26N, although other concentrations can also be suitable. After developing the pattern, the remaining unexposed portions of the layer, \u201cthe pattern,\u201d is generally baked (post develop bake) or otherwise dried to remove any remaining developer.","The pattern formed from the photo-imageable compositions of the present invention advantageously have characteristics of both its acrylate-type components and norbornene-type components. That is to say such patterns represent high-resolution images of the mask employed and exhibit high selectivity during plasma etching processes such as can be used to transfer such pattern to an underlying material layer disposed over the substrate. Thus, embodiments of the photo-imageable compositions of the present invention can be used to create patterned material layer structures such as metal wiring lines, holes for contacts or vias, insulation sections (e.g., damascene trenches or shallow trench isolation), trenches for capacitor structures, etc. as might be used in the design of integrated circuit devices.","The various aspects of the invention will be appreciated more fully in light of the following illustrative examples:","In a glove box, under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen), [(1,5-cyclooctadiene)Pd-(Me)(Cl)] (0.020 g, 7.56\u00d710mol) was placed into a 25 mL round bottom flask.

Varying the ratio of acrylate monomer to norbornene monomer affects the properties of the copolymers in that increasing the ratio of one of the monomer reactants increases its presence in the copolymer product. In instances of a very high ratio of one monomer relative to the other (for example, in 10:1 and 1:10 monomer ratio reactions) the resulting copolymer product consists of long strings of repeating units of the abundant monomer with a one or more units of the less abundant monomer therebetween. Thus, polymer products having a high acrylate content, e.g., high methyl content, tend to be somewhat tacky, whereas polymers having a high norbornene content are white powdery substances. Varying the ligand used in the reaction and\/or varying the reactant monomer ratio also affects the molecular weight of the copolymer product. Thus, referring to the Examples 1\u201328 and Table 1, it can be seen that the mole % of norbornene in the copolymer product increased as the ratio of acrylate monomer to norbornene monomer in the reaction decreased from 10:1 to 1:1 when PPhwas used as the ligand (Examples 11\u201313), when PCywas used as the ligand (Examples 14\u201316), and when pyridine was used as the ligand (Examples 26\u201328). Similarly, it can be seen that the molecular weight of the copolymer product increased as the ratio of acrylate monomer to norbornene monomer increased from 1:1 to 10:1 when PPhwas used as the ligand (Examples 9\u201311), when PCywas used as the ligand (Examples 14\u201316), and when PMewas used as the ligand (Examples 19\u201321). It also can be seen that the use of pyridine as the ligand (Examples 24\u201328) generally resulted in the production of lower molecular weight copolymers, whereas the use of triphenyl phosphine as the ligand (Examples 9\u201313) tended to produce higher molecular weight copolymers.","Examples 36\u201340, as well as Example 31, the homopolymer of t-butyl acrylate, and Example 32, essentially the same copolymer as Example 36, are all photo-imageable. It will be noted that such characteristic is afforded by the inclusion of an acid labile group on at least one or the other of the acrylate-type or norbornene-type monomer used to form the copolymer or homopolymer of each photo-imageable example. Thus in Examples 31, 32, 36 and 40 the acrylate monomer selected encompasses an acid labile moiety and in Examples 37, 38 and 39, the norbornene monomer encompasses an acid labile moiety. It will be understood, therefore, that the photo-imageable compositions of embodiments in accordance with the present invention encompass copolymers where at least one or the other of the acrylate or norbornene monomers from which the copolymer is derived includes an acid labile moiety.","While the present invention has been described and exemplified above, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the details of the illustrative embodiments and examples, but may be embodied with various changes and modifications which may occur to those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in the following claims. For example, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to copolymers formed of a single acrylate monomer and norbornene monomer. Rather, the teachings herein make it apparent that polymers encompassing more than a single acrylate-type monomer and a single norbornene-type monomer are within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus it is taught herein that the selection of specific monomers is useful for the control of, for example, the physical characteristics of the resulting polymer. Therefore it would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the inclusion of one or more additional monomers, acrylate-type units or norbornene-type units, can be useful for forming a polymer with a set of desired characteristics. Where such polymers having additional monomers are desirable, the formation of such can be effected in several ways. For example, each of the monomers can be combined together initially and the desired polymer formed in a single polymerization reaction or the desired polymer formed using a multi-stage polymerization where a first polymer is first formed and one or more additional monomers are added in one or more additional polymerization reactions."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["Embodiments of the invention are described below with reference to the accompanying figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
