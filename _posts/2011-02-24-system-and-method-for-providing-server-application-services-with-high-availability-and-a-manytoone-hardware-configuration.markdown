{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to providing server application services, such as the services provided by the server application offered by Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122, with high availability and a many-to-one back up hardware configuration.","Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122 may be a rich enterprise server application that provides full content management features, implement business processes, and\/or provide access to information related to organizational goals and\/or processes.","High availability may be a system design protocol that ensures a certain degree of operational continuity. Conventional configurations of Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122 may be challenged to meet high availability standards for a variety of reasons. For example, conventional configurations of servers providing redundancy involve a one-to-one standby server to online server set up that is costly in terms of hardware, bandwidth, and\/or other resources.","One aspect of the invention relates to a system and method providing a suite of network-based services, such as the services corresponding to the server application distributed by Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122, to users with high availability. The suite of network-based services may include browser-based collaboration functions, process management functions, index and search functions, document-management functions, help and help search functions, and\/or other functions. The system and method may enable a plurality of computing devices functioning as servers to be backed up by a single computing device, may make the services available with high availability, and\/or may provide other enhancements.","In some implementations, a single standby server devices may be configured to backup a server farm having two or more servers configured to coordinate to serve a server application. The single standby server device may be configured to execute computer program modules including a server application module, a monitor module, an information transfer module, a server replacement module, a changeover coordination module, configuration management module, and\/or other modules.","The server application module may be configured to provide one or more server application services associated with a server application to be backed up for the server farm. For example, the server application may include the collection of software elements available from Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122. The server application services may include one or more of a web front-end service, an indexing service, a central administration service, one or more shared services, a database service, and\/or other sub-modules.","The monitor module may be configured to determine whether a changeover of the server farm should be initiated. Such determinations may be made based on user input or command, and\/or based on monitoring the operation of the server farm. Disruptions in operation of one or more of the servers in the server farm may cause the monitor module to determine that a changeover of the server farm to the single standby device should be initiated.","The information transfer module may be configured to transfer information stored by the servers of the server farm to the electronic storage of the standby server. This transfer of information may take place in response to determination by the monitor module that a changeover should be initiated. The information transferred may include a configuration database for the server farm, a central administration website associated with the server farm, information being served by the server farm, and\/or other information.","The server replacement module may be configured to replace the servers of the server farm with the standby server device. This replacement may be made by replacing the servers of the server farm with the standby server device in information transferred from the servers of the server farm to the electronic storage of the standby server. For example, the server replacement module may be configured to replace the servers of the server farm with the standby server device in the configuration database, and\/or other information.","The changeover coordination module may be configured to initiate startup, on the server application module executed on the standby server device, of the services previously provided by the server farm. The changeover coordination module may be configured to manage the order in which services are started up. For example, the changeover coordination module may be configured such that the database service and the central administration service may be started up before other services. This may bring the configuration database and\/or the central administration website online before other services are started up.","The configuration management module may be configured to adjust the configuration database after transfer to the electronic storage of the standby server. This may be done in order to consolidate server roles that become redundant during changeover from the plurality of servers in the server farm to the single standby server. This may involve scanning the configuration database and\/or the central administration website to identify instances of redundancy. The identified instances of redundancy may then be addressed by deleting information, adjusting information, adjusting control settings, and\/or performing other adjustments.","These and other objects, features, and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structure and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. As used in the specification and in the claims, the singular form of \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","16","18"]},"The system  may leverage one or more external information sources . Users may interface with system  and\/or external information sources  via client computing platforms . The components of system , external information sources , and\/or client computing platforms  may be operatively linked via one or more electronic communication links. For example, such electronic communication links may be established, at least in part, via a network such as the Internet and\/or other networks. It will be appreciated that this is not intended to be limiting, and that the scope of this disclosure includes implementations in which system , external information sources , and\/or client computing platforms  are operatively linked via some other communication media.","A given client computing platform  may include one or more processors configured to execute computer program modules. The computer program modules may be configured to enable one or more users associated with the given client computing platform  to interface with system  and\/or external information sources , and\/or provide other functionality attributed herein to client computing platforms .

As such, first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server  may be included in a \u201cserver farm\u201d configured to provide the server application services of the server application. In order for a server, such as first production server , second production server , or third production server , in the server farm, the server may have to be included in a configuration database for the server farm. An entry in the configuration database including the server in the server farm may indicate a server role of the server, and\/or other information.","The server farm may serve, or host, the network-based services over the network to client computing platforms . In order to provide the network-based services with high availability, standby server device  may be configured as a back-up to first production server , second production server , and third production server  that replaces first production server , second production server , third production server  and\/or any other production servers in the server farm in case of failover or switchover. Failover may include situations in which a server (or one or more individual services hosted by a server) fails in an unexpected manner. Switchover may include situations in which the switch from the server farm to standby server device  is performed intentionally. For example, switchover may be executed to perform maintenance, to test one or servers, and\/or for other purposes. For convenience, the term \u201cchangeover\u201d will be used herein to refer to switching services from one server to another for either of failover or switchover.","Although first production server , second production server , and third production server  are each illustrated as a single entity in , this is not intended to be limiting. One or more of first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server  may represent a set of two or more servers that cooperate to provide the functionality attributed to the individual server(s) herein. The illustration of standby server device  as a single entity, on the other hand, may be indicative of the operation of standby server device  as a single piece of server hardware in backing up an entire server farm including first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server .","The first production server , second production server , third production server , and\/or standby server device  may be in operative communication with each other.

The description of the functionality provided by modules  described below is for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to be limiting, as module  may provide more or less functionality than is described.","The server application module  may be configured to provide one or more server application services associated with a server application. As used herein, the term \u201cserver application\u201d may refer to one or more software elements that cause processor  to provide a suite of network-based services to users in a coordinated and cooperative manner with first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server . For example, the server application may include the collection of software elements available from Microsoft\u00ae SharePoint\u2122. The server application module  may be configured such that the server application provides application programming interfaces through which server application module  communicates with other computer program modules that are not an integral part of server application module .","In cooperating with second production server , and\/or third production server  to provide the server application services to users, the server application module  may provide one or more of the server application services. The server application services may include one or more of a web front-end service, an indexing service, a central administration service, one or more shared services, a database service, and\/or other sub-modules.","In some implementations, server application module  may be configured to provide the database service.

The one or more computer program modules may include a server application module , and\/or other modules. The server application module  may be substantially the same as server application module , and may be configured to provide one or more of the server application services associated with the server application.","In some implementations, server application module  may be configured to provide the indexing service, may provide the central administration service, may perform one or more shared services provider roles, and\/or may provide other services. The indexing service may index information served by the server farm, metadata related to information served by the server farm, and\/or other information. The indexing service may crawl content, logs, and\/or other information sources associated with the server farm, and\/or other information and create an index in an ongoing manner. This index may be referenced to respond to queries and\/or searches by users, administrators, and\/or for other purposes.","The central administration service may be configured to manage administration functions within the server farm. This may include serving a central administration database through which the configuration database is accessed by the servers (e.g., first production server , second production server , and third production server ) of the server farm. The central administration service may provide users with the capabilities to configure the servers and the components\/roles on them, modify security settings, configure web sites, provide access to other configuration parameters.","As a shared service provider, server application module  may be configured to provide one or more shared services within the server farm.

Serving the content may include receiving requests for content, receiving instructions for altering or calling content, and\/or receiving other requests or instructions from client computing platform(s) , and then responding by providing the requested content (or locations of the requested content) to the requesting client computing platform(s) .","The standby server device  may generally be configured to backup the server farm including first production server , second production server , and third production server . Prior to changeover from the server farm to standby server device , standby server device  may be excluded from the configuration database of the server farm. This may mean that standby server device  is not indicated in the configuration database to be a part of the server farm. This may facilitate the performance of operations on the server farm that would be complicated by the presence of a server that was continually offline (since standby server device  would not be online until after a changeover). The standby server device  may include electronic storage , one or more processors , and\/or other components.","Electronic storage  may comprise electronic storage media that electronically stores information. The electronic storage media of electronic storage  may include one or both of system storage that is provided integrally (i.e., substantially non-removable) with standby server device  and\/or removable storage that is removably connectable to standby server device  via, for example, a port (e.g., a USB port, a firewire port, etc.) or a drive (e.g., a disk drive, etc.).

Although processor  is shown in  as a single entity, this is for illustrative purposes only. In some implementations, processor  may include a plurality of processing units.","As is shown in , processor  may be configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The one or more computer program modules may include a server application module , a monitor module , an information transfer module , a server replacement module , a changeover coordination module , a configuration management module , and\/or other modules. Processor  may be configured to execute modules , , , , , and\/or  by software; hardware; firmware; some combination of software, hardware, and\/or firmware; and\/or other mechanisms for configuring processing capabilities on processor .","The description of the functionality provided by the different modules , , , , , and\/or  described below is for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to be limiting, as any of modules , , , , , and\/or  may provide more or less functionality than is described. For example, one of modules , , , , , and\/or  may be eliminated, and\/or some or all of its functionality may be provided by other ones of modules , , , , , and\/or . As another example, processor  may be configured to execute one or more additional modules that may perform some or all of the functionality attributed below to one of modules , , , , , and\/or .","The server application module  may be substantially the same as server application modules , , and\/or . As such, server application module  may be configured to function as a backup for the server application services provided by the server farm. This many-to-one backup configuration in which the single standby server device  backs up all of the servers in the server farm may be an enhancement over conventional systems in which individual ones of first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server  are backed up by separate standby servers. For example, the replica\/standby auto-configuration procedures used for each individual server in a farm in conventional systems are not necessary. As another example, the use of standby server device  as the sole standby server device makes backup and high availability less costly from a hardware standpoint.","The monitor module  may be configured to determine whether a changeover of the server farm should be initiated. The monitor module  may determine whether a changeover should be initiated based on user input and\/or by monitoring operation of the servers in the server farm (e.g., first production server , second production server , and third production server ). The user input may include a user command or selection to initiate a switchover. Monitoring operation of the servers in the server farm may include communicating information to and\/or from the servers (e.g., requests for operational information, operational information, requests for status information, status information, and\/or other information) via the application programming interfaces of one or more of first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server . A determination that a changeover should be initiated made by monitoring operation of the server farm may include a determination to initiate a failover based on an observed disruption in operation in one or more of first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server . An observed disruption in operation may include a timed out operation, a disruption in communication, the failure of some application service, unavailability of some application function, and\/or other disruptions.","The information transfer module  may be configured to effect the transfer of information stored in electronic storage , , and\/or  associated with first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server , respectively, to electronic storage  associated with standby server device . This transfer of information may be initiated by information transfer module  responsive to a determination by monitor module  that a changeover should be initiated. The information transferred may include one or more of the configuration database, the files associated with the central administration database, information being served by the server farm to client computing platforms , and\/or other information. Effecting the transfer of information may include transmitting requests for information to and\/or receiving information from server application module , server application module , and\/or server application module  via their application programming interfaces.","The server replacement module  may be configured to replace first production server , second production server , and third production server  in the server farm with standby server device . This may include replacing first production server , second production server , and third production server  with standby server device  in the information transferred to electronic storage . For example, first production server , second production server , and third production server  may be replaced with standby server device  in the configuration database so that calls to functions or services previously provided by first production server , second production server , and\/or third production server  will subsequently return standby server device .","The changeover coordination module  may be configured to initiate startup, on server application module , of the server application services provided by server application module , server application module , and server application module  subsequent to changeover. The changeover coordination module  may be configured to coordinate the order in which startup is initiated to ensure ongoing operation of standby server device . This may include first initiating startup of services that are depended upon by other services before initiating startup of the dependent services. For example, changeover coordination module  may be configured to initiate startup of the database service and\/or the central administration service before initiating startup of other server application services. This may bring the configuration database and the central administration website online before the other server applications come online.","The consolidation of the server application services from the server farm including a plurality of servers (e.g., first production server , second production server , and third production server ) to the single standby server device  may make some of the roles or services superfluous, or redundant. For example, if third production server  includes two or more server devices providing the web front-end service, the server farm may require a load balancing function to balance the loads between the two or more server devices. After changeover to the single standby server device , load balancing becomes redundant. As another example, roles that are similar, such as a search service composed of the index service and the query service. Since after changeover, the standby server device  may provided both the index service and the query service, the search service may become redundant. Other examples exist.","The configuration management module  may be configured to adjust the settings and\/or configuration database of the server farm during or after changeover to reduce or eliminate this redundancy. This may involve scanning the configuration database and\/or the central administration website to identify instances of redundancy. The identified instances of redundancy may then be addressed by deleting information, adjusting information, adjusting control settings, and\/or performing other adjustments. The configuration management module  may be configured to perform this functionality after the database service and the central administration service are brought online on standby server device . The configuration management module  may be configured to perform this functional before other server application services are brought online on standby server device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["62","62","62","62"]},"In some embodiments, method  may be implemented in one or more processing devices (e.g., a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit designed to process information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a state machine, and\/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information). The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices executing some or all of the operations of method  in response to instructions stored electronically on an electronic storage medium. The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices configured through hardware, firmware, and\/or software to be specifically designed for execution of one or more of the operations of method .","At an operation , a determination may be made as to whether a changeover of the server farm should be initiated. The determination may be made based on user inputs or commands, and\/or based on monitoring of the operation of the server farm. Responsive to a determination that a changeover of the server farm should be initiated, method  may proceed to an operation . Responsive to a determination that a changeover of the server farm should not be initiated, method  may loop back over operation . In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a monitor module similar to or the same as monitor module  (shown in  and described above).","At operation , information stored in electronic storage associated with the server farm may be transferred to electronic storage associated with the single standby server device. Such information may include, for example, a configuration database of the server farm, a central administration website, information related to server application services being served by the server farm, and\/or other information. The transfer of the information may include generation of one or more requests for information from the single standby server device, and\/or reception of the information at the standby server device. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a information transfer module similar to or the same as information transfer module  (shown in  and described above).","At an operation , startup of one or more of the server application services previously served by the server farm may be initiated on the standby server device. The order in which startups of server applications are initiated may be managed according to a predetermined order. For example, startup of a database service may be first be initiated at operation . This may bring the configuration database online. Subsequent to startup of the configuration database, startup of a central administration service may be initiated. Startup of the central administration service may result in the central administration website being brought online. Subsequent to startup of the central administration service, startups of other server application services may be initiated. The order in which startups at least some of the services are initiated may be in accordance with a predetermined order. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a changeover coordination module similar to or the same as changeover coordination module  (shown in  and described above).","Responsive to startup of the database service, the servers of the server farm may be replaced by the standby server device at an operation . This may include replacing the servers of the server farm in the configuration database with the single standby server device. In some implementations, operation  may be performed by a server replacement module similar to or the same as server replacement module  (shown in  and described above).","At an operation , the configuration database may be adjusted to consolidate server roles that become redundant during changeover from the plurality of servers in the server farm to the single standby server device.
