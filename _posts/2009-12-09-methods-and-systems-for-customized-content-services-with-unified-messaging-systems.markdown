title: Methods and systems for customized content services with unified messaging systems
abstract: Profile information and other information about users are received from information sources into a unified messaging platform. Multimedia messages and files for users are converted to text using approximation algorithms. Text and multimedia messages and files for users are analyzed using confidence scores and thresholds. Profile information, file keyword information and message keyword information are used to identify and transmit a limited amount of information about users to information consumers and content service providers. Information consumers and content service providers can customize their content that is presented to users.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates to unified messaging systems and, in particular, methods and systems for customized content services.","Communications over the Internet and other networks are implemented under different messaging techniques. The different messaging techniques include email, smart messaging service (SMS), facsimile (FAX), voicemail, video messaging, and other formats, and each messaging technique may involve a dedicated storage system. Integration of the messaging techniques for storage, retrieval and management by a single messaging device such as a unified messaging (UM) platform poses advantages and efficiencies. Some messaging solutions (e.g., the \u201cGoogle Voice\u201d product) can support audio transcriptions and may be used along with search engines, etc. There are advantages for such messaging devices to consume and\/or provide information about their subscribers from and to other systems. Such advantages include providing better targeted advertising and content services. However, efficient techniques for sharing relevant and concise information among such platforms, devices and systems are needed to improve delivery of targeted content to users. Information that is stored in unified messaging platforms for users can be in the form of text, facsimile, audio, video, etc. Such information, in its original form, cannot be shared with information consumers and content service providers.","Systems, methods, and computer readable products in accordance with the present invention are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.","In one embodiment, a selection of profile information, text information, and multimedia information for users is received. Multimedia information is converted to text information. Confidence scores and thresholds are used to select keywords about the users.","Many other features and embodiments of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the following detailed description.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the description. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the description.

In one embodiment, UM platform  may search the texts of the emails, other text-based messages, and any text files that may be in the users' -mailboxes. Additionally or alternatively, in another embodiment, UM platform  can apply text-conversion programs to other messages and\/or files in the users' -mailboxes to collect textual information about such users -. Examples of conversion programs include character recognition (CR) programs that may be applied to facsimile messages and files, as well as speech-to-text (STT) programs that can be applied to audio portions of multimedia messages and files. In at least one embodiment, UM platform  can use such information that the UM platform  can collect about users -, and\/or information that the UM platform  may receive from information sources -to customize the service that it renders to its users -. In at least another embodiment, UM platform  can use the source information (e.g., caller's phone number, caller's area code, caller's country code, email sender's domain part of email address, facsimile senders' phone numbers, facsimile senders' area codes, facsimile senders' country codes, etc.) from the messages that it receives to determine additional information of interest about its users -. In at least another embodiment, UM platform  can send data to information consumers -and\/or content service providers -based on such information that the UM platform  can collect about users -, and\/or information that the UM platform  may receive from information sources -. Information consumers -and content service providers -may use such received information to improve their knowledge about users -. In at least another embodiment, UM platform  may use the information that it collects about its users -to render its own advertising to users -(e.g., in exchange for free messaging service or reduced-cost messaging service) over any of its interfaces, such as telephone user interface, internet browser interface, smart phone application clients, etc.","The information sources -provide information to the UM platform  about users -. Such information may include, but not be limited to, any or all of the following: information retrieval patterns (e.g., time of day statistics for content retrieval, nature of the content that is retrieved, etc.), information usage patterns (e.g., specific services that are used (e.g., email, searches, VOD downloads, remote device management, etc.), demographics (e.g., age, location, race, gender, etc.), and locations (current, previous, historical, etc.)). Examples of information sources -can include (without limitation and among others) the AT&T U-verse service, AT&T U-verse portal servers, AT&T mobility wireless servers, search engine servers, etc. UM platform  may use the information that it receives from information sources -to render its own advertising to users -(e.g., in exchange for free messaging service or reduced-cost messaging service) over any of its interfaces, such as telephone user interface, internet browser interface, smart phone application clients, etc.","Information consumers -receive from the UM platform  information that may be useful to them and\/or their partners. Examples of information consumers -include, but are not limited to, AT&T wireless servers, mobile browser servers, WiFi hot-spot gateways and\/or servers, IP TV VOD listing servers, IP TV ad-insertion servers, the AT&T U-verse portal, AT&T mobility text messaging servers, security audit servers, etc. Information consumers -may inquire from UM platform  specific information about users -and\/or all users, periodically and\/or at specific times. Such information transmissions from the UM platform  to information consumers -may be on-demand from information consumers -and\/or periodically. Information consumers -may use such information from the UM platform  to prioritize and customize content that they may deliver to their users -. Information consumers -can use any statistical algorithms to rank their information for their services to users -, based on the information they receive from UM platform .","Content service providers -provide to users -content such as, but not limited to, IP TV program listings, IP TV programming, VOD programming, VOD listings, dynamic advertising insertion into TV programming advertising time slots, multimedia user interfaces (e.g., video phone, computer-based IP phone service, etc.), etc. Content service providers -receive from the UM platform  information that may be useful to them and\/or their partner services. Content service providers -may inquire from UM platform  specific information about users -and\/or all users, periodically and\/or at specific times. Such information transmissions from the UM platform  to content service providers -may be on-demand from content service providers -and\/or periodically. Content service providers -may use such information from the UM platform  to prioritize and customize content that they may deliver to their users -. For example, an IP TV ad insertion engine may prioritize tourism and travel advertisements about Europe over its other advertisements for a user -, who receives most of his voicemails from Germany and\/or emails from an organization in Switzerland. As another example, a content service provider -VOD server may rearrange (e.g., reorder) its display of available downloads to emphasize recorded football play-off games, if the UM platform  has detected the word football in recorded voicemails during the last 3 hours. Content service providers -can use any statistical algorithms to rank their information for their services to users -, based on the information they receive from UM platform . For example, in one embodiment, an IP TV content service provider -may rearrange the most likely programs to be displayed in its featured program listings to users -by using the keywords that it receives from UM platform  and the information that it may have about its complete list of available programs. In another embodiment, a content service provider -may rearrange the list of commercials to be displayed to one or more users -by using the keywords that it receives from UM platform .","Information sources -, information consumers -, and content service providers -may be provided by the same or different organizations in any combination. For example, an information source may belong to and\/or be managed by organization O, whereas information consumer may belong to and\/or be managed by organization O, and content service provider may belong to and\/or be managed by an organization O, where O, O and O may be anywhere from one to three different organizations. Letters in the information source -, information consumer -, content service provider -and users -are used to indicate multiplicities of numbers, and such numbers do not have to be the same. For example, there can be two information sources -, five information consumers -, one content service provider -, and millions of users -. Users -may be fixed-location users and mobile users.","In one embodiment, the UM platform  provides sophisticated backward-compatible changes to the existing architecture of the UM platform  to provide tangibly attractive and financially rewarding new revenue streams to the UM platform  by providing services for information consumers -and\/or content service providers -. The UM platform  can provide significant convergent \u201csearch-engine\u201d-like multimedia services to information source -and content service provider -with respect to fixed and mobile users -","In one embodiment, an API of the UM platform  may be designed to allow suppliers of advertisements to pay the UM platform  to provide and insert any type of advertisement (e.g., sound, visual, multimedia, interactive, static, etc.) in messages retrieved by users -during, or contemporaneous with, message retrieval by the users -. In one embodiment, the advertisements may include rebate offers, incentives, cash back information, coupons, or any other kind of promotional information. The suppliers of advertisements may be any company or entity that desires to display or otherwise publish advertising. In one embodiment, the suppliers of advertisements may include advertisers that offer goods or services. In one embodiment, the suppliers of advertisements may include the information sources -","In one embodiment, an API of the UM platform  may be designed to allow the client applications such as information source -to specify or otherwise provide profile information to the UM platform , such as, for example, categories of interest areas, keywords of interest, and\/or demographical information. The UM platform  may analyze the profile information to create a profile for the users -and to select an advertisement or advertisements to publish to the users -","An information consumer -can receive one or more word sets and subscriber (user -) profile information from the UM platform . Upon receiving each such word set and optional subscriber profile parameters, an information consumer -can customize the content that it presents to each user -. Such customizations can include, but are not limited to, rearranging the presentations of currently available VOD programming, future available VOD programming, advertisements to be inserted using one or more ad-server engines for IP TV platforms (not shown), advertisements to be inserted using one or more application servers for web browser interfaces, and\/or advertisements to be inserted using one or more application servers for mobile devices such as mobile PDAs.","The UM platform  can also render advertising messages to its users -, who may access messages in the UM platform  using one or more interfaces such as one or more subscriber web browser interfaces (SBIs), telephone user interfaces, stationary phone applications (such as Voice Over IP softphones) and other applications (such as applications on smart mobile phones). In one embodiment, presentation layers of the UM platform , such as the SBI and the TUI, may be designed to consult a class of service (COS) profile of each user -(which can be influenced by the information sources -using one or more APIs of the UM platform , if administratively allowed). The presentation layers of the UM platform  may present or otherwise publish advertisements to users, as appropriate. For example, a user may agree to listen to one advertisement per phone-in (when the user retrieves messages) in exchange for free service or lower-priced service. The supplier of the advertisement may be separately charged by the UM platform  for the advertisement per a service agreement. As another example, sponsored advertisements may be invoked (clicked) in the SBI portal, and the supplier of the advertisement may be charged accordingly. As another example, any contact with the supplier of the advertisement, or the occurrence of a transaction with the supplier of the advertisement, may result in a charge to the supplier. It will be appreciated that the UM platform  may generate advertising-related revenues in a variety of manners. In one embodiment, a folder structure of the UM platform  may be designed to include a \u201cfree-ad\u201d folder for each user.","In one embodiment, the UM platform  may use one or more central subscription profiles of users -(e.g., by using the Member Account Manager in the U-verse platform, and\/or the Home Subscriber System (HSS) in Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem, etc.), and its own subscriber information to influence ranking and weighing of categories of interest of the user -to select appropriate advertisements for the user -. In one embodiment, a weighing or ranking algorithm can be provided to the UM platform  by the client applications such as the information source -",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","300","102","200","102","102","102","104","108","112","108","112","102","110","104","102","108","112","110","102","104","108","112","102","102","102","110","102","108","112","102","108","112","102","108","112","102"],"i":["a","n","a","k","a","p","a","k","a","p ","a","u","a","n ","a","k ","a","p ","a","u ","a","n","a","k","a","p ","a","u ","a","k ","a","p","a","k ","a","p ","a","k ","a","p "]},"UM platform  may use a variety of mechanisms to determine keywords of interest to transfer to information consumers -and\/or content service providers -. In one embodiment, UM platform  can be configured with at least one of the following information about its users -, information consumers -and content service providers -: one or more character recognition (CR) thresholds (CR_Ts), one or more speech-to-text (STT) thresholds (STT_Ts), preferred language(s) of the primary and secondary (if any) mailbox(es) associated with the mailboxes of such users -, maximum number of keywords for each user -to be sent to an information consumer or content service provider , and a list of words of interest for each information consumer -and\/or content service provider -. Such information can be configured into UM platform  using one or more APIs and\/or interactive applications (not shown). UM platform  may also receive presence information from a presence server (not shown) to determine the current location of each such user -. In at least one embodiment, the UM platform  may also use the Home Subscriber Service (HSS) (not shown) and\/or other repositories of user information (not shown) to collect data in order to rank keywords of interest for each user -. In at least one additional or alternative embodiment, the UM platform  may transmit other parameters of interest such as current location information (derived from a presence server that is not shown), zero or more elements of the subscribers' profiles such as preferred languages (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.) for the subscribers' primary and secondary mailboxes (if any), etc. to zero or more information consumers -and\/or content service providers -. Collectively, such data are referred to as additional subscriber parameters herein. In at least one embodiment, UM platform  can use an STT service to create text transcriptions of one or more multimedia messages or files for its users -. Multimedia messages may include audio components of voicemail messages, audio components of video-mail messages, and\/or multimedia files that the user -may receive and\/or store on the UM platform . In at least another alternative or additional embodiment, UM platform  can use a CR mechanism to create text representations of one or more facsimile documents in each mailbox of users -. Facsimile, audio, video, text and other documents may be stored in mailboxes of users -as files and\/or attachments to messages. UM platform  can use method  to transmit information about users -to zero or more information consumers -and\/or content service providers -. Method  can be used to identify relevant keywords, based on precise text and approximated multimedia and facsimile content, and send limited numbers of them to information consumers -and\/or content service providers -about users -","Method  starts in step , and may be executed separately for each user -. In step , UM platform  determines whether it has received a new file or message for a user -. If no such message or file has been received, method returns to step  where it awaits arrivals of new messages and\/or files. If UM platform  has received a message for a user -, the method moves to step , where UM platform  determines whether the contents of the message or file are only in text format. Examples of such information include text documents such as word processing documents, email messages, text messages, etc. If the received message or file is in text format, the method proceeds to step . If UM platform  receives a file or message that is not in text format or also has one or more non-text (e.g., audio, video and\/or facsimile components), the method proceeds to step . In step , UM platform  can apply to one or more conversion algorithms to convert the message or file contents to text format. Such conversions are typically based on approximation and estimation algorithms, and are often not precise. Therefore, beneficial methods must be devised to use the converted information. For example, an STT function can be applied to the audio portion of a multimedia message or file that UM platform  has received for the user -. UM platform  may also apply one or more CR algorithms to facsimile messages that it receives for users -. The text information that is generated in step  may include a separate series of characters, where each such continuous string can have a confidence score between 1 and 100 assigned to it. For example, a \u201c,\u201d (comma) character may be associated with a confidence score of 30, and a contiguous string sequence \u201cdoor\u201d may be represented as a word with a confidence score of 70. The method then proceeds to step . In step , UM platform  can use an appropriate threshold such as an STT_T or a CR_T to discard words whose confidence scores are below desirable threshold values. In at least one embodiment, UM platform  may use the same STT_T and CR_T values for all of the information consumers -and content service providers -. In at least another embodiment, UM platform  may use separate STT_T and CR_T values for each of the information consumers -and content service providers -. The method then proceeds to step . In step , UM platform  includes the words that are above the appropriate threshold to a raw histogram data set for a user -. A raw histogram is simply a list of words that are found for a user -from text information or using conversion schemes (e.g., using STT and\/or CR schemes) along with the number of times that each such word has been found for that user -. In at least one embodiment, UM platform  in step  also stores in the raw histogram an individual confidence score for each occurrence of such words. In at least one other embodiment, UM platform  in step  only stores in the raw histogram the count of the number of times that each word has been encountered and not discarded in a prior step. The method proceeds to step . If there are additional text words in the message or file (e.g., in the body of an email whose multimedia attachment file was analyzed in prior steps  to ), UM platform  can include such words with appropriate confidence scores (e.g., with confidence score of 100 for each such word) in the raw histogram data for user -. In at least one embodiment, punctuation marks are not stored in the raw histogram. The method then proceeds to step . Also, if no additional words were found in step , the method would proceed from step  to step . In step , UM platform  can create a customized refined histogram for user -for one or more information consumers -and\/or content service providers -. In at least one embodiment, the refinement procedure may involve selecting only those words of interest from a list that an information consumer -or content service provider -has previously specified to UM platform  for a specific user -. In at least one other alternative embodiment, the refinement procedure may involve selecting only those words of interest from a list that an information consumer -or content service provider -has previously specified to UM platform  for all users -. In at least one other alternative or additional embodiment, the refinement procedure may include sorting the words in the raw histogram data based on the frequencies of occurrences of such words in the mailbox of a user -. The method then proceeds to step . In step , UM platform  selects an appropriate word set and sends this (these) word set(s) to each information consumer -and\/or content service provider -that is to receive such information. In at least one embodiment, the numbers (zero or more) of such words are specified by the information consumer -and\/or content service provider -for each individual user -. In at least one alternative embodiment, the numbers (one or more) of such words are specified by the information consumer -and\/or content service provider -for all users -. UM platform  sends the selected words for user -to each information consumer -and\/or content service provider -, as appropriate. The method then proceeds to step , where it can process additional messages and\/or files. If one or more content, file or attachment were found previously and had not yet been processed in the other steps of method , each one is processed just like new messages and files starting in step .","Information consumers -and content service providers -can use the keyword information that they receive from UM platform  to deliver customized and beneficial information to users -using any of the convergent services such as customized IP TV program listings, customized IP TV VOD listings, computer interfaces (e.g., using web servers) and telephone user interfaces. Some such information content that is delivered to users -may be in the form of customized advertisements. For example, one or more ad-insertion servers (not shown) may insert such customized advertisements. Users -may use any of the various convergent (e.g., internet web browsing, TV, phone, etc.) services with contents that are customized for them.","In one embodiment, a user receives more targeted and favorable content when retrieving messages through convergent presentation services.","In one embodiment, users may observe more relevant and targeted content based on information from the UM platform . The UM platform  may provide \u201csearch engine\u201d-like services using convergent communication platforms. The UM platform  may be useful to a wide array of customers such as small businesses and mass market customers. The UM platform  may encourage users (e.g., small business and consumers) to use the UM platform  for free or reduced fees in exchange for some advertising services. The UM platform  provides additional convergence among the various information source -, information consumer -and content service provider -applications.","In one embodiment, the services provided by the UM platform  may be hosted, licensed, or sold.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","330","340","350","360","370","300","310","320","330","340"]},"In one embodiment, the routines, steps, and functional blocks executed to implement the embodiments of the disclosure and all of the aforementioned features of the present invention may be variously implemented as computer modules , , , .
