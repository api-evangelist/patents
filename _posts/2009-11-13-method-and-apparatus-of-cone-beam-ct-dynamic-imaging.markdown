title: Method and apparatus of cone beam CT dynamic imaging
abstract: A cone-beam scanning system scans along a half circle. The reconstruction uses a weighting function which decreases for rows farther from the scan plane to take the redundancy of the projection data into account. Another embodiment uses a circle plus sparse helical scan geometry. Image data can be taken in real time.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/711,155, filed Feb. 27, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,643,605, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/776,666, filed Feb. 27, 2006. The disclosures of those applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties into the present disclosure.","The work leading up to the present invention was supported by NIH Grants 8 R01 EB002775, R01 9 HL078181, and 4 R33 CA94300. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to imaging and more specifically to a half-scan imaging technique using a weighting function to increase temporal resolution.","The use of the half-scan method in cone beam CT has been a hot topic in recent years owing to the resultant improvement in temporal resolution. There are currently several different types of cone beam half-scan schemes, such as FDK-based, cone beam filtered-backprojection-based (CBFBP), and Grangeat-based. Each scheme uses planar scanning trajectories (circular or non-circular) to conduct the half-scan scheme. Theoretically, a circular half scan can acquire approximately the same information in the radon domain as a circular full-scan in terms of the first derivative radial data, as long as the reconstructed object is within a certain size based on the derivation of the Grangeat formula. Even in the circular half-scanning range, redundancy still exists. The Grangeat-type half-scan (GHS) maps the spatial projection data into the first derivative radial data and weights them in the radon domain. After adding missing data through linear interpolation\/extrapolation in the shadow zone of the radon domain where a circular scan can't access, a 3-D radon inverse formula is used to get the reconstructed image.","Current FDK-type half-scan (FDKHSFW) schemes for cone beam CT use Parker's or other weighting coefficients based on fan beam geometry where same weighting coefficients are applied to all detector rows. The CBFBP algorithm manipulates the redundant projection data in the radon domain, does the half-scan reconstruction in the structure of filtered backprojection (FBP) and achieves almost the same performance as FDKHSFW. The Grangeat-type half-scan scheme outperforms the FDK-type half-scan scheme in the correction of the off-scanning plane attenuation coefficient drop when the shadow zone is filled with the linear interpolated data. However, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images from GHS is inferior to that of FDKHSFW because data interpolation is less involved in FDK than in GHS. Furthermore, GHS cannot handle the truncated data in the longitudinal direction. The CBFBP-related half-scan and FDKHSFW showed obvious attenuation coefficient drop artifacts in the position of the reconstructed image farthest away from Z=0, where Z is the rotation axis. This artifact is undesirable in practice.","It is an object of the invention to correct the drop problem to a certain degree.","It is another object of the invention to do so while maintaining spatial resolution.","To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention is directed to a FDK half scan scheme with a new weighting function that fits the cone beam geometry (FDKHSCW) where the weighting function is cone beam geometry dependent. The FDK half-scan algorithm with the new cone beam weighting function is described. A computer simulation has been conducted, and the FDKHSCW has been evaluated in comparison to FDKFS and FDKHSFW.","A new cone beam weighting scheme has been heuristically proposed for the FDK-based circular half scan reconstruction (FDKHSCW) to correct the density drop artifact to a certain degree along the rotation axis inherited with original FDK algorithm for large cone angle. Computer simulation on the Shepp-Logan phantom with and without noise showed an improvement when using the FDKHSCW over FDKFS and FDKHSFW in terms of the attenuation coefficient drop when the cone angle is large while maintaining the same visual image quality. FDKHSCW needs additional cone-beam weighting before filtering and only uses a scanning range of [\u03b2,180+\u03b2+2\u0394], where \u03b2 the starting projection angle of the x-ray, and \u0394 is half of the full fan angle; both of them are defined in the scanning plane. As soon as the starting angle is determined, each projection image can be processed (cone-beam weighting for half scan, pixel weighting inherited by FDK, and filtering). So, it will take less time to reconstruct an object in comparison to the full scan scheme, a very desirable feature in practice. Here the half scan is defined as 180\u00b0 plus cone angle of the scan geometry. In addition, the half-scan scheme provides a flexibility to choose any starting point for reconstruction as long as the scanning range is guaranteed, another preferable feature for cone beam CT dynamic imaging. If a full circle scan is performed, to increase temporal resolution of the system and cone beam CT reconstruction, a multiple of half scan reconstructions can be performed from the full circle scan by choosing the different starting point. Therefore it is another objective of the invention that using the half scan algorithm to reconstruct a multiple of half scan reconstructions from a circle or multiple circle scan projection images of an object to increase temporal resolution for cone beam CT dynamic imaging scan.","Based on the idea proposed by Silver (M. D. Silver, \u201cA method for including redundant data in computed tomography,\u201d 27, 773-774 (2000)), we can even conduct an extended half-scan scheme by making the scanning range larger than 180+2\u0394 applying this new cone beam weighting function for better noise characteristic.","The circular cone-beam half-scan weighting scheme works better for low contrast objects. We can see from our simulation on Shepp-Logan phantom that the largest compensation is within 0.03 in terms of attenuation coefficient. We expect that FDKHSCW can show improvement in terms of intensity drop in high-contrast phantoms, like a Defrise disk phantom. Yet it is more promising with low-contrast phantoms.","Other proposed modified FDK methods called T-FDK and FDK-SLANT, also corrected the attenuation coefficient drop to some extent along the rotation axis inherited in FDK with a larger cone angle. There is a difference between these methods and FDKHSCW. Although the results of these methods showed similar correction to FDKHSCW, FDK-SLANT and T-FDK need to be parallel rebinned from cone beam data. That means the filtering portion would not start until the whole set of data acquisition and parallel resorting procedures are completed and then followed by backprojection for image reconstruction. FDKHSCW possess the advantage that once a 2-D projection data is acquired, the filtering portion can start and be immediately followed by backprojection. As long as the gantry speed and readout rate is high enough, this scheme can provide almost real time monitoring when continuous dynamic imaging is conducted. Wang (G. Wang, \u201cX-ray micro-CT with a displaced detector array,\u201d Med. Phys. 29, 1634-1636 (2002)) developed a weighting scheme for cone beam full circular scan reconstruction on a displaced detector array without rebinning the projection data for reconstruction. As for the redundant area, our scheme can be applied to this algorithm by adjusting the weighting conditions in the scanning range.","Recently, a new circular 3-D weighting reconstruction algorithm was proposed to reduce cone beam artifacts based on the investigation on the data inconsistency between a direct ray and its conjugate rays. The basic idea is to have filtered projection data multiplied by correction coefficients that are cone beam geometrically dependent during the backprojection. But the artifact it corrects is not what FDKHSCW tries to correct here, namely attenuation coefficient drop. However, the two schemes can be combined.","In conclusion, by incorporating a new cone beam weighting scheme, a new FDK-based heuristic half-scan approximate algorithm for circular trajectory has been proposed based on a flat panel detector, and the numerical simulation demonstrated its feasibility.","Because both the scanning and the processing of the data can be accomplished in less time, imaging can be accomplished much faster. Thus, scanning in four dimensions (three dimensions of space and one of time) becomes possible.","Related systems and methods are disclosed in the following U.S. Pat.

In a circular fan-beam half-scan, there are two redundant regions in the scanning plane in terms of the projection angle \u03b2.  shows that the projecting ray data acquired in region I will have a conjugate ray data in region II. In these two regions, the projection ray data is wholly or partly redundant.

In the traditional FDK cone-beam half scan scheme, all the row projection data are weighted by the same set of coefficients defined in the scanning plane because the row projection data away from the scanning plane are expected to have the same redundancy as those in the scanning plane.","The proposal of the circular cone-beam half scan weighting scheme is based on the idea that the weighting coefficients should be different for projection data in different rows, and for the row projection data furthest away from the scanning plane, it should be weighted less.

As  show, the position of the x-ray source  is at z=0 cm during the circular scan. After the circular scan, the x-ray source  and detector  lower down simultaneously while they are still rotating. When the x-ray source gets to the point where z=10, it starts to shoot and keeps shooting between the interval \u0394l till it finishes eight shoots in this helical scan. For each shoot during the helical scan, the x-ray source still maintains the same collimation as it does in circular scan. This scheme is called sparse spiral scan. In practice, to efficiently implement sparse spiral scan, the system is required comprises a slip ring on the gantry frame for providing the connection to the electrical power to the on-gantry components and the communication between the two-dimensional detector and the computer system;","The projection angles associated with helical line scan are illustrated by . There are eight shoot points during helical scan which cover the angular range of 4\u03c0, and the movement in Z direction is from 48 mm to 128 mm with the increment interval of 10 mm based on the size of the simulated breast phantom.","Some of the radon data points acquired from this additional scanning trajectory still can be acquired through the circular scan; this is what is called redundancy sampling points in radon domain, and can be efficiently eliminated by the redundant window function (RWF), and the geometric setup of the collimator as during the HL scanning can avoid the redundant sampling radon points between those shooting points on this helical line. Since the collimation during helical line scanning unavoidably induces the longitudinal truncation, a geometric dependent truncation window function (TWF) will be used to handle this case.","Composite reconstruction framework is probably the most preferable algorithm for the CBCTBI.
