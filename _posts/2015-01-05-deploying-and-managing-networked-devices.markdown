The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","This disclosure relates to the field of network-connected devices and more particularly to techniques for deploying and maintaining Internet-connected networked devices. Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to improvements to computing devices and, more specifically, to efficient use of CPUs in various devices.","The present disclosure relates to networked devices, and more particularly to deployment, automatic configuration, identification and access of devices on a network. Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to improvements to networking systems including, but not limited to, networking of consumer devices.","As increasingly more devices (e.g., servers, computers, phones, equipment, appliances, etc.) are connected to the Internet, the need to connect them in a meaningful, fast, secure, and cost-effective way becomes increasingly difficult. Specific scalability challenges related to Domain Name System (DNS) capability and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate deployment are evident. The function of the DNS, carried out by one or more DNS servers, is to associate various information with Internet domain names. More specifically, it translates more easily memorized domain names (e.g., www.example.com) to their associated numerical IP addresses (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6 addresses) needed for the purpose of locating computer services and devices worldwide. DNS servers resolve (e.g., translate to an IP address) a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) in a hierarchical manner, looking first at the top level domain or TLD (e.g., \u201c.com\u201d), then the domain name (e.g., \u201cexample\u201d), and then the sub domain (e.g., \u201cwww\u201d). More sub domains (e.g., a second sub domain, a third sub domain) can be included in the URL (e.g., m.www.example.com), limited by a maximum of 123 levels, and a maximum of 253 characters for the entire domain name.","An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a web site, application, or device and encrypts exchanged information (e.g., 256-bit encryption) using SSL technology. SSL certificates can secure a single domain name with a single domain certificate (e.g., www.example.com), secure multiple domain names with a multi-name certificate (e.g., both www.example.com and mail.example.com), and secure multiple subdomains of a domain with a wildcard certificate, for example, (e.g., *.example.com). There is an annual cost (e.g., USD $150-$300) and setup resources required (e.g., for generating the CSR, private key, renewal, etc.) when deploying wildcard certificates.","Legacy DNS capability in consideration of SSL certificate limitations presents challenges to secure and cost-effective Internet device scalability. In particular, the handling of wildcards in both the DNS and SSL certificates impacts scalability. For example, legacy DNS capability (e.g., as outlined in Network Working Group RFC 4592, and RFC 1034 sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3) will only accept wildcards in the left-most subdomain (e.g., *.example.com). To have multiple subdomains translate to two different servers (e.g., servers s and s to manage resource loading), multiple wildcard DNS records unique to each server (e.g., *.s1.example.com and *.s2.example.com) are required. Likewise, a wildcard SSL certificate can only serve one subdomain level (e.g., *.s1.example.com), so a separate certificate for each server would be required, given the aforementioned DNS addressing limitation. The restrictions of these legacy protocols and systems therefore limit the scaling of devices on the Internet (e.g., adding servers, subdomains, etc.) in a secure and cost-effective manner (e.g., minimizing the deployment of SSL certificates, managing server loading).","Furthermore, legacy networking environments and systems often include a web server (e.g., Apache web server) that receives mapping directives such as:","ProxyPass\/foo\/http:\/\/s1.example.com\/","This directive, for example, will direct a request for \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\/foo\/device1\u201d to be mapped into a proxy request to \u201chttp:\/\/s1.example.com\/device1\u201d. This mapping can, for example, direct a user request to host server at \u201cexample.com\u201d for connection to \u201cdevice1\u201d to be redirected to a remote server at \u201cs1.example.com\u201d associated with (e.g., physically co-located with) \u201cdevice1\u201d to complete the connection. Similarly, the reverse mapping, ProxyPassReverse\/foo\/http:\/\/s1.example.com\/\n\nconverts or maps, for example, \u201chttp:\/\/s1.example.com\/device1\u201d back to \u201chttp:\/\/example.com\/foo\/device1\u201d before forwarding the response from the server at \u201cs1.example.com\u201d back to the user. From the user or client side, the request satisfied by the server at \u201cs1.example.com\u201d appears to have been satisfied by \u201cexample.com\u201d.\n","While the aforementioned legacy structure (e.g., syntax and semantics) for proxy server mapping provides some simplification of addressing multiple network servers and devices, the structure has limits to scaling of devices on the Internet (e.g., adding devices, servers, subdomains, etc.) in a flexible and efficient manner. Techniques are needed to address the problem of flexibly and efficiently mapping to a large number of devices connected to the Internet using domain names.","The above scenario is further complicated by the fact that many sorts of devices can be connected via the Internet. However, applications pertaining to certain types of connected devices rely on characteristics of the connected network that can be set up during the course of installation and configuration. Legacy installation and configuration fails to account for the specifics of certain connected devices, and in some cases, legacy installation and configuration relies on pre-existing network component configurations that may not fully serve the needs of the aforementioned connected devices. Further, techniques are needed to address the problem of deployment and ongoing management of internet connected devices. The hereinabove problems with deployment are exacerbated since Device deployers and manufacturers need a way to identify deployed devices to the Internet in a way that provides security and authentication. Legacy techniques as are used by applications such as Dropbox and YouTube have offered developers app identification codes (\u201cid's\u201d) and\/or shared keys that were typically embedded in the app or device. Unfortunately, legacy use of such keys did not include security such as authentication and encryption. Implementation of security was left up to the user. In many cases, identification codes (\u201cid's\u201d) and\/or shared keys and were often left open in plain text (e.g., unencrypted), and accessible in plain text at or from the device, and\/or embedded in plain text in various components of the application (e.g., in plain text embedded in the binary modules of the application).","Techniques are needed to address the security problems that developers and manufactures face, namely how to identify their deployed devices to Internet edge services in a way that provides a specified level of security and authentication. Security and authentication becomes increasingly more important as increasingly more devices (e.g., servers, computers, phones, equipment, cameras, appliances, etc.) are connected to the Internet. The need to connect them in a meaningful, fast, secure, and cost-effective way becomes increasingly difficult. Specific scalability challenges related to managing the messaging between devices are evident.","There are legacy approaches that enable inter-device communication (e.g., between a home security camera and a homeowner's smartphone). However, these legacy techniques are not well suited to quickly and cost-effectively enable communications from a large number of devices (e.g., all security cameras of a multi-national corporation). Specific challenges arise in balancing the connection and messaging load on the communication system servers. Techniques are therefore needed to address the problem of cost-effectively scaling the communications with an increasing number of devices connected to the Internet.","None of the aforementioned legacy approaches achieve the capabilities of the herein-disclosed techniques for deploying and maintaining Internet-connected networked devices. There is a need for improvements.","The present disclosure provides an improved method, system, and computer program product suited to address the aforementioned issues with legacy approaches. More specifically, the present disclosure provides a detailed description of techniques used in methods, systems, and computer program products for deploying and maintaining Internet-connected networked devices. The claimed embodiments address the problem of deploying and managing Internet-connected devices.

A protocol  depicts operations and communications on and among user device , DNS server , first host server , second host server , first target device , and second target device . Specifically, protocol  represents the key activities required in legacy DNS and SSL protocols and systems to establish secure connections with first target device  and second target device  through multiple separate servers, first host server  and second host server , respectively.","In protocol , devices are initialized, deployed, brought-inline and managed over a lifecycle. Many variations of the environment  and\/or any of its constituent components are shown and described in the disclosure herein. Moreover, the architecture of the components and\/or interconnection between components may vary. As one specific example, the following figure illustrates a network architecture according to a particular embodiment that provides interconnection between and\/or through (1) a telecommunications network, (2) a local area network (LAN), (3) a wireless network, and (4) a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet.","A master device  plans a swarm deployment.

For example, a server computer (e.g., data server Y-) and a client computer (e.g., an end user computer Y-) may be coupled to the network Y- for communication purposes. Such end user computer Y- may include a desktop computer, lap-top computer, and\/or any other type of logic. Further, each of these computers can host independent virtual computers or services, which may operate as independent capabilities, each uniquely connected to the network. Still yet, various other devices may be coupled to the network Y-, including a personal digital assistant (PDA) device Y-, a mobile telephone device Y-, a television Y-, a networked camera Y-, an irrigation controller Y-, a network router Y-, a media server, Y-, etc. Additionally, devices may be coupled to the network via a separate network.

See operation Y-. Additionally, the device is automatically configured. See operation Y-.","In the context of the present description, a device refers to any device capable of being connected to a network. For example, in various embodiments, the device may include, but is not limited to, a PDA, a mobile phone, a television, a camera, an irrigation controller, a network router, a media server, a computer, and\/or any other device that meets the above definition.","Furthermore, the configuration of the device may involve any type of configuration.

See operation Y-. In the context of the present description, a unique identifier (e.g., a UNIQUE ID, etc.) refers to any identifier that is unique to the device. For example, in various embodiments, the unique identifier may include, but is not limited to, a Media Access Control (MAC) address, a Universal Product Code (UPC), and\/or any other identifier that meets the above definition.","Strictly as an option, the device may be associated with a Universal Device Locator (UDL). In this case, the UDL may include any term (e.g., familiar term, etc.) capable of being used for identification purposes.

In yet another embodiment, the association of the device to the UDL may be used to establish a direct peer-to-peer network between the device and a remote device associated with the UDL.","Strictly as an option, the device may be configured once the device is identified. See operation Y-. In one embodiment, the device may be automatically configured. In another embodiment, the device may be manually configured.","More illustrative information will now be set forth regarding various optional architectures and features with which the foregoing technique may or may not be implemented, per the desires of the user. It should be strongly noted that the following information is set forth for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting in any manner. Any of the following features may be optionally incorporated with or without the exclusion of other features described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0160"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1","500","1","500","1","500"]},"As shown, a device Y- may be identified using a unique identifier (e.g., UNIQUE ID Y-, or another unique identification form, etc.) associated therewith. The device Y- may include any of the devices described above with respect to  and\/or , and\/or any other device capable of using a network. As shown by way of example, the device Y- may include a camera connected to a network Y-.","The UNIQUE ID Y- may include, for example, a MAC address (and\/or may be derived from a MAC address), a universal product code (UPC) number, and\/or other type of unique identifier capable of guaranteeing the uniqueness of the ID across a plurality of different vendors (e.g., service providers, product providers, etc.). The device Y- may also be associated with a service having a particular Universal Device Locator (UDL) Y-. In various embodiments, the UDL Y- may represent an individual, an entity (e.g., a company, vendor, etc.), etc. Accordingly, the service may be provided by such individual, entity, etc.","As an option, the device Y- may be associated with multiple UDLs Y-, where each of the UDLs Y- represents various individuals or entities (e.g., user, manufacturer, software provider, reseller, etc.). In one embodiment, the device Y- may be associated with the UDL Y- by associating the UNIQUE ID Y- of the device Y- with the UDL Y-. As shown, the UNIQUE ID Y- and the UDL Y- may be associated at a UDL server Y- (e.g., the association may be stored at the UDL server Y-, etc.).","Further, if multiple UDLs Y- are associated with the device Y-, a master UDL may optionally be identified (e.g., predetermined, etc.) that designates particular permissions for each of the UDLs Y- with respect to the device Y-. In another embodiment, each UDL Y- may be designated as having authority over particular capabilities (e.g., functionality, etc.) of the device Y-. By associating the device Y- with at least one UDL Y-, a user (e.g., owner, etc.) associated with the UDL Y- may access the device Y- over the network Y- (e.g., from a location remote from the device, etc.) using the service providing the UDL Y-. Accordingly, remote access to the capabilities of the device Y- may be disabled or severely limited if such association is broken (e.g., the UDL Y- is no longer associated with the device Y-, etc.). As shown, the network Y- may include the Internet, but of course the network Y- may also include any of the networks described above with respect to , or any other suitable network.","In one embodiment, a user may access the device Y- from a remote personal computer (PC) Y- using the association of the UDL Y- and the UNIQUE ID Y-, as shown. For example, the user may login to the service (e.g., the service providing the UDL Y-, etc.) for authenticating the user and for identifying any devices associated therewith. Optionally, the user may login using a UDL Y-. In addition, devices associated with the user's address (e.g., internet protocol (IP) address, etc.) may become accessible. In this way, a direct connection to the device Y- may be made remotely using the association between the UDL Y- and UNIQUE ID Y-.","As a specific example, a user may purchase a home router Y- and configure the router for the user's home Internet connection. The user may also associate the MAC address of the router with an Internet service UDL Y-. For illustrative purposes, the home router Y- may be manufactured by Company A. As the master UDL holder, the user may grant the manufacturer (Company A) permission to provide any updates to the firmware of the router using the UDL Y- associated with the home router Y-. In addition, the user may login anywhere the user has access to an Internet connection and may establish a direct connection with the home router Y- using the associated UDL Y-.","Going further with the example, Company A may determine that it needs to provide a firmware update to the home router Y-. By logging into the Internet service providing the UDL Y-, all devices that have been associated with such UDL Y- may become available and accordingly an automatic update to such devices may be allowed. Optionally, the user may grant the manufacture permission to access the home router Y- on a case-by-case basis, such that Company A may send an alert to the home router Y- for communicating with the user (e.g., the next time that the device owner logged into the service, etc.). The user may then determine whether or not to update the firmware of the home router Y- based on the received alert.","In another exemplary embodiment, the user may be traveling internationally and may receive a call from home that there is a problem with the home Internet connection. In a situation where no one at home is knowledgeable enough to check the home router Y-, the user may login to the Internet service capable of providing direct connection to the home router Y- and may select the user's home router Y-. A browser application may then be launched and a user interface for the home router Y- may be made available to the user for remotely configuring the home router Y- as if the user were accessing the router via the local network. For example, the user may reset the home router Y- and re-establish the Internet connection such that the home Internet connection is repaired.","In another exemplary embodiment, the owner of a network connected video camera Y- may select to make a UDL Y- associated with the camera Y- and any information associated therewith visible and searchable to anyone using the Internet service. For example, the device owner may be going on vacation and may ask another person (e.g., a neighbor, etc.) to monitor camera Y- while the device owner is away. The device owner may provide the other person with the UDL Y- associated with the device Y-.","The neighbor may then login to the Internet service and conduct a search for devices associated with the UDL Y-. Any devices associated with the UDL Y- may be presented and the neighbor may request and receive permission (e.g., temporary permission, permanent permission, etc.) from the device owner to view the network camera Y- over the network Y-. The association of the UNIQUE ID Y-, which in the present embodiment includes the MAC address of the device, with the UDL Y- may therefore allow for searching for and accessing remote devices via UDLs Y-, such that a user attempting to access a remote device need not know or remember the UNIQUE ID Y- of the device Y-, which may be a complex set of numbers that may not be easily remembered.","Furthermore, a browser plug in may be available for the Internet service, such that a user may use the \u201cdevicename@userID\u201d as a UDL Y- to locate the device Y-. In this scenario, the protocol type may be entered along with the UDL Y-, similar to how Internet addresses may be entered. Table 1 illustrates an exemplary UDL Y- associated with a sample Internet Service that may be used for accessing the device Y-.

For example, devices may automatically register when connected to a network and identify their location (e.g., IP address, etc.) to the Internet service. Thus, a purchaser of used goods may request that payment be automatically released upon transfer of the device to the new UDL associated with the purchaser. Thus, a transfer of an association between a device's UNIQUE ID Y- and\/or UDL Y- and a user may be used for triggering a commerce\/commercial transaction. In addition, the association of the UDL Y- and the UNIQUE ID Y- of the device Y- may also provide security for the device Y-, such that unless the UDL Y- is fundamentally modified, the UDL Y- may remain associated with the current owner.","In still yet a further embodiment, the association between the UDL Y- and the UNIQUE ID Y- of the device Y- may also be used by a system integrator, reseller, or manufacturer for configuring the device Y- for a customer. For example, the reseller may take ownership of the device Y- by associating a UDL Y- of the reseller with the device Y- and may further fully configure the device Y- for the customer. The reseller may then transfer ownership to a UDL Y- of the customer upon completing the configuration. This method of pre-configuration could also be used as a mechanism for product registration. In addition, the customer may optionally have the ability to temporarily grant access permission in order to temporarily provide direct access to the device Y-, thus facilitating on-going sessions of technical support.","In one embodiment, the device Y- connected to the network Y- may be automatically identified and, in turn, automatically configured. The automatic identification of un-configured devices may allow for the configuration of such devices on the network Y-. Moreover, such configuration may be performed without knowledge of a local IP address associated with the device Y-, which may be acquired over the network Y- via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). Accordingly, a user may locate and configure the device Y- by simply connecting the device Y- to the network Y- and\/or by connecting to a service provided by a service provider with any other device.","As an option, any un-configured device on the network Y- may be automatically detected, configured, and linked to an account associated with the service. Once configured, a user may be able to reconfigure and update the device by connecting to the service and selecting the device to reconfigure or update. In addition, the service may also allow a connection to the configured device without the knowledge of an Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with the device.","Furthermore, a device class interface (e.g., user interface, etc.) may be configured or changed, thus allowing additional devices to connect and\/or existing devices to be re-configured. For example, configurable information (e.g., attributes, etc.) of the device Y- may be abstracted into an interface associated with the service, or the interface associated with the service may be populated with configurable attributes of the device Y-. A user may be able to configure the device Y- at the homepage of the service provider, and the device Y- may then be updated (e.g., based on user selections, etc.). The communication between the service and device Y- may consist of a protocol that can update configuration and memories of the device Y- at the request of a user or the associated service provider.","In one exemplary embodiment, a system that provides video cameras for monitoring purposes may allow a server associated with a service provider to automatically identify un-configured (e.g., unregistered, etc.) devices. A source IP address used to connect to the server may be detected. When a registered user (e.g., of the service) logs onto the server, a source IP address associated with such user may be logged. This source IP address could be either a static or dynamic, and does not have to remain constant with a user ID. Rather, the IP address for the user and the un-configured device would be associated on a login-session basis.","If an un-configured device is detected from the same source IP address as the logged source IP address, then it may be determined that the un-configured device belongs to the registered user. Specifically, such determination may be made on the basis that the un-configured device corresponds to the same source IP address. In a situation where a router uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to source all connections associated with a network, the device can enter the Auto Identification mode by pressing a button on the device or automatically when the un-configured device powers up, etc.","Automatic identification may therefore allow a user to find and configure the device Y- plugged into the network Y- without having to read complex instructions, change a configuring computer's network settings or install any software on a user computer Y-. The user may simply plug in the device Y- and go to a service homepage, where the device Y- may automatically be displayed such that the user may configure the device Y-. Once initialized to the user (e.g., registered to the user, etc.), the device Y- may be easily configured, updated or controlled from any source by the user through the service. The user could also grant to other users of the service various levels of permission on either a permanent or temporary basis. Such permissions could include monitoring, configuring, reconfiguring or even transfer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0182","num":"0181"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["1","600","1","600","1","600"]},"As shown, an un-configured device may power on and attempt to use an automated network service to acquire a configuration resource from a network server (e.g., a DHCP server, etc.). See operation Y-. Once the resource is acquired, the device may attempt to connect to a service. See operation Y-. If the connection is successful the device may enter a service chat mode (e.g., passive chat mode). See operation Y-. Moreover, the device may await a command from the service provider.","If the device is unable to acquire a network resource from the network server, the device may signify to the user via an indicator that the device has failed to acquire a resource.

The service may then check for any un-configured devices from the users IP address that have contacted the service. See operation Y-. If any un-configured device exists, such device may be displayed to the user. See operation Y-. The same flow would follow for a pre-configured device, where during the discovery phase, the service (e.g., YOICS service) would scan for unregistered devices. Upon discovery of a registered device, where manufacturer and device type may be used as further filters, that device is presented to the user for confirmation. Upon registration by the user, a mechanism could be in place to allow device ownership transfer or simply to provide sharable access.","The user may optionally select to configure the device. If the user selects to configure the device, then the device may be configured as being associated with the user. In this way, the user may be allowed to configure and control the device.","If no un-configured device exists, the user is presented with devices owned by the user and options for configuration and control. See operation Y-. It should be noted that once a device is configured and associated with a service ID, the device may be removed from a network associated with the user and plugged into another network where the associated service ID may still be able to control it.

The service server Y- may store the received information along with a perceived Internet address and communication port for the device\/user (e.g., as determined by the service server Y-). With this information, the service server Y- may determine if it will acknowledge the device (e.g., the camera Y-) of its enrolment (e.g., registered status, etc.) and\/or give the device further instructions.

For example, address mapping may use IPv4 to IPv6 mapping and\/or use private IP addresses on a router. For example, cell phone C may be connected using a router R (e.g., a home router, etc.). Assume router R supports PPCs. For example cell phone C may have a PPC mapped to (e.g., paired with, associated with, linked to, etc.) a first address A (e.g., A may be an IPv4 address such as 10.10.10.99:5959, a loopback address, combinations of these and\/or other addresses, etc.) using a router R. For example, the mapping may be static (e.g., fixed, programmed, set, etc.) or may be dynamic (e.g., configurable, etc.). Thus, for example, when cell phone C uses the first address A (e.g., 10.10.10.99:5959, etc.) the router R may translate (e.g., map, etc.) the address A  to a second address A (e.g., a private address, an IPv6 address, a loopback address, combinations of these and\/or other addresses, etc.) associated with a device D. For example, D may be a security camera, another mobile device, a service, etc. Then, cell phone C may move or otherwise change connection to router R. Assume router R supports PPCs. Cell phone C may use the first address A (e.g., 10.10.10.99:5959) to access D and router R may automatically connect the cell phone C with the security camera D using the second address A.","In one embodiment, more than one device may be mapped. In one embodiment, one address may be translated to multiple devices. For example, two devices D and D may use a first address A (e.g., 10.10.10.99:5959) as their mapping. When a first mobile device, e.g., cell phone C, connects to a first address A, a first router R may translate the first address A to a second address A (the second address A may be associated with a first device D). For example, A and D may belong to a first security camera, etc. When a second mobile device, e.g., cell phone C, connects to the first address A, a second router R may translate the first address A to a third address A (the third address A may be associated with a second device D). For example A and D may belong to a second security camera, etc. Of course R and R may be the same router. Of course any number of devices (e.g., D, D) may be mapped. Of course any number and type of addresses (e.g., A) may be mapped. The translation of addresses (e.g., A to A) may be fixed (e.g., programmed, etc.) or dynamic (e.g., programmable, configurable, etc.). Of course any type of mobile device (e.g., C, C) may be used.

The devices in connection system -D can be connected using Internet connections (e.g., Internet connection -, Internet connection -, Internet connection -, Internet connection -, Internet connection -, Internet connection -, and Internet connection -). In some embodiments, an internal network may comprise servers (e.g., server -, server -, and server -, which may be HTTP servers) on their own subnet (e.g., inside a firewall).","In an example for comparison to system -D, a proxy system can support a site name \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d, which resolves to a static NAT address of 10.0.1.1 and a real IP address of 192.168.0.1. The site name \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d and NAT address 10.0.1.1 can be associated with a reverse proxy server or reverse proxy RP. Further, a server S (e.g., inside a firewall) is at \u201cs1.yoics.com\u201d with a NAT address of 10.0.100.1 and a real IP address of 192.168.10.1.

The host file on the reverse proxy RP has an entry for the host name \u201cs1.yoics.com\u201d associated with the static NAT address of S1 10.0.100.1.","The reverse proxy can use prefix mappings, directives (e.g., in Apache), and the like.","A regular mapping is used to tell a reverse proxy which URL prefix is to be proxied and the real (e.g., final, etc.) destination URL. For example, regular mapping contains the source \u201cs1.yoics.com\u201d and destination source \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d.","A reverse mapping translates the URL prefix back to the reverse proxy URL (i.e., \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d). A reverse mapping contains the source \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d and destination source \u201cs1.yoics.com\u201d.","As an example of a regular mapping for an Apache web server, the directive: ProxyPass\/mirror\/foo\/http:\/\/s1.yoics.com\/","directs a request for \u201chttp:\/\/yoics.com\/mirror\/foo\/bar\u201d (for example) to be converted into a proxy request to \u201chttp:\/\/s1.yoics.com\/bar\u201d (for example).","As an example of a reverse mapping for the Apache web server, the directive: ProxyPassReverse\/mirror\/foo\/http:\/\/s1.yoics.com\/","takes care of redirects the server \u201cs1.yoics.com\u201d sends when \u201chttp:\/\/s1.yoics.com\/bar1\u201d (for example) is redirected to \u201chttp:\/\/s1.yoics.com\/bar2\u201d (for example). The Apache server converts \u201chttp:\/\/s1.yoics.com\/bar2\u201d to \u201chttp:\/\/yoics.com\/mirror\/foo\/bar2\u201d (for example) before forwarding the HTTP redirect response to the client.","In an example for comparison to system -D, the following operations can occur in a reverse proxy system:\n\n","From the client side it appears that the request satisfied by \u201cs1.yoics.com\u201d was satisfied by \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d. Thus, for example, a request for \u201chttp:\/\/yoics.com\/mirror\/foo\/bar\u201d may be proxied to \u201chttp:\/\/s1.yoics.com\/bar\u201d. The original request (e.g., for \u201chttp:\/\/yoics.com\/mirror\/foo\/bar\u201d, etc.) uses a hostname plus directory syntax. The directory syntax structure for a proxy server (e.g., \/mirror\/foo\/bar, etc.) may cause problems for software, among other constraints to flexibly and efficiently mapping to a large number of devices connected to the Internet using domain names. Thus a more flexible and powerful method is needed.","In a system including a direct map proxy (e.g., DM proxy), the DM proxy may use (e.g., employ, store, create, etc.) a map to translate (e.g., change, modify, etc.) one or more connection, link, protocol properties, and the like. Any form (e.g., type, number, etc.) of maps may be used.","In one embodiment, for example, a DM proxy may use domain names as (e.g., in, as part of, etc.) a map. For example, a domain name such as \u201cxxxx.yoics.com\u201d may be used as a proxy domain name, where the placeholder \u201cxxxx\u201d may represent the proxy name and \u201cyoics\u201d may be the domain name. The proxy domain name may be used instead of a host name plus directory name in a domain map proxy. In one embodiment, a reverse proxy using a domain map proxy may operate as described above. Of course, the operation of a domain map proxy and\/or any direct map proxy may be carried out (e.g., implemented, architected, etc.) in any fashion, manner, and the like.","In one embodiment, as shown in system -D, DMP - may establish a direct mapped connection between a client and a server using a map (e.g., domain name map, etc.). For example, in system -D, client - may connect to DMP - using domain name \u201cxxx.proxy.com\u201d using Internet connection -. DMP - may use the map (e.g., internal software table, and\/or other similar structures, etc.) to map the domain name \u201cxxx.proxy.com\u201d to domain name \u201cxyz.com\u201d. Second server - may host domain \u201cxyz.com\u201d. Second server - may be connected to DMP - via direct connection -. Second server - may be an IP camera, for example.","In one embodiment, DMP - may establish a direct mapped connection between a client and a server using a connection service. For example, in system -D, client - may connect to connection service - (e.g., YOICS service, etc.) at \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d through DMP - using Internet connections - and -. For example, client - may login to \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d with a user name and password and request a connection (e.g., using a web page hosted by connection service -, etc.) to an Internet camera named myipcamera. The Internet camera myipcamera may be located at first server -. Connection service - may then setup a connection between client - and first server - as described in the following steps. Connection service - may, in a first step, lookup myipcamera and discover the association of myipcamera with first server -. Connection service - may, in a second step, connect to first server - via Internet connection -.

The myipcamera connection between client - and first server - may be initiated in a first stage using Internet connection -, -, and -, but may transition in a second stage to Internet connections - and -. Connection service - may, in a fourth step, assign a domain name \u201c943216.com\u201d to the myipcamera connection, for example. The assigned domain name may be dynamic or static, for example. The assigned domain name may be randomly chosen, for example. Connection service - may, in a fifth step, send the domain name to DMP -. As part of the myipcamera connection the domain name \u201c943216.com\u201d is sent to client -.","In one embodiment, DMP - may establish a direct mapped connection between a client and a server using a connection service and an indirect link. For example, within communication network -B, client - may connect to connection service - (e.g., YOICS service, etc.) at \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d through DMP - using Internet connections - and -. For example, client - may login to \u201cwww.yoics.com\u201d with a user name and password and request a connection (e.g., using a web page hosted by connection service -, etc.) to an Internet camera named myipcamera. The Internet camera named myipcamera may be located at third server -, for example. A connection, myipcamera connection, may be established as described for the myipcamera connection, but the connection between third server - and DMP - may be an indirect connection. For example proxy - may be another proxy (e.g., DMP - and proxy - may form a nested proxy, etc.). For example, proxy - may be a tunnel, another indirect network link, and the like.","In one embodiment for a domain map proxy, a domain map proxy may be used to create connections that are private, protected, encrypted, masked, secured, or are PPCs, etc. to one or more devices or virtual devices.","In one embodiment for a domain map proxy, the proxy domain name may be mapped to an address (e.g., Internet URL, device address, virtual device address, etc.).","In one embodiment for a domain map proxy, HTTPS may be used as the protocol for secure connection to a domain map proxy.","In one embodiment of a domain map proxy, the proxy name \u201cxxxx\u201d may be different for different virtual devices.","In one embodiment of a domain map proxy, the proxy name may be random per connection, per operation, per session, or per set of connections, operations, or sessions, etc. Thus, for example, a proxy domain name may be \u201chttp:\/\/klghrvb34vb769kju.yoics.com\u201d where the proxy name \u201cklghrvb34vb769kju\u201d is a randomly chosen bit string.","In one embodiment of a domain map proxy, the construction (e.g., length, characters used, etc.) of the random proxy name may be adjusted (e.g., modified, changed, etc.) to adjust (e.g., alter, etc.) the level of security.","In one embodiment of a domain map proxy, the algorithm (e.g., random number and\/or character generator, etc.) used to construct the random proxy name may be adjusted (e.g., modified, changed, etc.) to adjust (e.g., alter, etc.) the level of security.","In one embodiment of a domain map proxy, the proxy name \u201cxxxx\u201d may be changed over time (e.g., fixed time period, length of connection(s), number of bytes exchanged per connection, total bytes exchanged, etc.).","In one embodiment of a domain map proxy, the proxy name \u201cxxxx\u201d may be changed based on the user or other variable (e.g., device type, type of user, type of device use, purpose of device use, virtual device type, etc.).","In one embodiment of a domain map proxy, the proxy name may use a secure URL as a password.

In some embodiments, other computing systems, modules, devices, and the like can be required to support direct map proxy system -.","More specifically, communications processing module - can be configured to receive and send communications within direct map proxy system -. For example, communications processing module - can receive a request using a standard networking protocol (e.g., HTTP) that contains a first URL including a domain name (e.g., \u201cxxxx.example.com\u201d), and forward the request to another computing service and\/or system.

User interface module - enables configuration and management of various attributes (e.g., domain name mapping table) of direct map proxy system -.","Various embodiments of direct map proxy system - have further capabilities. For example, direct map proxy system - can be used to create connections having various attributes (e.g., private, protected, encrypted, masked, secured, personal published channels, etc.) to one or more devices or virtual devices. Direct map proxy system - can also map a proxy domain name to an address (e.g., Internet URL, device address, virtual device address, etc.). Further, direct map proxy system - can use secure HTTPS protocol connections. Direct map proxy system - can also map a different URL prefix or proxy name (e.g., \u201cxxxx\u201d in \u201cxxxx.example.com\u201d) to different virtual devices. In addition, the proxy name (e.g., \u201cxxxx\u201d in \u201cxxxx.example.com\u201d) can be random per individual or set of connections, operations, sessions, and the like.

Thus, for example, the provisioning file may be used to configure e.g., select, enable, disable, choose, control, modify, etc. one or more aspects of a device configuration, state, purpose, behavior, etc. Thus, for example, the provisioning file may be used to configure which TCP ports the device may use for connection, etc. Of course any aspect, feature, etc. of a device configuration may be so controlled using any known techniques.","In one embodiment, for example, a provisioning file, configuration file, etc. may be produced (e.g., created, modified, etc.) by a script, program, utility, application, combinations of these, and the like, etc. For example, a user, company, OEM, provider, etc. may use, sell, provide, distribute, offer, publish, etc. a utility program, etc. that may create, modify, alter, etc. one or more configuration files, portions of one or more configuration files, provisioning files, etc. In one embodiment, for example, an application (app, etc.) on a user phone (e.g., iPhone, etc.) may be used to create, change, alter and\/or otherwise modify a provisioning file, configuration file, part or parts of one or more such files and the like, etc. In one embodiment, for example, a user e.g., on a phone (e.g., iPhone, etc.) may be allowed, permitted, etc. to create, change, alter and\/or otherwise modify a provisioning file.","Of course other and any similar functions, behaviors, features, etc. may be achieved by similar techniques to those described above. For example, there may be more than three areas of a configuration file or provisioning file. For example, there may be more than one configuration file, etc. For example, the entire configuration file may be encrypted, etc. In one embodiment, for example, the override area may be encrypted. In one embodiment, for example, there may be more than one override area. In one embodiment, for example, a first override area may be encrypted and a second override area may be unencrypted. An override area may comprise an override-specific salt and\/or an encryption scheme indication using an encoding identifier. In one embodiment, for example, a first override area or encrypted area may be encrypted using a first encryption scheme and a second override area or encrypted area may be encrypted using a second encryption scheme. Of course not all information may be encrypted on all devices in the same manner. For example on a first type of device, all data may be unencrypted and on a second type of device the same data may be encrypted, etc. Of course which data is encrypted and how it is encrypted may depend on any factor and is not limited to device type. For example, any encryption functions, encryption behavior, encryption features, encryption strength, encryption type, etc. may depend on the user, a group of users, the type of device, the services present on the device, the services enabled on the device, the device capabilities, functions, device location, type of use, battery power remaining, device status, device state, application running on the device, power usage of the devices, device history, resources available, and\/or combinations of these, and any other similar factors and the like, etc.","For example, in one embodiment, there may be one or more provisioning files that may be used for initial configuration, boot, start-up, etc. and one or more configuration files that may be altered, modified, etc. by the user at run-time, etc. Of course, provisioning files, configuration files, etc. may be altered, modified, created, changed, etc. at any time including (but not limited to) design time, during manufacturing, testing, deployment, sales, at installation, boot, start-up, during provisioning, at run-time, at any combination of these times, and\/or at any point in time, etc. Of course, one or more provisioning files, configuration files, etc. may be separate, combined, and\/or combined, linked, structured, etc. with other files, data storage structures, databases, etc.","In one embodiment, for example, the one or more provisioning files, configuration files, etc. may be used to perform transport of, provide a conduit for, communicate with, connect to, and\/or distribute, convey, etc. any type of information, data, code, etc. In one embodiment, for example, such communication of information may be between devices, between a user and a service, between a host system and a device, or between any number, type, form of device, system, etc. For example, code required by a device may be fetched from a host server under control or partial control of a provisioning file, etc.","In one embodiment, for example, the one or more provisioning files, configuration files, etc. may be used to store, convey, etc. the state, status, notifications, context, or other similar related information, data, etc. of one or more devices, systems, services, etc. Thus, for example, one or more provisioning files etc. may contain information about the types of notification required by a device, supported by a device, chosen by the user, etc. Thus, for example, one or more provisioning files, etc. may contain style sheets, CSS, and\/or other information, data, etc. that may pertain to, configure, select, filter, etc. data, information, etc. that is sent to a device, received by a device, etc. Thus, for example, one or more provisioning files, etc. may contain style sheets, device information, screen size, screen capabilities, language features, language preferences, etc. that control the display, control notifications, or control any such similar aspect of display, function, behavior, etc. on a device, system, etc.","In one embodiment, for example, the one or more provisioning files, configuration files, etc. may be used to store, convey, etc. an image of a virtual machine, code corresponding to a device driver, install scripts, and\/or any other form, type, etc. of object code, encoded function, binary image, database, code library, routine, device driver, as well as portions, parts and\/or combinations of any of these and the like, etc. For example, the provisioning file may contain, include, point to, link to, etc. one or more code segments, library files, install scripts, patches, updates, bug fixes, code containers (e.g., .jar file or similar, etc.), that may be required, needed, used etc. by one or more devices. For example, a provisioning file may contain code, a link to code, etc. required to handle a particular feature or function, etc. on a device, on other devices, systems, etc. For example, a provisioning file, etc. may contain a link, etc. to code, etc. required to handle a particular feature or function on a device. For example, a provisioning file, etc. may contain code, etc. that may enable or permit a first device to access or control a function, behavior, service, etc. on a second device.","In one embodiment, for example, a provisioning file, configuration file, etc. may be used, may contain data, information, etc. pertaining to, corresponding to, belonging to, to be applied to, to be used by or for, etc. the device on which the provisioning file, configuration file, etc. is kept, stored, located, created, etc. In one embodiment, for example, a provisioning file, configuration file, etc. may be used, may contain data, information, etc. pertaining to, corresponding to, belonging to, to be applied to, to be used by or for, etc. a different device or devices on which the provisioning file, configuration file etc. is kept, stored, located, created, etc. For example, a first device of a first type may be used as a hub, central resource, gateway, etc. for a number of other devices, including for example a second device of a second type. In one embodiment, for example, a provisioning file, configuration file, etc. may be kept, stored, located, created, etc. on the first device and may be used, may contain data, information, etc. pertaining to, corresponding to, belonging to, to be applied to, to be used by or for, etc. the second device. For example a smart home may contain a number of electronic door locks that may for example be wirelessly controlled by a central resource. The central resource may be a first device of a first type and a door lock may be a second device of a second type. The manufacturer, user, OEM, etc. may provision, configure, etc. such a door lock system or any similar system in a number of ways according to various techniques described above, elsewhere herein or in one or more specifications incorporated by reference. For example, in one such configuration or provisioning technique a provisioning file, configuration file, etc. may be created, stored, located, managed, etc. on the first device, the central resource, which may be a small embedded system capable of connecting to the electronic door locks. In one embodiment, one or more parts, portions, etc., of the provisioning file, configuration file, etc. may be copied, moved, transferred, etc. to one or more door locks. For example, one or more combinations may be transferred from the central resource to one or more door locks. For example, the door locks may not have the capability to set, reset, and\/or change, alter, etc. the combination of the lock. Such a provisioning, configuration, etc. technique may allow the lock combinations to be set, configured, changed, etc. remotely. In one embodiment, for example, such a technique may reduce the cost and\/or complexity of the locks. In one embodiment, for example, such a technique may increase the security of the door lock system, e.g., by reducing the possibility of tampering with locks, altering the combination, etc. Such a provisioning, configuring, etc. technique may also allow greater control over who can change combinations, when combinations may be changed, how, etc. door lock combinations may be changed. Of course, similar schemes, techniques, etc. to those described above may be used in any similar situation, system, device network, etc. For example, such a configuration, provisioning, etc. scheme may be used for any system that employs one or more relatively smart resources, systems, central controls, etc. together with an array, system, collection, etc. of relatively dumb accessories, sensors, actuators, and the like, etc. In this case part or all of the provisioning, configuration, etc. may be performed on the relatively smart device and parts, portions, elements etc. of the configuration, provisioning, etc. may then be transferred, moved, copied, etc. to one or more of the relatively dumb devices.","In one embodiment, for example, the act of creating, editing or otherwise manipulating, altering, etc. a provisioning file, configuration file, etc. may be triggered, initiated, controlled, managed, performed manually, performed automatically, etc. by any trigger, event, etc. For example provisioning etc. may be triggered by a user, OEM, manufacturer, etc. Provisioning, etc. may, for example, be required before a device is first used, and\/or before a device can connect or be connected to another device, system, network, etc. Provisioning, etc. may, for example, be required after a device is registered by a user. For example, a user may purchase a device and then be required to register and provision the device. Provisioning, etc. may be triggered, for example, by the purchase of one or more devices, subscriptions, upgrades, or other services. For example, a webcam may be purchased and then provisioned to upload images to a cloud service with such provisioning occurring after the device is registered and the user subscribes to the cloud storage service. Of course any similar event, etc. may be used to trigger, may be used as a trigger, or may otherwise cause, etc. provisioning to occur. In one embodiment, for example, the initial act of configuration of a device, or devices, or services, etc. may be referred to as provisioning. In one embodiment, for example, the configuration of a device, or devices, or services, etc. that occurs after any initial provisioning may be referred to as configuration. Thus for example, there may be only one provisioning step, which in some cases may be required for device operation, but there may be zero, one or more configuration steps during the life of a device. However, in general, any number, type, form, etc. of provisioning and\/or configuration steps, functions, operations, etc. may be performed in any sequence, at any time, on any combination of devices, systems, etc. In one embodiment, for example, the configuration and\/or provisioning of a device, or devices, or services, etc. may be performed before, during, as part of, or after the process, function, etc. corresponding to onboarding. For example, onboarding a device may correspond to joining, connecting, etc. a device to a network, system, other device, service, etc. and\/or registering a device, etc. Although the use of the term onboarding is not always consistent between manufacturers, OEMs, users, etc. and across different devices, different manuals and\/or other documentation, etc. generally the process of provisioning and\/or configuration or part of the process of provisioning and\/or configuration generally occurs before onboarding, though it need not necessarily occur before onboarding.","A provisioning file containing an identification header area -, an encrypted portion -, and an override area - can be used in accordance with many use models, and in accordance with many protocols.

In one embodiment, a first address A (e.g., 127.0.0.2) could be setup to always map to a specific port P (e.g., 127.0.0.2:999). Of course the connection(s) (e.g., mapping, etc.) and\/or connection type(s) (e.g., address, port, etc.) may also be programmed, programmable, configurable, under software control, etc. For example, in one embodiment, the act of trying to connect to 127.0.0.2:999 may automatically setup the connection as described above. The setup can be performed in the background, and can be triggered, initiated, established, etc. using any known technique. For example, in one embodiment, running one or more virtual proxies may set up one or more connections. In one embodiment, the connections may be kept alive (e.g., using keep alive or other known techniques, etc.) so as to have these connections always in place.

This exemplary embodiment as well as other embodiments may implement additional features. Environment -A comprises various computing systems interconnected by a network -. Network - can comprise any combination of a wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), wireless network, wireless LAN (WLAN), or any similar means for enabling communication of computing systems. Network - can also collectively be referred to as the Internet. Environment -A comprises a representative instance of a push server -, a representative Yoics notification service (e.g., implemented on a YNS host server -), a plurality of notification servers - (e.g., notification server -, notification server -), a representative instance of a listener device -, a representative notification device -, and a representative variety of types and instances of listener device - and notification device - (e.g., a router -, a laptop -, a web camera -, a mobile phone -, a tablet -, a desktop -, and a storage device -). Listener device - and notification device - can represent any type of device as described in this disclosure. A protocol - depicts operations and communications on and among listener device -, push server -, YNS host server -, the plurality of notification servers -, and notification device -. Protocol - represents the key activities in a system that supports using multiple connection URLs to enable load balanced (e.g., between the plurality of notification servers -) inter-device messaging.","More specifically, in the example of protocol -, notification device can be any device (e.g., web camera -, etc.) enabled with embedded notification services. Further, listener device - can be any device (e.g., mobile handset, mobile phone -, tablet -, etc.) hosting a client application (e.g., \u201capp\u201d) that is listening (e.g., has notification turned on) to one or more notification devices and receiving push notifications, wherein the client application can be a third-party application using the YNS APIs, and the push notifications can be asynchronous messages. More specifically, push notifications can include an \u201cin-app\u201d notification received by the app when it is running, and an \u201cout-app\u201d notification received and displayed by listener device - when the app is not running.","Specifically, protocol - and environment -A support a notification service (NS) that provides enabled products (e.g., notification device -) with generic methods to communicate notifications (e.g., events and alarms) with the product's registered owner (e.g., user of listener device -) over mobile notification or push systems (e.g., through push server -), such as the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), or JPush platforms. These notifications can be application specific (e.g., supporting network cameras with motion and audio alarm capabilities). As shown in protocol -, YNS usage can begin with listener device - registering for notification (e.g., can be off by default) with a push server at push server - (e.g., APNS for iOS handsets, or GCM or JPush for Android handsets). Push server - then provides a notification token back to listener device - to allow listener device - to be setup for notifications and listening (e.g., to specifically enabled notification devices) with the YNS at YNS host server -. This step can be done, for example, in conjunction with registering a remote storage solution for storing recorded video (e.g., YouTube), since the YNS may not store all event data. Also, the client app API can use a common load balanced URL (e.g., notification.yoics.net) to access the YNS APIs. When some event occurs on notification device -, the notification event (e.g., a single message from a notification device) will be communicated with the YNS at YNS host server -. In some embodiments, notification device - can use multiple primary base URLs (e.g., notify1.yoics.net, notify2.yoics.net, notify3.yoics.net, notify4.yoics.net, etc.) to contact the NS, wherein the server at each URL contains the same APIs and capabilities. In some embodiments, these URLs can be used (e.g., by a standard UpTube notification engine or daemon) in a random access pattern. YNS host server - will first verify access for notification device - (e.g., as a firewall) and then prepare to route the message by performing a server load balancing analysis. YNS host server - can choose to route the notification message to any of the plurality of notification servers - to optimize the load balancing of the servers. As shown in protocol -, YNS host server - routes the notification to notification server -, which forwards the notification to the push service (e.g., back-end service such as APNS, GCM, or JPush) at push server -. In the final step, push server - delivers the push notification from notification device - to listener device -. In some embodiments, the push notification can be an SMTP notification (e.g., an email message sent to the registered user's email address).","The operational and communication flow through a representative YNS system is shown in the following diagram.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0679","num":"0717"},"figref":"FIG. 102","b":["5","1","00","5","1","00","5","1","00"]},"As shown in , system -B comprises a notification subsystem - in communication with listener device -, push server -, and notification device - from environment -A.

This exemplary embodiment as well as other embodiments may implement additional features. Listener device protocol -A depicts operations and communications on and among listener device - and YNS host server - from environment -A. In general, listener device - running a client application must first be authorized by the YNS before it can call the YNS for notification settings and features. This requires the YNS to process a security authorization (e.g., logging in to the YNS using a login API at authentication module - from system -B, or a \u201cplatform-specific\u201d SDK), sending a valid API token to listener device -, and listener device - saving and using the valid API token when interacting with the NS. If an invalid token error response is received during authorization, for example, the client app must be authorized again to obtain a new token.","Tokens may expire at any time based on service usage and security settings. After these initialization steps, the client app on listener device - can manage notification settings and configuration by first asking the YNS for the current user's notification settings (e.g., global settings, mobile handsets, listener devices, notification devices, etc.), and then parsing and saving the returned notification settings information. Next, the client app will need to register the user's mobile handset. The registration process can vary with the mobile handset platform, but each of the processes are very well defined by the platform manufacturer (e.g., Apple, Google, etc.). In one example, as shown within listener device protocol -A, registration of listener device - calls for listener device - to get a push token and a unique device ID. A push token is a unique identifier provided by a push service that maps the user's handset to the client application. Both Apple iOS and Google Android SDKs, for example, provide the push token service to mobile applications. Also, the unique device ID can be obtained from the platform SDK. This ID should be saved as it will be needed to register the listener device - as a \u201clistener\u201d (see below). With this information, listener device - can then request device registration from the NS, which can then register the device (e.g., at registration module - of system -B).","The second step in receiving notifications is to register the listener device - as a \u201clistener\u201d with the NS. This registration provides a virtual mapping of one or more listener devices to one or more notification devices. This mapping includes how to send notification messages received from a notification device to specific listener devices (e.g., mobile handsets). There may be multiple listener devices registered. Specifically, referring to listener device protocol -A, the client app at listener device - can request listener registration using the unique device ID of listener device - and notification device ID (e.g., from user notification settings) of the target notification device. With this information, the YNS at YNS host server - (e.g., using registration module -) can register the listener. To remove a listener, the client app can make the same API call with the remove action. During device registration, the client app must inform the YNS that a new device is being registered. This allows the YNS to perform privacy checks and clean up any older settings and events from previous registrations for the specific device. This step must be performed under very specific conditions. The client app must call the YNS during pre-registration after removing the device and before registering the device. This step prevents potential security vulnerabilities between device registrations where a device may have been previously registered by another user.","Other operations between and among listener device - and YNS host server - are also shown in listener device protocol -A, including: (1) manage the mobile platform's push service delivery methods for in-app notifications; (2) manage the mobile platform's application startup modes to detect being started as a result of an out-app notification event and immediately display the relevant content; (3) retrieve event history (e.g., notification history, or a saved listing of recent messages from a notification device for one or more listener devices) from the YNS show the user's recent events; (4) send the YNS instructions on clearing events from the event history; and (5) send the YNS instructions on renaming and deleting notification devices as appropriate for the application. In some embodiments, some user accounts can have service restrictions, where the YNS allows notification delivery and saves notification history based on published service levels. These service levels and settings are specific to each YNS user and may change accordingly. These settings typically affect items such as push delivery methods, push message frequency, and save event history. Further, some user accounts can qualify for an event cloud provisioning and storage service. If enabled, the provisioning API in the YNS (e.g., at provisioning module -) is activated to provision the storage using a storage service. After provisioning, the client app can configure devices to use the storage service. When listener device - has been completely setup with the NS, it can then listen for notifications.","The following describes in more detail implementations of listener device protocol -A (e.g., as the client API), according to some embodiments.","API Login\u2014the YNS API uses the Yoics Service API for authenticating the client API requests. This involves logging in to the Yoics Service API to obtain an authentication and authentication token. All Yoics related handset applications would already have done the login to authenticate the user, for which the API token is then easily obtained in the login response message. This authentication token will be referred to as the \u2018<yoicstoken>\u2019.","Apple Push Registration\u2014iOS applications must contact the APNS to obtain a registration token. This process informs the APNS that this application has been authorized to receive push notifications. The process will return an APNS token that must be provided to the YNS during handset registration. This token will be referred to as \u2018<apnstoken>\u2019 or, more generically, as \u2018<pushtoken>\u2019 when iOS handsets are involved.","Google GCM Registration\u2014Android applications must contact the GCM service to obtain a registration token. This process informs the GCM that this application has been authorized to receive push notifications. The process will return a GCM token that must be provided to the YNS during handset registration. This token will be referred to as \u2018<gcmtoken>\u2019 or, more generically, as \u2018<pushtoken>\u2019 when Android handsets are involved.","JPush Registration\u2014Android applications must contact the JPush service to obtain a registration token. This process informs the JPush that this application has been authorized to receive push notifications. The process will return a JPush token that must be provided to the YNS during handset registration. This token will be referred to as \u2018<jpushtoken>\u2019 or, more generically, as \u2018<pushtoken>\u2019 when Android handsets are involved.","YNS Handset Registration\u2014Each handset intending to receive notifications from the YNS must be registered with the YNS. This requires the handset to send its unique identifier and the appropriate <pushtoken> to the YNS. The YNS will save this information for use in delivery notifications that arrive from the user's YNS enabled products. As an example, before an iOS device is registered for receiving notifications, ServerCallYNSAPI class must be initialized with the appropriate yoicsID, YoicsToken and PushToken as shown in Table
