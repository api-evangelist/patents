title: Method for the generation of a code, and method and system for the authorization of an operation
abstract: The present invention relates to a method for generating a code and a method comprising the authorization of an operation carried out by a client on a first server. A second server generating an authorization code according to an encoding method is involved in the authorization. The operations can be transactions, access to a web page, user-to-user payments, user-to-business payments, online user-to-business payments, cash withdrawal in automated teller machines, etc.

A second server generating an authorization code according to an encoding method is involved in the authorization. The operations can be transactions, access to a web page, user-to-user payments, user-to-business payments, online user-to-business payments, cash withdrawal in automated teller machines, signing operations, etc.","The development and social impact of mobile devices have led to the development of applications for mobiles in the business environment, such as those which make business transactions.","Some mobile devices include software applications which allow capturing QR codes, or quick response codes. The application captures the code, decodes it and transmits the decoded information to a remote server as a request for information about materials for example, such as a purchase order, etc. Such operations are merely an exchange of information and do not include any type of business transaction operation.","PayPal\u2122 is a text only one-way payment system that can be installed in mobile devices. The system works such that information about the payer and the amount to be paid is sent from the mobile device to a server. An operator calls the user of the mobile device after this information is sent so that the user can authorize the transaction.","Obopay\u2122 is a mobile device application the use of which allows a transaction from an Obopay\u2122 account to a business. The use depends on the proprietary software installed in the device, with the drawback that not all devices are prepared to run Obopay\u2122 software.","Other forms of payment using mobile devices comprise the use of barcodes, communication with the merchant by means of wireless technology, such as Bluetooth or infrared, etc. The main drawback is the required use of additional hardware and software both in the client and in the merchant.","However, there are no applications which allow the exchange of funds in a fast and comfortable manner for the user and assure 100% security in said operations and transactions. In addition, the disclosure of this invention allows, in addition to performing transactions, identifying and signing operations in alternative channels that prevent the typical attacks using the means that have been widespread up until now.","The present invention solves the technical problems described above by means of a method for generating a code according to claim , an authorization method for authorizing an operation according to claim , and an authorization system for authorizing an operation according to claim . The dependent claims define preferred embodiments of the invention.","A first aspect of the invention is a method for generating a code, characterized in that it comprises the steps of:\n\n","Encrypting or enciphering must be understood in the context of the present invention by its conventional meaning, i.e., applying an algorithm for converting the original information into secret information. A message susceptible to being encrypted undergoes at least one transformation by means of a key. The original message is transformed into a binary string by means of the key. The decrypting entity must have the decryption key to obtain the original message.","Encoded or encoding must be understood in the context of the present invention by its conventional meaning, i.e., applying an algorithm for representing information. The Base64 encoding system, for example, which takes groups containing 6 bits and forms characters, can be used to represent a series of binary symbols in one character.
