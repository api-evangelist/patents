{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST STATEMENT","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was developed under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates in general to an optical sampler for analog to digital conversion, and more specifically, to an optical sampler which can be monolithically integrated on a single integrated circuit (IC) substrate and which uses time delayed parallel sampling.","Increased global datacom bandwidth demands have pushed internet transmission system providers to improve aggregate data rates through increased modulation speeds and multi-level signaling. The fidelity of the transmission link may be improved through real time processing of the received optical signal using digital signal processing techniques. Digital signal processing may allow for more of the receiver functions to operate in the digital domain. These include electronic dispersion compensation, error correction, signal conversion, out-of-band rejection, and filtering among other applications. The primary enabler for digital signal processing applications in this context are analog-to-digital converters (ADC).","In particular, high-speed ADCs may enable not only the real-time observation and processing of high-speed optical communications, but also storage of the signal for off-line processing. Such ADCs may also find applications in advanced radar, spread spectrum communications, radio astronomy, and signal transmission for remote antenna systems.","The demands of these systems call for high-bandwidth (>40 GHz), high-resolution ADCs which cannot be met by current electronic analog-to-digital converters (eADC). Although time interleaving could potentially relieve bandwidth demands, the jitter associated with electronic sampling limits the resolution of such configurations.","The present invention is embodied in an optical sampler monolithically integrated on a single IC substrate and using time delayed parallel sampling. The optical sampler includes n parallel optical modulators each configured to modulate either a) an optical analog input signal or b) an input optical sampling signal by an electrical input signal. The n parallel optical modulators provide n successive optical samples of the optical analog input signal.","According to one aspect, the optical sampler includes n parallel photodiode interconnected Mach-Zehnder Modulators (PD-MZM) each containing a photodiode and a Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM). The photodiode converts a respective one of either a) n parallel optical analog input signals or b) n parallel input optical sampling signals to an electrical out signal that is coupled to a branch of the MZM. The electrical output signal modulates a relative phase of two branches of the MZM so that the MZM produces a differential pair of optical output signals.","According to another aspect, the optical sampler includes n semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) amplifying either a) n parallel optical analog input signals or b) n parallel input optical sampling signals to provide either a) n parallel amplified optical analog input signals or b) n parallel amplified input optical sampling signals, respectively.","According to another aspect, the method of sampling an optical analog input signal includes splitting an input optical sampling signal into n parallel input optical sampling signals; splitting the optical analog input signal into n parallel optical analog input signals; delaying each parallel optical sampling signal by a respectively different delay, to provide n parallel delayed optical sampling signals relative to the input optical sampling signal; sensing either a) the n parallel delayed optical sampling signal or b) the n parallel optical analog input signal by n photodiodes, respectively, to generate n respective electrical output signals; and modulating either a) the n parallel delayed optical sampling signal or b) the n parallel optical analog input signal with n optical modulators, respectively, to provide n successive optical samples of the optical analog input signal.","The fast repetition rates, and low jitter of mode locked lasers make optical sampling an attractive alternative. There have been a number of reported methods to optically sample a signal, for example, time-division demultiplex the signal and then use eADCs for quantization and coding, as shown in the following publications.","Gupta et al. (ePrint arXiv:0901.2767, 2009) show the photonic time-stretch technique for a Mode-Locked Laser or Super-Continuum laser can be used to scale eADCs to higher frequencies (time-stretch ADC or TS-ADC). In a time-stretch ADC, the effective bandwidth and frequency of the RF signal to be digitized is compressed by stretching the signal in time, thereby reducing the bandwidth of the backend electronic digitizer required to capture the original signal. To do so, the RF signal is modulated over a long pulse of a linearly chirped optical carrier obtained from a super-continuum source (which can be a femtosecond mode locked fiber laser). Propagation through a dispersive medium stretches the modulated pulse in time, resulting in a \u201ctime-stretched\u201d replica of the original RF signal after photodetection. To achieve continuous operation, the optical spectrum is segmented into multiple channels using a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) filter. Time-stretched signals from different channels are digitized by separate electronic digitizers and combined together in digital domain.","Juodawlkis et al. (IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 49(10), p 1840, 2001) show how optically sampled ADCs combine phase-encoded optical sampling technique with electronic quantization to enhance the performance of electronic ADCs with a Mode-Locked Laser pulse source. The narrow-band jitter of actively mode-locked fiber lasers (<10 fs) has been shown to be limited by the phase noise of the laser's electronic reference oscillator, and pulse-to-pulse jitter estimates (<50 fs) indicate the absence of a significant wide-band-noise component. Therefore, optical pulse sources with quantum-limited pulse-to-pulse jitter of <10 fs may be realizable through proper design and the use of low-noise reference oscillators. The low back-electromotive force of electrooptic sampling transducers facilitates the accuracy of the optical sampling process by providing high isolation between the optical clock pulses and the signal being sampled. The advantage of optically sampled ADCs is that the sampling operation can be viewed as a near-perfect mixer, allowing microwave signals to be directly down-converted in the ADC component. For a given jitter-limited resolution, the maximum frequency that can be sampled is limited only by the bandwidth of the sampling modulator and the temporal width of the optical pulses. Thus, it is feasible to undersample signals with frequencies in the range of 100 GHz with 6-b resolution (assuming \u02dc10-fs jitter) using demonstrated modulator and mode-locked laser technologies.","The embodiments described below relate to a simpler configuration which does not use complicated time-division demultiplexing after the optical sampling.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that although the following description mainly provides a parallel optical sampler, used for analog to digital conversion, having a plurality of parallel optical modulators or optical samplers that avoid complicated time-division demultiplexing in the optical domain as examples, many alterations and changes can be made by those skilled in the art, without deviating from the scope of the invention. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention.","An optical sampler for analog to digital conversion uses time delayed parallel sampling to avoid complicated time-division demultiplexing in the optical domain. The optical sampler takes advantage of the low jitter and fast repetition rates of mode locked lasers to enable an ADC with an overall higher fidelity and speed than currently available eADCs. Such an ADC may be used in optical transmission links enabling real time processing of the received signal using digital signal processing techniques. These ADCs may also find applications in advanced radar, spread spectrum communications, radio astronomy, and signal transmission for remote antenna systems.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention are described with reference to the drawings.","An example of an optical sampler , as illustrated in , is monolithically integrated on a single IC substrate . The example optical sampler  works by doing time delayed parallel sampling of an optical analog input signal  and generates digital samples of the optical analog input signal  provided to the optical sampler .","The single IC  may be a common III-V compound semiconductor substrate such as an indium phosphide (InP) substrate or a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate. The single IC  may also be a Silicon substrate and all of the optical and electrical devices except for the semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) may be implemented using silicon photonics. The example optical sampler  integrated on the single IC  forms a waveguide layer . The waveguide layer  may include an InGaAsP layer, or the like. The waveguide layer  may also include quantum wells , as shown in .","Referring to , the example optical sampler  includes a first 1\u00d7n optical beam splitter  where n is an integer greater than 1, a second 1\u00d7n optical beam splitter , a plurality of optical delay elements , and n optical modulators  including n respective photodiodes , monolithically integrated on the single IC , forming the waveguide layer .","The example optical sampler  further includes a plurality of output photodiodes  monolithically integrated on the single IC , and a plurality of eADCs  each following a respective one of the plurality of output photodiodes . The eADCs  can be displaced outside the single IC . The number of the plurality of output photodiodes  and eADCs  can be n or n pairs, depending on the number of the outputs from the n optical modulators. For example, if there was one output from each of the n optical modulators, then n output photodiodes  and n eADCs  may be used. If there were two outputs from the each of the n optical modulators, then n pairs of the output photodiodes  and n pairs of the eADCs  may be used.","The optical analog input signal  may be provided, for example, by an optical fiber and may have a radio-frequency (RF) bandwidth (BW) of 40 GHz or more. The optical analog input signal  is sampled and converted to the digital sample data  at a sampling rate. The sampling rate is chosen to be the Nyquist rate or greater based on the maximum BW of the optical analog input signal  to be converted.","The optical analog input signal  is sampled by an input optical sampling signal  including input optical sampling pulses. The input optical sampling signal  may be provided from another optical fiber, or from a semiconductor laser, which can be a mode-locked laser  having a repetition rate. The mode-locked laser  can be a C-band laser, or other lasers that generate pulses at the desired wavelengths and rates. The repetition rate depends upon the frequency of the optical analog input signal  that is being digitized by the example optical sampler , and on a desired effective number of n parallel channels ,  that the example optical sampler  includes.","The first and second 1\u00d7n optical beam splitters ,  may be a y-branch type splitter, a multi-mode interference (MMI) type splitter, or any splitter that is able to be integrated on a monolithic IC substrate and provide n parallel and substantially equal optical beams. The first and second 1\u00d7n optical beam splitters ,  split light into the n parallel channels , , respectively, wherein the n is defined by the BW of the optical analog input signal  divided by a BW of the eADCs .","Because the values of n is incorporated into the physical design of the example optical sampler , it is determined beforehand by the BW of the optical analog input signal  that the example optical sampler  uses to convert and the BW of the eADCs . As an example, n may be 8 if the maximum BW of the optical analog input signal  is 40 GHz and the BW of the eADCs  is 5 GHz (the corresponding sampling rate of each individual eADC is 10 GHz). Thus, in this example, the first and second 1\u00d7n optical beam splitters ,  may be 1\u00d78 optical beam splitters, respectively, integrated on the single IC . Furthermore, the repetition rate of the input optical sampling signal  including input optical sampling pulses from the mode-locked laser  may be 10 GHz, which matches the corresponding sampling rate of each individual eADC (10 GHz).","The first 1\u00d7n optical beam splitter  is coupled to receive the input optical sampling signal  and to provide n substantially equal parallel optical sampling signals  to the n parallel channels . The second 1\u00d7n optical beam splitter  is coupled to receive the optical analog input signal  and to provide n substantially equal parallel optical analog input signals  to the n parallel channels .","The plurality of optical delay elements  are coupled to receive respectively different ones of the n parallel optical sampling signals  to provide n parallel delayed optical sampling signals  with respectively different time delays relative to the input optical sampling signal .","The plurality of optical delay elements  include a plurality of waveguides of respectively different lengths in the waveguide layer . The plurality of optical delay elements  further include a series of meandering curves or spirals in the waveguides. The plurality of optical delay elements  each may also include a biasing electrode  configured to fine tune the time delay provided by the optical delay elements  by the application of an electrical signal to the biasing electrode . The biasing electrode  changes the effective refractive index of the waveguides and thus changes the speed of the light traveling through the waveguides to implement a fine adjustment of the delays.","The respectively different time delays of the respectively different ones of the n parallel optical sampling signals  are defined by respective values of an expression (m\u22121)\/S, where S is the sampling rate of the optical analog input signal , m is a respective one of the n parallel channels  or  and m is an integer where m=1 to n. As an example, if the frequency of the optical analog input signal  is 50 GHz, then the sampling rate of the optical analog input signal  may be 100 GHz, which is the Nyquist rate of the optical analog input signal , thus, the time delay for the first parallel optical sampling signal may be 0 relative to the input optical sampling signal . The time delay for the second parallel optical sampling signal relative to the first parallel optical sampling signal may be 10 picoseconds. The time delay for the third parallel optical sampling signal relative to the first parallel optical sampling signal may be 20 picoseconds. The time delay for the nth parallel optical sampling signal relative to the first parallel optical sampling signal may be 10\u00d7(n\u22121) picoseconds.","Furthermore, the n optical modulators , including the respective n photodiodes , are integrated on the single IC substrate  in parallel. The n optical modulators  may be n individual optical samplers integrated on the single IC substrate  in parallel. The n individual optical samplers are essentially identical. An optical modulator  is described as follows. One of the n parallel delayed input optical sampling signal  and one of the n parallel optical analog input signal  go to the optical modulator . A photodiode  is coupled to receive the one of the n parallel optical analog input signals  to convert the one of the n parallel optical analog input signals  to an electrical output signal. The optical modulator  is coupled to receive the one of the n parallel delayed optical sampling signals  as an optical input signal. The optical modulator  also receives the electrical output signal from the photodiode  as the electrical input signal. The optical modulator  is configured to modulate the one of the n parallel delayed optical sampling signals  by the electrical input signal where the n optical modulators  provide n successive optical samples  of the optical analog input signal .","Furthermore, the plurality of the output photodiodes  receive the n successive optical samples  of the optical analog input signal  and convert the n successive optical samples  to n successive electrical samples  of the optical analog input signal , respectively.","The plurality of the eADCs  receive the n successive electrical samples  of the optical analog input signal , respectively. Each eADC  is connected to a respective one of the n output photodiodes . The plurality of the eADCs  then digitize the n successive electrical samples  and produce n successive digital samples  of the optical analog input signal . Each of the n successive digital samples  is generated at the sampling rate of the individual eADC , which matches the repetition rate of the input optical sampling signal . The n successive digital samples  form the digital signal data  which is upsampled to the sampling rate of the optical analog input signal , as shown in . The digital signal data  may be then processed through digital signal processing circuits (not shown).","In the above embodiment of the example optical sampler , each of the n optical modulators  samples a different portion of the optical analog input signal , as shown in , therefore, the effective sampling rate is the Nyquist rate or greater. The each individual eADC , however, deals with a signal at a lower sampling rate appropriate to its BW and maximum sampling rate (2\u00d7BW). This approach may be regarded as 1-to-n time-division demultiplexing since a temporal window is created to route every nth pulse to the same channel, thereby reducing the effective data rate into the each individual eADC  by a factor of n. Therefore, the example optical sampler  for analog to digital conversion uses no complicated time-division demultiplexing in the optical domain after the optical sampling.","In one embodiment of the example optical sampler , the n optical modulators , each may be a photodiode interconnected Mach-Zehnder Modulator (PD-MZM) , as shown in .  is a schematic plan view of an individual PD-MZM . The PD-MZM  is composed of a photodiode  coupled to a Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM) , which may be a traveling-wave modulator for higher bandwidth signals. The example MZM  has two complementary modulator outputs , . As shown in , the PD-MZM  also includes a SOA  provided with an electrode  over the optical waveguide biased with the photodiode .","Referring to , the individual PD-MZM  included in the example optical sampler  is described as follows.","The MZM  includes a 1\u00d72 optical beam splitter . The 1\u00d72 optical beam splitter  splits the delayed input optical sampling signals  into two substantially equal portions , . Each portion of the delayed optical sampling signals  is directed into one of two optical waveguide branches ,  of the MZM . The branch  is a phase delay branch, whereas the branch  has no phase change. The 1\u00d72 optical beam splitter  may be the same type of beam splitter as the first and second 1\u00d7n optical beam splitters , , which may be one of a y-branch type splitter, multi-mode interference (MMI) type splitter, or the like, and is able to be integrated on a monolithic IC substrate.","The MZM  further includes an output coupler , which may be a \u201cy\u201d coupler or an adiabatic coupler, used to interfere the two branches ,  at the outputs of the MZM  leading to the two complementary modulator outputs , ","The photodiode  is coupled to receive a respective one of the n parallel optical analog input signals  and convert the optical analog input signals  to an electrical output signal. The photodiode  is formed by doping the optical waveguide to form a PN junction contained in the waveguide and forming an electrode  over the PN junction. The electrical output signal from the photodiode  is coupled to the phase delay branch  of the MZM . An electrode  is provided over a PN junction in the phase delay branch  of the MZM  to allow a phase delay to be electrically generated only in the phase delay branch  by the respective electrical input signal. The MZM  is coupled to receive the electrical output signal from the photodiode  as an electrical input signal. The MZM  is configured to modulate the respective one of the n parallel delayed optical sampling signals  by the electrical input signal and provides an optical sample  of the optical analog input signal .","The phase delay of the one of the two portions , of the respective one of the n parallel delayed optical sampling signal  or the input sampling optical signal  generated in the MZM  is due to electric field effects. Since the electrical input signal is presented in the phase delay branch , the electrical signal output from the photodiode  will modulate the voltage on the phase delay branch  of the MZM  and change the index of the waveguide of the phase delay branch  through a number of electric field effects including the Linear Electro-optic Effect (LEO) and Kerr Effect\/Quadratic electro-optic effect. Thus, the electrical input signal modulates a relative phase of the two branches ,  of the MZM , shifts an optical power splitting ratio between the two complementary modulator outputs , from the MZM  so that the MZM produces differential optical output signals , representing the optical sample  of the optical analog input signal .","Because the MZM  has the two complementary modulator outputs , pairs of the output photodiodes  and n pairs of the eADCs  are used to convert the optical samples  of the optical analog input signal  to the digital samples . The n pairs of the output photodiodes  may be monolithically integrated in the single IC substrate .","A respective pair of the n pairs of the output photodiodes  receive a respective differential pair of optical output signals , from the two complementary modulator outputs , of the MZM  and convert the respective differential pair of optical output signals , to a respective differential pair of electrical output signals , . The respective differential pair of the electrical output signals , represent an electrical sample  of the optical analog input signal .","Furthermore, a respective pair of the n pairs of the eADCs  are connected to the respective pair of the n pairs of the output photodiodes . The respective pair of the n pairs of the eADCs  receive the respective differential pair of the electrical output signals , and digitize the respective differential pair of the electrical output signals , to a respective differential pair of digital output signals , . The respective differential pair of the digital output signals , represent the digital sample  of the optical analog input signal . The digital sample  is generated at the sampling rate of the individual eADC . The n pairs of the eADCs  produce n successive digital samples  forming the digital sample data , which is upsampled to the sampling rate of the optical analog input signal , as shown in . The digital sample data  may be then processed through digital signal processing circuits (not shown).","The optical and electrical connections of the PD-MZM  for the example optical sampler  are shown in . The two branches ,  of the MZM  in the waveguide layer  have essentially identical lengths. The electrode  of the photodiode  and the electrode  on the phase delay branch  of the MZM  are electrically connected in parallel with a termination resistor  at the end of the electrodes , . The respective one of the n parallel delayed sampling signals  is fed into the beam splitter  of the MZM  forming the two portions , . Each portion then propagates through the two branches ,  of the MZM , respectively. The respective parallel optical analog input signals  is absorbed in the photodiode  to generate the electrical output signal. The electrical output signal flows through to the electrode  extending over the phase delay branch  of the MZM  to the termination resistor , and this generates a voltage on the electrode  which reverse biases a semiconductor p-n junction in the phase delay branch  therebeneath to produce the phase delay of the one of the two portions , of the respective one of the n parallel delayed input sampling optical signals  over the phase delay branch  of the MZM .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["41","51","41","51","1","12","70","70","1","41","51"]},"In another alternative embodiment of the optical sampler , the optical input signal of the MZM  may swap from the respective one of the n parallel delayed optical sampling signals  to the respective one of the n parallel optical analog input signals , and vice versa. In this embodiment, the respective one of the n parallel delayed optical sampling signals  is fed into the photodiode , where the respective one of the n parallel delayed optical sampling signals  is converted to the respective electrical output signal. The respective one of the n parallel optical analog input signals  is fed into the MZM  as the optical input signal. The MZM  is coupled to receive the electrical output signal as the electrical input signal applied to the phase delay branch  of the MZM  to produce the phase delay  on the phase delay branch . Thus, the electrical input signal modulates the relative phase of the two branches , , and shifts the optical power splitting ratio between the two complementary modulator outputs , so that the MZM  produces the differential optical output signals , representing the optical sample  of the optical analog input signal . In this embodiment, the MZM  modulates the respective one of the n parallel optical analog input signals  by the electrical input signal.","Optionally, as shown in , in another alternative embodiment of the example optical sampler , the SOA  is coupled to amplify the respective one of the n parallel optical analog input signals  to provide a respective parallel amplified optical analog input signal . As described above, the electrical input signal is proportional to the optical analog input signal . To provide the electrical input signal for the electrode , the respective one of the n parallel optical analog input signals  may optionally be amplified with the respective SOA . The optical analog input signal  may be amplified after the 1\u00d7n beam splitter  and before being applied to the respective one of the photodiodes . After being amplified, the respective parallel amplified optical analog input signal  is fed into the photodiode , where the respective parallel amplified optical analog input signal  is converted to the electrical output signal. The MZM  operates in response to the electrical output signal to optical input sampling signal  as described above.","Optionally, as shown in , in another alternative embodiment, the example optical sampler  may includes another set of n SOAs  between the first 1\u00d7n beam splitter  and the plurality of the delay elements , respectively. Each SOA  is coupled to amplify a respective one of the n parallel optical sampling signals  to provide a respective one of n parallel amplified optical sampling signals \u2032.

The EAM is based on electroabsorption effect, which is defined as the change of material absorption in the presence of an electric field. The EAM may be integrated on a single chip, and may be made in the form of a waveguide with electrodes for applying an electric field in a direction perpendicular to the modulated light beam. Because an individual EAM provides a single output, in this embodiment, the example optical sampler  may include n eADCs  connected to n photodiodes  that are coupled to the n EAMs on the single IC substrate .","All embodiments allow each parallel optical modulator or sampler  to sample a different portion of the optical analog input signal , as shown in , therefore, the effective sampling rate is the Nyquist rate or greater.
