{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This non-provisional patent application claims priority to U.S. Pat. No. 60\/301,249, which was filed on Jun. 26, 2001.","This patent application relates to co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/180,636 entitled \u201cDetecting and Transporting Dynamic Presence Information Over a Wireless and Wireline Communications Network,\u201d which has the same filing date as the present application.","Over the last couple of decades a large variety of communication devices have become available for common use. Some of these devices include the personal computer (PC), personal digital assistant (PDA) and cellular (or \u201cwireless\u201d) telephone. The ushering in of these new devices and the coming into prominence of the Internet during the 1990s has resulted in an increased number of independent communication networks. Unfortunately, exclusivity of networks is often undesirable, especially from a consumer standpoint, since it does not allow communication across device platforms.","To address the problems associated with multiple devices on multiple networks, solutions have been sought that unify device service across multiple platforms. One emerging protocol, which is used to establish \u201csessions\u201d over an Internet Protocol (IP) network, is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP is a request-response type protocol that resembles two other Internet protocols, HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol, which is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is a protocol used to send e-mails between servers). While the development of SIP is progress in the right direction, more innovations are needed.","According to the present invention, apparatuses and methods are disclosed that enable the exchange of presence information between a wireless network and an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The exchange of presence information does not require a user-initiated session or a pre-established network connection between the wireless network and IP network. The architecture is instantiated through a gateway, which interfaces with the end user on one side and the IP network on another side.","According to an aspect of the invention, a communication gateway includes a message bearer configured to receive presence information signals from a wireless message center and a translation engine coupled to the message bearer operable to translate the presence information signals into signals capable of being transported over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.","According to another aspect of the invention, a communication gateway for communicating presence information between a connectionless packet-switched signaling network and an Internet Protocol (IP) network includes a message bearer configured to receive and send messages over a connectionless packet-switched signaling network and a translator, in communication with the message bearer, operable to translate messages received from the connectionless packet-switched signaling network into messages suitable for transport over an IP network and operable to translate messages received from the IP network into messages suitable for transport over the connectionless packet-switched signaling network.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method of communicating between a wireless packet-switched signaling network and an Internet Protocol (IP) network includes the steps of receiving a presence information signal from a wireless packet-switched signaling network and translating the received presence information signal into a signal capable of being transported over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.","Other aspects of the invention are described and claimed below, and a further understanding of the nature and advantages of the inventions may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the attached drawings.","The present invention is directed at apparatuses and methods that are operable to translate a presence signal comprising presence information from a wireless network into Internet Protocol (IP) compatible signals and vice versa.","Presence information comprises near-real-time information. It may be detected, gathered and provided to other interested users by the user's interaction with an associated presence-enabled electronic device. An example of an electronic device that may be enabled for presence detection and capture is a wireless telephone. A presence-enabled wireless telephone can capture presence information of an associated end user, which might include, for example, switching on the telephone (i.e. power-on), dialing a telephone number, talking on the telephone, location of the telephone, telephone number assigned to the telephone, etc. According to the present invention, once captured, the presence information may then be automatically provided to other interested users. Other types of presence information may not be automatically provided but may, rather, require the user to first describe and then send the presence information. For example, a user may express a present desire not to be disturbed. An architecture, according to an embodiment of the present invention, which may be used to transcode streaming messages comprising presence information to signals IP-compatible signals and vice versa is described in detail below.","In an embodiment of the present invention, a bidirectional gateway translates wireless SIP-like signals comprising presence information of an end user into SIP signals for transport over an IP network and conversely translates SIP signals comprising presence information of an end user into wireless signals, which may be transported over the wireless network to a subscriber of the presence information. Although SIP format is used to describe the application layer IP protocol in this disclosure, it is to be understood that other similar application layer IP protocol, e.g. Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), may be used. Similarly, the presence information in the wireless signals may be transported according to various transport protocols, e.g. SMS (short message service), USSD (unstructured supplemental service data) and paging network protocols. Further, the wireless network may comprise, for example, any connectionless packet-switched signaling network, any two-way paging network, or any cellular network supporting cellular technologies such as GSM (global System for Global Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), etc. The foregoing variations apply to the figures and descriptions of the figures presented below.","Referring to , there is shown an exemplary architectural diagram of a system  that translates wireless SIP-like messages, comprising presence information, into SIP signals (and vice versa), according to an embodiment of the present invention. A wireless carrier center  is configured to receive presence information in SIP-like format from a presence information provider . Only one presence information provider is shown in , in order to simplify illustration and explanation. In operation, many presence information providers may interact with system . The manner by which the presence signals are detected, captured and transported to wireless carrier center  is described in detail in co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 10\/180,636 entitled \u201cDetecting and Transporting Dynamic Presence Information Over a Wireless and Wireline Communications Network,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference into this disclosure.","The presence information provider  may comprise a wireless telephone having an SIM card configured to detect and capture presence signals for transport to wireless carrier center . Alternatively, presence information provider  may comprise other wireless communication devices such as, for example, a personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer configured for wireless communication, automobile navigation system, etc. In the case of a wireless telephone, the capture of presence information is derived from the subscriber identity module (SIM) of the wireless telephone, by a proactive application programming interface call to the mobile equipment (ME) through the event driven handle. The captured presence information is then converted into an SIP-like signal payload, which is streamed over a transport layer to a wireless message center. In an exemplary embodiment, the SIP-like wireless messages are formatted according to a subset of the SIP grammar set and are transported in binary format by a presence streaming applet (PSA) layer over SMS. Further details concerning the detection and capture of presence signals and the transport of the presence signals to the wireless message center are provided in the co-pending patent application referred to above. The SIP-like wireless messages are then transmitted to a wireless message-SIP gateway .","Referring again to , wireless message-SIP gateway  comprises a wireless message bearer box , a translation engine  and optional DHCP address and DNS server engine components  and . Wireless message bearer box  is coupled to wireless carrier center  by message send and receive lines , , which may comprise Ethernet, TCPIP, or telephone line connections, for example. In one embodiment message bearer box  communicates with wireless message center  using SMPP (short message peer-to-peer) protocol over TCP\/IP protocol.","Translation engine  of wireless message-SIP gateway  comprises an IP engine  and an SIP engine , which together operate to translate SIP-like messages received by gateway  into SIP messages suitable for transport over an IP network. In an exemplary embodiment, wireless SIP-like messages comprise an originating address, a destination address, a method (e.g. REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, etc., which are explained in more detail below), and message contents. IP engine  uses the originating address of a message received by gateway  to look up an associated SIP address of the presence information provider . (Optional DHCP address and DNS server engine components  and  operate to provide IP addresses to incoming presence signals that do not have pre-assigned IP addresses.) SIP engine  translates the received SIP-like message into an SIP-compliant message and then transmits it to a presence agent and server  via an IP network . As described in more detail below, presence agent and information server  has access to one or more databases , which store dynamic and static presence information of registered presence information providers and subscribers.","Whereas the architecture of system  in  above is described in the context of sending presence information from an presence information provider  to presence and agent server , via gateway , it is understood that gateway  is bi-directional and, therefore, is capable of sending presence information from the presence and agent server  to a user on the wireless network. Accordingly, gateway  also receives SIP formatted signals, translates them into SIP-like messages and sends these SIP-like signals to wireless message center , which transmits the SIP-like messages to presence information provider  or presence information subscriber  on a wireless network, according to the SMS transport protocol.","Now that the architecture of gateway  of system  has been described, a description of how a user interacts with system  will be provided. A user may comprise any entity that provides or consumes presence information received by or sent from gateway . So in , for example, both the presence information provider  and presence information subscriber  are users.","Referring to , there is shown an event sequence diagram of a first presence-enabled device  associated with a first user transmitting an SIP-like REGISTER to a second presence-enabled device  associated with a second user, in response to the first user turning on the power of the first presence-enabled device. It is assumed in this example that the presence-enabled devices are wireless, mobile telephones and that the signaling protocol is of SIP-like signals transported over an SMS transport protocol. Other device types and signaling and transport protocols may be used, as described above.","When the power of the first mobile phone  is turned on, presence signal software resident on the API of the phone's SIM card detects and captures the power on event as presence information. First mobile phone  sends an SMS message comprising the presence information to a wireless message center (SMS-C) , as indicated by event . The SMS message comprises an origination address, an optional destination address, a method (i.e. REGISTER, in this example) and optional message content. The origination and destination addresses, in this example, comprise the telephone number assigned to the first and second mobile phones  and , respectively. SMS-C  delivers the SMS message to a wireless message-SIP gateway (SMS-SIP gateway) , as indicated by event . In a specific exemplary embodiment, SMS-C  sends the message using SMPP over TCP\/IP protocol. SMS-SIP gateway  then performs a process , which comprises operating on the SMS message to translate it to an SIP formatted message. After the translation process is completed, SMS-SIP gateway  sends the translated message to a presence agent and server , via an IP network, as indicated by event .","Upon receiving the SIP formatted REGISTER, presence agent and server  performs a process , which checks whether any authorized users (i.e. authorized subscribers) may be interested in receiving the presence information of the first user. From the power on signal and the operating base station identifier of the wireless network, an interested subscriber can, for example, be informed of the first user's physical presence. If presence agent and server  determines that a second user has expressed an interest in the presence attributes of the first user or has previously subscribed to the first user's presence information, the second user is notified as follows.","First, an SIP formatted NOTIFY message is generated by presence agent and server  and sent to SMS-SIP gateway , as indicated by event  in . Upon receiving the SIP formatted NOTIFY message, SMS-SIP gateway  performs a process , which comprises operating on the SIP formatted NOTIFY message to translate it to an SMS formatted message containing the NOTIFY message. The SMS-SIP gateway  then sends the SMS formatted message to SMS-C , as indicated by event . Finally, the SMS-C sends the SMS NOTIFY message to the second mobile phone  associated with the destination address, as indicated by event . Note that if no destination address is provided by the first user, but the second user is otherwise subscribed to the first user's presence information, the destination address is provided from an alternative source, e.g. from database  in the architecture shown in .","In the above exemplary REGISTER event sequence, the REGISTER request is automatically sent after the user powered on mobile phone . Other types of automatic REGISTER event sequences could provide presence information, for example, of the user's physical location by the identification number of the associated mobile phone or by a device that is GPS (Global Position Satellite)-enabled. In another aspect of the invention, a user may REGISTER presence attributes through a gateway (e.g. through wireless message-SIP gateway  in  using a REGISTER event sequence similar to that shown in ). The presence attributes may describe other presence information of the user, capabilities of an associated device, preferences (e.g. language preference) of the user, etc. A specific example is of a user who wishes to provide a presence \u201cstatus\u201d, indicating whether the user is free, busy or does not want to be disturbed. The REGISTER request made by the user is similar to that shown in , except that the user provides the necessary parameters to implement the request.","Referring now to , there is shown an event sequence diagram of a presence information subscriber  (e.g., which may correspond to presence information subscriber  in ) making a SUBSCRIBE request for access to presence information of one or more other users. Similar to the REGISTER example described above, it is assumed for purpose of example, that the SUBSCRIBE request is sent as an SMS message from a wireless device associated with the presence information subscriber . Software resident on the API of the wireless device's SIM card detects and captures the SUBSCRIBE request. The wireless device of the presence information subscriber  sends an SMS message comprising the SUBSCRIBE request to a wireless message center (SMS-C) , as indicated by event . The SMS message comprises an origination address, a method (i.e. SUBSCRIBE in this example) and message content. The origination address may comprise, for example, a telephone number of the wireless device associated with presence information subscriber . The SMS-C  delivers the SMS message to an SMS-SIP gateway , as indicated by event . SMS-SIP gateway  then performs a process , which comprises operating on the SMS message to translate it to an SIP formatted message. After the translation process is completed, SMS-SIP gateway  sends the translated message to a presence and agent server , via an IP network, as indicated by event .","Upon receiving the SIP formatted SUBSCRIBE request, presence and agent server  performs a process  to determine whether the SUBSCRIBE request is to be accepted or denied. If accepted, the message contents of the message (i.e. subscription data) are stored on a data storage device coupled to presence agent and server . In response to receiving the SUBSCRIBE request, presence agent and server  generates an SIP formatted NOTIFY message and send it to SMS-SIP gateway , as indicated by event . The NOTIFY message may indicate, for example, that the SUBSCRIBE request was accepted or denied. Then, the SMS-SIP gateway  performs a process , which comprises operating on the SIP formatted NOTIFY message to translate it to an SMS formatted message containing the NOTIFY message. The SMS-SIP gateway  then sends the SMS formatted message to SMS-C , as indicated by event . Finally, the SMS-C  sends the SMS NOTIFY message back to the wireless device of the presence information subscriber, as indicated by event .","Whereas the above is a complete description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, various alternatives, modifications, and equivalents may be used. Therefore, the above description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
