{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure is generally related to the field of image display systems, and more particularly to methods and systems for communication between a display source and a display sink over a communication link.","Conventional display systems typically include a wired connection between a display source (e.g, computer, DVD\/Blu-ray device, cell phone, set-top box, etc.) and a display sink (e.g., a device that receives data for producing an image such as but not limited to a computer monitor, television, projector, hub, etc.) for communicating multimedia data and other display controls and capability data. Wired communication links or interfaces between the display source and the display sink may include video graphics array (VGA), digital video interface (DVI), high definition multimedia interface (HDMI), DisplayPort (DP), and other wired communication interfaces. The communication interface may include an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus for communicating monitor control commands and monitor capability information between the display source and the display sink. The I2C bus is a multi-wire (typically including a data wire and a clock wire), bidirectional communication bus that provides for serial communication between connected components.","Referring to , an exemplary known display system  is illustrated that utilizes an I2C bus for communicating monitor control commands and monitor capability data. Display system  includes a display source , such as a computer (e.g., laptop, desktop, tablet, etc.), cell phone, DVD\/Blueray device, set-top box, etc., that is operative to provide audio\/video data or other multi-media data to a display sink  for display on a monitor  (e.g., display, screen, etc.) of display sink . Display sink  may include a computer monitor device, a television, a video\/image projector, or any other suitable display sink  operative to display image data (e.g., video, graphics, etc.) and\/or to convert audio data into sound. The connections lines between components of display system  illustrated in  represent physical electrical connections (e.g., conductors, wires) between the components.","Display source  includes an image provider  that is operative to generate or decode audio and image (video or graphics) data. Image provider  may include a graphics processor (e.g. one or more GPU cores), decoder, or other control unit operative to generate or decode multimedia data, such as audio, video, and other image data. In some embodiments, image provider  further includes a main processor (e.g., one or more CPU cores) that includes an operating system operative to issue control commands to display sink  and to request data from display sink . In one embodiment, a graphics processor and a main or central processor are provided in an integrated circuit of image provider , although processors and logic components of image provider  may comprise separate devices. Display source  includes a memory , internal or external to image provider , containing data, such as image or control data, accessible by image provider . Memory  may include software or firmware with program instructions that when executed by a processor of image provider  performs one or more computing tasks. Memory  may also include image data used by image provider  to provide video or graphics data.","Display sink  illustratively includes a monitor controller  operatively coupled to monitor  and to a memory . Monitor controller , which may include a processor or other suitable logic that is operative to process multimedia data, such as audio data and video and\/or graphics image data, received from image provider  of display source  and to provide the processed data to monitor  for display on monitor . As described herein, monitor controller  is also operative to control monitor  based on control commands received from display source  and to provide monitor capability data to display source . Memory  may be internal or external to monitor controller  and stores data, such as image or control data, accessible by monitor controller  for controlling monitor . Memory  may further include software or firmware with program instructions that when executed by a processor of monitor controller  performs one or more computing tasks associated with monitor . Memory may be any suitable memory including but not limited to RAM, ROM, EEPROM, DDRAM, optical memory, distributed memory in differing devices such as web servers or any suitable non-transitory memory.","A display interface  of display source  provides a communication interface between image provider  of display source  and display sink . Similarly, a display interface  of display sink  provides a communication interface between monitor controller  of display sink  and display source . Display interfaces ,  may include a video graphics array (VGA), digital video interface (DVI), high definition multimedia interface (HDMI), DisplayPort (DP), or other communication interface. A communication cable  is coupled from display interface  to display interface . Communication cable  includes a connector cable or wire, or other suitable wired connector, that is compatible with the communication interface (e.g., VGA, DVI, HDMI, DP, etc.) of display interfaces , . Communication cable  illustratively includes an audio\/video bus  for communicating audio, video, other image data, and various controls from display source  to display sink . Audio\/video bus  is illustratively unidirectional from display source  to display sink . In the illustrated embodiment, communication cable  further includes an I2C bus  for communicating monitor control commands and monitor capability information between display source  and display sink . Audio\/video bus  and I2C bus  are illustratively provided in a single communication cable . In one embodiment with a DisplayPort interface, communication cable  includes a pair of auxiliary (AUX) wires rather than an I2C bus  for communicating the monitor control commands and monitor capability information between display interfaces , .","I2C bus  communicates monitor control commands and monitor capability information between display source  and display sink . Capability information may include extended display identification data (EDID) or other suitable data representing the display capabilities of monitor . EDID includes a data structure provided at display sink , such as at memory  accessible by monitor controller , that describes to display source  the display and operational capabilities of monitor . Exemplary capability data includes graphics modes, frame rate, display size and aspect ratio, resolution, color capabilities, and other suitable monitor capability information. Image provider  performs multiple functions or operations based on the EDID structure. Upon reading the EDID structure, image provider  is configured to identify the type and capabilities of monitor  and to tailor the audio\/video data (or other image data) to conform to the capabilities of the monitor . For example, image provider  may scale the video or image content provided to display sink  based on whether monitor  has enabled overscan functionality, as determined from the display capability information in the EDID structure. In another example, image provider  performs color management based on the display gamut and related information of monitor  provided in the EDID structure. Other operations may be performed by image provider  based on EDID information and other control\/capability information.","Monitor control commands communicated over I2C bus  may include Monitor Command and Controls Set (MCCS) commands or other suitable monitor control commands provided from display source  to display sink  for controlling the display properties of monitor . Each MCCS command includes various data parameters and command attributes operative to control the display properties of monitor . MCCS commands are operative to restore factory defaults (e.g., color, geometry, brightness\/contrast, and other presets\/defaults) of the monitor , to control color temperature, hue, and saturation, to adjust display geometry (e.g., parallelogram, pincushion, etc.), and to control image display parameters. Exemplary image display parameters include display orientation, zoom, brightness, contrast, gamma, focus, backlight control, white point, and other image parameters. The I2C bus  may be used to transfer other display setup information. In one embodiment, monitor display sink  provides reply data or controls over I2C bus  to display source  in response to monitor control commands.","In one embodiment, the I2C bus  utilizes Display Data Channel and\/or Command Interface (DDC\/CI) communication protocol to communicate EDID information, MCCS commands, and other data or monitor control commands between display source  and display sink . DDC\/CI protocol may provide a \u201cplug and play\u201d environment such that display source  and display sink  are able to communicate upon connection to the I2C bus .","Monitor controller  controls monitor  based on the monitor control commands from display source . For example, upon image provider  issuing an MCCS command or other monitor control command to display sink  via the IC2 bus , the monitor controller  displays the video or other image data, or processes audio data, in accordance with the issued commands. Similarly, upon image provider  issuing an EDID request via the IC2 bus , monitor controller  provides the EDID information of monitor  to display source  via the I2C bus .","The I2C bus  is configured to communicate low-level messaging transactions (e.g., single byte messages) between image provider  of display source  and monitor controller  of display sink . These low-level messages may include read or write commands, such as read\/write replies and requests. In one embodiment, I2C bus  includes two wires, i.e., a data wire and a clock wire, that provides for serial communication between display source  and display sink . For example, in one embodiment, information from the EDID structure, MCCS commands, and other display data or monitor control commands are transmitted over I2C bus  a single byte at a time. As such, a monitor control command, for example, may include a plurality of low level (e.g., single byte) messaging transaction requests. Another suitable multi-wired, bidirectional communication bus may be provided as an alternative to I2C bus  for handling the communication of low-level messaging transactions containing monitor control and capability information.","Some display systems  are operative to provide audio\/video data to the display sink  over a computer networking protocol, such as an internet protocol (IP) format including Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for example. Rather than being directly connected with a communication interface  such as VGA, DVI, HDMI, DP, or other wired interface, the display source  and display sink  are connected via an IP link to remotely communicate with each other over a wired or wireless IP network. However, such IP communication links do not support the communication of I2C read\/write messaging transactions (e.g., MCCS commands, DDC\/IC protocol, EDID information, etc.) between the display source  and the display sink . Without a mechanism to enable the communication of remote I2C read\/write messaging transactions over an IP interface, some or all operations performed by the image provider  based on the monitor control commands and capability data previously communicated via I2C bus  may be either compromised or performed at the display sink . However, performance of such operations by the display sink  results in increased complexity of the display sink  and increased likelihood of compatibility issues between the display source  and the display sink . Further, the processor(s) and\/or control logic of the image provider  of display source  is typically much more flexible in operation and is better adapted to handle changes in the monitor control\/capabilities.","Therefore, a need exists for methods and systems to communicate monitor control commands and other monitor data between a display source and a display sink using a network protocol communication interface, such as an internet protocol (IP) communication interface.","In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a method carried out by an electronic device is provided. The method includes translating monitor control commands to an network protocol format to produce network protocol formatted monitor control commands. The method further includes communicating the network protocol formatted monitor control commands to a network protocol port dedicated for communicating network protocol formatted monitor control commands.","Among other advantages, the method and apparatus allows for communication of monitor control commands, monitor capability information, and other monitor data between a display source and a display sink using a network protocol (e.g., internet protocol (IP)) communication interface, such as a wireless interface. The enabled communication of monitor control commands, capability data, and other data intended for communication over an I2C bus, for example, allows a display source communicating over an IP communication interface to control the display operations and the display features and capabilities of the display system, as described herein. Other advantages will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.","In one example, the translating the monitor control commands to a network protocol format to produce network protocol formatted monitor control commands includes translating monitor control commands intended for communication over a multi-wire bidirectional bus. In another example, the communicating the network protocol formatted monitor control commands to the dedicated network protocol port includes identifying a network protocol port of a destination device, such as a display sink, and dedicating the identified network protocol port for communicating network protocol formatted monitor control commands.
