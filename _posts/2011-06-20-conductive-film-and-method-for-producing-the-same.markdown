Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a conductive film having a high-resolution-patterned silver image on each side of a transparent support and a method for producing such a conductive film by use of a silver halide emulsion layer.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventional methods for forming a conductive pattern on each side of a support are described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2008-158108 and 2008-216799, for example.","In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2008-158108, a photosensitive material has a silver halide emulsion layer on each of both sides (A and B sides) of a transparent support.

The conductive film of the present invention is particularly suitable for a capacitive touch panel.","Furthermore, in a case where the light-transmitting conductive layer containing the net-like structure composed of the thin wires is used in a touch panel sensor, the sensor and a part of a wiring extending from the sensor to the control IC circuit can be simultaneously formed from the silver halide emulsion layer (the precursor of the conductive layer). Thus, a touch panel module can be easily produced.","The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.","Several embodiments of a conductive film and a conductive film production method according to the present invention will be described below with reference to . It should be noted that, in this description, a numeric range of \u201cA to B\u201d includes both the numeric values A and B as the lower limit and upper limit values.","As shown in , a conductive film  according to an embodiment of the present invention has a transparent support , a first conductive silver image disposed on one main surface of the transparent support , and a second conductive silver image disposed on the other main surface of the transparent support . The conductive film  is produced by forming at least one photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer on each of the surfaces of the transparent support  and then exposing and developing the emulsion layer.","Each of the first silver image and the second silver image contains a net-like structure in a region required to be transparent. The net-like structure is composed of thin wires having a line width of 10 \u03bcm or less. The net-like structure forms a conductive layer, and the sheet resistance of the conductive layer is 50 ohm\/sq or less, preferably 10 ohm\/sq or less.","Each of the first silver image and the second silver image further contains silver wires  in a region not required to be transparent. The silver wires  are electrically connected to the net-like structure, and each have a width of 10 to 500 \u03bcm and a length of 10 mm or more. The resistance of the silver wire  is 300 ohm or less, preferably 100 ohm or less, per 10 mm.","The photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer on each surface of the transparent support  is not substantially spectrally-sensitized. Thus, for example, as shown in , the photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer formed on the one main surface of the transparent support  (hereinafter referred to as the first photosensitive layer ) and the photosensitive silver halide emulsion'layer formed on the other main surface of the transparent support  (hereinafter referred to as the second photosensitive layer ) are not substantially spectrally-sensitized. The first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer have a surface resistance value (log SR) of 15 or less and an applied silver amount (an amount of an applied silver salt) of 5 to 20 g\/min silver density. The term \u201cnot substantially spectrally-sensitized\u201d means that silver halide particle surfaces are covered with a spectral sensitizing dye at a coverage of 20% or less in the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer . The first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer preferably have a surface resistance value (log SR) of 13 or less.","When the one main surface is used as the upper surface of the transparent support , the first photosensitive layer is formed as the substantially uppermost layer. The term \u201cthe substantially uppermost layer\u201d means the uppermost layer in the stuck structure excluding a protective layer, although such a protective layer is generally formed as the uppermost layer.","The volume ratio of silver\/binder in each of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer is 1\/2 or more, preferably 1\/1 or more, more preferably 2\/1 or more. The silver\/binder volume ratio is further preferably 1\/1 to 4\/1, most preferably 1\/1 to 3\/1. When the silver\/binder volume ratio is within the above range, the electric resistance variation can be reduced even under various applied silver amount, whereby the conductive film  for a touch panel, and which has a uniform surface resistance, can be obtained. The silver\/binder volume ratio can be determined by converting the silver halide\/binder weight ratio of the material to the silver\/binder weight ratio, and by further converting the silver\/binder weight ratio to the silver\/binder volume ratio.","The first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer have a high contrast photographic property exhibiting a gamma of 4 or more in an optical density region of 0.1 to 1.5 on the characteristic curve showing the logarithm of exposure (X-axis) and the optical density (Y-axis) on the orthogonal X and Y coordinate axes with the same unit lengths. The gamma is more preferably 5 to 30, further preferably 5 to 10.","Each of the first silver image and the second silver image has a lattice pattern containing a plurality of polygons. The lattice pattern has an arrangement pitch of 300 \u03bcm or less and a total light transmittance of 80% or more. Furthermore, the conductive film  has a difference of 1% or less between the opening ratio of the effective area on the one main surface of the transparent support  (i.e., the effective area excludes the outer periphery on which the first silver image is not disposed) and the opening ratio of the effective area on the other main surface of the transparent support  (i.e., the effective area excludes the outer periphery on which the second silver image is not disposed).","A method for producing the conductive film  according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to .","First, in step S of , a long photosensitive material  is prepared. As shown in , the photosensitive material  has the transparent support , the first photosensitive layer formed on the one main surface of the transparent support , and the second photosensitive layer formed on the other main surface of the transparent support .","In step S of , the photosensitive material  is exposed. In this exposure step, a simultaneous both-side exposure, which includes a first exposure treatment for irradiating the one main surface of the transparent support  with light to expose the first photosensitive layer in a first exposure pattern and a second exposure treatment for irradiating the other main surface of the transparent support  with light to expose the second photosensitive layer in a second exposure pattern, is carried out. In the example of , the first photosensitive layer is irradiated through a first photomask with a first light (a parallel light), and the second photosensitive layer is irradiated through a second photomask with a second light (a parallel light), while the long photosensitive material  is conveyed in one direction. The first light is obtained by converting light from a first light source into the parallel light through an intermediate first collimator lens , and the second light is obtained by converting light from a second light source into the parallel light through an intermediate second collimator lens . Though the two light sources (the first light source and the second light source ) are used in the example of , the exposure can be performed using only one light source. In this case, light from the one light source is divided by an optical system into the first light and the second light with which the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are irradiated.","In step S of , the exposed photosensitive material  is developed to produce the conductive film  shown in . The conductive film  has the transparent support , the first silver image formed in the first exposure pattern on the one main surface of the transparent support , and the second silver image formed in the second exposure pattern on the other main surface of the transparent support . Preferred exposure time and development time for the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer depend on the types of the first light source and the second light source , and the type of developer, etc., and thus cannot be categorically determined. The exposure'time and development time may be selected in view of achieving a development ratio of 100%. The first silver image and the second silver image may be subjected to a plating treatment to deposit a conductive metal thereon.","As shown in , in the first exposure treatment in the production method of this embodiment, for example, the first photomask is placed in close contact with the first photosensitive layer , the first light source is arranged so as to face the first photomask . Then, the first light is emitted from the first light source toward the first photomask , so that the first photosensitive layer is exposed. The first photomask has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern (the first exposure pattern ) formed thereon. Therefore, in the first exposure treatment, areas in the first photosensitive layer that correspond to the first exposure pattern , are exposed. A space of approximately 2 to 10 \u03bcm may be formed between the first photosensitive layer and the first photomask ","Similarly, in the second exposure treatment, for example, the second photomask is placed in close contact with the second photosensitive layer , and the second light source is arranged so as to face the second photomask . Then, the second light is emitted from the second light source toward the second photomask , so that the second photosensitive layer is exposed. The second photomask , as well as the first photomask , has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern (the second exposure pattern ) formed thereon. Therefore, in the second exposure treatment, areas in the second photosensitive layer that correspond to the second exposure pattern in the second photomask , are exposed. In this case, a space of approximately 2 to 10 \u03bcm may be formed between the second photosensitive layer and the second photomask ","In the first and second exposure treatments, the emission of the first light from the first light source and the emission of the second light from the second light source may be carried out simultaneously or separately. When the emissions are simultaneously carried out, the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can be simultaneously exposed in one exposure step thereby to reduce the exposure time.","When both of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are not spectrally-sensitized, light incident on one side may affect the image formation on the other side (the back side) in the both-side exposure of the photosensitive material .","Thus, as shown in , the first light from the first light source reaches the first photosensitive layer and is scattered by the silver halide particles in the first photosensitive layer , and part of the scattered light is transmitted through the transparent support  and reaches the second photosensitive layer . Then, large areas at the boundary between the second photosensitive layer and the transparent support  are exposed thereby to form latent images . As a result, the second photosensitive layer is exposed not only to the second light from the second light source but also to the first light from the first light source . As shown in , when the second photosensitive layer is developed to produce the conductive film , the conductive patterns  (the second silver image ) corresponding to the second exposure pattern are formed, and additionally thin conductive layers  are formed between the conductive patterns  due to the first light from the first light source , so that the desired patterns  (corresponding to the second exposure pattern ) cannot be obtained.","This is true also for the first photosensitive layer . As shown in , the second light from the second light source reaches the second photosensitive layer and is scattered by the silver halide particles in the second photosensitive layer , and part of the scattered light is transmitted through the transparent support  and reaches the first photosensitive layer . Then, large areas at the boundary between the first photosensitive layer and the transparent support  are exposed thereby to form latent images . As a result, the first photosensitive layer is exposed not only to the first light from the first light source but also to the second light from the second light source . As shown in , when the first photosensitive layer is developed, the conductive patterns  (the first silver image ) corresponding to the first exposure pattern are formed, and additionally thin conductive layers  are formed between the conductive patterns  due to the second light from the second light source , so that the desired patterns (corresponding to the first exposure pattern ) cannot be obtained.","For example, when such a conductive film  is used in a touch panel on a liquid crystal display panel, an image on the display screen may be blocked by the thin conductive layers , whereby the touch panel may become unuseful.","This problem may be solved by fixing a dye between the first photosensitive layer and the transparent support  and between the second photosensitive layer and the transparent support  thereby to suppress the light transmission to the back side. Because the dye deteriorates the transparency of the final product, it is necessary to remove the dye (render the dye harmless) in the development step, for example. On the other hand, in order to achieve a desired conductivity, it is necessary to increase the thicknesses of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer . In this case, the dye cannot be easily removed in the development step. Thus, the production process becomes complicated and cannot be readily carried out.","As a result of intense research, it has been found that if the thicknesses or the applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are selected within a particular range, the incident light can be absorbed by the silver halide per se thereby to suppress the light transmission to the back side. In this embodiment, the thicknesses of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 1 to 4 \u03bcm. The upper limit is preferably 2.5 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 5 to 20 g\/m.","In the above described contact both-side exposure technology, the exposure may be inhibited by dust or the like attached to the film surface thereby to generate an image defect. It is known that the dust attachment can be prevented by applying a conductive substance such as a metal oxide or a conductive polymer to the film. However, the metal oxide or the like remains in the processed product to deteriorate the transparency of the final product, and the conductive polymer is disadvantageous in storage stability, etc. As a result of intense research, it has been found that a silver halide with reduced binder content exhibits a satisfactory conductivity for static charge prevention. Thus, the volume ratio of silver\/binder is controlled in the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer . The silver\/binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are 1\/1 or more, preferably 2\/1 or more.","As described above, when the thicknesses, the applied silver amounts, or the silver\/binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are controlled, the first light emitted from the first light source to the first photosensitive layer does not reach the second photosensitive layer as shown in . Similarly, the second light emitted from the second light source to the second photosensitive layer does not reach the first photosensitive layer . As a result, in the following development for producing the conductive film , as shown in , only the conductive patterns  corresponding to the first exposure pattern (the patterns forming the first silver image ) are formed on the one main surface of the transparent support , and only the conductive patterns  corresponding to the second exposure pattern (the patterns forming the second silver image ) are formed on the other main surface of the transparent support , so that the desired images can be obtained.","In the method for the conductive film according to the present embodiment, the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can have both of the satisfactory conductivity and both-side exposure suitability, and the same or different patterns can be formed on the surfaces of the one transparent support  by the above exposure. Therefore, for example, electrodes of a touch panel can be easily formed, and the touch panel can be made thinner (smaller).","Furthermore, in the contact both-side exposure technology, the conductive patterns  in the first silver image and the second silver image formed in the development step can have a line width of 10 \u03bcm or less. When the line width is 10 \u03bcm or less, a touch panel obtained by superimposing the conductive film  on a display panel of a liquid crystal display device or the like can prevent generation of moire.","An example in which the conductive film  according to the present embodiment is applied to a conductive sheet  for a touch panel will be described below.","As shown in , in the conductive sheet , the first silver image and the second silver image are formed respectively on the one main surface and the other main surface of the one transparent support  by the one-shot exposure and development. The first silver image has the region required to be transparent (a sensing region ) and the regions not required to be transparent (a first terminal wiring region shown in  and a second terminal wiring region shown in ).","Each of the first silver image and the second silver image contains the net-like structure in the sensing region . The net-like structure is composed of thin metal wires having a line width of 10 \u03bcm or less. In each of the first silver image and the second silver image , the net-like structure (the conductive layer) has a sheet resistance of 50 ohm\/sq or less.","In the first silver image , first terminal wiring patterns in the first terminal wiring region are electrically connected to the net-like structure in the sensing region  (see ). In the second silver image , second terminal wiring patterns in the second terminal wiring region are electrically connected to the net-like structure (see ). The first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns are composed of metal wires (silver wires) having a width of 10 to 500 \u03bcm and a length of 10 mm or more. The resistance of the metal wire (the silver wire) is 300 ohm or less, preferably 100 ohm or less, per 10 mm.","As shown in , in the first silver image , two or more first conductive large lattices A are formed in the net-like structure in the sensing region  on the one main surface (e.g. the upper surface) of the transparent support . The first large lattices A each contain a combination of two or more small lattices \u2032 (see ). A first dummy pattern A (a first unconnected pattern), which is not connected to the first large lattices A, is formed near each side of the first large lattices A. First connections A are formed between the first large lattices A, and each adjacent two of the first large lattices A are electrically connected by the first connection A. The first connections A each contain one or more medium lattices  (to ), and the pitch of the medium lattices  is n times larger than that of the small lattices  (in which n is a real number larger than 1). The small lattices  have a smallest square shape.","The side length of the first large lattice A is preferably 3 to 10 mm, more preferably 4 to 6 mm. When the side length is less than the lower limit, for example in the case of using the conductive sheet  in a touch panel, the first large lattices A exhibit a lowered electrostatic capacitance in the detection process, and the touch panel is likely to cause a detection trouble. On the other hand, when the side length is more than the upper limit, the position detection accuracy may be deteriorated. The side length of each small lattice  in the first large lattices A is preferably 50 to 500 \u03bcm, more preferably 150 to 300 \u03bcm, for the same reasons. When the side length of the small lattice  is within this range, the conductive sheet  has high transparency and thereby can be suitably used at the front of a display device with excellent visibility.","The two or more first large lattices A are arranged in an x direction (a first direction) with the first connection A disposed therebetween, to form one first conductive pattern A. Two or more of the first conductive patterns A are arranged in a y direction (a second direction) perpendicular to the x direction. Electrically isolated first insulations A are disposed between the adjacent first conductive patterns A.","Meanwhile, as shown in , in the second silver image , two or more second conductive large lattices B are formed in the net-like structure in the sensing region  on the other main surface (e.g. the back surface) of the transparent support . The second large lattices B each contain a combination of two or more small lattices  (see ). A second dummy pattern B (a second unconnected pattern), which is not connected to the second large lattices B, is formed near each side of the second large lattices B. Second connections B are formed between the second large lattices B, and each adjacent two of the second large lattices B are electrically connected by the second connection B. The second connections B each contain one or more medium lattices  (to ), and the pitch of the medium lattices  is n times larger than that of the small lattices  (in which n is a real number larger than 1). The side length of the second large lattices B is preferably 3 to 10 mm, more preferably 4 to 6 mm, as well as the first large lattice A.","The two or more second large lattices B are arranged in the y direction (the second direction) with the second connection B disposed therebetween, to form one second conductive pattern B. Two or more of the second conductive patterns B are arranged in the x direction (the first direction). Electrically isolated second insulations B are disposed between the adjacent second conductive patterns B.","A specific example of the conductive patterns of the first silver image formed on the one main surface of the transparent support  and the second silver image formed on the other main surface of the transparent support  in the sensing region  will be described below.","As shown in , in the pattern on the one main surface of the transparent support  in the sensing region , the four sides of the first large lattice A each have a straight line shape. Of the four sides, a first side and a second side are on one corner unconnected to the adjacent first large lattice A, and a third side and a fourth side are on the other corner unconnected to the adjacent first large lattice A. In other words, the intersection of the straight lines of the first side and the second side forms the one corner of the first large lattice A, and the intersection of the straight lines of the third side and the fourth side forms the other corner of the first large lattice A.","In the first connection A, the four medium lattices  (the first medium lattice to the fourth medium lattice ) are arranged in a zigzag manner, and each of the medium lattices  has a size equal to the total size of four small lattices . The first medium lattice is disposed at the intersection of the second side and the fourth side , and forms an L-shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The second medium lattice is disposed on one side of the first medium lattice , and forms such a square space that four small lattices  are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The third medium lattice is adjacent to one vertex of the first medium lattice and one side of the second medium lattice , and has the same shape as the second medium lattice . The fourth medium lattice is disposed at the intersection of the third side and the first side , is adjacent to one vertex of the second medium lattice and one side of the third medium lattice , and forms an L-shaped space in combination with one small lattice  similarly to the first medium lattice . When the small lattices  have an arrangement pitch of P, the medium lattices  have an arrangement pitch of 2P.","The above described first dummy pattern A is formed near each of the four sides of the first large lattice A (the first side to the fourth side ). The first dummy pattern A is formed such that two or more parts each having a shape corresponding to the partially-removed small lattice  are arranged along the corresponding straight side. In the example of , the part has a shape obtained by removing one side from the small lattice  and thus the shape has two corners and one opening (referred to simply as an approximately U-shape), and ten of the parts are arranged such that the openings are opened in the direction away from the corresponding side of the first large lattice A. The arrangement pitch of the parts is twice as large as the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices  in the first large lattices A. For example, the shortest distance between the straight line shape of the first side and the approximately U-shape of the first dummy pattern A is approximately equal to the side length of the inner periphery of the small lattice . This is true also for the second side to the fourth side ","In the first insulation A, a first insulation pattern A unconnected to the first large lattices A is formed. The first insulation pattern A has a first assembly pattern portion containing two or more small lattices  arranged and three spaces  (to ) containing no small lattices .","Specifically, the first assembly pattern portion contains a combination of four straight lines composed of a plurality of the small lattices  (two long straight lines and two short straight lines). Each of the straight lines is formed by arranging a plurality of the small lattices  so as to connect the vertices of the small lattices . With respect to the adjacent two first large lattices A with the first insulation A interposed therebetween, the three spaces  include a first space containing no small lattices  and which is surrounded by the first assembly pattern portion , a second space containing no small lattices  and which is formed near the other corner of one first large lattice A, and a third space containing no small lattices  and which is formed near the one corner of the other first large lattice A.","For example, of the four straight lines, each of the two long straight lines is formed by arranging seven small lattices  so as to connect the vertices thereof. The small lattice  in one end of one long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A arranged along the third side of the one first large lattice A at the same pitch near the other corner of the one first large lattice A, and the small lattice  in the other end of the one long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A arranged along the first side of the other first large lattice A at the same pitch near the one corner of the other first large lattice A. Similarly, the small lattice  in one end of the other long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A arranged along the fourth side of the one first large lattice A at the same pitch near the other corner of the one first large lattice A, and the small lattice  in the other end of the other long straight line is positioned adjacent to the first dummy pattern A arranged along the second side of the other first large lattice A at the same pitch near the one corner of the other first large lattice A.","Of the two short straight lines, one short straight line contains two small lattices  connecting the 2nd small lattice  in the one long straight line from the one end and the 2nd small lattice  in the other long straight line from the one end. Similarly, the other short straight line contains two small lattices  connecting the 2nd small lattice  in the one long straight line from the other end and the 2nd small lattice  in the other long straight line from the other end.","When the small lattices  have an arrangement pitch of P, the first insulation A has a width of mP (in which m is an integer of 1 or more). The width of the first insulation A is defined as the shortest distance between the adjacent first conductive patterns A (i.e. the distance between the other corner of the one first large lattice A and the one corner of the other first large lattice A). Thus, the first insulation pattern A has a maximum length of mP or less in the width direction of the first insulation A. The maximum length is the distance between a part in the one short straight line facing the other corner of the one first large lattice A and a part in the other short straight line facing the one corner of the other first large lattice A.","As shown in , in the above-constructed conductive pattern, in one end of each first conductive pattern A, the first connection A is not formed on the open end of the first large lattice A. In the other end of the first conductive pattern A, the end of the first large lattice A is electrically connected to the corresponding first terminal wiring pattern by a first wire connection in the first terminal wiring region ","As shown in , the second large lattice B on the other main surface of the transparent support  has an approximately octagonal shape unlike the first large lattice A. The second large lattice B has four short sides  (a first short side to a fourth short side ) and four long sides  (a first long side to a fourth long side ). With respect to the second large lattices B which are adjacent to each other in the y direction, the second connection B is formed between the first short side of one second large lattice B and the second short side of the other second large lattice B. With respect to the second large lattices B which are adjacent to each other in the x direction, the second insulation B is formed between the third short side of one second large lattice B and the fourth short side of the other second large lattice B.","The four long sides  of the second large lattice B each have a straight line shape. Of the four long sides , the first long side and the second long side are adjacent to the third short side facing one second insulation B, and the third long side and the fourth long side are adjacent to the fourth short side facing another second insulation B.","In the second connection B, the four medium lattices  (the fifth medium lattice to the eighth medium lattice ) are arranged in a zigzag manner, and each of the medium lattices  has a size equal to the total size of four small lattices . The fifth medium lattice is disposed on the first short side , and forms an L-shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The sixth medium lattice is disposed on one side of the fifth medium lattice , and forms such a square space that four small lattices  are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The seventh medium lattice is adjacent to one vertex of the fifth medium lattice and one side of the sixth medium lattice , and has the same shape as the sixth medium lattice . The eighth medium lattice is disposed on the second short side , is adjacent to one vertex of the sixth medium lattice and one side of the seventh medium lattice , and forms an L-shaped space in combination with one small lattice  similarly to the fifth medium lattice . When the small lattices  have an arrangement pitch of P, the medium lattices  have an arrangement pitch of 2P.","The above described second dummy pattern B is formed near each of the four long sides  of the second large lattice B (the first long side to the fourth long side ). The second dummy pattern B is formed such that two or more parts each having a shape corresponding to the partially-removed small lattice  are arranged along the corresponding straight side. In the example of , the part has a shape formed by removing one side from the small lattice  and thus the shape has an approximately U-shape, and ten of the parts are arranged such that the openings are opened in the direction away from the corresponding long side of the second large lattice B. The arrangement pitch of the parts is twice as large as the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices  in the second large lattices B. For example, the shortest distance between the straight line shape of the first long side and the approximately U-shape of the second dummy pattern B is approximately equal to the side length of the inner periphery of the small lattice . This is true also for the second long side to the fourth long side ","In the second insulation B, a second insulation pattern B unconnected to the second large lattices B is formed. The second insulation pattern B has a second assembly pattern portion containing two or more small lattices arranged, a first bend pattern portion and a second bend pattern portion each containing two approximately U-shapes, and a fourth space containing no small lattices .","Specifically, the second assembly pattern portion is formed by arranging a plurality of the small lattices  in a matrix so as to connect the vertices of the small lattices . The number (e.g., six) of the small lattices  is such that they can be accommodated in the first space of the first insulation pattern A in the first conductive pattern A shown in .","The first bend pattern portion has the two approximately U-shapes formed on one end of the second insulation pattern B (between the intersection of the fourth short side and the third long side in one second large lattice B and the intersection of the third short side and the first long side in another second large lattice B). The ends of the two approximately U-shapes are connected, an angle formed by the sides at the ends being approximately 90\u00b0.","Similarly, the second bend pattern portion has the two approximately U-shapes formed on the other end of the second insulation pattern B (between the intersection of the fourth short side and the fourth long side in the one second large lattice B and the intersection of the third short side and the second long side in the other second large lattice B). The ends of the two approximately U-shapes are connected, an angle formed by the sides at the ends being approximately 90\u00b0.","The fourth space comprises an empty space containing no small lattices  and has a shape in which the four straight lines of the first assembly pattern portion in the first insulation pattern A shown in  can be accommodated.","When the small lattices  have an arrangement pitch of P, the second insulation B has a width of nP (in which n is an integer of 1 or more). The width of the second insulation B is defined as the shortest distance between the adjacent second conductive patterns B (i.e. the distance between the fourth short side of the one second large lattice B and the third short side of the other second large lattice B). Thus, the second insulation pattern B has a maximum length of nP or less, preferably less than nP, in the width direction of the second insulation B. The maximum length is the distance between a part facing the fourth short side of the one second large lattice B and a part facing the third short side of the other second large lattice B in the second assembly pattern portion ","As shown in , in the above-constructed conductive pattern, in one end of each second conductive pattern B, the second connection B is not formed on the open end of the second large lattice B. In the other end of the second conductive pattern B, the end of the second large lattice B is electrically connected to the corresponding second terminal wiring pattern by a second wire connection in the second terminal wiring region ","As shown in , the positional pattern relation between the first silver image formed on the one main surface of the transparent support  and the second silver image formed on the other main surface thereof is such that the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the transparent support  interposed therebetween, and also the first insulations A of the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the transparent support  interposed therebetween. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines respectively in order to clearly represent the positions thereof in , actually they have the same line width.","When the conductive sheet  is observed from above, the spaces between the first large lattices A are filled with the second large lattices B. Thus, the sensing region  is covered with the large lattices. In this case, the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B overlap with each other to form combined patterns between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B. The combined pattern has a width equal to or larger than the side length of the small lattices . The width of the combined pattern is defined as the shortest distance projected on the one main surface of the transparent support , for example, between the first side of the first large lattice A and the second long side (facing the first side ) of the second large lattice B. In the example of , the width of the combined pattern is twice as large as the side length of the small lattices . This is true also for the relations between the second side to the fourth side of the first large lattice A and the second long side to the fourth long side of the second large lattice B.","Thus, as viewed from above, the openings of the approximately U-shapes in the first dummy patterns A along the first large lattices A are connected and closed by the straight long sides of the second large lattices B, and the bottoms of the approximately U-shapes in the first dummy patterns A are connected by the bottoms of the approximately U-shapes in the second dummy patterns B along the second large lattices B. Similarly, the openings of the approximately U-shapes in the second dummy patterns B along the second large lattices B are connected and closed by the straight long sides of the first large lattices A, and the bottoms of the approximately U-shapes in the second dummy patterns B are connected by the bottoms of the approximately U-shapes in the first dummy patterns A along the first large lattices A. As a result, as viewed from above, a plurality of the small lattices  are arranged, and the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B can hardly be found.","For example, in the case of not forming the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B, blank areas corresponding to the combined pattern width are formed, whereby the edges of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are highly visible, resulting in deterioration of the visibility. This problem might be solved by overlapping each side of the first large lattices A with the corresponding long side of the second large lattices B to prevent the formation of the blank area. However, when the stack position accuracy is slightly deteriorated, the overlaps of the straight lines have large widths (the straight lines are thickened), whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are highly visible, resulting in deterioration of the visibility.","In contrast, in this embodiment, the first dummy patterns A and the second dummy patterns B are stacked in the above manner, whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are made less visible to improve the visibility.","When the overlap of the first connection A and the second connection B is observed from above, the connection point of the fifth medium lattice and the seventh medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the second medium lattice in the first connection A, and the connection point of the sixth medium lattice and the eighth medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the third medium lattice in the first connection A. Thus, the first medium lattice to the eighth medium lattice form a plurality of the small lattices  in combination. Therefore, the small lattices  are formed by the combination of the first connections A and the second connections B in the overlaps thereof. Thus formed small lattices  cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, so that the visibility is improved.","When the overlap of the first insulation pattern A of the first insulation A and the second insulation pattern B of the second insulation B is observed from above, the first assembly pattern portion of the first insulation pattern A faces the fourth space of the second insulation pattern B, and the first space of the first insulation pattern A faces the second assembly pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B. Furthermore, the second space of the first insulation pattern A faces the first bend pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B, and the third space of the first insulation pattern A faces the second bend pattern portion of the second insulation pattern B. In this case, as viewed from above, the openings of the first bend pattern portion are connected and closed by the straight line shapes of the third side and the fourth side near the other corner of the first large lattice A, and the openings of the second bend pattern portion are connected and closed by the straight line shapes of the first side and the second side near the one corner of the first large lattice A. Therefore, the first insulation patterns A and the second insulation patterns B form a plurality of the small lattices  in combination. Thus formed small lattices  cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, so that the visibility is improved.","When the conductive sheet  is used in a touch panel, a protective layer is formed on each of the first silver image and the second silver image , and the first terminal wiring patterns extending from the first conductive patterns A in the first silver image and the second terminal wiring patterns extending from the second conductive patterns B in the second silver image are connected to an IC circuit such as a scan control circuit. It is preferred that the first wire connections between the first conductive patterns A and the first terminal wiring patterns are linearly arranged, and the second wire connections between the second conductive patterns B and the second terminal wiring patterns are linearly arranged, whereby the periphery area of the conductive sheet  (the frame area around the display screen of the liquid crystal display device) is minimized.","When a finger comes into contact with the protective layer, signals are transmitted from the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B corresponding to the finger touch position to the IC circuit. The finger touch position is calculated in the IC circuit based on the transmitted signals. Thus, even when two fingers come into contact with the protective layer simultaneously, the finger touch positions can be detected.","Though the small lattice  has a square shape in the above conductive sheet , it may have another polygonal shape. Each side of the small lattice  may have a straight line shape, a curved shape, or an arc shape. When the small lattice  has arc-shaped sides, for example, two opposite sides may have an outwardly protruding arc shape, and the other two opposite sides may have an inwardly protruding arc shape. Alternatively, each side may have a wavy shape containing outwardly protruding arcs and inwardly protruding arcs formed continuously. Of course, each side may have a sine curve shape.","Though the arrangement pitch of the medium lattices  in the first connections A and the second connections B is twice larger than the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices  in the above conductive sheet , it may be appropriately selected depending on the number of the medium lattices . The arrangement pitch of the medium lattices  may be 1.5, 3 times, etc. larger than the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices . When the arrangement pitch of the medium lattices  is excessively small or large, it may be difficult to arrange the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, resulting in poor appearance. Thus, the arrangement pitch of the medium lattices  is preferably 1 to 10 times, more preferably 1 to 5 times, larger than the arrangement pitch P of the small lattices .","Also, the sizes of the small lattices  (including the side length and the diagonal line length), the number of the small lattices  in the first large lattice A, and the number of the small lattices  in the second large lattice B may be appropriately selected depending on the size and the resolution (the line number) of the touch panel adopting the conductive sheet.","Another preferred method for producing the conductive film according to an embodiment of the present invention by use of a photographic photosensitive silver halide material will be described below.","The method for producing the conductive film  according to the present invention includes the following three processes different in the photosensitive materials  and development treatments.","(1) A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei to a chemical or thermal development to form the conductive patterns  on the photosensitive material .","(2) A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing physical development nuclei to a solution physical development to form the conductive patterns  on the photosensitive material .","(3) A process comprising subjecting a stack of a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei and an image-receiving sheet having a non-photosensitive layer containing physical development nuclei to a diffusion transfer development to form the conductive patterns  on the non-photosensitive image-receiving sheet.","In the process of (1), an integral black-and-white development procedure is used to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material . The resulting silver is a chemically or thermally developed silver containing a high-specific surface area filament, and thereby shows a high activity in the following plating or physical development treatment.","In the process of (2), the silver halide particles are melted around and deposited on the physical development nuclei in the exposed areas to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material . Also in this process, an integral black-and-white development procedure is used. Though high activity can be achieved since the silver halide is deposited on the physical development nuclei in the development, the developed silver has a spherical shape with small specific surface.","In the process of (3), the silver halide particles are melted in the unexposed areas, and are diffused and deposited on the development nuclei of the image-receiving sheet, to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting conductive film on the image-receiving sheet. In this process, a so-called separate-type procedure is used, the image-receiving sheet being peeled off from the photosensitive material .","A negative or reversal development treatment can be used in the processes. In the diffusion transfer development, the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto-positive photosensitive material.","The chemical development, thermal development, solution physical development, and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art, and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin-ichi Kikuchi, \u201cShashin Kagaku (Photographic Chemistry)\u201d, Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., 1955 and C. E. K. Mees, \u201cThe Theory of Photographic Processes, 4th ed.\u201d, Mcmillan, 1977. Though a liquid treatment is generally used in the present invention, also another development treatment such as a thermal development treatment can be utilized. For example, techniques described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2004-184693, 2004-334077, and 2005-010752 and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004-244080 and 2004-085655 can be used in the present invention.","The structure of each layer in the conductive film  of the above embodiment will be described in detail below.","[Transparent Support ]","The transparent support  may be a plastic film, a plastic plate, a glass plate, etc.","Examples of materials for the plastic film and the plastic plate include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates (PET) and polyethylene naphthalates (PEN); polyolefins such as polyethylenes (PE), polypropylenes (PP), polystyrenes, and EVA; vinyl resins; polycarbonates (PC); polyamides; polyimides; acrylic resins; and triacetyl celluloses (TAC).","The transparent support  is preferably a film or plate of a plastic having a melting point of about 290\u00b0 C. or lower, such as PET (melting point 258\u00b0 C.), PEN (melting point 269\u00b0 C.), PE (melting point 135\u00b0 C.), PP (melting point 163\u00b0 C.), polystyrene (melting point 230\u00b0 C.), polyvinyl chloride (melting point 180\u00b0 C.), polyvinylidene chloride (melting point 212\u00b0 C.), or TAC (melting point 290\u00b0 C.). The PET is particularly preferred from the viewpoints of light transmittance, workability, etc. The conductive film  for the touch panel is required to be transparent, and therefore the transparent support  preferably has a high transparency.","[First Photosensitive Layer and Second Photosensitive Layer ","Each of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer contains a silver salt and a binder and may further contain a solvent and an additive.","The silver salt used in this embodiment may be an inorganic silver salt such as a silver halide or an organic silver salt such as silver acetate.

For example, the tone of 4.0 or more can be obtained by doping with rhodium or iridium ion or by adding a polyethylene oxide derivative to the developer.","(Film Hardening Treatment after Development)","It is preferred that after the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are developed, the resultant should be immersed in a hardener and thus subjected to a film hardening treatment. Examples of the hardeners include potash alums, dialdehydes (such as glutaraldehyde, adipaldehyde, and 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-dioxane), and boric acids, described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 02-141279.","The conductive film  is obtained by the above steps.

(without temperature control) to 50\u00b0 C. in general.","[Treatment with Vapor Contact]","In the production method of the present embodiment, the conductive patterns may be brought into contact with a vapor in a vapor contact step after the smoothing treatment. In the vapor contact step, the smoothed conductive patterns  may be brought into contact with a superheated vapor or with a pressurized vapor (or a pressurized saturated vapor). The conductivity and transparency can be readily improved in a short time by this step. In this step, a water-soluble binder may be partly removed, so that the bindings between the conductive metal substances may be increased.","In the production method of this embodiment, the conductive patterns  are preferably water-washed after the treatment with the superheated or pressurized vapor. The binder dissolved or embrittled by the superheated or pressurized vapor can be removed by the water washing after the vapor contact treatment, to improve the conductivity.","[Plating Treatment]","In this embodiment, the conductive patterns  may be subjected to a plating treatment in addition to the smoothing treatment. By the plating treatment, the surface resistance can be further lowered to improve the conductivity. The smoothing treatment may be carried out before or after the plating treatment.

The conductive pattern  may have a part with a line width of more than 10 \u03bcm for the purpose of connection to a control IC circuit, connection to ground, etc.","Particularly in the case of using the conductive film  in the touch panel, it is preferred that the first silver image and the second silver image have the lattice conductive patterns  composed of a plurality of polygons, the lattice conductive patterns  have an arrangement pitch of 300 \u03bcm or less and a total light transmittance of 80% or more, and the difference between the opening ratio of the first silver image and the opening ratio of the second silver image is 1% or less. The term \u201cthe opening ratio of the first silver image \u201d as used herein means the opening ratio of the effective area on the one main surface of the transparent support  (the effective area excluding the outer periphery on which the first silver image is not disposed), and the term \u201cthe opening ratio of the second silver image \u201d as used herein means the opening ratio of the effective area on the other main surface of the transparent support  (the effective area excluding the outer periphery on which the second silver image is not disposed). The opening ratio of the first silver image is the ratio of the light-transmitting portions (other than the conductive patterns ) to the entire surface of the first silver image , and the opening ratio of the second silver image is the ratio of the light-transmitting portions (other than the conductive patterns ) to the entire surface of the second silver image ","[Light-Transmitting Portion]","In this embodiment, in the conductive film , the light-transmitting portions are areas having a light transmission property other than the conductive patterns .

When the thickness is 5 to 350 \u03bcm, a desired visible light transmittance can be obtained, and the transparent support  can be easily handled.","The thicknesses of the conductive patterns  formed on the transparent support  may be appropriately selected by controlling the thicknesses of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer applied to the transparent support . In the case of using the conductive film  in the touch panel, the conductive pattern  preferably has a smaller thickness. As the thickness is reduced, the viewing angle and visibility of the display panel are improved. Thus, the thickness of each conductive pattern  is preferably 0.5 to 3 \u03bcm, more preferably 1.0 to 2.5 \u03bcm.","The plating or the like is not necessarily carried out in the method for producing the conductive film  of this embodiment. This is because the desired surface resistance can be obtained by controlling the applied silver amounts and the silver\/binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer in this method for producing the conductive film  according to the present embodiment. The calender treatment or the like may be carried out if necessary.","The present invention may be appropriately combined with technologies described in the following patent publications and international patent pamphlets shown in Tables 1 and 2. \u201cJapanese Laid-Open Patent\u201d, \u201cPublication No.\u201d, \u201cPamphlet No.\u201d, etc. are omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0169","num":"0168"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["2004-221564","2004-221565","2007-200922","2006-352073","2007-129205"]},{"entry":["2007-235115","2007-207987","2006-012935","2006-010795","2006-228469"]},{"entry":["2006-332459","2009-21153","2007-226215","2006-261315","2007-072171"]},{"entry":["2007-102200","2006-228473","2006-269795","2006-269795","2006-324203"]},{"entry":["2006-228478","2006-228836","2007-009326","2006-336090","2006-336099"]},{"entry":["2006-348351","2007-270321","2007-270322","2007-201378","2007-335729"]},{"entry":["2007-134439","2007-149760","2007-208133","2007-178915","2007-334325"]},{"entry":["2007-310091","2007-116137","2007-088219","2007-207883","2007-013130"]},{"entry":["2005-302508","2008-218784","2008-227350","2008-227351","2008-244067"]},{"entry":["2008-267814","2008-270405","2008-277675","2008-277676","2008-282840"]},{"entry":["2008-283029","2008-288305","2008-288419","2008-300720","2008-300721"]},{"entry":["2009-4213","2009-10001","2009-16526","2009-21334","2009-26933"]},{"entry":["2008-147507","2008-159770","2008-159771","2008-171568","2008-198388"]},{"entry":["2008-218096","2008-218264","2008-224916","2008-235224","2008-235467"]},{"entry":["2008-241987","2008-251274","2008-251275","2008-252046","2008-277428"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0170","num":"0169"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["2006\/001461","2006\/088059","2006\/098333","2006\/098336","2006\/098338"]},{"entry":["2006\/098335","2006\/098334","2007\/001008"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to Examples.
