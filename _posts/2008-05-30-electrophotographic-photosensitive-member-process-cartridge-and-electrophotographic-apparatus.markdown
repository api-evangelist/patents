{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/159,307, filed Jun. 23, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,396,622, issued Jul. 8, 2008.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have the electrophotographic photosensitive member.","2. Related Background Art","In recent years, in electrophotographic apparatus such as copying machines and printers, widely used is an electrophotographic photosensitive member (an organic electrophotographic photosensitive member) having a photosensitive layer containing an organic charge-generating material and a charge-transporting material. As such a photosensitive layer, from the viewpoint of durability, what is prevalent is one having layer configuration of a multi-layer type (regular-layer type) in which a charge generation layer containing a charge-generating material and a charge transport layer (a hole transport layer) containing a charge-transporting material are superposed in this order from the support side.","Of charge-generating materials, a charge-generating material having sensitivity in the red or infrared region is used in electrophotographic photosensitive members mounted to laser beam printers or the like having markedly advanced in recent years, and the demand therefor has increased with more frequency. As charge-generating materials having a high sensitivity in the red or infrared region, phthalocyanine pigments such as oxytitanium phthalocyanine, hydroxygallium phthalocyanine and chlorogallium phthalocyanine and azo pigments such as monoazo, bisazo and trisazo pigments are known in the art.","There, however, has been a problem that, where such highly sensitive charge-generating materials are used, electric charges are generated in so large a quantity that electrons existing after holes have been injected into the hole transport layer tend to stagnate in the charge generation layer to tend to cause memory. Stated specifically, what is called a positive ghost, in which the image density comes high only at areas exposed to light at previous rotation, and what is called a negative ghost, in which the image density comes low only at areas exposed to light at previous rotation, are seen in images reproduced.","As background art which can keep such a ghost phenomenon from occurring, Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H11-172142 and No. 2002-091039 disclose techniques in which II-type chlorogallium phthalocyanine is used as the charge-generating material. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H07-104495 discloses a technique in which a charge generation layer making use of oxytitanium phthalocyanine is incorporated with an acceptor compound. Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. 2000-292946 and No. 2002-296817 disclose techniques in which a charge generation layer making use of a phthalocyanine is incorporated with a dithiobenzyl compound. Besides, Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H02-136860, No. H02-136861, No. H02-146048, No. H02-146049, No. H02-146050, No. H05-150498, No. H06-313974, No. 2000-039730, No. 2000-292946 and No. 2002-296817 disclose techniques in which the charge generation layer is incorporated with an electron-transporting material, an electron-accepting material or an electron-attracting material.","Incidentally, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-040237 discloses a technique in which, for the purpose of making sensitivity higher, an organic acceptor compound is added in the step of pigmentation to produce phthalocyanine crystals.","Electrophotographic techniques have made remarkable progress in these days, and electrophotographic photosensitive members are also required to have much superior performance.","For example, black and white images such as characters or letters have been main in the past. In recent years, however, there is an increasing demand for color images of photographs or the like, and the requirement for their image quality is becoming higher year after year.","The above ghost phenomenon tends to appear especially in halftone images, and especially come into important question in color images, which are often formed by superimposing halftone images.","In addition, in the case of color images, even though the level of a ghost for each color is equal to that of black and white images, the ghost phenomenon tends to appear conspicuously because a plurality of colors are superimposed.","As a method for keeping the ghost phenomenon from occurring, a method is available in which the electrophotographic apparatus is provided with a destaticizing means such as pre-exposure. However, from the viewpoint of making the electrophotographic apparatus main body low-cost and small-size, it has become frequent to provide no destaticizing means.","The above background art has not been sayable to be well effective for such circumstances that are severe on the ghost phenomenon.","An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member that is excellently effective in keeping ghosts from occurring, and can not easily cause the ghost phenomenon even when mounted to color electrophotographic apparatus or electrophotographic apparatus having no destaticizing means, and provide a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have such an electrophotographic photosensitive member.","That is, the present invention is an electrophotographic photosensitive member comprising a support, a charge generation layer containing a charge-generating material and a binder resin, provided on the support, and a hole transport layer containing a hole-transporting material, provided on the charge generation layer, wherein;","the charge generation layer contains a phenanthrene compound having a structure represented by the following formula (2), a phenanthroline compound having a structure represented by the following formula (3) or an acenaphthene compound having a structure represented by the following formula (4).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"24.21mm","wi":"58.42mm","file":"US07592113-20090922-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["201 ","202 ","201 ","202 "],"sub":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"24.38mm","wi":"58.42mm","file":"US07592113-20090922-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (3), Zand Zeach independently represent an oxygen atom, a \u2550C(CN)group or a \u2550N-Ph group;

For example, usable are supports made of a metal (or made of an alloy) such as aluminum, nickel, copper, gold, iron, aluminum alloy or stainless steel. Also usable are the above supports made of a metal, supports made of a plastic (such as polyester resin, polycarbonate resin or polyimide resin) and supports made of glass, having a coating layer formed by vacuum deposition of aluminum, aluminum alloy, indium oxide-tin oxide alloy or the like. Still also usable are supports comprising plastic or paper impregnated with conductive fine particles such as carbon black, tin oxide particles, titanium oxide particles or silver particles together with a suitable binder resin, and supports made of a plastic containing a conductive binder resin. Also, as the shape of the support, it may include cylindrical and beltlike. A cylindrical support is preferred.","For the purpose of prevention of interference fringes caused by scattering of laser light or the like, the surface of the support may be subjected to cutting, surface roughening (such as honing or blasting) or aluminum anodizing, or may be subjected to chemical treatment with a solution prepared by dissolving a metal salt compound or a metal salt of a fluorine compound in an acidic aqueous solution composed chiefly of an alkali phosphate, phosphoric acid or tannic acid.","The honing includes dry honing and wet honing. The wet honing is a method in which a powdery abrasive is suspended in a liquid such as water and the suspension obtained is sprayed on the surface of the support at a high speed to roughen the surface of the support, where the surface roughness may be controlled by selecting spray pressure or speed, the quantity, type, shape, size, hardness or specific gravity of the abrasive, suspension temperature, and so forth. The dry honing is a method in which an abrasive is sprayed by air on the surface of the support at a high speed to roughen the surface of the support, where the surface roughness may be controlled in the same way as the wet honing. The abrasive used in the honing may include particles of silicon carbide, alumina, iron, and glass beads.","A conductive layer intended for the prevention of interference fringes caused by scattering of laser light or the like or for the covering of scratches of the support surface may be provided between the support and the charge generation layer or an intermediate layer described later.","The conductive layer may be formed with a dispersion prepared by dispersing conductive particles such as carbon black, metal particles or metal oxide particles in a binder resin. Preferable metal oxide particles may include particles of zinc oxide or titanium oxide. Also, as the conductive particles, particles of barium sulfate may be used. The conductive particles may be provided with coat layers.","The conductive particles may preferably have volume resistivity in the range of from 0.1 to 1,000 \u03a9cm, and, in particular, more preferably in the range of from 1 to 1,000 \u03a9cm (This volume resistivity is the value determined by measurement made using a resistance meter LORESTA AP, manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. A sample for measurement is one hardened at a pressure of 49 MPa so as to be made into a coin.). Also, the conductive particles may preferably have average particle diameter in the range of from 0.05 \u03bcm to 1.0 \u03bcm, and, in particular, more preferably in the range of from 0.07 \u03bcm to 0.7 \u03bcm (This average particle diameter is the value measured by centrifugal sedimentation.). The proportion of the conductive particles in the conductive layer may preferably be in the range of from 1.0 to 90% by weight, and, in particular, more preferably in the range of from 5.0 to 80% by weight, based on the total weight of the conductive layer.","The binder resin used in the conductive layer may include, e.g., phenol resins, polyurethane resins, polyamide resins, polyimide resins, polyamide-imide resins, polyamic acid resins, polyvinyl acetal resins, epoxy resins, acrylic resins, melamine resins and polyester resins. Any of these may be used alone or in the form of a mixture or copolymer of two or more types. These have good adhesion to the support, and also improve dispersibility of the conductive particles and have good solvent resistance after films have been formed. Of these, phenol resins, polyurethane resins and polyamic acid resins are preferred.","The conductive layer may preferably be in a layer thickness of from 0.1 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm, and, in particular, more preferably from 0.5 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm.","The conductive layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of 10\u03a9cm or less, and, in particular, more preferably in the range of from 10to 10\u03a9cm (This volume resistivity is the value determined by forming a coating film on an aluminum plate using the same material as the conductive layer on which the volume resistivity is to be measured, forming a thin gold film on this coating film, and measuring with a pA meter the value of electric current flowing across both electrodes, the aluminum plate and the thin gold film.).","The conductive layer may also optionally be incorporated with fluorine or antimony, or a leveling agent may be added to the conductive layer in order to improve its surface properties.","An intermediate layer (also called a subbing layer or an adhesion layer) having the function as a barrier and the function of adhesion may also be provided between the support or the conductive layer and the charge generation layer. The intermediate layer is formed for the purposes of, e.g., improving the adhesion of the photosensitive layer, improving coating performance, improving the injection of electric charges from the support and protecting the photosensitive layer from any electrical breakdown.","The intermediate layer may be formed using a resin such as acrylic resin, allyl resin, alkyd resin, ethyl cellulose resin, an ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer, epoxy resin, casein resin, silicone resin, gelatin resin, nylon, phenol resin, butyral resin, polyacrylate resin, polyacetal resin, polyamide-imide resin, polyamide resin, polyallyl ether resin, polyimide resin, polyurethane resin, polyester resin, polyethylene resin, polycarbonate resin, polystyrene resin, polysulfone resin, polyvinyl alcohol resin, polybutadiene resin, polypropylene resin or urea resin, or a material such as aluminum oxide.","The intermediate layer may preferably be in a layer thickness of 0.05 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm, and, in particular, more preferably from 0.3 \u03bcm to 3 \u03bcm.","The charge-generating material used in the electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention may include, e.g., azo pigments such as monoazo, disazo and trisazo, phthalocyanine pigments such as metal phthalocyanines and metal-free phthalocyanine, indigo pigments such as indigo and thioindigo, perylene pigments such as perylene acid anhydrides and perylene acid imides, polycyclic quinone pigments such as anthraquinone and pyrenequinone, squarilium dyes, pyrylium salts, thiapyrylium salts, triphenylmethane dyes, inorganic materials such as selenium, selenium-tellurium and amorphous silicon, quinacridone pigments, azulenium salt pigments, cyanine dyes, xanthene dyes, quinoneimine dyes, styryl dyes, cadmium sulfide, and zinc oxide. Any of these charge-generating materials may be used alone or in combination of two or more types.","Of the above various charge-generating materials, azo pigments and phthalocyanine pigments are preferred in that they have high sensitivity but on the other hand tend to cause the ghost phenomenon and hence the present invention may more effectively act thereon. Phthalocyanine pigments are particularly preferred.

The present inventors presumes it as stated below.","That is, the ghost phenomenon is a phenomenon which is caused by the potential difference that comes after irradiation with exposure light at the time of next drum rotation because of a difference between the number of electrons remaining at areas having been irradiated with exposure light (imagewise exposure light) and the number of electrons remaining at areas having not been irradiated with exposure light.","Electric charges (holes and electrons) are generated by the charge-generating material upon irradiation by exposure light. Where the charge generation layer is a layer containing the charge-generating material and the binder resin, the holes and electrons having been separated move on through the interior of the binder resin, and hence are considered to greatly take over the properties of the binder resin. In the case of the electrophotographic photosensitive member comprising a charge generation layer and provided thereon a hole transport layer, i.e., a negatively chargeable multi-layer type electrophotographic photosensitive member as in the present invention, the holes continue to be injected into the hole transport layer, whereas the electrons tend to remain in the binder resin of the charge generation layer, and cause the potential difference to make the ghost phenomenon occur.","In the present invention, the charge generation layer is incorporated with the phenanthrene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (2), the phenanthroline compound having the structure represented by the above formula (3) or the acenaphthene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (4). This compound is what is called an electron transporting material, which has electron transporting ability, and hence it can lower the level of electrons remaining in the binder resin of the charge generation layer, as so considered.","It is also considered that the electrons move on through the interior of the binder resin, and is considered that the effect of keeping the ghost phenomenon from occurring can be obtained by smoothing such movement of electrons. Accordingly, the phenanthrene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (2), the phenanthroline compound having the structure represented by the above formula (3) or the acenaphthene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (4) may preferably be made so present as to stand molecular dispersion in the binder resin. The phenanthrene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (2), the phenanthroline compound having the structure represented by the above formula (3) or the acenaphthene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (4) may also preferably be in a content of from 15 to 120% by weight, and, in particular, more preferably from 51 to 80% by weight, based on the weight of the binder resin in the charge generation layer. If it is in a too small content, the effect of keeping the ghost phenomenon from occurring may come poor.","To form such a charge generation layer, the phenanthrene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (2), the phenanthroline compound having the structure represented by the above formula (3) or the acenaphthene compound having the structure represented by the above formula (4) may be added (preferably in an amount of from 15 to 120% by weight, and more preferably from 51 to 80% by weight, based on the weight of the binder resin) to a fluid prepared by dispersing or dissolving the charge-generating material and the binder resin in a solvent, to make up a charge generation layer coating fluid, and this charge generation layer coating fluid may be coated, followed by drying. The coating fluid containing the charge-generating material, the binder resin and the solvent is obtained by subjecting the charge-generating material to dispersion together with the binder resin and the solvent.
