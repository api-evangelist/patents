title: Ventilation sensor rate response normalization and calculation
abstract: A cardiac rhythm management (CRM) device can extract ventilation information from thoracic impedance or other information, and adjust a delivery rate of the CRM therapy. A tidal volume of a patient is measured and used to adjust a ventilation rate response factor. The measured tidal volume can optionally be adjusted using a ventilation rate dependent adjustment factor. The ventilation rate response factor can also be adjusted using a maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), an age predicted maximum heart rate, a resting heart rate, and a resting ventilation determined for the patient. In various examples, a global ventilation sensor rate response factor (for a population) can be programmed into the CRM device, and automatically tailored to be appropriate for a particular patient.

Section 119(e), to Paul Emerson et al., U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/181,044, entitled \u201cVentilation Sensor Rate Response Normalization and Calculation,\u201d filed on May 26, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Implantable medical devices (IMDs) include devices designed to be implanted into a patient. Some examples of these devices are cardiac function management (CFM) devices such as implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRTs), neuromodulation devices, or devices that include a combination of such capabilities. Such devices can often be used to treat patients using electrical or other therapy or to aid a physician or caregiver in patient diagnosis through internal monitoring of a patient's condition. The devices can include one or more electrodes in communication with one or more sense amplifiers to monitor electrical heart activity within a patient, and often include one or more physiological sensors to monitor one or more other internal patient parameters. Other examples of implantable medical devices include implantable diagnostic devices, implantable drug delivery systems, or implantable devices with neural stimulation capability, some of which can also be used as CFM devices.","This document relates generally to systems, devices, and methods for normalizing and calculating a minute ventilation rate response factor for a minute ventilation or other ventilation sensor.","Minute Ventilation (also referred to as \u201cminute volume\u201d or \u201cMV\u201d) is a respiratory-related parameter that is a measure of the volume of air inhaled and exhaled during a one-minute time interval. Minute ventilation can be conceptualized as the product of a patient's ventilation rate and the patient's tidal volume of air inhaled and exhaled during a particular breath. One or both of the patient's ventilation rate or tidal volume can be sensed using an impedance sensor that measures transthoracic impedance, which is modulated by the patient's breathing. Minute ventilation correlates well with the patient's metabolic need for an increased heart rate over a range of heart rates.","Typically, patients have similar potential heart rate range depending on their age. However, ohmic tidal volume measured in patients can differ substantially based on their chest size, the positioning of impedance sensors within the body cavity, current paths taken within the body cavity, etc. Large individuals with large thoracic movements may exhibit greater impedance differences than smaller individuals with smaller impedance differences. However, both types of individuals may have the same heart rate range. Additionally, deep breaths detected by a thoracic impedance sensor at a lower gain setting could have the same digitized tidal volume output as shallow breaths at a higher gain setting. Variation in tidal volume measurement can lead to inaccurate measurement of minute ventilation, which, in turn, can affect pacing therapy that can be based at least in part on the minute ventilation.","Example 1 includes a cardiac rhythm management system. In this example, the system optionally includes a signal processor configured to measure a tidal volume of a patient and to adjust a ventilation sensor rate response factor using information determined from the measured tidal volume.

processor.","In Example 5, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-4 optionally includes a signal processor including or coupled to a memory configured to store a plurality of resting tidal volumes, the signal processor comprising a central tendency computation circuit configured to compute a central tendency of the plurality of resting tidal volumes.","In Example 6, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-5 optionally includes a signal processor configured to adjust the ventilation sensor rate response factor using information determined from the measured tidal volume, including using the measured tidal volume to determine a normalization factor using a population-determined relationship between the tidal volume and the normalization factor.","In Example 7, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-6 optionally includes a population-determined relationship between the tidal volume and the normalization factor comprising a substantially inverse linear relationship for the normalization factor as a function of the tidal volume.","In Example 8, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-7 optionally includes a population-determined relationship between the tidal volume and the normalization factor comprising about a 4-to-1 range of the normalization factor over an expected range of tidal volumes for the population.","In Example 9, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-8 optionally includes a signal processor configured to adjust a ventilation sensor rate response factor using information determined from the measured tidal volume, including using a population-based ventilation rate response factor programmed into a cardiac rhythm management device, and automatically adjusting the population based ventilation rate response factor for the patient using a normalization factor determined using the measured tidal volume of the patient.","In Example 10, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-9 optionally includes a signal processor configured to adjust a ventilation sensor rate response factor using a measured minute ventilation at rest, an exercise equivalent minute ventilation, a resting heart rate, and an age predicted maximum heart rate determined for the patient.","The subject matter of Example 11 can include a process, or a memory circuit coupled to a processor, the memory circuit including instructions causing the processor to control or perform one or more of measuring a tidal volume of a patient, adjusting a ventilation sensor rate response factor using information determined from the measured tidal volume, and calculating a ventilation sensor driven pacing rate, including applying the adjusted ventilation sensor rate response factor to a deviation in an observed ventilation sensor output from a baseline.","In Example 12, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-11 optionally includes adjusting the ventilation sensor rate response using information obtained from a patient population.","In Example 13, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-12 optionally includes adjusting the ventilation rate response factor using a measured minute ventilation at rest, an exercise equivalent minute ventilation, a resting heart rate, and an age predicted maximum heart rate determined for the patient.","In Example 14, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-13 optionally includes scaling the maximum voluntary ventilation using a scaling factor, the scaling factor selected based on the patient's physical health condition.","In Example 15, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-14 optionally includes adjusting the measured tidal volume using a ventilation rate dependent adjustment to generate an adjusted measured tidal volume.","In Example 16, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-15 optionally includes measuring the tidal volume including receiving a plurality of resting tidal volumes, and computing a central tendency of a plurality of measured tidal volumes.","In Example 17, the subject matter of any one or more of Examples 1-16 optionally includes measuring the tidal volume and computing the central tendency of a plurality of the adjusted measured tidal volumes using an implantable medical device.","In Example 18, the subject matter of any one or more of

period.","This section is intended to provide an overview of subject matter of the present patent application. It is not intended to provide an exclusive or exhaustive explanation of the invention.

In an example, one or more portions of the system  (e.g., device ) can be disposed external to the human patient. In the illustrated example, portions of the lead  are disposed in the right ventricle; however, any other positioning of lead  can be used. For example, the lead  can be positioned in the atrium or elsewhere. In an example, the lead  can be a commercially available bipolar pacing lead. The system  can also include one or more other leads or electrodes (e.g., with a lead, or leadless), such as in addition to lead , appropriately disposed, such as in or around heart , or elsewhere.","In an example, the system  can include at least four electrodes, such as described in Hauck et al.

In an example, the impedance-derived ventilation signal, such as a minute ventilation signal, can be obtained by measuring transthoracic (across the chest or thorax) impedance. The measured transthoracic impedance can provide respiratory or ventilation information, including how fast and how deeply a patient is breathing. A component of transthoracic impedance varies as the patient inhales and exhales. Ventilation (e.g., breathing rate, which is also referred to as \u201cventilation rate\u201d or \u201cVR\u201d, and breathing volume, which is also referred to as \u201ctidal volume\u201d or \u201cTV\u201d) information is included in the thoracic impedance signal. A ventilation representative impedance difference can be associated with an Ohmic TV. A minute ventilation signal (also referred to as \u201cminute volume\u201d or \u201cMV\u201d) signal can be derived from the impedance signal, as illustrated by Equation (1a). MV measures airflow rate (e.g., liters per minute), Ohmic TV measures volume per breath (e.g., liters per breath), and VR measures breathing rate (e.g., breaths per minute).\n\n\u2003\u2003(1a)\n","In equation (1a), \u201ck\u201d represents a conversion constant having the units of liters\/ohm. A larger MV signal indicates a metabolic need for an increased heart rate, and a pacing rate can be adjusted accordingly by a cardiac rhythm management device, such as the device . We note that if the constant \u201ck\u201d is not available (which typically may be the case), then Equation (1b) applies, where an \u201cohmic minute ventilation\u201d or \u201cohmic minute volume\u201d having units ohms\/minute can be related to the ventilation rate and ohmic tidal volume. Typically, as will be described later, this Ohmic MV can be used to adjust the heart rate.\n\nOhmic MV=VR\u00d7Ohmic TV\u2003\u2003(1b)\n","An example of an approach for measuring transthoracic impedance is described in Hauck et al., U.S. Pat.

Based at least in part on the MV signal, the signal processor  can output an indicated pacing rate signal at node  to the controller . Based on the indicated pacing rate signal at node , the controller  can adjust the rate of delivery of cardiac rhythm management therapy, such as electrical pacing stimuli, to the heart  by the therapy circuit . Such pacing stimuli can include, for example, providing bipolar pacing such as between the tip electrode  and the ring electrode , providing unipolar pacing such as between the can electrode  and either of the tip electrode  or the ring electrode , or providing pacing stimuli using any other suitable electrode configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["155","155","200","205","210","200","145","120","150","200","215","210","220","220","225"]},"The A\/D converter  can receive the output signal of the bandpass filter  and can provide a resulting digitized output signal to a high pass filter  of the digital signal processing circuit . In an example, the A\/D converter  can be implemented as a 12-bit, successive approximation type switched-capacitor A\/D converter having an input range of approximately 1 Volt. In one example, A\/D converter  provides one 12-bit word corresponding to a sequence of current pulses delivered by exciter . Many different implementations of A\/D converter  can be suitable for use in the present systems and methods. An output signal from A\/D converter  can be received at the highpass filter  of the digital signal processing circuit .","In an example, the highpass filter  can include a single-pole infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter that can receive a 12-bit digital output signal from the A\/D converter . The highpass filter  can remove frequency components below its highpass cutoff frequency of approximately 0.1 Hz. Many other different examples of the highpass filter  may also be suitable for use in the present systems and methods. The highpass filter  can advantageously further attenuate baseline dc components of the transthoracic impedance, or low frequency shifts, such as may result from pulmonary edema or the like, and any dc-offset voltages created by A\/D converter . In an example, the output of the highpass filter  can be provided to an adaptive lowpass filter  that attenuates frequency components of the signal that exceed the lowpass cutoff frequency of the adaptive lowpass filter . Attenuated frequencies can include the cardiac stroke signal, resulting from changes in blood volume in heart  as it contracts during each cardiac cycle, which appears as a component of the transthoracic impedance signal. In an example, the lowpass cutoff frequency of the filter  can be adaptively based on a heart rate of the patient. In an example, the lowpass cutoff frequency can be independent of any breathing rate signal obtained from the patient. In an example, the adaptive lowpass filter  can use a Chebyshev filter. In an example, the adaptive lowpass filter  can include an Elliptic filter. In an example, the adaptive lowpass filter  can use a state-space structure, rather than a conventional direct form structure. The state-space structure can further reduce the effects of coefficient quantization and round-off noise. An example of such a state-space structure is described in Leland B. Jackson, \u201cDigital Filters and Signal Processing,\u201d 2ed., pp. 332-340, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, Mass., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","In an example, a digital signal processing circuit  can be included within the controller  such as, for example, as a sequence of instructions executed by a microprocessor. In an example, the digital signal processing circuit  can include separately implemented hardware portions dedicated to performing the digital signal processing tasks described herein. An output signal from the highpass filter  can be received by the adaptive low pass filter  of the digital signal processing circuit . A minute ventilation (MV) calculation module  can receive an output signal from the adaptive lowpass filter , and can provide a resulting indicated pacing rate signal at node  to the controller .","In an example, an MV calculation module  can be implemented as a sequence of instructions executed on any suitable microprocessor. Alternatively, or in addition, the MV calculation module  can also be implemented as any other hardware or software configuration capable of calculating an indicated pacing rate based on ventilation information. An example of such a sequence of instructions executed on a microprocessor for calculating minute ventilation indicated rate is described below, and illustrated in .","The MV calculation module  can receive, from the adaptive low pass filter , a digital signal representing a time-varying transthoracic impedance. In an example, the impedance signal can be centered around zero, with positive values representing inhalation, and negative values representing exhalation. The maximum (most positive) and the minimum (most negative) values of the impedance signal can be stored in separate storage registers. After each breath, an interrupt can be provided to the microprocessor, such as upon each positive-going zero-crossing.","In an example, the signal processor  can be configured to determining a moving short-term average (STA) and a concurrent long-term average (LTA) of the ohmic minute ventilation. In an example, the STA can include carrying out an average of the ohmic minute ventilation over about 30 seconds. In an example, the LTA can include carrying out an average of the ohmic ventilation over about 4 hours to about 5 hours. The STA can represent the present minute ventilation indication of metabolic need. Similarly, the LTA can represent approximates the resting state of the patient. In an example, the LTA is carried out by an IIR digital filter. Other forms of central tendency or other measures of centrality can be obtained rather than averages or means.","In an example, the LTA and STA can be compared such as by subtracting one from the other. The difference can optionally be scaled, and can be used to adjust the pacing rate when the STA exceeds LTA. In an example, the pacing rate can be adjusted according to equation (2).\n\nSENSOR RATE DELTA()\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In equation (2), \u201cK\u201d is a rate response factor that represents an optional scaling coefficient, LRL is a programmable lower limit to which the incremental sensor driven rate is added, and SENSOR RATE DELTAis the minute ventilation indicated rate at which pacing therapy is to be delivered. In an example, SENSOR RATE DELTAcan be a linear function of the difference STA\u2212LTA. Also, in this example, if the value of the short-term average (STA) is less than the value of the long-term average (LTA), then pacing therapy is delivered at the lower rate limit (LRL).","In an example, more than one scaling coefficient K can be used, such as for obtaining a piecewise linear mapping of minute ventilation to the resulting minute ventilation indicated rate. For example, when the STA\u2212LTA difference exceeds a certain threshold value, a smaller scaling coefficient Kcan be used. This reduces the incremental increase in pacing rate for high pacing rates, when compared to the incremental increase in pacing rate for pacing rates close to the lower rate limit (LRL).","In an example, a ratio STA\/LTA may be used, rather than the difference STA\u2212LTA used as described above. In such an example, the rate can be adjusted according to equation (3).\n\nSENSOR RATE DELTA()\u2003\u2003(3)\n","In equation (3), STA represents the short-term average, LTA represents the long-term average, \u201cK\u201d is the rate response factor that represents an optional scaling coefficient, LRL is a programmable lower rate limit to which the incremental sensor driven rate is added, and SENSOR RATE DELTAis the minute ventilation indicated rate at which pacing therapy is delivered. If the value of the short-term average (STA) is less than the value of the long-term average (LTA), pacing therapy can be delivered at the lower rate limit (LRL). In an example, the LRL used can be about 60 beats per minute. In an example, a reduced incremental rate can be obtained for higher pacing rates by using more than one scaling coefficient, such as described above.","Other rate modifiers can also be used to obtain a minute ventilation indicated rate. Moreover, the minute ventilation indicated rate can be combined, blended, or otherwise used in conjunction with other rate indicators, such as those derived from different sensors providing different indicators of metabolic need (e.g., an acceleration sensor indicating a physical exertion level of a subject). Such indicators can have different response characteristics (e.g., time lag after onset of exercise) that can be advantageously combined with the minute ventilation rate indication described above. Moreover, although the above description has been represented in terms of rate between successive heart contractions, one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that this is for conceptual convenience, and that implementation may instead use the time interval between successive heart contractions, or an appropriate combination of heart rate and heart rate interval.","The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that obtaining the desired pacing rate response to MV can involve tailoring the MV rate response factor (Kor K), for the particular patient\u2014which involves more effort for the physician or other user in programming the cardiac rhythm management device. For a particular patient, the measured TV can generally range from about 400 ml to about 4000 ml. The measured TV will generally depend upon the respiration rate (breathing rate) of the subject. Respiration rate generally varies within a range from about 6 breaths\/minute to about 70 breaths\/minute. In general, larger people having larger lungs generate larger thoracic impedance differences while breathing as opposed to the smaller thoracic impedance differences generated in people having smaller lungs. This is at least partially why the MV rate response factor must generally be tailored for the particular patient.","However, the present inventors have also recognized that can be possible to automatically tailor the MV rate response factor for the particular patient, such as based on a TV measurement of the particular patient, and on population-derived information from other patients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"At , resting TV can be measured for the particular patient, such as by using a single TV measurement or a central tendency (e.g., average, median, etc.) of a plurality of TV measurements (e.g., such as over a period that can range from about 2 minutes to several hours). In an example, while the average tidal volume is measured over a short time period (e.g. 2 minutes), a \u201cquick calibration\u201d is performed by having the patient sit quietly and breathe normally without talking. A much longer calibration period (e.g., 6 hours) can be used to perform an \u201cautomatic\u201d calibration. During the automatic calibration, the patient may carry on normal activities, wherein it is presumed that a large portion of the time period will be spent in a resting state so that the average tidal volume thus obtained will reflect the resting tidal volume.","At , a normalization factor (NF) can be selected, such as by using the TV measured for the particular patient as an x-axis index for selecting a corresponding NF, such as by using the graph of  to obtain the corresponding y-axis value for use as the NF.

A tidal volume measurement can be generated at  for individual breaths taken by the patient.","At , the measured ohmic tidal volume can be adjusted using a respiration-rate dependent adjustment factor to generate an adjusted ohmic tidal volume. For example, the respiration-rate dependent adjustment factor can be generated by applying an inverse function to that of the non-ideality in any non-ideal filters used in the signal processing circuit , such as to compensate for any non-idealities.","At , a central tendency of the adjusted ohmic tidal volumes can be computed, and used with  as the x-axis index for obtaining the y-axis normalization factor, NF.","At , a minute ventilation sensor rate response factor, K, can be adjusted to obtain a K.

In terms of the population the peak minute ventilation observed during maximal exercise can range from 0.61 to 1.07 of MVV. The lower limit is reached by individuals with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) while the other extreme (1.07) is reached by well trained athletes.","A cardiovascular limitation can be distinguished from a pulmonary limitation, in an example, by comparing an individual's peak exercise ventilation and the individual's resting MVV measurement. The patient's ventilatory reserve can be estimated by knowing the disease status (e.g., COPD, etc.) of the patient and the patient's resting MVV. If desired, the signal processing circuit  can be configured to provide an MV rate response that can substantially match the patient's ventilatory reserve to the patient's heart rate reserve.","At , a resting MV of a patient can be measured during a maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), such as by requesting the patient to forcibly breath as deeply and rapidly as possible for a prescribed time (e.g., 12 to 15 seconds) under a physician's supervision. The external programmer  can be used to activate MV measurement before the MVV forcible breathing maneuver. The signal processing circuit  can calculate the resting minute ventilation by measuring the transthoracic impedance during the MVV maneuver. The external programmer  can generate an audible or visual indication indicating that the calibration has been completed, so that the patient can discontinue the MVV forcible breathing maneuver.","At , a maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation can be computed, such as by using the resting minute ventilation measured at . The maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation can be computed using equation (6).\n\nMax Exercise Equivalent \u00d7Scaling Factor\u2003\u2003(6)\n","The minute ventilation observed during the MVV forcible breathing maneuver is multiplied by a scaling factor (e.g., 0.75). In an example, the scaling factor can be any specified value within the range including from about 0.67 to about 1.07. In an example, the nominal scaling factor that can be used is about 0.8. A scaling factor below the lower limit (e.g., below 0.67) can be used for COPD patients.","At , a minute ventilation sensor rate response factor can be adjusted using the computed maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation, an age predicted maximum heart rate, a resting heart rate, and the resting minute ventilation. The age predicted maximum heart rate (HR) can be given by equation (7):\n\n220\u2212(Age of the patient)\u2003\u2003(7)\n","For example, based on the equation (7), a 50-year-old patient can be predicted to have an age-predicted maximum heart rate of 170. In an example illustrated in , after MV calibration at  and computing the maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation at  (Eq. 6), two points (x, y) and (x, y) can be plotted on the graph. The heart rate is shown on the y-axis and ohmic minute ventilation on the x-axis. The first point includes an x-coordinate (x) that corresponds to the minute ventilation at rest (i.e. after calibration, labeled REST in the graph) and a y-coordinate (y) that corresponds to the Resting Heart Rate (which in a pacemaker patient is the Lower Rate Limit\u2014LRL). The second point (x, y) includes an x-coordinate (x) that corresponds to the maximum exercise equivalent minute ventilation and a y-coordinate (y) that corresponds to the age predicted maximum heart rate (e.g. APHRMAX=220\u2212patient age). The line drawn between (x, y) and (x, y) is the MV rate response factor, K.","The MV rate response factor Kdetermined in this fashion will be equivalent in most cases to the earlier Kwhich was derived from population data and which occurs automatically as part of calibration. The MVV derived K3 may be determined prior to the population derived Kis calculated. In either case it will supplant the population derived Kuntil the next MV calibration of the device. (Note: the MV calibration is good for the life of the device unless there is a lead revision or the user requests another calibration.)","The above description illustrates, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, a particular example of the present devices and methods in which ventilation information can be extracted from a detected transthoracic impedance, and the rate of delivery of cardiac rhythm management therapy can be adjusted based on an indicator derived from the ventilation information. However, the present devices and methods can also include extraction of other information (e.g., cardiac stroke information) from the transthoracic impedance, such as for adjusting the rate of delivery of cardiac rhythm management therapy based on an indicator extracted from such information. One such example is disclosed in Spinelli U.S. Pat. No. 5,235,976 entitled, \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING AND MONITORING CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT USING ACTIVE TIME AS THE CONTROLLING PARAMETER,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","An implantable medical device (IMD) may include one or more of the features, structures, methods, or combinations thereof described herein. For example, a cardiac monitor or a cardiac stimulator can be implemented to include one or more of the advantageous features or processes described above. It is intended that such a monitor, stimulator, or other implantable or partially implantable device need not include all of the features described herein, but can be implemented to include selected features that provide for unique structures or functionality. Such a device can be implemented to provide a variety of therapeutic or diagnostic functions.","The above detailed description includes references to the accompanying drawings, which form a part of the detailed description.
