ILs have also been defined as molten salts having a melting point below 100\u00b0 C. Recent interest in room temperature ionic liquids has increased due to unique characteristics of those compounds, such as a unique solubility, negligible vapor pressure, a wide electrochemical window and good thermal stability. Due to the negligible vapor pressure of ILs, they have been identified as environmentally friendly as they would not contribute to air pollution or to the generation of potentially toxic emissions when used as a solvent. As a result of these advantageous characteristics, ILs have potential use in a number of applications, including but not limited to synthesis, as both solvents and catalysts; energy storage, as electrolytes; extraction of radioactive materials, metals and organic liquids; polymer processing; cellulose processing; and gas separations. However, due to the vast amount of structural configurations possible for an ionic liquid, estimated at up to 10available compounds, selection of appropriate compounds for the various applications can be intimidating.","ILs include triazolium salts, which consist of two isomeric compounds having aromatic 5-membered rings with three nitrogen and two carbon atoms on the ring as the cation. The two isomers are typically referred to as 1,2,4- or 1,2,3-triazolium salt based on the position of the nitrogen atoms, e.g., 1,2,3- refers to a salt where the three nitrogen atoms are adjacent to one another on the ring. Heterocyclic compounds based on 1,2,3-triazoles have been widely used due to their high biological activity, in antiviral, antimicrobial, antifungal medicines and agricultural chemicals. The 1,2,3-triazole heterocycle is commonly synthesized via Cu(l)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and Ru-cat of azides and alkynes, resulting in a 1,4-di-substituted 1,2,3-triazole core and 1,5-di-substituted 1,2,3-triazole core, respectively. However, synthesis and use of tri-substituted 1,2,3-triazolium salts in various applications has not been thoroughly explored.","For example, certain five and six-membered aromatic heterocyclic ILs have been identified as potential candidates in gas separation processes, particularly in U.S. Pat. No. 6,579,343, issued to Brennecke, et al. However, relative to the vast number of potential ILs, very few ILs have found widespread use for most applications, and gas separations in particular.","One or more embodiments consistent with the present disclosure generally relate to a novel class of 1,2,3-triazolium-based cation species and ionic compounds that contain these cation species. These ionic compounds have improved properties over other classes of ionic compounds, including but not limited to increased CO solubility and polymerization capability in one or more embodiments.","The use of the 1,2,3-triazolium core to investigate the effect of structural changes on functional properties is advantageous due to the high modularity and regio-specificity of triazolium over other core compounds, such as ammonium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium and imidazolium cores. Moreover, the click chemistry presented herein is an ideal platform to systematically probe properties of ILs due to excellent molecular control, ease of synthesis, benign reaction conditions and fidelity, in addition to the chemistry being modular, wide in scope, high yielding, stereospecific and insensitive to oxygen and water. In addition, the configuration of the multiple embodiments described herein create a greater dipole moment, which leads to greater thermal stability of the IL.","In one aspect, a tri-substituted-1,2,3-triazolium salt comprises a structure represented by formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"15.41mm","wi":"22.01mm","file":"US08906135-20141209-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2 ","3 "],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["(i) H;","(ii) halogen;","(iii) Cto Cstraight-chain, branched or cyclic alkane or alkene, optionally substituted with at least one member selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, F, I, OH, NHand SH;","(iv) Cto Cstraight-chain, branched or cyclic alkane or alkene comprising one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and optionally substituted with at least one member selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, F, I, OH, NHand SH;","(v) Cto Cunsubstituted aryl, or Cto Cunsubstituted heteroaryl having one to three heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S; and,","(vi) Cto Csubstituted aryl, or Cto Csubstituted heteroaryl having one to three heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S; and wherein said substituted aryl or substituted heteroaryl has one to three substituents independently selected from the group consisting of:\n        \n        "]}}}},"In some embodiments, the anion component, X, may comprise any suitable anionic species.

The gas stream may be contacted with one or more ionic liquids to separate a component gas from the gas stream due to the preferential solubility and\/or diffusibility of the component gas in the ionic liquid. An illustrative embodiment is a method to purify industrial effluent stream by removing impurities, such as carbon dioxide, by contacting the effluent stream with an ionic liquid as described herein.","For purposes of this disclosure, it is understood that gas and gas streams may refer to vapors (volatilized liquids), gaseous compounds, and\/or gaseous elements.","Contacting the ionic liquid with the gas stream may be accomplished in a variety of ways and should be optimized to increase mixing and contact between the ionic liquid and gas stream for a sufficient time to allow significant removal of the target gas. More specifically, systems having high surface contact areas are desirable. As one example, the ionic liquid may be contained within a supported liquid membrane or use of conventional absorbers, such as counter current and similar absorbers.","Supported liquid membranes comprise a solvent such as an ionic liquid contained within the pores of a solid microporous support such as ceramic, metal or polymer support.

Supported liquid membranes contact a feed gas mixture on one side of the membrane and may affect separation of a target gas component from the mixture by allowing that component to escape via permeation or diffusion into the ionic liquid and through the liquid membrane.","In additional embodiments, the ionic liquid may be contacted with the gaseous mixture in conventional, fixed bed gas\/liquid absorption systems or a flow apparatus. In a fixed bed absorption system, the ionic liquid may be coated on a solid support to increase surface area of the ionic liquid capable of solubilizing the target gas. The above systems may be operated is co-current or counter-current dual flow mode to achieve the desired level of mixing, with subsequent regeneration of the ionic liquid prior to introduction to the purification unit.","Definitions","In describing the disclosed subject matter, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set forth below.","The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d refers to an aryl group having one or more heteroatoms.","When referring to an alkane or alkene, the term \u201coptionally substituted with at least one member selected from the group consisting of\u201d means that one or more hydrogens on the carbon chain may be independently substituted with one or more of at least one member of the group.

It is anticipated that those triazoles can be converted to the corresponding tri-substituted 1,2,3-triazolium ionic liquids having vinyl groups through the addition of an alkyl halide, such a methyl iodide, to the vinyl-containing triazole, which is stirred for approximately two hours. Subsequently, acetonitrile and additional methyl iodide is added and the reaction mixture is stirred, refluxed overnight at 40\u00b0 C., and distilled in a Rotovac for about 30 minutes.","The resulting tri-substituted, 1,2,3-triazolium halide (iodide) salt may subsequently be subjected to ion exchange in order to replace the anion with a more desired anion. This will be accomplished by adding water and a salt containing the desired anion, such as lithium bis[(trifuoromethyl)sulfonyl]amide, to the triazolium salt and stirring and refluxing the mixture overnight at 80\u00b0 C. The product can be purified through extraction in organic liquids, distillation of impure compounds and using column chromatography techniques, discarding the aqueous layer and distilling the organic layer.","To characterize COsolubility, the gas sorption properties of ionic liquids as a function of time was carried out using a pressure decay sorption system (Setarm PCTPro\u20142000, Setaram, Inc. Newark, Calif.). All of the ionic liquids were dried in vacuo at room temperature to remove dissolved gases before they were loaded into the pressure decay sorption system. The amount of ionic liquid was between about 0.2 and 0.3 g. COsolubility for these ILs was recorded at 37\u00b0 C. at pressures from 1 to 5 bar. The data were extracted for solubility calculations when the CO-IL equilibrium reached a plateau (no change in the slope) in the COabsorption versus time curve. After 6 hours, this plateau is both visually and mathematically determined to confirm the equilibrium. The general features such as kinetic and equilibrium values in the sorption graph for these ILs are similar. A linear line was fitted for the plot of COmolar fraction versus pressure. In , the COmolar fraction of triazolium-based ILs was calculated from the resulting equation when the pressure is 3 bar.","The thermal decomposition temperature (T) of selected ILs was determined by TGA and evaluated at 5% mass loss of the sample.","The Tand other physicochemical properties, including density and melting temperature, of various ILs are presented Table 1.

A supported ionic liquid membrane (SILM) was made by placing cross-linked nylon supports in a container and depositing the respective ionic liquid on top of the membrane with a pipette. Enough IL was added to completely cover the face of the support and the membrane was allowed to absorb the IL for at least eight hours. The SILMs were then removed from the container and excess IL was removed by blotting.","Testing was performed in a flow system in which the permeate and retentate gas compositions were measured using a gas chromatograph and packed columns. Flows were measured with a digital bubble flow meter. The membrane was placed on the permeate side of a filter holder and a nylon substrate identical to the one used for preparation of the SILM was placed against the SILM on the feed side to reduce mechanical stress. The feed consisted of approximately 30 ml\/min of a mixture of CO(19.95 mole %), H(20.01 mole %) and argon (balance) and a sweep of 6-10 ml\/min of argon (99.999%) passed over the permeate side of the membrane. The total pressure was approximately 108 kPa for the feed and the permeate pressure was less than 102 kPa. After introduction of a feed, the system was allowed to reach steady state, and data were recorded for at least 2 hours.","Measurements of the separation of a mixture \u02dc20 mol % COand \u02dc20 mol % H(balance argon) showed selectivities greater than 4 for a supported ionic liquid membrane consisting of the IL depicted in  in a cross-linked Nylon 66 polymeric support.","It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular embodiments described, and as such may, of course, vary.
