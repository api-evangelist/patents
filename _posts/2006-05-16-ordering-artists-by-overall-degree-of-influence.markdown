The related co-pending applications are assigned to the same assignee as the present application.","This invention relates generally to multimedia, and more particularly using ordering artist associated with multimedia object by degree of influence by other artists.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software and data as described below and in the drawings hereto: Copyright\u00a92005, Sony Electronics, Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.","Clustering and classification tend to be important operations in certain data mining applications. For instance, data within a dataset may need to be clustered and\/or classified in a data system with a purpose of assisting a user in searching and automatically organizing content, such as recorded television programs, electronic program guide entries, and other types of multimedia content.","Generally, many clustering and classification algorithms work well when the dataset is numerical (i.e., when datum within the dataset are all related by some inherent similarity metric or natural order). Numerical datasets often describe a single attribute or category. Categorical datasets, on the other hand, describe multiple attributes or categories that are often discrete, and therefore, lack a natural distance or proximity measure between them.","A graph of nodes and edges is used to represent artist influence between different artists. Each node of the graph represents an artist. An edge between two nodes represents an influence relationship between two artists. The relative influence between artists is computed for the artists represented in the graph. Furthermore, the artists are ordered based on the computed influence.","The present invention is described in conjunction with systems, clients, servers, methods, and machine-readable media of varying scope. In addition to the aspects of the present invention described in this summary, further aspects of the invention will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by reading the detailed description that follows.","In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical, electrical, functional, and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["10","11"]},"The category data  is grouped into clusters, and\/or classified into folders by the clustering\/classification module . Details of the clustering and classification performed by module  are below. The output of the clustering\/classification module  is an organizational data structure , such as a cluster tree or a dendrogram. A cluster tree may be used as an indexed organization of the category data or to select a suitable cluster of the data.","Many clustering applications require identification of a specific layer within a cluster tree that best describes the underlying distribution of patterns within the category data. In one embodiment, organizational data structure  includes an optimal layer that contains a unique cluster group containing an optimal number of clusters.","A data analysis module  may use the folder-based classifiers and\/or classifiers generated by clustering operations for automatic recommendation or selection of content. The data analysis module  may automatically recommend or provide content that may be of interest to a user or may be similar or related to content selected by a user. In one embodiment, a user identifies multiple folders of category data records that categorize specific content items, and the data analysis module  assigns category data records for new content items with the appropriate folders based on similarity.","A user interface  also shown in  is designed to assist the user in searching and automatically organizing content using the data system . Such content may be, for example, recorded TV programs, electronic program guide (EPG) entries, and multimedia content.","Clustering is a process of organizing category data into a plurality of clusters according to some similarity measure among the category data. The module  clusters the category data by using one or more clustering processes, including seed based hierarchical clustering, order-invariant clustering, and subspace bounded recursive clustering. In one embodiment, the clustering\/classification module  merges clusters in a manner independent of the order in which the category data is received.","In one embodiment, the group of folders created by the user may act as a classifier such that new category data records are compared against the user-created group of folders and automatically sorted into the most appropriate folder. In another embodiment, the clustering\/classification module  implements a folder-based classifier based on user feedback. The folder-based classifier automatically creates a collection of folders, and automatically adds and deletes folders to or from the collection. The folder-based classifier may also automatically modify the contents of other folders not in the collection.","In one embodiment, the clustering\/classification module  may augment the category data prior to or during clustering or classification. One method for augmentation is by imputing attributes of the category data. The augmentation may reduce any scarceness of category data while increasing the overall quality of the category data to aid the clustering and classification processes.","Although shown in  as specific separate modules, the clustering\/classification module , organizational data structure , and the data analysis module  may be implemented as different separate modules or may be combined into one or more modules.","In one embodiment, data analysis module  comprises interest\/influence module  that orders the artists associated with the category data by generating an artist influence graph. One embodiment to order by artist influence is further described in  below. In an alternate embodiment, interest\/influence module  generate a weighted artist influence graph. One embodiment for generating a weighted artist influence graph is further described in FIGS.  and - below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["150","150","10","150","152","154","156","158","160","162","164","166","168","170","150","152","10","154","156","150","162","164","166","168","160"]},"Category data describes the different categories associated with the content. For example, category data  comprises terms: Best, Underway, Sports, GolfCategory, Golf, Art, 0SubCulture, Animation, Family, FamilyGeneration, Child, Kids, Family, FamilyGeneration, and Child. As illustrated, category data  comprises fifteen terms describing the program. Some of the terms are related, for example, \u201cSports, GolfCategory, Golf\u201d are related to sports, and \u201cFamily, FamilyGeneration, Child, Kids\u201d, are related to family. Furthermore, category data  includes duplicate terms and possibly undefined terms (0SubCulture). Undefined terms may be only associated with one program, because the definition is unknown and, therefore, not very useful.","Artists  comprise the list of artists associated with the program. For example, artists  comprise artist, artist, . . . , artist. An artist can be, but not limited to, an actor, actress, producer, director, singer, musician, arranger, composer, choreographer, painter, illustrator, author, etc., and\/or any person who adds to the creative content of the program. Thus, there is the possibility of a large number of artists associated with one program.","In addition, there can be a large number of programs available to a customer. For example, a week of television programming could have thousands of programs with thousands of individual terms describing the programs. Therefore, it is possible for a customer to be presented with thousands (or more) artists to choose from in the programs offered through an EPG.","However, a customer is likely to be interested in only a small subset of available artists. The problem lies when a customer would like to access programs with artists that not in the interested subset because of the potentially large number of additional artists.","Artists that influence another artist are referred to as an influencing artists or influencers. Conversely, an artist influenced by another artist referred to as a following artist or follower. An influence means that one artist inspires, teaches, motivates, or otherwise affects another artist. For example, the composer Johan Sebastian Bach influenced Wolfgang Mozart. In turn, Mozart influenced Ludwig Beethoven. Thus, Bach is an influencer of Mozart, and Mozart is a follower of Bach. Similarly, Mozart is an influencer of Beethoven and Beethoven is a follower of Mozart.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["170","170","172","174","176","182","184","186","182","184","186","172","176","174","172","174","182","172","174","182","182","172","174","182","182","174","172","182","174","172","182","174","176","186","174","176","186","176","174","186","176","174","186","176","174","186"]},"Artist can be followers and influencers. As illustrated in , artists A-B are both influenced by and influence other artists. Furthermore, an artist can be both a follower and influencer of the same artist. As illustrated, artists A-B have both a influencing and following relationship through directed edge .","In one embodiment, graph  is a basic artist influence graph indicating the type of influence relationship between the artists. In an alternate embodiment, graph  is a weighted artist influence graph indicating the type and degree of influence relationship. The degree of relationship represents the strength of influence one artist has on a following artist.
