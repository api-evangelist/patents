{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel carboxylic acid derivatives having an oxo-substituted azaheterocyclic partial structure, processes for their preparation, their use for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, and their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for the treatment and\/or prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, thromboses, stroke and myocardial infarction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of heme. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment [O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755].","Substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, i.e. without previous release of NO, have been identified in recent years. The indazole derivative YC-1 was the first NO-independent but heme-dependent sGC stimulator described [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. Based on YC-1, further substances were discovered which are more potent than YC-1 and show no relevant inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE). This led to the identification of the pyrazolopyridine derivatives BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and BAY 63-2521. Together with the recently published structurally different substances CMF-1571 and A-350619, these compounds form the new class of the sGC stimulators [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. A common characteristic of this substance class is an NO-independent and selective activation of the heme-containing sGC. In addition, the sGC stimulators in combination with NO have a synergistic effect on sGC activation based on a stabilization of the nitrosyl-heme complex. The exact binding site of the sGC stimulators at the sGC is still being debated. If the heme group is removed from the soluble guanylate cyclase, the enzyme still has a detectable catalytic basal activity, i.e. cGMP is still being formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the heme-free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the stimulators mentioned above [Evgenov et al., ibid.].","In addition, NO- and heme-independent sGC activators, with BAY 58-2667 as prototype of this class, have been identified. Common characteristics of these substances are that in combination with NO they only have an additive effect on enzyme activation, and that the activation of the oxidized or heme-free enzyme is markedly higher than that of the heme-containing enzyme [Evgenov et al., ibid.; J. P. Stasch et al., 136 (2002), 773; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552]. Spectroscopic studies show that BAY 58-2667 displaces the oxidized heme group which, as a result of the weakening of the iron-histidine bond, is attached only weakly to the sGC. It has also been shown that the characteristic sGC heme binding motif Tyr-x-Ser-x-Arg is absolutely essential both for the interaction of the negatively charged propionic acids of the heme group and for the action of BAY 58-2667. Against this background, it is assumed that the binding site of BAY 58-2667 at the sGC is identical to the binding site of the heme group [J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","The compounds described in the present invention are now likewise capable of activating the heme-free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. This is also confirmed by the fact that these novel activators firstly have no synergistic action with NO at the heme-containing enzyme and that secondly their action cannot be blocked by the heme-dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-1,2,4-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), but is even potentiated by this inhibitor [cf. O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","WO 00\/64876 and WO 00\/64888 claim di- and triarylacid derivatives as PPAR ligands for the treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis and hypertension. Other multicyclic carboxylic acid derivatives are described in EP 1 357 115-A1, EP 1 394 154-A1 and EP 1 541 564-A1 as PPAR and\/or RXR ligands for the treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity and hypertension. Furthermore, multicyclic acid derivatives are known from WO 91\/19475 as leukotriene antagonists with anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties. EP 1 229 010-A1 discloses certain diarylamide derivatives for the treatment of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Furthermore, EP 0 779 279-A1 and EP 0 802 192-A1 describe various phenyl-acetamide derivatives having an azaheterocyclic partial structure as apolipoprotein B inhibitors for the treatment of atherosclerosis and coronary heart diseases, and EP 0 608 709-A1 discloses 2-oxoquinolinylmethyl-substituted phenylacetamides as angiotensin II antagonists for the treatment of arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase in the manner described above and can be used as such in particular for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","Structurally, the compounds of the present invention are distinguished by a terminal carboxylic acid grouping attached in the manner shown below to an oxo-substituted azaheterocycle as head group.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"32.43mm","wi":"76.03mm","file":"US08987256-20150324-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sub":["1","6","3","7","1","4","2","4","1","4","1","6","3","7","1","4","2","4","1","4","1","4","1","4","3","6","3","6","1","4","3","7","3","7","1","4","1","4","1","4","1","4"],"sup":["1 ","2 ","3 ","1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"30.82mm","wi":"64.43mm","file":"US08987256-20150324-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["4A ","4B ","4A","4B","4A ","4B ","2 "],"sub":["1","4","1","4","1","4","1","4","1","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"15.24mm","wi":"30.06mm","file":"US08987256-20150324-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["1","5 ","6 "],"sub":["2 ","2","2","1","4","1","4","1","4"]},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds included in the formula (I) of the formulae mentioned in the following and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, and the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following as embodiment examples and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, where the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","The compounds according to the invention can exist in stereoisomeric forms (enantiomers, diastereomers), depending on their structure.

The saphenous artery is removed and divided into rings 3 mm wide. The rings are mounted singly on in each case a pair of triangular hooks open at the end and made of 0.3 mm-thick special wire (Remanium\u00ae). Each ring is placed under an initial tension in 5 ml organ baths with Krebs-Henseleit solution which is at 37\u00b0 C., is gassed with carbogen and has the following composition: NaCl 119 mM; KCl 4.8 mM; CaCl\u00d72HO 1 mM; MgSO\u00d77HO 1.4 mM; KHPO1.2 mM; NaHCO25 mM; glucose 10 mM; bovine serum albumin 0.001%. The force of contraction is detected with Statham UC2 cells, amplified and digitized via A\/D converters (DAS-1802 HC, Keithley Instruments, Munich) and recorded in parallel on chart recorders.
