title: Wear resisting sleeve system for aircraft landing arresting cables
abstract: The aircraft landing arrest cable has wear resisting sleeves positioned thereon in spaced relation to each other to thereby hold the cable out of contact with a non-skid landing surface in a lowered position of the cable. Stresses imposed on the cable when engaged by a tail hook suspended from aircraft during landing, are absorbed by the wear resisting sleeves which are held clamped in positions on the cables by fluid adhesive previously injected into the sleeves. The wear resisting sleeves are respectively formed from pivotally connected sleeve sections made of an impact shatter-proof and durable material such as polyurethane with abutting edges held in contact with each other under a clamped condition of the sleeves on the cable, established by the injected adhesive.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to cables and lift devices for arresting aircraft landing on a non-skid deck surface of an aircraft carrier.","Arresting cables are retractably anchored to the non-skid surface deck of an aircraft carrier having cable and lift devices used for landing retrieval of aircraft. Such cables are now often replaced because of repeated impact engagement by aircraft arresting hooks and abrasion by the non-skid surface. Also, the non-skid deck landing surfaces require routine repair because of abrasion and slapping motion of the arresting cables in contact therewith. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to prolong the life of such aircraft arresting cables, reduce the frequency of repair and\/or replacement of the non-skid deck surface and eliminate use of cable lift devices during aircraft landing arrestment.","Pursuant to the present invention, aircraft arresting cables held stretched across the non-skid deck surface of an aircraft carrier have positioned thereon wear resisting sleeves spaced above the deck surface. The sleeves are made of a durable, shatter-proof material to absorb impact imposed by aircraft tail hook engagement of the cables during landing as well as to reduce cable surface abrasion by maintaining the cables out contact with the deck surface throughout. The purposes of the present invention are achieved without lift devices by use of the sleeves firmly held in desired spaced positions on the cables by clamping thereof between pivotally connected sleeve sections. Clamping is effected by injection of adhesive into the enclosure within each of the sleeves through which the cable extends and sealing of the injected adhesive fluid within the sleeves.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrate a top deck portion of an aircraft carrier vessel hull  having a non-skid deck surface . An aircraft  is shown about to land on the deck surface  while traveling thereabove in an aft to forward direction relative to the vessel hull . A flexible arresting cable  as generally known in the art is shown in  extended from anchor locations established by retraction sheaves  attached to the deck surface  at locations adjacent opposite port and starboard sides of the vessel hull . The arresting cable  may be raised above the deck surface  by lift devices  as shown in  so as to accommodate engagement thereafter of the cable  by a tail hook  suspended from the aircraft  during its first speed forward motion as shown in , to arrest such motion during a landing operation. The cable  is accordingly extended by being pulled forwardly from its lifted position by the aircraft  through the tail hook  as shown in . The lift devices  will wear off with time and may be eliminated since the cable  is maintained in its lifted position above the surface  as hereinafter explained.","Pursuant to the present invention, the cross-deck positioned arresting cable  is provided with a plurality of cylindrical protective wear resisting sleeves  positioned in spaced relation to each other at locations on the cable  between which the cable  is engaged by the aircraft tail hook  as shown in . The arresting cable  before being raised above the deck surface  by the lift devices , is held out of contact with the deck surface  by the wear resisting sleeves . The aircraft arresting cable , which may be formed from a plurality of strands  as shown in , is furthermore protected against damage due to impact with the deck surface  during the landing operation by the wear resisting sleeves  as shown in ,  and . Each of the sleeves  is positioned on the cable  by clamping thereof between its sleeve sections  and  pivotally connected to each other by a pivot  as shown in . In such cable clamping condition of the sleeve , the sleeve sections  and  engage each other along parallel spaced edge portions  and  as shown in . The sleeve sections  and  may be made of a cross deck pendant material such as a synthetic polyurethane. Examples of such material include: Aramid fibers (Kevlar Nomex), Crystal Polyester (Teschnora), high modulus polyethylene (Spectra), Nylon and Fiber X.","As shown in ,  and , one tapered axial end  of the sleeve  from which the cable  extends, has an elongated flexible injection tube  extending through the upper sleeve section  through which a fluid adhesive from a suitable source is injected into a cross-sectionally circular enclosure  formed within the sleeve . The cable  extends through the enclosure  enclosed within the sleeve sections  and  is held closed by the adhesive sealed within the sleeve  by abutment of the sleeve section edges  and  in the cable clamping condition of the sleeve . Outflow of the adhesive from the sleeve  is conducted from the lower sleeve section  at a location adjacent the other tapered axial sleeve end  through outlet tubing  as shown in , while the adhesive wears off the cable  during use. The tubing  will wear off as the cable  is used. The fluid adhesive injected into the sleeves  insure retention thereof in the clamped positions on the arresting cables  under tension exerted by the tail hook  during landing of the aircraft  on the deck surface .","As a result of the foregoing described positioning and use of the wear resisting sleeves  on the aircraft arresting cables , wear of the non-skid deck surface  is minimized and the operational life of the cables  is prolonged so as to avoid frequent repair or replacement of the non-skid deck surface .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6","7","7"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
