{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The subject invention relates generally to industrial control systems, and more particularly to a system and methodology that enables industrial automation equipment to be regulated according to applicable standards via the employment of electronic signatures that are managed in a distributed application architecture.","Industrial controllers are special-purpose computers utilized for controlling industrial processes, manufacturing equipment, and other factory automation, such as data collection or networked systems. Controllers often work in concert with other computer systems to form an environment whereby a majority of modern and automated manufacturing operations occur. These operations involve front-end processing of materials such as steel production to more intricate manufacturing processes such as automobile production that involves assembly of previously processed materials. Often such as in the case of automobiles, complex assemblies can be manufactured with high technology robotics assisting the industrial control process.","In many automated processes, including the basic production of commodities such as food, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, complex state logic is often designed and programmed by Systems Engineers or provided in some cases by automated equipment manufacturers. This logic is often programmed with common PLC ladder logic or higher level languages supported by Sequential Function Charts. Sequence logic can be employed for a plurality of tasks such as material movement and conveying operations, packaging operations, or as part of an assembly process itself, wherein various stages of an assembly are sequenced from stage to stage until a final assembly occurs. As can be appreciated, much planning and design is required to implement an automated production process that can involve hundreds of machines, computers, and program logic to facilitate proper operation of the respective sequences.","In modern systems, many layers of regulation are now being imposed on automated industries to ensure compliance to applicable standards. To document that these requirements are being adhered to, often one or more signatures are required which in some systems may not be more than merely signing a journal record or document but, in increasing circumstances these procedures have become electronic. For instance, if a customer in an FDA regulated industry desires to use electronic signatures in place of handwritten signatures, they must do so in accordance with 21 CFR Part 11. In some existing systems, electronic signatures are only offered in association with report parameter verification in procedural phases, verification of procedural steps, and confirmation of batch and phase commands. However, these signatures may be lacking several key features required under 21 CFR Part 11. For example, the meanings of the signatures are not presented to the signers nor recorded, and in some electronic event journals it may be difficult or impossible to determine if an electronic signature was properly obtained or not.","Some of the notable aspects of 21 CFR Part 11 include:\n\n","In addition to the components mentioned above, customer requirements include the ability to specify one or more signers for each signature, to specify security requirements for each signer, and to specify a comment requirement for each signer.","Journaling requirements are further described in the following 21 CFR Part 11 excerpt:","\u201cElectronic signatures and handwritten signatures executed to electronic records shall be linked to their respective electronic records to ensure that the signatures cannot be excised, copied, or otherwise transferred to falsify and electronic record by ordinary means.\u201d","In view of the above, many modern industrial automation systems are not equipped to process, record, and document required signature activities. For instance, in a typical factory setting, process steps and operator actions requiring possible signature authentication are highly distributed throughout various locations in the factories. Attempting to manage such activities from various locations can be a challenge even for the most sophisticated of automation systems.","The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the invention nor delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The subject invention relates to a system and methodology to automatically manage and control electronic signature activities in accordance with a distributed industrial control system. In one aspect, the system provides distributed management of electronic signatures for manual data entry and operator actions that includes an automated, distributable mechanism for the collection of validatable signatures for confirmation of operator actions and\/or for acknowledgement of process conditions or deviations. Signatures can be generated by operator commands, automated phase logic uploading values outside of defined ranges, operators entering values outside of defined ranges, and so forth. After signatures are generated, they are managed, centrally, with distributed client applications sending in user ID and password data to be validated, for example. By providing a centralized architecture to control when signatures are required and to collect and validate signatures from remote locations in an industrial environment, the subject invention provides a controlled, flexible, and scalable environment to manage regulatory requirements for automated processes while seamlessly distributing intelligence for such control to a plurality of local or remote interface locations that interact with factory automation systems.","The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the invention. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The subject invention relates to a system and methodology facilitating automated manufacturing processes in a regulated industrial controller environment, wherein a centralized signature component generates signature events to remote locations and validates signatures required to satisfy such events. In one aspect, a system for distributed signature processing is provided. The system includes a signature component to determine when to generate one or more electronic signature events and also to validate electronic signatures that have been received from various remote locations that respond to such events in order to comply with regulatory requirements of an automated industrial process. An application layer distributes interface components to the remote locations in order to facilitate generation of the electronic signature events and validation of the electronic signatures. A centralized processor such as a batch server can operate the signature component to generate the electronic signature events and to validate the signatures.","It is noted that as used in this application, terms such as \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201clayer,\u201d \u201cobject,\u201d \u201cclass,\u201d and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution as applied to an automation system for industrial control. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be components. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers (e.g., via data packets and signals between the computers), industrial controllers, and\/or modules communicating therewith.","Referring initially to , a system  illustrates distributed signature processing in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. A signature component  is associated with an Application Programming Interface (API) layer  that is employed to facilitate generation, control, and management of electronic signatures (not shown). These signatures are electronic versions of actual signatures that become associated with electronic documentation that verifies whether a system is in compliance with applicable regulations. For instance, if a process step executes, a manual phase may be initiated whereby a user enters a respective value to document the procedure which is then authenticated by entering a user name or password in one example that satisfies the signature requirement. In other cases, signatures can be generated by operator commands, automated phase logic uploading values outside of defined ranges, operators entering values outside of defined ranges, or with respect to other automated requirements of an automated process. After signatures are generated, they are managed centrally via the signature components , with distributed client applications interacting with the signature components through the API layer .","In general, the signature components  determines when a signature event or requirement is to be executed and then proceeds to automatically verify whether or not the requirement for signature has been met. The API layer  is employed to facilitate notifying one or more interface components  of a signature requirement and then interacting with the interface components to complete and verify the requested signature. The interface components  operating on computers can locally interface with the signature components  or more likely interface over remote connections via a network  that can include local factory networks or global networks such as the Internet, wherein wired or wireless connections are available.","The API layer  can include various components such as schemas, interface templates, dialog options, signature controls, inputs for receiving signatures, Active X controls, display outputs to drive various signature procedures and various graphical user interfaces components. The API layer  enables signatures to be managed and controlled from a centralized location such as a batch server yet, still allow great flexibility when interfacing to the server. This includes distributing components to trigger a signature event at remote locations while receiving signature data verifying the events from such locations.","Other features provided by the distributed architecture depicted by the system  include linking signature records to the events to which they correlate. Also, signatures can be triggered by phase logic, a Batch Server or processor, or by a user. Generally, a signature can include one or more signoffs, wherein each signoff may include a user ID and password field (or other data supplied by operator). For each signoff, a comment field can be required, optional, or not allowed. The signoffs can have an associated meaning and associated security requirements which are described below.","A signature and its component parts can be configurable for any operator interaction with a running batch. However, signatures initiated by a process-connected device cannot be canceled, whereas signatures initiated by an operator interaction can be canceled. In one aspect, signatures can be considered transactions\u2014until the transactions are completed the actions they correlate to are not performed. Thus, signatures can be held active until they are completed, or, in some cases, canceled. Interactions with signatures, successful or not, are journaled (e.g., stored in an event file). Also, if a signature requires multiple signoffs, each signoff can be completed on different workstations. Before proceeding with a discussion of , the following definitions may be employed:","Electronic Signature","An electronic representation of a signature, including associated data. Can include one or two signoffs\u2014or more. Associated data includes meanings for the signoffs, comments, security requirements, and timestamps.","Signoff","A component of an electronic signature in which a user enters his username and password and optionally a comment. An electronic signature can require one or two signoffs or more.","Signoff Meaning","A short phrase describing the meaning attached to a given signoff. For example, \u201cDone By\u201d or \u201cChecked By\u201d.","Signature List","A list of pending signatures and their related commands, report parameters, etc. maintained on a Batch Server or processor.","Signature List UI","User interface for accessing all types of signatures not associated with eProcedure phases.","Signature Template","A collection of data to define a signature\u2014number of signoffs, signoff meanings, signoff security requirements, and signoff comment requirements. Signature templates can be defined centrally, and can be referred to when defining signature requirements.","Cancel a Signature","When a user cancels a signature, this signals the batch system that the signature will not be completed. The Batch system will then let the originator of the signature know that it has been canceled so that it may take appropriate actions. Likely reasons for canceling a signature include incorrect data associated with the signature and the user desiring to prevent a command associated with a signature to complete.","Referring now to , a system  illustrates signature processing via a batch server in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. The system  includes a batch server  for processing recipes or programs that are employed to manufacture a plurality of differing products in an automated industrial environment. The server  generally operates with one or more control systems  via network connections  (wireless and\/or wired) to the server . Such network connections can include local factory networks such as ControlNet, DeviceNet or Ethernet and can include communications to remote systems such as over the Internet, for example. The control systems  can include programmable logic controllers, I\/O modules, communications modules and so forth. In order to facilitate signature processing, one or more distributable signature components  are migrated to various locations across the factory. These components can include signature templates, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Schemas, and so forth that drive respective user interface components  to interact with various users or operators associated with the control systems  and\/or batch server . The user interface  interacts with operators to control a process and manage signatures in accordance with the subject invention.","At , one or more operator actions can be input that may affect operations of the system . For instance, an operator may request to change a parameter or system variable. This request is fed back to the server , wherein a signature and verification component  determines whether or not the changed parameter requires signature verification for such request. These determinations can include policy or rule determinations and\/or limit testing on the changed value. If the parameter change requires a signature, the batch server  initiates a signature verification procedure, wherein the operator (or operators) is required to perform one or more signature requirements  at the user interface . These requirements  can include such procedures as entering a user name and password, for example. After entering the signature data, the data is transferred to the server where the data is verified by the signature and verification component . When the data has been verified, automated processes occur such updating a regulation record with the operator's electronic signature. After verification, the actual parameter change can be initiated on the batch server  and\/or control system . At , one or more automated signature events (non-operator initiated) can occur such as an event that is detected during a recipe phase or step that requires signature verification and validation before proceeding with other phases or steps. Upon triggering of the automated event , the user can be directed to complete a signature requirement at  via the user interface .","Referring to , various signature events  are illustrated in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. The signature events describe conditions in which an electronic signature requirement can be generated by the system or an operator. At , one type of signature event is report verification for an automated phase or for a manual phase. This can include signature generated based on the report verification policy of a report in an automated phase or based on the report verification policy of a report in a manual phase. At , a signature event can be related to general usage requirements of an automated phase. In this case, the signature can be requested at any point during execution of the automated phase. At , signatures can be generated resulting from a manual phase step being completed.","At , signatures resulting from an operator issuing a batch or phase command from batch system user interface can be employed. These type signatures result from an operator initiating some type of activity. Such activities can include variable changes, program changes, process changes and so forth that affect how the system performs. Other actions can include commands such as start, hold, restart, abort, stop, reset, manual, pause, resume, acknowledge, and disconnect, for example. Still yet other commands can include auto, download, semi-auto, add batch, remove batch, step change, clear failures, acquire, release, and bind, for example. At , signatures can be generated that result from an operator changing the value of a recipe parameter from batch system user interface. At , signatures can be generated as a step in the execution of a recipe.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-6","b":["400","500","600"]},"Referring to , a process  illustrates automated phase report verification and\/or general usage signature processing in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. These types of signature requirements generally originate from programmed phase logic and are thus not considered cancelable. At , a non-cancelable signature is requested such as a report verification request and\/or a general usage signature. At , a signature data associated with a first user is entered. At , the signoff data entered at  is verified such as verifying that a password correlates to a valid username. At , a determination is made as to whether or not the verification succeeded. If not, the process logs a verification failure at  and proceeds back to receive new signoff data. If the verification is a success at , the process proceeds to  to log that a successful signoff has occurred. At , a determination is made as to whether another signoff is required. If not, the process proceeds to  and clears the request for the signature and logs successful completion of the signature. If another signoff is required, the process proceeds to the acts represented at  to request signature verification from a subsequent user. These acts are similar to the acts represented at -. As can be appreciated, signoff for a given signature requirement can occur with more than two users.","Turning to , a process  illustrates a report verification signature in a manual phase in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The process  describes signatures and related processing that result from an operator entering values in a manual phase with a corresponding acknowledgement (e.g., selecting an OK button on a user interface). After reports in a respective step have been verified, processing continues with step verification illustrated in .","Proceeding to , a user completes a step in a manual phase. At , if there are no reports to verify, the process proceeds to  to continue with step verification depicted in . If there are reports to verify at , the process proceeds to , where values that are entered for the report are logged. At , a determination is made as to whether or not a signature is required. If so, the process proceeds to  where a batch server generates a report verification signature. At , a user enters signoff data for the verification. At , a determination is made as to whether or not a user desires to cancel the verification. If so, the process proceeds to  where the signature cancellation is logged. Then, at , upon cancellation, the user re-enters the cancelled value, wherein the process proceeds back to  to log the re-entered value.","Proceeding back to the determination at , and if the user does cancel the previously entered value, the process proceeds to verify a signoff for a first user at . At , a determination is made as to whether or not the verification succeeded. If not, the process logs a verification failure at  and proceeds back to receive new signoff data. If the verification is a success at , the process proceeds to  to log that a successful signoff has occurred. At , a determination is made as to whether another signoff is required. If not, the process proceeds to , clears the request for the signature and logs successful signature completion. If another signoff is required, the process proceeds to the acts represented at  to request signature verification from a subsequent user. These acts are similar to the acts represented at , , , , , and . As can be appreciated, signoffs for a given signature requirement can occur with more than two users. After execution of the clear signature request at , a determination is made as to whether or not there are more reports to verify at . If not, the process ends at  and continues with step verification depicted at . If more reports are left to verify at , the process proceeds back to  to log another report having associated values.","Referring to , a process  illustrates a manual phase step verification process that can occur after the process depicted in . If a step verification signature is required, and is cancelled, the step and any report verification signatures previously completed are re-executed as illustrated in . Proceeding to  of , a manual phase step has been previously completed having corresponding report verification signatures completed as described in . At , if a step verification signature is not required, the process ends at  where reports are uploaded for storage and the process can move on to the next process step or act if necessary. If a step verification signature is required at , the process proceeds to  where a step verification procedure is generated by a batch server or centralized processor(s). At , a user enters signoff data for the step verification. At , a determination is made as to whether or not a user desires to cancel the step verification. If so, the process proceeds to  where the signature cancellation is logged. At , the process  then proceeds back to the previous process depicted in  in order to re-complete the step.","Proceeding back to the determination at , and if the user does not decide to cancel the previously entered value, the process proceeds to verify a signoff for a first user at . At , a determination is made as to whether or not the step verification succeeded. If not, the process logs a verification failure at  and proceeds back to receive new signoff data. If the verification is a success at , the process proceeds to  to log that a successful signoff has occurred. At , a determination is made as to whether one or more signoffs is required. If not, the process proceeds to , clears the request for the signature and logs successful signature completion. If another signoff is required, the process proceeds to the acts represented at  to request signature verification from a subsequent user. These acts are similar to the acts represented at , , , , , and . As can be appreciated, signoffs for a given signature step requirement can occur with more than two users.","Before proceeding with a discussion of , it is noted that example user interfaces are shown that can include various display and input capabilities. Thus, the user interface can be implemented as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or interface application to interact with the systems previously described. This can include substantially any type of application that sends, retrieves, processes, and\/or manipulates the various signature data and processes described herein. For example, such user interfaces can also be associated with an engine, controller, batch processor, web service, web site, and web browser although other type applications can be utilized. For example, depending on the detected recipe phase, the user interface may be converted from a normal operating interface to a guided sequence of instructions. This may be especially beneficial when all or portions of the recipe have changed and\/or new procedures are to be installed. It is also noted that the user interface can be adapted to direct the operator to remote locations for respective information. For example, the interfaces can include hyperlinks for directing the operator to a remote web site, wherein further instructions are provided (e.g., mouse click at user interface automatically brings up web site).","The user interface can also include a display having one or more display objects including such aspects as configurable icons, buttons, sliders, input boxes, selection options, menus, tabs and so forth having multiple configurable dimensions, shapes, colors, text, data and sounds to facilitate operations with the systems and processes described herein. In addition, the user interface can also include a plurality of other inputs or controls for adjusting and configuring one or more aspects of the subject invention. This can include receiving user commands from a mouse, keyboard, speech input, web site, remote web service and\/or other device such as a camera or video input, biometric device to affect or modify operations of the user interface.","Turning to , an interface  illustrates an example signature template in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. Signature templates  can be defined centrally as part of an area model which describes an object for how program elements interact with equipment. Generally, signature components are defined for each signature template including one or more signoffs, signoff meanings, signoff security requirements, and signoff comment requirements. When a signature is used, the signature requirements should be defined by giving the name of one of the signature templates defined in the signature template editor . As illustrated, the signature template editor  shows different user defined template structures at . An input area  allows users to select\/define a template name, define signoff meanings, define security groups, define whether comments are optional or required, and define similar requirements for additional users if more than one signature is required.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 9 and 10","b":["900","1000","900","910","1000","1010","1020"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12"],"b":["1100","1100","1110","1200"]},"What have been described above are preferred aspects of the subject invention.
