title: System and method of photoionization of fullerene and derivative clusters for high thrust-density ion thrusters
abstract: The present invention is for a system and a method of VUV photoionization of fullerene and derivative clusters followed by their thermal effusion for a practical energy-efficient and economically-viable high thrust density ion thruster. By taking advantage of the state-of-the-art high intensity VUV photon sources, present invention is able to provide much softer ionization with minimal internal energy deposition than the ionization in the electron impact or charge exchange type ionization in plasma environment used in conventional ion thrusters. Because the invention eliminates the need of additional gas for forming discharge plasma, it permits simpler and lighter structures than the conventional fullerene thrusters with significantly enhanced propellant-usage efficiencies, thrust to power ratios, and thrust to weight ratios. Because the present invention employs softer VUV photoionization, it permits the usage of heavier and more complex fullerene derivatives, nanotubes, and nanotube derivatives than fullerene clusters for fuels without significantly fragmenting them.

One of crucial parameters of ion thrusters, which determine its applicability to specific missions, is the thrust density, the ratio of the thrust to the area of the exit nozzle\/electrode. The high thrust density correlates with a smaller accelerator grid area that is essential in minimizing the construction, operation and lifting costs of the ion thrusters. Although the power to thrust conversion efficiency and Iof ion thrusters can be much higher than conventional chemical thrusters, the ion thrusters currently are not used for missions requiring large thrusts in the order of multi megawatts, because their construction and lifting costs are prohibitive. Therefore, the methods of increasing thrust density of ion thrusters can significantly broaden their application scopes have been extensively sought for.","The operation of the ion thruster relies on acceleration of ions. Thus, the space-charge limitation of the ion acceleration process limits the thrust density. Currently, most of ion thrusters use atomic species, such as Xe or Hg making the ion thruster practical for only a limited range of missions. Extensive research efforts have attempted to increase thrust density to levels that would lead to an attractive ion thruster with wider applicability with the use of heavier ion species than Xe or Hg without success. The method of increasing thruster density can be guided by a physical theory by Child-Longmuir law, and according to this law, the thrust density, T, of an ion thruster can be given by:\n\nT\u221dmI,\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere Iis the specific impulse and mis the ion mass of the propellant. For a specific mission with a fixed I, the higher the ion mass is, the higher is the thruster density. Because the thrust density is proportional to square of the ion mass, even small change in ion mass can increase the thrust density significantly. For example, the atomic mass of the most popular propellant Xe is 131, and any fuels with atomic or molecular mass greater than 131 would increase the thrust density over the current limit.\n","Molecular or cluster ions can potentially increase ion mass significantly, however, with highly increased probability of fragmentation, which negates the effect of increased ion mass on thrust density. Therefore, the usage of molecular or cluster ions for ion thrusters has not been successful until now. Fullerene clusters, such as C, have much larger masses than Xe, yet under favorable thermodynamic conditions, they behave like atoms in terms of resisting fragmentation. In addition to their larger mass than that atomic species, fullerene clusters have lower ionization potentials, thus require lesser energy for ionization than atomic species. Fullerene clusters can be sublimated at relatively low temperatures without fragmentation, and their vapors behave like atomic vapors. Therefore, the usage of Cfor propellant for ion thrusters has been extensively investigated by researchers over two decades.","For example, Cclusters, cardinal clusters among fullerenes, have a mass of 720. If thrust operation conditions are kept the same, the thrust density of Cions would be greater than Xe ions by a factor of (720\/131)\u02dc30 according to Eq. 1. For example, a high thrust mission with a thruster beam power of 10 MW and I-5,000 with Xe as propellant would need a grid area of 18 m, which is too large for economically viable construction and lift into space. If a similar ion thruster can be operated with Cfuel, the required grid area decreases to 0.60 m, which is economically viable for a wide range of space missions. The heavier fullerenes, such as Cor Cwould have better size-reduction effects. The chemistry of fullerenes has recently produced extensive classes of fullerene derivatives, fullerene nanotubes, and fullerene nanotube derivatives. Successful usages of these large stable clusters will further increase the thruster density. Therefore, fullerene-family fuels may open new doors for electrostatic propulsion, if they can be successfully used in ion thrusters.","Extensive research and development efforts for fullerene ion thrusters have at best produced engines with undesirably low fuel usage efficiency due to serious propellant deposition and other problems resulting from premature fragmentation before full electrostatic acceleration. Previous state-of-the-art fullerene ion thrusters have used traditional ionization methods including DC and RF discharge plasmas. An example C-based ion thruster system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,239,820, entitled \u201cElectric Propulsion Using CMolecules,\u201d issued Aug. 31, 1993, to Leifer et al., the prior usage of such ion thruster structures and operation methods with cathodes and hot filaments in DC or RF discharge chambers has not successful in realizing efficient and practical fullerene ion thrusters. A number of publications similar to the above mentioned Cion thruster system reported a failure of obtaining sufficiently high efficiency of fullerenes for rendering Cion thruster practically and economically viable. Other methods include the usage of charge exchange of fullerene with rare gas ions generated in discharge chambers in a modified configuration of Hall thrusters. An example such ion thruster system is described in Hruby, et al., \u201cA High Thrust Density, CCluster Ion, Thruster,\u201d AFOSR Final Report No. 49620-94-C-0006, September 1996. Such approach also resulted in similar inefficiency of fullerene usage to the above mentioned references.","None of the existing approaches so far resulted in a practical fullerene ion thruster, mainly because their ionization methods for generating fullerene cluster ions induce extensive fragmentation of fullerene clusters resulting in very low efficiency fullerene usage. Therefore, other innovative ion thruster structures and operation methods have been sought for. The present invention solves these problems in existing fullerene ion thrusters with the use of VUV photoionization followed by thermal effusion of fullerene clusters, which has negligible fragmentation during ionization process, thus promises cost effective and practical fullerene ion thrusters for a wide range of space propulsion applications.","The inventor realized that the fundamental problem in the existing fullerene ion thrusters is in the ionization process of fullerenes and transportation process of the fullerene ions and that the problem can be avoided by using a much gentler ionization method than the ones used in previous works or inventions. The present state-of-the-art fullerene ion thrusters use either electron impact ionization or charge exchange with other rare gases in hot filament environment as used in existing methodologies. Such ionization processes can deposit large internal energy into fullerenes after ionization. The hot filament discharge environment can also rapidly destroy fullerenes. These hot fullerene ions can readily fragment in very short time during acceleration even without collision with rare gas atoms. To make the situation worse, in the traditional fullerene thrusters, transportation of fullerene ions is performed in the mixture of fullerene and rare gas atom vapors at relatively high pressure resulting in further extensive collisional fragmentation.","The salient feature of the present invention lies in the usage of VUV photoionization of molecular beams of fullerene clusters generated by molecular beam sources, including but not limited to Knudsen cells. The photoionization with controlled photon energy can softly ionize fullerenes without depositing extensive internal energy that can fragment fullerene ions. The photoionization cross sections above the ionization potential of fullerene are well investigated. For example, the ionization potential of Cis 7.58 eV, and its photoionization cross section at 10 eV is \u02dc10cm, which is sufficient for efficient and soft photoionization with minimal fragmentation. The reason for this is that during photoionization at photon energy close to the photoionization threshold, the thermal energy, which induces fragmentation, imparted to fullerenes is minimal, and most of photon energy is used for expelling electrons.","The present invention can also minimize fragmentation during evaporation of fullerenes, because the present invention does not require enclosed structures for ionization process, which are required for containing DC or RF energies in prior arts. Since the present invention does not require such heavy enclosed structures for ionization, in principle, the ionization area can be arbitrarily large without increasing the overall weight of the thruster. This advantage allows to lower evaporation temperature of fullerenes sufficiently below the fragmentation threshold temperature resulting in minimal thermal fragmentation. For example, if the photoionization region has a diameter of 30 cm, the unit ionization efficiency can be achieved with fullerene densities in the order of 3\u00d710\/cm. Such a fullerene number density can be achieved by heating the fullerene solid to 650 C well below the thermal fragmentation temperature of 750 C by molecular beam sources including but not limited to Knudsen cells. With such configuration, almost all fullerenes can be efficiently ionized and accelerated together, thus the collisional fragmentation can be minimized as well. These advantages can not be found in prior art.","The photoionization of fullerenes require intense VUV photon sources with photon energies in excess of 10 eV, well above the photoionization threshold energy, 7.58 eV, of fullerenes. The ideal VUV photons should have high enough photon energy to have reasonably large photoionization cross sections, but low enough photon energy not to fragment fullerenes. The ideal photon energy thus is \u02dc10-20 eV. Such photon energy can be readily achieved by the above mentioned VUV photon source technologies. The new development in VUV photon lamps, including but not limited to, rare gas resonance lamps, rare gas excimer lamps, now provides the required high flux of VUV photons with high efficiency. Furthermore, the scaling up of such VUV photon source seems straightforward. For example, a 10 MW ion thruster for interplanetary mission with 10 kV (I\u02dc5,000 sec) acceleration would require a cluster ion beam of 1 kA with a ion flux of 6.3\u00d710ions\/sec. This would require at least 6.3\u00d710VUV photons per second. With a photon energy of 10 eV, the required photon source power is 10 kW, which is well within reach of near-future VUV source technologies.","Another advantage of the present invention is that it does not use rare gas for ion transportation in addition to fullerene fuel. Therefore, the structure of the present invention can be considerably simpler and lighter than the exiting fullerene ion thrusters that use conventional discharge plasma technologies. Furthermore, the thrust efficiency of the present invention is significantly high because does not require mixing with rare gas, which reduces the overall thrust efficiency of fullerene-based ion thrusters. Qualitatively, the summary of the advantages of the present invention over the conventional exiting ionization method for fullerene ion thrusters is presented in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Comparison of exiting ionization method and the present"},{"entry":"invention for fullerene ion thrusters."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Existing Ionization Method","Present Invention"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Ionization Physics","Electron Impact Ionization or","Photoionization"]},{"entry":[{},"Charge Exchange"]},{"entry":["Internal Energy","Much Higher than","Lower than"]},{"entry":["Deposition due to","Fragmentation Threshold","Fragmentation"]},{"entry":["Ionization",{},"Threshold"]},{"entry":["Gas Required In","Yes","No"]},{"entry":"Addition to Fullerene"},{"entry":"Fuel"},{"entry":["Scaling Up","Difficult","Easy"]},{"entry":["Structure","Complicated","Simple"]},{"entry":["Thrust Efficiency","Low","High"]},{"entry":["Fullerene Fuel Usage","Very Low","High"]},{"entry":["Usage of Fullerene","Not Possible","Possible"]},{"entry":"Derivatives"},{"entry":["Usage of Fullerene","Not Possible","Possible"]},{"entry":"Nanotubes and Their"},{"entry":"Derivatives"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Another important aspect of the present invention is in its ability of ionizing with minimal fragmentation of functionalized fullerenes, fullerene nanotubes, and fullerene nanotube derivatives, which have larger mass than fullerenes and can be tailored for mission specificities. Currently, chemists in the world have successfully produced bulk quantities of varieties of functionalized fullerenes (fullerene derivatives), such as C-F, which was recently shown to be evaporable without fragmentation. For example, C-F, has a mass of is 1632. The thrust density of C-Fcan be 5 times higher than that of Calone, and 150 times higher than that of Xe. The potential usage of other heavier functionalized fullerene, fullerene derivatives, fullerene nanotubes, and fullerene nanotube derivatives can further increase the thruster density. Therefore, the successful usage of such fullerene derivatives in the present invention will result in more compact and lighter ion thrusters, thus can greatly expand the usage of ion thrusters for unprecedented space mission applications further beyond ion thrusters using fullerene ions. The ionization with minimal fragmentation of such large fullerene derivatives can be readily achieved by the present invention that uses VUV photoionization.","In the following discussion that addresses a number of embodiments and applications of the present invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced.
