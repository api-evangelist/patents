{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application was originally filed as PCT Application No. PCT\/CN2009\/076329 filed Dec.31, 2009.","Modern communication technology enables users to communicate in various forms including telephone, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), instant messaging, e-mail, and the like. However, within a conventional communication session, a user is typically limited to communicating in the form that was used to initiate the session. For example, if the user receives a telephone call, the user generally has to respond by voice over the telephone call. As a result, if the user receives a communication in one form and the user's context (e.g., the user is in a meeting or other location where a voice conversation would be inappropriate or be disturbing to others) does not allow the user to conduct the communication session, the user usually would have to reject or miss the communication. In other words, the user typically does not have the option to use or switch between multiple forms of communications (e.g., including communications in a hybrid form that transcodes one form to another) independently of the form of communication used to initiate the session. Accordingly, service providers and device manufacturers face significant technical challenges to integrating multiple hybrid forms of communications in a single context-aware communication session (e.g., a communication session that can alter the form the communication for one or more of the communicating parties depending on contextual information). Overcoming such technical challenges can enhance the user experience and offer greater flexibility and convenience when conducting communication sessions.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for performing multiple forms of communications in the same communication session.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises receiving a request to establish a communication session using a first form of communication, wherein the communication session supports multiple and simultaneous forms of communication. The method also comprises selecting a second form of communication to conduct the communication session. The method further comprises transcoding the second form of communication to the first form of communication.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprising at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to receive a request to establish a communication session using a first form of communication, wherein the communication session supports multiple and simultaneous forms of communication. The apparatus is also caused to select a second form of communication to conduct the communication session. The apparatus is further caused to transcode the second form of communication to the first form of communication.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to receive a request to establish a communication session using a first form of communication, wherein the communication session supports multiple and simultaneous forms of communication. The apparatus is also caused to select a second form of communication to conduct the communication session. The apparatus is further caused to transcode the second form of communication to the first form of communication.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for receiving a request to establish a communication session using a first form of communication, wherein the communication session supports multiple and simultaneous forms of communication. The apparatus also comprises means for selecting a second form of communication to conduct the communication session. The apparatus further comprises means for transcoding the second form of communication to the first form of communication.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for performing multiple forms of communications in the same communication session are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Conventionally, within a single communication session, only one form of communication is used for communication between parties. Therefore, if a user using one form of communication, e.g., telephone, to communicate with the other user wants to communicate to the other user using a different form of communication (e.g. text message), the user typically ends the telephone session in order to be able to start a text message session to send the text message. For many users, the inconvenience of using current methods for switching among different forms using multiple communication sessions (e.g. one session for voice and another session for text) is too burdensome. As result, most users do not or cannot conduct multiple concurrent but distinct communication sessions to take advantage of the particular strengths of each type of communication. Further, if a user is in a situation where a caller calls the user via telephone and the user is not able to communicate in voice, the conventional method generally does not provide a way to communicate with the caller in voice, without having the user talk on the phone.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the following capabilities: (1) establishing a communication session with one form of communication (i.e. a first form), (2) selecting a different form of communication (i.e. a second form) in the communication session, and (3) transcoding the second form of communication to the first form of communication to communicate with the device using the first form of communication. More specifically, the system  enables one of the UEs -(e.g. UE ) to establish a communication session with another one of the UEs -(e.g. UE ), using one of the forms of communication available for multiple and simultaneous forms of communication. Once the communication session is established between the UEs and , for example, different forms of communication may be used to send and receive communication between the UEs and , wherein the UE uses a first form of communication and the UE uses a second form of communication, which is transcoded to the first form of communication to present to the UE , creating a hybrid form of communication. Therefore, within the same communication session, multiple forms of communication may be used to communicate between the UEs and ","In addition, the approach described herein enables seamless switching among various forms of communications by transcoding or converting one form of communication to another without interrupting the communication session. As noted above, a key advantage of this approach is that a user can select the forms or forms of communication to conduct a communication session independently of the forms of communication used by other parties in the communication session, thereby improving the user's communication experience. Therefore, a means for communicating with multiple forms of communication within the same communication session is anticipated.","Further, using these features, a user may manually or automatically select a suitable form or forms of communication to use based on context information such as the user's current activities or environment (e.g., driving, exercising, attending a meeting, etc.) and then conduct a communication session using the selected communication types. In one embodiment, the suitable form of communication as determined using the context information may be a different form of communication than the form of communication used to establish the communication session. More specifically, the system  can determine the associated context information of the UEs and from sensors or user input, wherein the contextual information can be used to identify the user's profile, behavior, activity, environment, social networking status, and the like. In one embodiment, the context information can be communicated as new media attached or associated (e.g., as metadata) with a particular form of communication, thereby making the form of communication context-aware. Then, as one form of communication is transcoded into another form, the associated context in one form can also be transformed and associated with the other form of communication. For example, the contextual information can be described by text written in natural human style language. Then as the associated form of communication is transcoded from to text-based to voice-based communication, the text can be correspondingly converted into, for instance, voice by text-to-speech and vice versa. An advantage of using a context to determine a form of communication is that this feature reduces the steps the user takes to select from among possible forms of communications by automatically presenting or initiating forms of communication most suitable for a given context. Therefore, a means for selecting a form of communication based on the context is also anticipated.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UEs) -having connectivity to the communication service  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.). The UE  also includes or is connected to a data storage medium  to store data and\/or to access the stored data.","The UE  may also be connected to a sensor module . The sensor module  may be used to collect information, which may be stored in the data storage  or be used by the UE . In one embodiment, the sensor module  may include a sound recorder, light sensor, global positioning system (GPS) device, temperature sensor, motion sensor, accelerometer, and\/or any other device that can be used to collect information about an environmental condition or context associated with the UE .","The UE  may include a communication manager . In one embodiment, the communication manager  is capable of handling various operations related to communication using the UE . For example, the communication manager  may manage incoming or outgoing communications via the UE , and display such communication. More specifically, the communication manager  provides options to communicate in multiple forms of communication within a single communication session. The communication manager  may also provide visualization (e.g. graphical user interface) to allow a user to control communication over the communication network . For example, the communication manager  may include an option to initiate a communication session with the UEs -using one or more forms of communication. Further, the communication manager  may include interfaces (e.g., application programming interfaces (APIs)) that enable the user to communicate with Internet-based websites or to use various communications services (e.g., e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging, etc.) via the communication service . In some embodiments, the communication manager  may include a user interface (e.g., graphical user interface, audio based user interface, etc.) to access Internet-based communication services, initiate communication sessions, select forms of communications, and\/or other related functions. The communication manager  may also acquire context data associated with the UE  from the sensor module  and process the data to provide communication options suitable for a determined context.","The communication service  provides various services related to communication to the UEs -, such that the UEs -can communicate with each other over the communication network. The services provided by the communication service  may include a cellular phone service, internet service, data transfer service, etc. In one embodiment, the communication service  may also provide content such as music, videos, television services, etc. for use during a communication session. The communication service  may be connected to a service storage medium  to store or access data. In yet another embodiment, the communication service  is also able to perform various computations to support the functions of the communication manager , some of which may be performed for the UE . For example, the communication service  can manage the transcoding or conversion of the different forms of communication in a communication or provide the information or content using during the communication session.","By way of example, the UE  and the communication service  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["107","107","107","201","203","205","207","209","201","201","203","205","207","209","203","101","111","111","101","101","111","111","203","205","207","101","207","201","203","209","209","101","109","109","107","109","109","109","109","105","101","113","105","107","113","113"],"i":["a","n","a","n ","a","n ","a","n","a","n "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 7"],"b":["107","300","301","101","101","101","101","101","101","101","303","107","101","101","101"],"i":["b ","a ","a","a ","b","b ","a "]},"If the communication manager  does not determine that a different form of communication in the same communication will be used, then communication may be performed with the same form of communication in the same session, as shown in step . Thus, for example, if the communication via telephone is established and the communication manager  does not determine that a different form of communication than a telephone will be used in the same communication, then the user of the UE  continues communication via telephone. On the contrary, if the communication manager  determines that a different form of communication will be used in the same session, a second form of communication is selected, as shown in step , and the communication is performed using the second form of communication in the same communication session, as shown in step . Then, the second form of communication is transcoded to the first form of communication, creating a hybrid form of communication, as shown in step . In this way, the caller who communicates in the first form of communication will receive responses from the user in the first form of communication, even though the user communicates in the second form of communication.","Communicating via a different form of communication in the same session may be performed in many different ways. In the example where the communication is established via telephone, the user of the UE  may choose to select a text message to send a text message within the same communication session. Then, according to this invention, a caller may communicate by speaking on the phone, and the user of the UE  may communicate by sending text messages to the caller, with the same communication session. Then, the communication manager  converts the user's text messages using, for instance, a text-to-speech engine to voice and then plays the converted voice to the caller, so that caller can still carry on the communication session as if the user were actually talking. By way of example, this feature may be useful in a setting where the user may be able to hear the caller but cannot speak to the caller. For example, if the user is in a meeting or another location where the user can hear the caller's voice via a headset, but cannot speak on the phone, the user can still carry a conversation with the caller by communicating via text messages while the caller communicates via telephone, within the same communication session. In addition, the text may be sent along with the voice to the caller so that the caller using voice communications receives responses from the user as text messages as well as the voice corresponding to the text messages. In another example, another text message option may be available to allow a user to use a template of text messages. In a template, a user may fill in blank portions of the template to form a complete message, and then send this complete message as a text message. The blank portions may represent time, location name, a person's name, meeting name, title of an event, etc. An example of a template may be \u201cI am at a <event name> in <location name>,\u201d wherein the \u201cevent name\u201d and the \u201clocation name\u201d may be filled to complete the message. In this way, the user can quickly construct a text message so that the caller may receive a response with minimum delay.","This process is advantageous in that this process allows communicating in different forms of communication within the same communication session and thus can take advantages of different forms of communication within the same communication session. The communication manager  is a means for achieving these advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 7"],"b":["107","400","401","403","107","111","405","407","413","107"]},"Once the data is collected, the communication manager  analyzes the context data (e.g., recognizing background noises from sound samples, determining heading and speed from a GPS, cell-ID sensor, identifying the activity from accelerometer, accessing a calendar function, etc.) to determine and generate a context, as shown in step . In addition, the context source can also come from external sensors such as in a smart room, and from services by querying for temperature, real time traffic information, etc. The context may be generated automatically or manually by a user's request. The context may also be set such that the context is valid during a predetermined time period. For example, if the context is a meeting running from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, the context for the meeting will be set during this time period such that appropriate form of communication will be used to respond to a caller. This meeting time may be extracted from a user's schedule application software in the UE  or on an Internet website that the user uses to store his or her schedule.","Further, the context may be generated according to user preferences or settings. For example, the user preferences may want to generate a detailed context or simple context. Further, the user may configure the setting such that the user may choose a type of context to send. The generated context also includes what form of communication to use for sending the context. In step , a different form of communication is selected in the same session depending on the context. Then the response is generated in the different form of communication and transcoded to the first form of communication, as similarly explained in step  of . Further, some information describing the context may be transcoded to the first form of communication while other information may not be transcoded. For example, a user may configure a setting of the UE  such that, when the user receives a telephone call during a meeting, a message stating that the user is in the meeting may be transcoded from a text-based form (e.g., a text message) to voice for transmission to the caller over the telephone. At the same time, information regarding details of the meeting (e.g., meeting place, time, attendees, etc.) may be sent as a text message rather than being transcoded to voice. In this way, the communication manager  may advantageously use the most effective form of communication to transfer different responses (e.g., voice for a general response and text for informative details).","In one embodiment, the context may be configured in a variety ways depending on the available sensors and other related information. For example, if a caller establishes a telephone call via voice with a user of the UE , and asks for a location of the user holding the UE , the user may choose an option to generate location information in text or data and send it back to the caller. The location information may be generated with data gathered from a location sensor such as a GPS device along with other data that may be available about the location (e.g. maps, restaurant information on the Internet, etc.). In another example, when a speed sensor such as an accelerometer or a GPS device is used, the context may be generated based on the speed. The type of context may include, walking, running, driving, flying, etc. depending on how fast the UE  with the sensor module  is moving. Then, this context may be sent to the caller either automatically or by a user pressing an option to send. Further, various other sensors such as a touch sensor and\/or a proximity sensor may be used to approximate actions by the user of the UE . For example, if the user is frequently touching the touch sensor on a screen of the UE , the communication manager  may infer a context that the user is actively using the UE  to perform a task. In another example, if a proximity sensor is located on the UE , the proximity sensor may detect how close the user is to the UE , and thus approximate the user's location with respect to the UE .","In addition, a sound sensing device such as microphone may be used as a sensor to record sound surrounding the UE , in order to collect data regarding the context. For example, if the user of the UE  is at a concert or a loud construction site, the sound recording device may sense the noise or sound pattern to determine the context of the surroundings. In this case, because it is difficult to talk on the phone in an area with loud noise, the context gathered from the sound sensing device may direct the user of the UE  to respond to a caller's telephone call in a text message. Further, the sound sensing device may be useful in speech recognition in that if the user of the UE  tries to talk to a caller who cannot hear the user due to the caller's disability or an environmental condition (e.g., a noisy environment), the sound sensing device along with a speech recognition technology implemented in the UE  may recognize the user's speech and send the caller's speech in a text format to the user of the UE , while both the caller and the user attempt to communicate in voice over the telephone within the same communication session. This feature may also be used in a translation service, where a caller only understands Finnish and the user of the UE  only knows how to speak English. The UE  would recognize the user's speech and translate the user's speech into Finnish. Then, the translation in Finnish may be sent to the caller in a text message and\/or via Text-to-Speech (TTS) within the same communication session. In this case, the speech recognition and\/or translation may be performed in the UE  or in the communication service .","Further, an option may be available such that when an option is selected, context about the current situation and\/or environment surrounding the user of the UE  may be sent in various forms of communication. For example, in an emergency situation, a user call another user via telephone, and when the other user answers the telephone, select an emergency option which may collect various information such as the location, directions to reach the location, sound and\/or video clips of the surrounding, etc. and send such information in a text message, a media message and etc. within the same communication session, wherein all or a part of the messages are transcoded to voice. In this case, various sensors such as a GPS device, a sound recording device, a video recording device, and etc., may be used to collect information that may be useful to convey the emergency situation.","This process advantageously allows selecting proper forms of communication depending on the context of the circumstances or surrounding environment, wherein the context may depend on information from a sensor. Therefore, multiple forms of communication may be used within the same session depending on the context, in order to provide optimized user experience in communication. The communication manager  is a means for achieving these advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5D","FIG. 3","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["101","101","101","511","101","513","515","101","515","517","101","519","101","521","521","101"]},"In another embodiment, instead of selecting the options , ,  and , at least one of the icons representing these options , ,  and  maybe dragged and dropped in the user interface element  showing the incoming communication, e.g. an indication pop-up of a receiving call function. Then, the option that is dragged and dropped in the user interface element  is selected as a form of communication to respond to the caller. For example, if the envelope-shaped icon representing the message option  is dragged and dropped in the user interface element , then the message interface  shown in  is displayed. Further, the icon for the context option  may change in shape depending on the type of the context. For example, if the icon for the context option  may be changed in a shape of a car if the context is that the user is driving, and the icon for the context option  may be changed in a shape of a document if the context is that the user is at work. Further, if the icon for the context option  is dragged and dropped in the user interface element , a corresponding form of communication for the context is selected.

Communication interface  provides a one-way or two-way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors, such as printers, scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link  that is connected to a local network  to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example, communication interface  may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus (USB) port on a personal computer. In some embodiments, communications interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line.

As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data.

The term computer-readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer-readable medium except transmission media.","Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer-readable storage media and special purpose hardware, such as ASIC .","Network link  typically provides information communication using transmission media through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet .","A computer called a server host  connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server host  hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display . It is contemplated that the components of system  can be deployed in various configurations within other computer systems, e.g., host  and server .","At least some embodiments of the invention are related to the use of computer system  for implementing some or all of the techniques described herein.

Computer system  can send and receive information, including program code, through the networks ,  among others, through network link  and communications interface . In an example using the Internet , a server host  transmits program code for a particular application, requested by a message sent from computer , through Internet , ISP equipment , local network  and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in memory  or in storage device  or other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus .

A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) .

A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of performing multiple forms of communication in the same communication session. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU) \u2014which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal  to perform multiple forms of communication in the same communication session. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
