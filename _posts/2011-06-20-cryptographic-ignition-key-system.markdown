The system  is adapted for managing access to sensitive or protected information, which can be stored locally or remotely therefrom. The system  includes a central processor , a non-volatile memory component  containing an encrypted file store or database  for storing encrypted content (e.g., encrypted sensitive or protected information), and a secure memory component  configured with tamper safeguards including detection and protection. The secure memory component  includes a database  for storing a plurality of encrypted master keys as will be described hereinafter.","The system  further includes an input device  for receiving a cryptographic ignition key (CIK) provided by an authorized user to gain access, and a random access memory (RAM) component  for supporting the user's session activity upon gaining access to the master key (MK) and corresponding encrypted sensitive or protected information.

It is noted that the present invention can be implemented as a standalone system or in combination with other conventional user authentication methods including biometric identification, password protocols, and the like. The system  is programmed to generate a master key (MK), which may be assigned for access to a specific user or a group of n number of users as will be further described hereinafter. In this manner, the MK allows the authorized users to gain access to encrypted sensitive and protected information encrypted by the MK, and to perform other cryptographic functions such as encrypting new data, documents, information, communications, and the like.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the central processor  generates a first key split (R) corresponding to a particular MK through a random number generator such as, for example, a deterministic random bit generator or a hardware random number generator. The first key split (R) is stored in the secure memory component  for subsequent use as a key in a CIK combiner or MK cryptographic combiner  (see ). The central processor  then generates through the random number generator one or more second key splits or Initialization Vectors (R, wherein IV is 1 to n corresponding to the number of authorized users assigned to accessing the particular MK) associated with the MK.","Each of the second key splits (R) is used in combination with the first key split (R) and the CIK combiner  for encrypting the MK to yield one version of the encrypted MK (E(MK)). The encrypted MK (E(MK)) serves as a third key split unique to the corresponding second key split (R). Each of the second key splits (R) is electronically stored in the memory component of a corresponding cryptographic ignition key assigned to an authorized user. The resulting encrypted MK (E(MK)) versions are stored in the database  of the secure memory component .","In a further embodiment of the present invention, the second key split (R) and the third key split (E(MK)) can each further include an index code (ID) associated therewith to facilitate matching of the corresponding key splits with another in the subsequent MK retrieval process. In this manner, each version of the encrypted MK and associated second key split, R, are assigned a corresponding identification or index code for correlation purposes. Optionally, the first key split (R), the second key split (R), and the third key split (E(MK)) can further be assigned, respectively, with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes for purposes of detecting the presence of any errors or tampering in the respective key splits.","In one example, the first key split (R) stored in the secure memory component  can have the following bit format (R+CRC). The second key split stored in the memory of an associated CIK can have the following format (R+CRC+Role 1 ID). The third key split stored in the database  of the secure memory component  can have the following format ((E(MK)+CRC+Role 1 ID).","An illustrative example of the data string or bit format of second key splits (R) where IV is 1 to 4 representing four unique tokens, each electronically stored in the memory of a corresponding CIK is shown below in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Second Key",{}]},{"entry":["CIK","Split (R)","Rbit format"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["User 1","R","128 bit R+ 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0001)"]},{"entry":["User 2","R","128 bit R+ 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0010)"]},{"entry":["User 3","R","128 bit R+ 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0011)"]},{"entry":["User 4","R","128 bit R+ 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0100)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"An illustrative example of the data string or bit format for four third key splits (E(MK)) each corresponding to an associated second key split (R) is shown below in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0052"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Third Key Split",{}]},{"entry":["R","(E(MK))","E(MK) bit format"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["R","E(MK)","E(MK) + 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0001)"]},{"entry":["R","E(MK)","E(MK) + 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0010)"]},{"entry":["R","E(MK)","E(MK) + 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0011)"]},{"entry":["R","E(MK)","E(MK) + 32 bit CRC + 4 bit ID (i.e., 0100)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Referring to , a schematic representation of a master key cryptographic combiner  utilizing an encryption cipher  is shown for one embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the encryption cipher  is a symmetric-key cipher or encryption standard selected from a block cipher. A suitable example of a block cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-based 128-bit block cipher. The cryptographic combiner  is configured for operating the encryption cipher  in an output feedback (OFB) mode, or alternatively in a cipher feedback (CFB) mode (not shown). It is noted that the cryptographic combiner  is not limited to the example described herein, and can be selected from any cryptographic combiners using suitable ciphers and modes as known to those skilled in the art.","The encryption cipher  of the cryptographic combiner  includes a first key split input  for receiving the first key split (Rk), a second key split input  for receiving the second key split (R), and a key stream block output . An output feedback  is provided for this particular combiner . The key stream block output  feeds into a first input  of an exclusive-or (XOR) gate , which is generally an artifact of the specific mode of the cipher . The XOR gate  includes a second input  for receiving the MK to encrypt, and an output  for yielding the corresponding encrypted MK as the third key split (E(MK)).","Accordingly, the MK is encrypted through the cryptographic combiner  using the first key split (R) and second key split (R) to yield the third key split (referred hereinafter as encrypted MK or E(MK), wherein IV is 1 to n). This process is repeated for each first key split up to n to generate a corresponding series of encrypted MK. The generated series of encrypted MK are stored in the database  (see ). The first key split, R, is stored in the secure memory component , and the second key splits (R) are stored in the memory component of a corresponding CIK.","It is noted that the present invention is not limited to the assignment of key splits described herein, and can encompass other key split assignments necessary for implementing the functions of the present invention. For example, the roles of Rand Ras key splits can be interchanged, or the encrypted MK can be stored on the CIK token and the corresponding Rstored in the secure memory component .","The process for retrieving the MK can be performed by inputting the third key split through the second input  of the XOR gate , while inputting the corresponding first and second key splits (Rand R) into the respective inputs  and  of the encryption cipher . Since the second key split (R) is stored in the CIK, the retrieval of the MK can only be accomplished when the user inserts the corresponding CIK into the input device .","The central processor  reads the second key split (R) (e.g., R) from the CIK along with the associated index (ID) and CRC. The central processor  checks the CRC to ensure the second key split (R) was not corrupted or tampered. The central processor  then calls up the first key split (R) along with the associated CRC from the secure memory component . The central processor  checks the CRC to ensure the first key split (R) was not corrupted or tampered.","The central processor  calls up the associated third key split or the encrypted form of the MK (E(MK)) along with the associated index (ID) and CRC from the database  of the secure memory component . The central processor  checks the CRC to ensure the third key split (E(MK)) was not corrupted or tampered. The ID codes of the second key split (R) and the associated third key split or the encrypted form of the MK (E(MK)) must correlate to one another. The central processor  proceeds to decrypt the corresponding encrypted form of the MK using the first and second key splits through the cryptographic combiner  to yield the corresponding MK.","The central processor  stores the retrieved MK on the RAM component  for operational use by the authorized user presenting the valid CIK at the input device . In this manner, the authorized user can access the associated encrypted files and documents stored in the encrypted file store  using the retrieved MK. Once the user removes the CIK from the input device , the system  clears the sensitive or protected information and master key in the RAM component , and ends the user's session.","In an optional step of the present invention, the central processor  can be programmed to generate a new second key split (R) for the user after authentication, recalculates the CRC and stores a second key split (R) with the appropriate CRC and index code (ID) in the CIK. The first key split (R) and the new second key split (R) are used to encrypt the MK to generate a new third key split or the encrypted form of the MK (E(MK)). The new encrypted form of the MK (E(MK)) is stored in the database  of the secure memory component , and replaces the old encrypted MK. Once the user removes the CIK from the input device , the system  clears the sensitive or protected information and master key in the RAM component , and ends the user's session.","The foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and claims, that various changes, modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The following drawings are illustrative of embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention as encompassed by the claims forming part of the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
