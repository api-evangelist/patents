title: Self diagnostic armor structure
abstract: A unit of modular armor. The module has a box-like, optically opaque outer shell of ballistic-protection material enclosed to exclude light from the module's interior. The shell contains transparent armor plates and the shell contains a self-diagnostic system for ascertaining whether the plates have been damaged. The self-diagnostic system includes a first PC board disposed along first edges of the plates, the board being divided into strips on which are mounted rows of lights. The self-diagnostic system further includes a second PC board at second, opposed edges of the plates divided into strips on which are mounted rows of light receptors. The PC boards incorporate circuitry for illuminating the rows of the lights in a row-by-row sequence, and for allowing activation only of the receptors directly opposed to illuminated lights. This circuitry has an analysis means for determining the health of the plates in response to signals from the receptors. The armor module has a transparent, elastomeric, adhesive matrix within the shell in which each of the plates and boards are suspended and encapsulated, wherein the matrix occupies all space not occupied by other elements within the shell.

Field of the Invention","Generally, the present invention provides an improved structure for a box-like module of armor for military vehicles and particularly military vehicles engaged in combat operations. The invention also relates to the field of composite armor wherein layers of various materials including ceramics, metals, glass and polycarbonates are combined to create desired kinds and levels of ballistic protection. Finally the invention relates to the technology by which transparent objects of manufacture, such as bottles or glass plates are inspected for flaws.","2. Background Art","It is well known to create a layered transparent structure that provides protection from bullets or projectiles. Numerous references could be cited showing such structures, and an example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,820 to Bolton et al, which shows laminated safety glass which affords ballistic protection. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,941 to Knapper shows glass layers used with metal layers in a box-like armor structure. U.S. Pat. No. 6,532,857 B1 to Shih et al. shows an armor face component comprised of ceramic tiles in a planar array along a metal plate wherein the tiles and plate are encased in rubber. U.S. Pat. No. 2,375,260 to Suydam shows an apparatus for testing a block of transparent crystal by focusing a beam of light through one edge of the crystal, whereby light travels through the crystal and forms an image used to detect flaws therein. A basic tutorial on image processing, including analysis of light intensity variation in an image, is provided by a National Instruments publication entitled \u201cImage Analysis and Processing,\u201d which can be found at http:\/\/zone.ni.com\/devzone\/cda\/tut\/p\/id\/3470.","The invention is a unit of modular armor for a vehicle which can be removed from the vehicle and replaced when the module is damaged by enemy fire. The exterior of the module has a box-like, optically opaque outer shell of ballistic-protection material such as armor steel. The shell is enclosed to exclude light from the module's interior. The module's interior contains transparent armor plates of variable material and thickness arranged in parallel, closely spaced relation. The module contains a self-diagnostic system for ascertaining whether the plates have been damaged as by cracking so that the module need not be opened or removed from the vehicle to determine its health. The self-diagnostic system includes a first PC board or circuit board disposed along first edges of the plates, the board being divided into strips on which are mounted rows of lights. The self-diagnostic system further includes a second PC or circuit board at second, opposed edges of the plates, the board divided into strips on which are mounted rows of light receptors. The PC boards incorporate circuitry for illuminating the rows of the lights in a row-by-row sequence, and for allowing activation only of the receptors directly opposed to illuminated lights. This circuitry has an analysis means for determining the health of the plates in response to signals from the receptors. The armor module has a transparent, resilient, shock absorbing matrix within the shell in which each of the plates and boards are suspended and encapsulated, wherein the matrix occupies all space not occupied by other elements within the shell.","Definitions and Terminology:","The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood by one skilled in the appropriate art.","The singular forms such as \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example, reference to \u201ca material\u201d includes reference to one or more of such materials, and \u201can element\u201d includes reference to one or more of such elements.","As used herein, \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cabout\u201d, when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material, dimension, characteristic, parameter, and the like, refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly, \u201csubstantially free of\u201d or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition, characteristic, or property. Particularly, assemblies that are identified as being \u201csubstantially free of\u201d are either completely absent of the characteristic, or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.","Concentrations, values, dimensions, amounts, and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits, but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units, 3 dimensional units, 10 dimensional units, and the like; and sub-ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units, 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units, and the like.","Referring to , there is shown the exterior of armor module  having the general shape of a cube having a length width and height in one embodiment of about fourteen inches. It is not necessary that armor module  be cubical in shape and may have any rectangular shape wherein the length width and height are not all equal. The faces  of module  are typically made of opaque sheets of ballistic protection material which inhibits the passage of X-rays therethrough. The sheets normally are plates of armor steel but can be made of armor grade aluminum or other suitable metal, depending upon the particular application for module . Faces  are typically 3 mm thick but the thickness can be varied as needed. The faces  form a completely enclosed box-like shell such that light outside module  does not enter it. Module  is provided with a means to attach it to a vehicle (vehicle not shown) which can be threaded studs  extending from one of faces . It will be understood that other attachment mechanisms could be used, such as brackets, weld connections or other known fastening and attachment mechanisms. Module  is provided with one or more bus leads as shown at  in . Lead  allows signals to be transmitted to and from elements within module  and allows electrical power to be transmitted to these elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","12","18","18","20","12","21","20","12","12","18","10","10","20","10","20","18","12","20","20","18","10","12","20","20","18","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","18","20","22","18","24","26","26","26","26","18","24","16","34","22","26","22","10","24","26","18","20","28","30","32","10","30","32","18","30","16","34","32","28","32","28","26","32","22","28","26","32","18","24","26","30","32","24","30","16","16","10","10","26","32"],"i":["a","b","a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["26","32","10","34","36","34","36","20","34","30","36","34","38","38","26","38","24","18","24","38","38","40","42","40","44","36","36","24","38","24","38","36"],"i":["a ","h ","a ","a ","h ","a ","b ","h "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["46","46","32","46","30","18","32","46","46","32","46","46","48","50","36","36","46","46","46","32","26","38","46","46","36","18","36","50","18","36","52","52","18"],"i":["a","h ","a ","a","h ","a","h ","a","h ","a ","a ","b ","h "]},"Preferably but not necessarily, strips  are not all separate components from each other but are formed from a single PC board wherein the strips are strip-shaped zones of the PC board disposed adjacent a given row of lights . The thickness of strips  or the PC board is about 1 mm and the board's length and width are approximately equal to the length and width of the inner surface of a face  at which the board is located. Likewise strips  are normally and preferably not all separate components from each other but are formed from another single PC board wherein the strips are strip-shaped zones of the PC board disposed adjacent a given row of receptors . The thickness of strips  or the board is about 1 mm and the board's length and width are approximately equal to the length and width of the inner surface of a face  at which the board is located. A typical module  has a length, width and height of 14 inches, will have 10 plates  and will have 5 lights  and 5 receptors  for each plate. For such a module , the strips or PC boards will occupy a volume of between 15 and 16 cubic inches. Using commercially available products, the volume for the lights, receptors, multiplexers and other electronic components described in conjunction with  can be limited no more than 2.0 and 3.3 cubic inches. Thus the boards and other electronic components needed for self-diagnosis of module  can, if desired, occupy a miniscule portion, less than 0.6 percent, of the module's total volume.","Optionally, a second set (not shown) of lights  and receptors  and associated circuitry elements similar to those described above can be provided for each plate  to achieve redundancy, The second set can be disposed orthogonal to the first set, along plate edges  and  shown in . Additionally, a memory chip  can be part of or be communicated with microprocessor . The chip's purpose is to monitor lights , receptors  and the associated circuitry to determine if these elements malfunction or deteriorate over time based on reference parameters derived from empirical testing and manufacturing specifications of these elements. A predetermined deviation from the reference parameters will indicate a fault in the self-diagnostic system of armor module .","Operation of Self-Diagnostic Means","Monitoring the light intensity experienced by receptors , the photo detectors, is the core of the self diagnosis in that cracks in transparent armor plates  reflect light back to the source, thereby reducing the amount of light transmitted to receptors .","Lights , receptors , CAN bus , microprocessor  lines -, driver , voltage source  multiplexer , multiplexers -, multiplexer  and converter  comprise a self-diagnostic means for module . Basically, the health of each individual plate  in armor module  is determined one at a time by measurements taken from one row of receptors along an edge  of the individual plate wherein microprocessor  gathers and processes the measurements for each row separately. Following is a more detailed description of a preferred method of operation for the self-diagnostic means.","For each row of receptors , measurements are taken receptor by receptor and this procedure is preferably repeated in a plurality of trials for each row, there typically being four trials for a row. From the measurements is determined the average light intensity for each receptor in the row and the highest value of the average intensities is stored. The absolute value of maximum deviation in average light intensity between adjacent receptors is found and is stored. A normalized maximum deviation is computed by dividing the highest value of the average intensities by the absolute value of the maximum deviation in light intensity between adjacent receptors. The value of the normalized maximum determines whether a plate  is definitely healthy, definitely damaged or further testing is needed.","An example of an application of the foregoing method is provided in conjunction with  where a set of five receptors  are subjected to light from a set of five relatively high intensity LEDs typically requiring between 1.0 and 1.5 watts for the set. On graph line  are readings in millivolts from a first tested plate representing the average light intensity experienced by receptors (or photo transistors) numbered 1 through 5. The readings on line  are 399, 505, 554, 499 and 409, and the normalized maximum deviation is 106\/554 or 0.19. This value of the normalized maximum deviation indicates that the tested plate is healthy or undamaged. On line  are readings from a second plate tested in a similar fashion to the first. The readings are 332, 353, 128, 76 and 135, and the normalized maximum deviation 225\/353 or 0.64. The normalized maximum deviation here represents an unhealthy or damaged plate.","Another example of an application of the foregoing method is provided in conjunction with  where a set of five receptors  are subjected to light from a set of five relatively low intensity LEDs typically requiring about 0.10 watts for the set. On graph line  are readings in millivolts from a third tested plate representing the average light intensity experienced by receptors (or photo transistors) numbered 1 through 5. The readings on line  are 26, 32, 35, 32 and 27, and the normalized maximum deviation is 6\/35 or 0.17. This value of the normalized maximum deviation indicates that the tested plate is healthy or undamaged. On line  are readings from a fourth plate tested in a similar fashion to the third. The readings are, 21, 21, 12, 5 and 7, and the normalized maximum deviation 9\/21 or 0.43. The normalized maximum deviation here represents an unhealthy or damaged plate. Experience thus far has shown that for maximum normalized deviations less than about 0.30, the plate is healthy, and for normalized maximum deviations greater than about 0.38, the plate is cracked or damaged. Currently, further testing or analysis of the plate is required when the normalized maximum deviation falls between 0.30 and 0.38.","Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
