Depending upon the size and complexity of the process, this can be difficult and labor intensive.","Another way to monitor and control the process is to have cameras positioned at various locations along the process, and to have monitors coupled to the cameras, and located near some form of remote process control. However, this can be a problem, as typically the cameras are fixed, and thus it can be difficult to view certain portions of the process without an unlimited number of cameras.","A still other way to monitor and control the process is with a traditional two-dimensional representation of the process, including its tasks and sub-tasks, displayed on a graphic monitor. However such representation typically does not provide the operator with a true visual understanding of the operation of the process.","The invention is provided to solve these and other problems.","It is an object of the invention to provide a method to permit monitoring of a factory process, the factory process comprising a plurality of tasks.","In accordance with the invention, the method comprises displaying the factory process in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the process as a whole and selectively displaying each of the tasks in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the respective task.","It is contemplated that the method includes selectively displaying data representative of a status of the displayed process.","It is further contemplated that the method includes selectively displaying data representative of a status of one or more of the displayed tasks.","It is still further contemplated that the process has a controllable parameter and the method includes controlling the parameter of the factory process.","It is further contemplated that the method includes sensing a status of one of the tasks, determining if the sensed status is acceptable, and automatically displaying the task if the sensed status is not acceptable.","It is still further contemplated that the method includes sensing a status of a plurality of the tasks, determining if the sensed status of each of the plurality of tasks is acceptable, and automatically displaying one of the plurality of tasks if the sensed status of the one of the plurality of tasks is determined not to be acceptable.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a system for monitoring a factory process, the factory process comprising a plurality of tasks.","In accordance with the invention, the system comprises means for displaying the factory process in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the process as a whole and means for selectively displaying each of the tasks in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the respective task.","It is contemplated that the system includes means for selectively displaying data representative of a status of the displayed process.","It is further contemplated that the system includes means for selectively displaying data representative of a status of one or more of the displayed tasks.","It is still further contemplated that the process has a controllable parameter and the system includes means for controlling the parameter of the factory process.","It is further contemplated that the system includes means for sensing a status of one of the tasks, determining if the sensed status is acceptable, and automatically displaying the task if the sensed status is not acceptable.","It is still further contemplated that the system includes means for sensing a status of a plurality of the tasks, determining if the sensed status of each of the plurality of tasks is acceptable, and automatically displaying one of the plurality of tasks if the sensed status of the one is determined not to be acceptable.","It is yet another object of the invention to provide a computer readable medium containing program instructions for execution by a processor to cause the processor to perform steps to permit monitoring of a process on a video display. The process comprises a plurality of tasks.","In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the steps comprise displaying the factory process in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the process as a whole and selectively displaying each of the tasks in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the respective task.","It is contemplated that the steps further include selectively displaying data representative of a status of the displayed process.","It is further contemplated that the process has a controllable parameter and the steps include controlling the parameter of the factory process.","It is still further contemplated that the steps include sensing a status of one of the tasks, determining if the sensed status is acceptable and automatically displaying the task if the sensed status is not acceptable.","These and other aspects and attributes of the present invention will be discussed with reference to the following drawings and accompanying specification.","While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawing, and will be described herein in detail, a specific embodiment thereof, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated.","A factory process  comprising a plurality of tasks is illustrated In FIG. . The process includes a plurality of tasks, including a first motor operated valve , a first settling tank , a motorized pump , a second settling tank , and a second motor operated valve . Each of the tasks is coupled to a control box , which is coupled to a remote computer  and monitor . The factory process and each of the tasks include controllable parameters. For example, the speed of the motorized pump  can be controlled.","A system is provided to permit monitoring and control of the process . Referring to , a computer generated virtual image of the factory process  is generated by the computer  and displayed on the monitor  in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the process  as a whole, or of selected portions of the process . The virtual image can be created using Microsoft Corporation=s DirectX7 suite of application programming interfaces and Windows7 software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","26","28"]},"The system further permits the monitor  to selectively display data representative of a status of the displayed process. For example, a flow sensor (not shown) can be placed in a pipe connecting the first and second tanks , , and the monitor  can display the rate of flow between the tanks , .","The system further permits selective control of the factory process parameter. For example, the motor operated valve  can be selectively opened and closed by the operator via the computer .","The system further permits selectively displaying each of the individual tasks in real-time as a three-dimensional, free-camera, computer generated representation of the respective task. This permits one to more closely view what is occurring with respect to each individual task. For example, one can select virtual display of only the motorized pump , as shown in FIG. . If the motorized pump  is running, a three-dimensional representation of the pump  running is displayed. As displayed in , like the display of the process  as a whole, the Afree camera@ aspect permits the operator at the monitor  to view the virtual image of the motorized pump , or any other sub task, from effectively every orientation, including permitting the operator to visually zoom in and out.","The system still further permits selective displaying of data representative of a status of the displayed task. For example, as shown in , the monitor will display the speed of the motorized pump , as well as other information.","Still further, the system permits the operator to selectively control the controllable parameter of each of the tasks. For example, the system permits the operator to turn the motorized pump  on and off, via the computer .","Each of the tasks can be broken down into sub-tasks, which similarly can be displayed, monitored and controlled. For example, the motorized pump  can be separately displayed as a motor and a pump (not shown). Depending on the complexity of a >task=, there can be multiple layers of sub-tasks, sub-sub-tasks, and the like. This permits the operator to virtually monitor and control a process at various levels of detail.","The system senses a status of one of the tasks, determines if the sensed status is acceptable and automatically displays the virtual image of the task if the sensed status is not acceptable. For example, the system can sense the speed of the motor of the motorized pump , and compare the sensed speed with an acceptable speed. If the speed of the pump  is not within an acceptable range, a virtual image of the pump will be displayed, calling the operator=s attention to the problem.","The control and display operates under the control of a computer readable medium containing program instructions for execution by a processor in the computer to cause the processor to perform steps.","From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific apparatus illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. It is, of course, intended to cover by the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":"4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
