{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/833,650, titled \u201cSoftware Defined LTE,\u201d filed on Jun. 11, 2013, which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to a software defined wireless network and, in particular embodiments, to a system and method for coordinated remote control of network radio nodes and core network elements.","Driven largely by smart phones, tablets, and video streaming, the amount of wireless data handled by wireless networks has risen markedly and is expected to continue to rise by orders of magnitude over the next ten years. In addition to the sheer volume of data, the number of devices is expected to continue to grow exponentially, possibly reaching into the billions of devices, along with radically higher data rates. Different applications will place different requirements on the performance of future wireless networks. Future wireless networks are expected to be highly flexible, highly efficient, open, and customizable for customers and consumers.","In a Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless network, the eNodeB (eNB) is responsible for running the radio resource control (RRC) protocol and is in charge of many decisions such as commanding the user equipment (UE) to measure neighboring cells in a particular priority order and initiating handover to neighbors based on a policy. In today's products, this policy is often hard-coded with limited means of configuration, and is difficult to change.","3GPP LTE and Wi-Fi use centralized architectures where user sessions are managed in highly centralized data centers or central offices. Due to the proliferation of highly functional user equipment (UE) that allow users to multi-task, for example, surf the internet, instant message and stream videos at the same time, the handling of user sessions in the data centers or central office can approach the performance limits of the data centers or central office.","In addition, with the increased deployment of small cells, het-net, machine to machine (M2M), and networks of devices, where thousands or millions of devices are attached, there are a large number of user sessions, some of which are more local (i.e., originate and terminate in nearby locations), while others are more distant. Each of these devices may be mobile. A core network anchors the Internet protocol (IP) sessions centrally and thus is able to maintain an IP session while a device transitions between layer 2 anchor points. Furthermore, the core network architecture, which is based on tunnels to a fixed anchor point, is cumbersome and inefficient. The packet data network (PDN) gateway (PGW) becomes a bottleneck in terms of the number of sessions that can be managed, and it becomes a central point of failure because it maintains so much state about the mobile nodes (MNs).","An embodiment method of routing network traffic includes configuring flow tables of a virtual switch using an OpenFlow protocol. The virtual switch is disposed at a network radio node. The method includes receiving network traffic destined for a user equipment (UE) at the virtual switch and establishing, by a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, a data radio bearer (DRB) for the network traffic between a virtual port on the virtual switch and the UE. The method also includes routing the network traffic over the DRB from the virtual port, through the PDCP layer, and toward the UE according to the flow tables.","An embodiment network radio node includes an OpenFlow switch and a PDCP module. The OpenFlow switch is configured to receive network traffic destined for a UE from a router. The OpenFlow switch includes a secure channel over which a flow-entry and an associated action are received according to an OpenFlow protocol. The OpenFlow switch also includes flow tables configured to store the flow-entry. The PDCP module is configured to receive an initialization instruction and establish a DRB between a virtual port on the OpenFlow switch and the UE according to the initialization instruction. The OpenFlow switch is further configured to route the network traffic over the DRB according to the flow-entry and the associated action.","An embodiment communication system includes a central software defined network (SDN) controller, a network radio node, and a plurality of routers. The central SDN controller includes a radio resource control (RRC) module. The network radio node is configurable by the RRC module according to a routing policy. The network radio node is configured to serve a UE. The plurality of routers are configurable by the central SDN controller according to an OpenFlow protocol and the routing policy. The plurality of routers are configured to route network traffic destined for the UE to the network radio node.","The making and using of embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that may be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.","The advent of cloud-based networking has complicated the ability of future wireless networks to satisfy expected demands for higher throughput, lower latencies, lower energy, lower costs, and drastically more numerous connections. Cloud-based networking fundamentally redefines the endpoints and the time frame for which network services are provisioned. It requires the network be much more nimble, flexible, and scalable. Thus, technologies such as network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) have become increasingly important in building future wireless networks. NFV enables network functions that are traditionally tied to hardware to run on a cloud computing infrastructure in a data center. The separation of the data plane, the control plane, and the management plane from the hardware infrastructure will be a cornerstone of future wireless network architectures. One benefit is the ability to elastically support network functional demands. SDN is an architectural framework for creating intelligent programmable networks, where the control planes and the data planes are decoupled, network intelligence and state are logically centralized, and the underlying network infrastructure is abstracted from the application.","It is realized herein that SDN concepts are applicable to an LTE network and any future wireless network in the future. An SDN allows the RRC protocol to be centralized in a commodity, re-programmable server, where the policy decisions generated by the RRC can be altered easily by manufacturers, operators, or both, without having to deploy new network radio nodes, i.e., e-Node Bs (eNBs). The SDN also centralizes routing decisions, providing flexibility in routing adjustments that allow more dynamic and direct routing for mobile traffic, while also allowing independent distribution of data flow and control. This reduces, possibly eliminates, the need for centralized tunnel aggregation points. It is further realized herein the use of OpenFlow-enabled switches allows deployment of the SDN in networks without the need for standardization or product cycles from manufacturers and vendors.","The existing 3GPP architecture separates some amount of control into a mobility management entity (MME), which is responsible for exchanging non-access-stratum (NAS) messages with the UE, and controlling the establishment of tunnels between the eNB and core network elements such as serving gateways (SGWs). However, the packet routing function in a 3GPP network is limited to using tunnels, while many other methods of getting packets to their destination, such as flat routing, layer 2 VLANs, or optical circuits, are precluded from use.","It is realized herein, that by using OpenFlow protocols to control the eNB and the core network elements, an architecture can be created that makes air interface mobility management decisions in concert with packet redirection and rerouting in the core network. The architecture can be embodied in wireless networks and devices, such as LTE wireless eNBs and core networks.","The evolved packet core (EPC) is a network architecture that provides a functional framework for handling user data and user sessions for multiple users, i.e., UEs. The EPC connects an access network, such as an LTE access network, to one or more external networks. External networks can include the Internet, corporate networks, and the IP multimedia core network subsystem (IMS). The access network typically includes multiple radio nodes to which the various UEs connect to access the external networks or to communicate with other UEs on the access network.","The current evolved packet core (EPC) requires all packets to be routed through fixed packet data network (PDN) gateway (P-GW). This is inefficient for local traffic. For example, traffic between two UEs on the same eNB often traverses two different and very distant P-GWs.","SGWs transport IP data traffic between UEs and external networks. The SGWs serve as the interface between radio nodes and the EPC and also serve as an anchor point for UE sessions and for layer 2 mobility among radio nodes. The SGWs are logically connected to the PGW. The PGW anchors IP sessions for the UEs and serves as an interface between external networks and the EPC. The PGW transports IP data traffic to and from the external networks, which are sometimes referred to as PDNs.","It is realized herein an SDN for LTE can, in certain embodiments, provide customized mobility management and customized core network routing, such as in network sharing. These features may also be desirable for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). For example, some wholesale network operators require traffic to be routed on separate virtual local area networks (VLANs) for each partner. In certain embodiments, such as over the top (OTT) partnerships and new business models, the SDN provides for special treatment of certain network traffic. In other embodiments, the SDN can be used in analytics-based optimization, as is found in data-driven self-organizing networks (SONs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","1","110","2","130","1","130","2","130","3","140","1","140","11","100","120","1","120","2","120","3","150","1","150","120","1","120","2","120","3","120","1","130","1","140","1","140","4","120","2","130","2","120","3","130","3"]},"eNBs - through - are network radio nodes and are sometimes referred to as access points, or Node Bs.
