The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The pancreas is an extremely common site for the development of early neoplasms-noninvasive clonal epithelial expansions. In a minority of persons, these clones of cells serially acquire genetic changes that can lead to an invasive adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic cancer, once invasive, is almost uniformly fatal. The epithelial cells in the advanced stage of this process are very aggressive, seemingly having an innate capability for metastasis that is exhibited rather soon after they invade beyond the duct structure into surrounding tissue. In order to alleviate the dismal prognosis associated with this disease, it is imperative that the process of pancreatic carcinogenesis be recognized and treated prior to invasion. Chemoprevention is the administration of agents (drugs, biologics, and nutrients) to slow progression of, reverse, or inhibit carcinogenesis thereby lowering the risk of developing invasive or clinically significant disease. Understanding the morphology and biology of precursor lesions of invasive pancreatic cancer has therefore become an issue of paramount importance. In the last decade, significant progress has been made in the recognition and appropriate classification of these precursor lesions. Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) encompass the three known morphologically distinct precursors to invasive pancreatic cancer.","A large number of case-control and cohort studies have shown that there is a significant clustering of pancreatic cancer in some families. These high-risk inherited pancreatic cancers are estimated to represent about 10% of pancreatic cancers. Five well-known genetic syndromes with known gene defects account for approximately 20% of the families in which there is aggregation of pancreatic cancer. These syndromes include (1) BRCA2, (2) familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (p16\/CDKN2A), (3) Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome; (4) HNPCC; and (5) familial pancreatitis. Majority of pancreatic cancers are sporadic and have evidence of widespread chromosomal instability, including a high rate of translocations and deletions. Nearly all (>90%) preinvasive lesions have an early mutation in the K-Ras protein involved in the transmission of growth factor signals. In the middle stages of preinvasive progression >90% of lesions develop inactivation of the CDKN2A (p16) cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor. In later stages most preinvasive lesions also harbor mutations of the TP53 (p53) and in MADH4, the common Smad protein involved in transduction of TGF\u03b2 and activin signals. Despite the enormous obvious benefit for chemopreventive agents in pancreatic neoplasia, direct drug investigations for chemopreventive indications have been slow to emerge. A critical factor is the challenge of conducting studies that will define and demonstrate clinical benefit.","Proliferation of pancreatic cancer is regulated through aberrant oncogenic Ras signaling and its effect on cyclin kinase inhibitors such as p27. Previous studies have demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of one of the ras signaling pathways, the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, elicits pancreatic cancer cell cycle arrest through induced expression of p27 (Cancer Res 2005; 65(11):4870-80). Tocotrienols, the chemical form of vitamin E with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, are receiving attention as promising dietary supplements for cancer prevention and treatment.","Tocotrienols are the primary form of vitamin E in the seeds of most monocot plants such as palm and cereals such as rice and wheat. The biosynthesis of tocotrienols and tocopherols occur exclusively in photosynthetic organisms and arise from homogentisic acid. Tocotrienols arise from the condensation of homogentisic acid and geranylgeranyl diphosphate while the committed step in tocopherol synthesis is the condensation of homogentisic acid and phytyl diphosphate. Structurally tocopherols and tocotrienols share some resemblance consisting of a common chromanol head and a side chain at the C-2 position however, their side chains distinguish tocopherols and tocotrienols.","While tocopherol has a saturated phytyl tail, tocotrienol possesses an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain. Tocopherols and tocotrienols are further separated into individual compounds assigned by the greek letter prefixes (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3,\u03b4) depending on the number and position of methyl substitution on the chromanol ring. As reflected in their structural similarity, tocopherols and tocotrienols are well recognized for their antioxidant effect. However, tocotrienols are the group of natural vitamin E compounds with clear and consistent antitumor activity. Semisynthetic tocopherols such as tocopherol succinate have antitumor activity however the bioavailability of the intact compound after oral consumption is poor making it unsuitable for chemopreventive interventions. Structure activity studies of the proapoptotic effects of vitamin E compounds have clearly documented the importance of the unsaturated isoprenoid tail of the vitamin E compounds in their antitumor bioactivity. Furthermore, these studies indicate that decreasing the number of methyl substitutions on the chromanol ring, is associated with increasing antitumor potency.","In one embodiment, the invention includes a method of determining the effectives of a chemotherapeutic agent by determining, in an isolated sample, a first level of a surrogate endpoint biomarker such as p27. The sample is then contacted with an experimentally effective amount of the chemotherapeutic agent being tested. After the chemotherapeutic agent has been administered, a second level of the surrogate endpoint biomarker is taken and compared to the first (pre-treatment) level. The candidate chemotherapeutic agent demonstrates effectiveness where the second (post-treatment) level of p27 is increased to a statistically significant degree over the pre-treatment and\/or control levels.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of determining the effectiveness of a chemotherapeutic agent by further determining, in the isolated sample, a first level of a second surrogate endpoint biomarker such as Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK. After the chemotherapeutic agent has been administered, a second level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK is taken and compared to the first (pre-treatment) level and\/or a control. The candidate chemotherapeutic agent demonstrates effectiveness where the second (post-treatment) level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK is decreased to a statistically significant degree below the pre-treatment and\/or control levels.","Another embodiment of the invention includes a method of screening for pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in a subject by determining, such as in an isolated sample, the level of a biomarker; namely, p27. The level of the biomarker is then compared to a corresponding control level in one or more control samples. In a preferred embodiment the control samples are obtained from individuals who have been determined not to have pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer.","The determination of a statistically significant similarity between the level of the biomarker in the subject and the level of the biomarker in the control sample(s) is indicative of the lack of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in the subject. A statistically significant decrease in the level of p27 in the subject, compared to the level of the biomarker in the control sample(s), indicates the presence of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in the subject.","In an alternate embodiment, the level of a second biomarker, namely Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK, is determined and compared to a control level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK in one or more control samples. A statistically significant increase between the level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK in the subject and the control sample(s) is indicative of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in the subject. A statistically significant similarity in the level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK in the subject, compared to the control sample(s), is indicative of the lack of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in the subject.","Methods of determining the level of the biomarker in the subject and control sample(s) are known to the ordinary practitioner. In one embodiment, as an example, the level of the biomarker is determined utilizing an antibody which binds the biomarker. The sample containing the biomarker is contacted with the antibody under conditions which allow binding of the biomarker to the antibody; the presence of the biomarker can then be quantified.","The invention also includes compositions useful in performing the associated methods. For example, the invention includes a composition comprising a plurality of isolated proteins which bind selectively to the protein products of the associated biomarkers; namely, Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK, and p27. In a preferred embodiment, the isolated proteins selectively amplify complementary double stranded DNA. A composition is also included comprising a plurality of biomarker specific primers, wherein each biomarker specific primer selectively amplifies double stranded DNA complementary to a unique biomarker such as Ki-67, p-MAPK, and p27. Alternatively, the invention includes a composition comprising a plurality of isolated proteins which bind selectively to the protein products of at least two unique biomarkers, wherein each unique biomarker is selected from the group consisting of Ki-67, p-MAPK and p27.","Accordingly, the invention includes method of treating cancer, such as pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer, by administering to a subject a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a tocotrienol. In a preferred embodiment the tocotrienol is gamma-tocotrienol and\/or delta-tocotrienol, which is administered as a pharmaceutical composition. The composition of the preferred embodiment is substantially free of alpha-tocotrienol, beta-tocotrienol and\/or tocopherols. Although one of ordinary skill will recognize methods of determining the appropriate dose, the composition of one embodiment comprises between about 100 mg and 300 mg tocotrienol which is administered twice daily.","The tocotrienol of the preferred embodiment has the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"18.88mm","wi":"72.64mm","file":"US08288369-20121016-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein R is selected from the group consisting of H and CH.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","\u03b4-Tocotrienol Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Cells In Vitro.","In one embodiment, the invention includes a method whereby \u03b4-tocotrienol inhibits pancreatic tumor growth, blocks malignant transformation, and induces apoptosis in vitro. Here, the inventors show the antitumorigenic properties of \u03b4-tocotrienol in vitro. Human pancreatic ductal carcinoma cell lines (MIA PaCa2, SW1990, BXPC3) from American type tissue culture (ATTC, Rockville, Md.) were acquired, grown at 70% confluency per protocol, and treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol. Immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, HPDE 6C7, were treated under identical conditions to investigate \u03b4-tocotrienol's selective effects on pancreatic cancer cells. Results show that \u03b4-tocotrienol selectively inhibits transformation and proliferation.","MIA PaCa2, SW1990, BXPC3, and HPDE 6C7 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of \u03b4-tocotrienol.  shows significant inhibition of anchorage independent growth of MIA PaCa2 cells in soft agar when treated with weekly \u03b4-tocotrienol compared to vehicle. HPDE 6C7 cells grown in recommended media alone did not undergo transformation in soft agar, as would be expected in this preneoplastic cell line, and served as our negative control.","Pancreatic cancer cells (3\u00d710) were plated in 96 well plates and treated the following day with \u03b4-tocotrienol. Proliferation was assessed by MTT at 24 hour intervals. Results show a dose dependent inhibition of proliferation (). The ICfor all three pancreatic cancer cell lines was 20-25 \u03bcM at 24 hours. HPDE 6C7 cells were also treated with increasing concentrations of \u03b4-tocotrienol for 24 hours.  shows selective inhibition of proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines by \u03b4-tocotrienol at 24 hours. HPDE 6C7 cells were relatively resistant to the antiproliferative effects of tocotrienol, even at the highest concentrations.","The observed antiproliferative effect of \u03b4-tocotrienol on pancreatic cancer cells likely occurs through cell cycle regulation. Results also show that \u03b4-tocotrienol causes selective G1 cell cycle arrest and is associated with upregulation of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27. MIA PaCa2, SW 1990, BXPC3 and HPDE 6C7 cells were treated with either \u03b4-tocotrienol 20 \u03bcM or vehicle for 24 hours. Cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in ethanol overnight. Pellets were washed the following day in PBS, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry for cell cycle phase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2F"],"sup":"kip1"},"Cell cycle inhibition by \u03b4-tocotrienol was associated with altered protein expression of p27. The same 4 cell lines were treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol (20 \u03bcM) and collected at progressive time intervals. Whole cell lysates were made from cell pellets washed twice in PBS and lysed in M-PER (Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent, Pierce). Proteins from lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for p27(BD Biosciences).  shows a time dependent upregulation in p27expression in all three pancreatic cancer cell lines. In contrast, a downregulation of p27is seen in HPDE 6C7 cells treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol.","The mechanism by which \u03b4-tocotrienol upregulates p27protein expression was investigated using a luciferase reporter assay. Mia PaCa2 cells transfected with a p27luciferase reporter (a gift from Dr. Pledger, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa) were treated with either \u03b4-tocotrienol (20 \u03bcM) or vehicle for 24 hours. Luciferase activity was then measured using a luminometer.  shows an increase in luciferase activity in MIA PaCa2 cells treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol. This suggests that \u03b4-tocotrienol increases p27protein expression through transcriptional upregulation. This dynamic is further demonstrated by the rescue of tocotrienol inhibition of MiaPaCa-2 cells by siRNAp27 ().","\u03b4-Tocotrienol was also shown to selectively inhibits downstream effectors of oncogenic Ras signaling. More than 80% of pancreatic cancers demonstrate abnormal oncogenic Ras signaling. The Ras effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3 kinase-AKT are important for cell proliferation and survival, respectively. Data indicates that \u03b4-tocotrienol has an inhibitory effect on oncogenic Ras signaling.","Pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa2, SW1990, BXPC3) and HPDE 6C7 cells were treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol (20 \u03bcM) and cell lysates were collected and prepared at progressive time intervals as described above. Proteins from lysates were run by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted with the following antibodies: Ras, p-cRaf (ser 338), p-MEK1\/2, MEK1\/2, pERK 44\/42, ERK 44\/42 (Cell Signaling) and c-Raf (BD Transduction Laboratories).  shows selective inhibition by \u03b4-tocotrienol of the downstream phosphorylated targets of oncogenic Ras p-cRaf, p-MEK, and p-ERK.","HPDE 6C7 cells were resistant to the inhibitory effects of \u03b4-tocotrienol. MIA PaCa2 and SW1990 cells were then treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol (20 \u03bcM) for 24 and 48 hours. Cell lysates were run by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for p-AKT and AKT (Cell Signaling).  demonstrates a decrease in p-AKT protein levels, but not AKT at 24 and 48 hours. Taken together, the inhibition of downstream effectors of oncogenic Ras signaling by \u03b4-tocotrienol without an affect on Ras protein levels may indicate a negative regulatory role of \u03b4-tocotrienol on the function of oncogenic Ras.","In addition to its chemopreventive effects, \u03b4-Tocotrienol induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer. MIA PaCa2 cells were treated with either \u03b4-tocotrienol or vehicle for 24 hours. Cells were collected and stained with Annexin V-FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry for apoptosis.  shows a dose dependent induction of early apoptosis in MIA PaCa2 cells treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol. \u03b4-tocotrienol selectively induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells","MIA PaCa2 cells and HPDE 6C7 cells were treated with vehicle or \u03b4-tocotrienol (20 \u03bcM) for 24 hours. Cells were harvested and stained for TUNEL.  shows significant staining of MIA PaCa2 cells treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol for TUNEL compared to vehicle or treated HPDE 6C7 cells. This finding suggests selective induction of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Next, cell lysates were prepared from MIA PaCa2 cells treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol (20 \u03bcM) at progressive time intervals as described above. Proteins from lysates were run by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted for biomarkers of apoptosis.  shows activation of the caspase cascade as evidenced by cleavage of Caspase 8, Caspase 3, and Parp in a time dependent manner. Interestingly, MIA PaCa2 cells treated with \u03b4-tocotrienol had no significant effect on mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins as shown by a lack of cytochrome C release or cleavage of Caspase 9. Taken together, these data show that induction of apoptosis by \u03b4-tocotrienol in pancreatic cancer cells occurs through activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.","\u03b4-Tocotrienol also Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Growth In Vivo.","Treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines resulted in induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The apoptotic effect of delta-tocotrienol was selective for neoplastic cells because immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells were not sensitive to delta-tocotrienol. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines resulted in activation of the caspase cascade of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis induction as evidenced by cleavage of Caspase 8 and Caspase 3 but not caspase 9. Further evidence of the lack of mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in delta-tocotrienol induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells was demonstrated by the lack of cytochrome C release and the absence of delta-tocotrienol modulation of mitochondrial associated proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bad.","Stable transfectants of MIA PaCa2 cells with luciferase were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor volumes were measured every 2 days with calibers and the rate of growth was determined weekly by measuring tumor luminescence using the IVIS 100 Xenogen system. Tumors of similar volume (100-150 mm) and rate of growth based on luminescence were randomized to receive either vehicle or \u03b4-tocotrienol (100 mg\/kg\/day) by gavage for 20 days.  shows representative luminescent measurements of control and \u03b4-tocotrienol groups prior to treatment and at day 10.

Tocotrienol caused tumor regression at the highest dose compared to vehicle\/PBS. Accordingly, tocotrienol inhibits pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.","Putative cancer chemoprevention in plasma and mouse tissue by HPLC-UV via vitamin E and delta-tocotrienol is shown in . Tocotrienol was detectable in plasma and was significantly concentrated in the pancreas. Surprisingly, tocotrienol localizes in the pancreas by a factor of 10 when compared to liver and tumor levels. These results indicate the mechanism for tocotrienol action.","Taken together, these findings show \u03b4-Tocotrienol selectively induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. \u03b4-Tocotrienol selectively inhibits the PI3-K\/AKT pathway and induces apoptosis in vivo and this is associated with inhibition of AKT signaling targets. Moreover, overexpression of myr AKT in Pancreatic Cancer cells rescues the effect \u03b4-Tocotrienol induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Also, tocotrienol inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell growth can be rescued by constitutively active myrAKT. This suggests that tocotrienol induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer at the level of pAKT.","It can be seen that delta-tocotrienol induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells likely involves modulation of the Akt signaling pathway, because the Akt survival signaling pathway is often overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and implicated in non-mitochondria associated apoptosis. Delta-tocotrienol suppressed the phosphorylation levels of serine\/threonine kinase Akt in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active Akt protected pancreatic cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis after incubation with delta-tocotrienol. Together, these data indicate that delta-tocotrienol induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells through activation of the caspase 8 cascade and suppression of the Akt survival pathway and shows that this micronutrient is useful for pancreatic cancer chemoprevention and treatment in vivo.","Surrogate End Point Biomarkers for Pancreatic Cancer","Historically, the chemopreventive benefit of an agent could only be shown by a reduced cancer incidence or mortality. The use of reduced incidence or mortality as end points makes chemoprevention trials long, large, costly, and, hence impractical except for cancers that have high event rates. Indeed, the only reports of chemoprevention trials for pancreatic cancer have come from subset analysis of chemoprevention trials conducted for other indications. This approach has resulted in inconclusive observations of the value of agents such as \u03b1-tocopherol, \u03b2-carotene, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).","Developing \u201cearly phase\u201d clinical trial methodologies for chemopreventive agents akin to the phase I and phase II studies for traditional cancer therapeutics is an important research priority to advance chemopreventive drug development in pancreatic cancer. Ideally these studies should confirm not only the potential for chemoprevention, but also answer questions about optimal dose and schedule. In response to these challenges, several investigators have proposed and initiated studies that focus on candidate surrogate end point biomarkers (SEBs) of the target lesion pathophysiology rather than on long-term cancer prevention.","In SEB trials, reduction in tumor incidence is replaced with evidence for reversal of one or more elements of the neoplastic phenotype, such as abnormal proliferation, cell survival, or aberrant gene expression. Specifically, these strategies focus on the effect of agents on a significant precancerous lesion, intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN). Whereas IEN is a validated precancer in most epithelial tissues, mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), are the best-characterized IENs in pancreatic tissue. The progress of these lesions to invasive carcinoma is well characterized and surgical removals of these lesions are already recommended medical practice for prevention of pancreatic cancer.","Although SEB studies are well established in the setting of IENs that do not require surgical intervention, such as leukoplakia of the oral mucosa or Barrett's esophagus, such studies are more difficult to conduct in premalignant lesions requiring immediate surgical intervention because the index lesion is removed and is not amenable to subsequent follow-up. However, the need for sequential procedures to diagnose and remove invasive and preinvasive pancreatic lessions, provides an opportunity for short-term SEB studies. An interval of two to four weeks is standard in most practices, hence offering a window within which a chemopreventive agent can be administered to evaluate the effects of the agent on SEB modulation. The inventor's experiments show the value of standard SEBs such as proliferation rate, apoptosis index, and the expression of proteins (discussed below) that are modulated by the early genetic changes in these lesions.","In one embodiment, the invention includes surrogate endpoint biomarkers that were prevelant in the surgical specimens of patients who have undergone resection of invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (IPMNs). Tocotrienol, such as \u03b4-tocotrienol from annatto bean, demonstrated selectively inhibition in human pancreatic cancer cells. The data shows that \u03b4-tocotrienol affects a number of molecular processes including induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth and that \u03b4-tocotrienol inhibits oncogenic signal transduction pathways in pancreatic neoplastic cells. Specifically, \u03b4-tocotrienol decreases phospho-Raf, phospho-MEK, phospho-ERK, and phospho-AKT levels in human pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, \u03b4-tocotrienol induces the expression of growth inhibitory mediators such as p27, and activates the apoptotic mediators caspase 8 and caspase 3.","Cases of resected pancreatic ductal carcinoma from 1986 to 2006 were collected from the Moffitt Cancer Center Tumor Registry and Pathology information system. Slides from each case were reviewed by a single pathologist for histological tumor type, grade, and presence of ductal precursor lesions. Histologic type and grade were assigned based on current W.H.O nomenclature. Pancreatic carcinoma precursor lesions, termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) were graded Ia, Ib, 2, and 3 according to published criteria (Hruban, 2001). Based on slide review, 10 representative tissue blocks were selected from ten consecutive resection specimens. Preference was given to sections showing carcinoma, (preferably more than one grade of carcinoma), nonneoplastic ducts, and precursor lesions. All cases were ductal adenocarcinoma, NOS, or well to poorly differentiated.","The data shown in  demonstrates the accuracy with which these intermediate biomarkers can be measured. Ki67 was noted to be a reliable marker of proliferation with progressive increase of a positive reaction in the nucleus from normal to intermediate to invasive carcinoma. An inverse progression was noted for TUNEL staining indicating oncogenic suppression of apoptosis in neoplastic pancreatic ductal cells. A similar inverse progression was observed in the expression of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein. In contrast, downstream mediators of activated oncogenic Ras signaling such as phospho-MAPK and phospho-AKT are increased. Remarkably, all patients with invasive ductal cancer of the pancreas and IPMNs had noninvasive precursor lesions in their surgical specimens.","No cases of undifferentiated carcinoma or ductal adenocarcinoma variants were selected for this pilot study. One section was cut from each block for routine Hematoxylin and eosin stains. Sections cut for immunohistochemistry were placed on poly-L-lysine coated slides. Antibodies used included Ki-67, p27, and p-MAPK. A TUNEL assay was used to evaluate for apoptosis. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using standard immunohistochemical techniques. Slides were then scanned into the Ariol SL-50 (version 3.0.70) from Applied Imaging for accurate, reproducible, and objective high throughput analysis. Images were reviewed by one pathologist for representative areas of carcinoma, PanIN, reactive ducts, and non-neoplastic ducts. Well-differentiated and moderately differentiated carcinomas were grouped into one category of low grade for the purpose of this study. Poorly differentiated carcinoma was classified as high grade carcinoma.

For example, the primers can include a first primer which is a sequence that can selectively hybridize to RNA, cDNA or EST complementary to a biomarker of the invention to create an extension product and a second primer capable of selectively hybridizing to the extension product, which are used to produce double stranded DNA complementary to a biomarker of the invention.","The term, \u201cprimer\u201d, as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide, whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, which is capable of acting as a point of initiation of synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product, which is complementary to a nucleic acid strand, is induced, i.e., in the presence of nucleotides and an inducing agent such as a DNA polymerase and at a suitable temperature and pH. The primer may be either single-stranded or double-stranded and must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of the desired extension product in the presence of the inducing agent. The exact length of the primer will depend upon many factors, including temperature, source of primer and the method used. For example, for diagnostic applications, depending on the complexity of the target sequence, the oligonucleotide primer typically contains 15-25 or more nucleotides, although it may contain fewer nucleotides. The factors involved in determining the appropriate length of primer are readily known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In general, the design and selection of primers embodied by the instant invention is according to methods that are standard and well known in the art, see Dieffenbach, C. W., Lowe, T. M.

The sample is then contacted with an experimentally effective amount of the chemotherapeutic agent being tested. After the chemotherapeutic agent has been administered, a second level of the surrogate endpoint biomarker is taken and compared to the first (pre-treatment) level. The candidate chemotherapeutic agent demonstrates effectiveness where the second (post-treatment) levels p27 are increased to a statistically significant degree over the pre-treatment and\/or control levels.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of determining the effectives of a chemotherapeutic agent by further determining, in the isolated sample, a first level of a second surrogate endpoint biomarker such as Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK. After the chemotherapeutic agent has been administered, a second level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK is taken and compared to the first (pre-treatment) level and\/or a control. The candidate chemotherapeutic agent demonstrates effectiveness where the second (post-treatment) levels of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK are decreased to a statistically significant degree below the pre-treatment and\/or control levels.","Another embodiment of the invention includes a method of screening for pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in a subject by determining, such as in an isolated sample, the level of a biomarker; namely, p27. The level of the biomarker is then compared to a corresponding control level in one or more control samples. In a preferred embodiment the control samples are obtained from individuals who have been determined not to have pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer.","The determination of a statistically significant increase between the level of the biomarker in the subject and the level of the biomarker in the control sample(s) is indicative of the lack of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in the subject. A statistically significant decrease in the level of p27 in the subject, compared to the level of the biomarker in the control sample(s), indicates the presence of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in the subject.","In an alternate embodiment, the level of a second biomarker, namely Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK, is determined and compared to a control level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK in one or more control samples.

A statistically significant decrease in the level of Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK in the subject, compared to the control sample(s), is indicative of the lack of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, or a stage of pancreatic cancer in the subject.","Methods of determining the level of the biomarker in the subject and control sample(s) are known to the ordinary practitioner. In one embodiment, as an example, the level of the biomarker is determined utilizing an antibody which binds the biomarker. The sample containing the biomarker is contacted with the antibody under conditions which allow binding of the biomarker to the antibody; the presence of the biomarker can then be quantified.","The invention also includes compositions useful in performing the associated methods. For example, the invention includes a composition comprising a plurality of isolated proteins which bind selectively to the protein products of the associated biomarkers; namely, Ki-67 and\/or p-MAPK, and p27. In a preferred embodiment, the isolated proteins selectively amplify complementary double stranded DNA. A composition is also included comprising a plurality of biomarker specific primers, wherein each biomarker specific primer selectively amplifies double stranded DNA complementary to a unique biomarker such as Ki-67, p-MAPK and p27.
