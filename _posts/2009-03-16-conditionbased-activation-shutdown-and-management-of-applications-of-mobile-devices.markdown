In some embodiments, the monitored application  may be a Location-Based Service (LBS) application, for example, a navigation application, a route guidance application, a mapping application, or other suitable application which provides to the user of device  information or services that are dependent, in whole or in part, on the spatial location of device . In other embodiments, the monitored application  may be anon-LBS application, for example, a resource consuming application, a power consuming application, a processor-intensive application, an applications that heavily utilizes one or more resources (e.g., processing resources, wireless communication resources, power resources, memory resources, network resources), an application that may be needed to be monitored for possible excess usage of resources, an application for which it may be beneficial to suggest to the user to shut-down or temporarily deactivate the application due to its power consumption or other excess usage of resources, an applications utilizing Bluetooth or various network resources, an Internet or Web application (e.g., particularly an application which automatically refreshes or periodically refreshes or dynamically modifies its content), or the like.","The monitored application  may be associated with a monitoring module  able to monitor, control, regulate and\/or modify, the operation of the monitored application , or the operational status or operational mode of the monitored application  (e.g., fully activated, partially activated, activated and online, activated but offline, in standby mode, deactivated, or the like). The monitoring module  may directly or indirectly affect the operation of the monitored application , for example, by generating and transferring to the monitored application  a command to modify its operational status; by generating and transferring to the power controller  a command to modify the power which the power source  provides to the monitored application  or to another component of device  (e.g., processor ), or the like.","The monitoring module  may be implemented, for example, using one or more software and\/or hardware components which may be separate from the monitored application ; as part or component of the monitored application ; as an add-on or plug-in or extension to the monitored application ; as a stand-alone application; as part of the OS ; as part of a driver associated with the monitored application  or associated with another component of device  (e.g., communication unit ); as a module embedded within the monitored application; or the like. In some embodiments, the monitoring module  may be automatically installed together with the installation of the monitored application , or upon the first launching or activation of the monitored application .","In some embodiments, the monitoring module  may run in the background substantially continuously; or may automatically run and\/or operate, for example, periodically at pre-defined time intervals or at user-configurable time intervals (e.g., every minute, every four minutes, or the like).","The monitoring module  may periodically check the power level of power source , and may perform one or more operations in response to determining that the power level of power source  is below a pre-defined threshold. For example, if the power level of power source  is below 25 percent of its full capacity, the monitoring module  may command the monitored application to reduce power consumption, or to operate in a power-saving mode, to commence power saving, or to further decrease an already-reduced power consumption (e.g., to reduce processing efforts, to reduce wireless communications, or the like).","In some embodiments, more than one threshold values of power levels may be used; for example, a first reduction of power consumption may be commanded by the monitoring module  and may be performed by the monitored application  when a first threshold value is reached (e.g., power level is below 40 percent of full capacity); and subsequently, a second reduction of power consumption may be commanded by the monitoring module  and may be performed by the monitored application  when a second threshold value is reached (e.g., power level is below 15 percent of full capacity).","In some embodiments, the user of device  may be warned of a possible shut-down or closure of the monitored application ; optionally, the user of device  may be prompted to actively confirm, within a pre-defined period of time (e.g., 30 seconds), that the user wishes to maintain the monitored application  running at the current power consumption mode; and if the user does not confirm in due time, the monitored application  may modify its operational mode or may shut-down. In some embodiments, the user of device  may be warned, notified, or prompted using one or more methods, for example, a textual notification, a graphical notification, an audio notification, an audio-visual notification, a vibrating effect, a ringtone effect, a warning sound, or the like.","In some embodiments, device  may optionally include a motion sensor , for example, a gyro-movement sensor or accelerometer, able to sense that device  is in motion and\/or is being accelerated or decelerated. Monitoring module  may periodically query the motion sensor , directly or through Application Programming Interface (API) or driver associated with the motion sensor . If it is determined that device  is not in motion, then monitoring module  may command the monitored application  to reduce its power consumption. Optionally, if device  is not in motion, then the time interval for re-checking mobility of device  may be modified, for example, increased or doubled.","In some embodiments, monitoring module  may obtain from device  and\/or from OS , information about additional applications and\/or functionalities which may be actively used, and (optionally) may not be disturbed or interrupted by a modification of the power consumption by the monitored application . For example, an active phone call being performed, or a game being played, or a texting application being used, may not be shut down or paused by the operations of monitoring module  which are aimed at reducing the power consumption of the monitored application .","In some embodiments, upon commencement of the monitoring process by the monitoring module , the current Cell-ID information may be obtained by the monitoring module  from device . The Cell-ID information may include any relevant information which may be provided via the mobile interface, for example, Cell-ID data, MSC ID, signal strength level, or the like. Changes in the Cell-ID information over time may be used by the monitoring module  to determine that device  is in motion, and to determine accordingly whether or not to reduce power consumption of the monitored application .","The monitoring module  may further identify connectivity of vehicular devices or car-related devices or accessories, for example, a hands-free Bluetooth kit, a 12 Volts power supply charger, dual-SIM phone activation, or the like.","The monitoring module  may further monitor connection to and\/or disconnection from one or more wireless communication networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11 \u201cWi-Fi\u201d, or IEEE 802.16 \u201cWi-Max\u201d). Upon such connection or disconnection, or upon a connectivity modification, the monitoring module  may activate the GPS receiver  in order to determine, or to verify, that device  is indeed in motion. Upon such determination, the monitoring module  may modify the operational status of the monitored application  and\/or the power consumption by the monitored application ; for example, an LBS monitored application  may be activated or fully activated upon detection of motion of device .","In some embodiments, monitoring module  may collect data from two or more sources in order to determine whether or not device  is in motion, and in order to determine whether or not it may be required or beneficial to reduce the power consumption of the monitored application. In some embodiments, two or three or more consecutive measurements (e.g., of location information) may be collected by the monitoring module  from one or more sources; the measurements may be compared, and detection of differences (e.g., any difference, or a difference greater than a threshold value) may result in activation of the GPS receiver , or modification of the power consumption by the monitored application. In some embodiments, the comparison process may be configured and fine-tuned in order to reduce unnecessary power consumption, and\/or in order to reduce unnecessary activation of power-consuming components of device  or unnecessary activation (or full activation) of the monitored application .","In some embodiments, once the GPS receiver  is operational, the monitoring module  may analyze the GPS data in order to determine motion, velocity and direction, and in order to confirm or reject the possibility that device  is in motion, or more particularly, in motion possibly due to being inside a driving vehicle (namely, high-velocity movement, in contrast with walking velocity or even running velocity). If the GPS receiver  is operational but is not able to generate GPS data (e.g., device  is inside a covered parking lot), the monitoring module  may shut-down the GPS receiver  after a pre-defined time period (e.g., three minutes).","Once a high-velocity movement is detected, the monitoring module  may trigger an interactive question to the user of device  (optionally with an audio\/visual alert in order to capture the user's attention), asking the user whether he would like to fully activate the monitored application  in order to receive its full functionality, or in order to receive its function which was previously turned-off entirely or partially for power consumption reasons. Based on the user's input, the monitoring module  may either fully activate the monitored application, or may deactivate the movement detection process for a (configurable) prolonged time period (e.g., one hour).","Once the monitored application  is fully activated, the monitoring module  may check that the monitored application is indeed running; and may then check GPS data in order to possibly determine immobility of device  for a prolonged period of time (e.g., three minutes or more). If such immobility is detected, the user of device  may be prompted whether or not to shut-down the monitored application ; or, whether or not to switch the monitored application  into a reduced-power mode (e.g., slow-refresh mode, no-refresh mode, offline mode, or the like).","If it is determined that device  is travelling at high velocity (e.g., more than 20 miles per hour, or other suitable threshold value), then the monitoring module  may command the monitored application to reduce its GPS polling interval, and\/or to reduce its server update interval (e.g., for data), in order to further reduce power consumption.","In some embodiments, monitoring module  may suggest to the user, and may allow the user if he confirms, to activate Cell-ID based navigation instead of GPS based navigation, for example, in order to reduce power consumption and\/or once the power level of the power source is below a pre-defined (or configurable) threshold value (e.g., below 20 percent of full capacity).","In some embodiments, the monitoring module  may optionally monitor SMS messages (e.g., by listening to one or more pre-designated ports), in order to allow external activation and\/or external deactivation of the monitored application .","In some embodiments, the monitoring module  may record and log the activation time and termination time of the monitored application , in order to identify usage patterns which may be utilized in the activation\/deactivation algorithm used by the monitoring module . For example, the monitoring module  may detect that device  is in high-velocity motion, and\/or that the monitored application  is fully activated and used, on particular days and times (e.g., on weekdays between 08:00 to 08:45, corresponding to the user driving from home to work; on weekdays between 17:00 to 17:50, corresponding to the user driving from work to home; on Tuesdays between 20:30 to 20:45, corresponding to the user driving to a weekly tennis session; or the like). The identified usage patterns may be taken into account by the monitoring module , for example, for determining whether or not the monitored application  may be shut-down or switched to reduced-power mode or fully activated. For example, if the monitoring module  detects a usage pattern on weekdays between 08:00 to 08:45, the monitoring module  may refrain from shutting-down the monitored application  during such time-slots, or may activate or turn on the monitored application  (e.g., using an auto-start module  as described herein) in these time-slots (e.g., weekdays between 08:00 to 08:45), corresponding to travel time that the user may optionally enter during a setup phase.","In some embodiments, the monitoring module  may optionally be implemented by including an auto-start module , which may perform auto-start of the monitored application  if one or more conditions are met or if one or more determinations are made. For example, if the monitored application  is shut-down, but may be restarted due to sufficient power level and\/or due to high-velocity movement, then the auto-start module  may launch the monitored application . In contrast, if it is determined that the user of device  is \u201croaming\u201d, the auto-start module  may avoid further processing operations and may avoid attempts to launch the monitored application ; however, the user may override this by manually launching the monitored application .","In some embodiments, the auto-start module  may automatically activate the monitored application , and the monitoring module  may automatically turn-on or turn-off a feature of function of the monitored application  (or may turn-on or turn-off the monitored application ), based on one or more monitored conditions or parameters, for example, time of day, time-based or date-based parameters, day of week, movement or non-movement, roaming or non-roaming (e.g., shut-down of a wireless data connection when the user is roaming, due to economical considerations), parameters which may be manually set-up by the user (e.g., the user may define that the monitored application , or one or more features thereof, be activated or be shut-down if one or more conditions are met), or the like. Other suitable conditions may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","127"]},"In some embodiments, the method may include, for example, collecting from one or more sources data which may be used for determining whether or not the mobile device is in motion (block ).","In some embodiments, the method may include, for example, determining or checking, based on the collected data, whether or not the device is in motion (block ).","If it is determined that the device is in motion (arrow ), then the method may include, for example, maintaining the current power consumption of a monitored application (block ); and proceeding to the operations of block  (arrow ).","In contrast, if it is determined that the device is not in motion (arrow ) (or, that the device is in relatively slow motion), then the method may proceed with the operations of block  and onward. For example the method may include checking whether or not the remaining power level of the device is below a threshold value (block ). If the remaining power level is not below a threshold value (arrow ), then the method may include, for example, maintaining the current power consumption of the monitored application (block ). In contrast, if the remaining power level is below the threshold value (arrow ), then the method may include, for example, switching the monitored application into a reduced power consumption mode of operation (block ); and continuing to periodically monitor the device's power level and possible changes in the device mobility (block ).","Other suitable operations or sets of operations may be used in accordance with some embodiments. Some operations or sets of operations may be repeated, for example, substantially continuously, for a pre-defined number of iterations, or until one or more conditions are met.
