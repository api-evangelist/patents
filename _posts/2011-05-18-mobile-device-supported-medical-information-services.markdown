title: Mobile device supported medical information services
abstract: A wireless telecommunications system can receive position information associated with a wireless mobile device of a user and a medical access point name from the wireless mobile device, can determine a gateway based on the position information and the access point name, can receive medical information associated with the user from the wireless mobile device via the gateway, and can provide, based on the medical information and the position information, the medical information to a computer system of a medical facility. The medical information can include drug allergies, food allergies, health issues, physician contact information, emergency contact information, and/or a preferred medical facility, among others. The medical information can be useful in providing medical aid to the user of the wireless mobile device if the user is not able to communicate via verbal means, via written means, and/or via sign means.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates generally to the field of wireless mobile devices that deliver medical information, and, more specifically, this disclosure pertains to the field of providing medical information of a user of a wireless mobile device to a health care professional or facility via the wireless mobile device.","2. Description of the Related Art","In the past, a wireless mobile device stored information associated with its user. For example, the wireless mobile device stored information such as an address book, phone numbers of contacts, songs, a schedule, pictures, motion pictures, email, personal memos, voice memos, etc. However, a wireless mobile device did not store medical information of its user in a secure fashion, nor was it capable of securely communicating the medical information of its user to a medical professional or medical facility.","While the described embodiments may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the disclosure to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the disclosure is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of an invention as defined by appended claims.","In one or more embodiments, a mobile device of a user can store medical information associated with the user and can provide the medical information to a medical professional and\/or a medical facility. For example, the medical information can include a drug allergy, a food allergy, a health issue, physician contact information, emergency contact information, medication information, photographic information, sex, age, height, weight, health insurance information, a preferred medical provider facility, a medical provider in an insurance network, and\/or an image of the user of the mobile device that can be used to identify the user, among others. This medical information can be useful in providing medical aid to the user of the mobile device if the user is not able to communicate via verbal means, via written means, and\/or via sign means. In one example, the user may be unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. In a second example, the user may be unable to speak, write, or sign (e.g., using sign language) in a fashion that correctly conveys medical information. In another example, a language barrier can exist between the user and a medical provider. For instance, the user may speak, write, or sign using one language while the medical provider may speak, write, or sign using another language.","In one or more embodiments, the mobile device can interface with a near field communication device used by a medical professional (e.g., a paramedic, a nurse, a doctor, etc.) and can provide the medical information of its user to the medical professional. For example, the medical professional can use a near field device terminal to retrieve a drug allergy, a food allergy, a health issue, physician contact information, emergency contact information, medication information, sex, age, height, weight, health insurance information, a preferred medical provider facility, a medical provider in an insurance network, and\/or an image of the user of the mobile device that can be used to identify the user, among others, from the user's mobile device. For instance, the mobile device can authenticate the near field device terminal before providing any medical information to the near field device terminal. Authenticating a device seeking access to the medical information can protect the user's privacy.","In one or more embodiments, the mobile device can interface with one or more computer systems of a medical facility and can provide the medical information of its user to the one or more computer system of the medical facility. For example, the mobile device can provide the medical information of its user to the medical facility before the user arrives at the medical facility. In one instance, this can facilitate and\/or expedite providing medical care to the user when the user arrives at the medical facility. In another instance, this can reduce or eliminate one or more possible errors in information transmission in an emergency or non-emergency scenario.","In one or more embodiments, routing of the medical information can be provided to a nearest and\/or preferred medical facility. In one example, the mobile device can provide a medical access point name (APN) and position information of the mobile device (e.g., location information of the mobile device) to a serving support node (SSN), and the SSN can query a domain name service to determine gateway servicing node (GWSN) from two or more gateway servicing nodes (GWSNs) based on the medical APN and the position information of the mobile device. In one or more embodiments, the medical APN can include a string of characters.

For instance, the strength of the signal transmitted from the MD can be different from the strength of the signal received by the antenna, and a distance from the antenna can be determined based on a differenced in transmitted strength of the signal and received strength of the signal. For example, a computer system (e.g., a computer system of network ) can communicate a signal to the MD, where the signal includes information that indicates a first signal strength, and the MD can transmit one or more signals, at or close to the first signal strength, to network . Network  can receive, at a second signal strength, the one or more signals transmitted by the MD, where the second signal strength is less than the first signal strength due to path loss, terrain, etc. In one or more embodiments, determining the distance from the antenna can be based on determining a path loss attenuation factor.","In one or more embodiments, a data structure stored in a memory medium can include terrain and\/or data clutter information that can be used in determining the distance from the antenna of a base transceiver station using a calculation based on the differenced in transmitted strength of the signal and received strength of the signal.
