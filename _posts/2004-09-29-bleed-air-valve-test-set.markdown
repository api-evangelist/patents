{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to a test set. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to a test set used on a bleed air shutoff valve in an aircraft.","A bleed air shutoff valve or an engine nacelle and fuselage bleed air shutoff valve is typically, but without limitation, an air valve that permits passage of anti-icing hot air in one direction (typically passing to the cross ship manifold) and allows starting airflow to pass in the opposite direction (typically passing to the engine). In various aircrafts, the bleed air shutoff valve may be operated in different fashion. For instance, but without limitation, in a P-3 aircraft, the bleed air shutoff valve is motor operated and is operated by a reversible electric actuator.","In a typical aircraft there are several bleed air shutoff valves. For instance, in a P-3 there are usually seven bleed air shutoff valves. If one is removed or is not operational this may render the entire aircraft inoperable. Maintaining the bleed air shutoff valves and ensuring their proper operation can save substantial costs, minimize aircraft down time, and possibly save lives. Currently, the United States Navy utilizes test procedures outlined in NAVAIR manual 01-75PAA-2-50, W\/P 019-00. Bleed air shutoff valves are passing test procedures outlined in the manual, but failing at an operational level. In addition, the procedures outlined in this manual present a safety concern for the user, specifically the risk for a possible electric shock. Thus there exists a need for a test set and procedure that is safe and adequately tests bleed air shutoff valves.","The present invention is directed to a test set that includes a circuit breaker, at least two test points, a single pole switch, a double pole switch, and a set of test lights. The at least two test points are for reading amperage when testing a bleed air shutoff valve in an aircraft. The at least two test points electronically communicate with the circuit breaker. The single pole switch electronically communicates with the circuit breaker and the at least two test points. The double pole switch is able to open and close and shut off the bleed air shutoff valve electronically. The double pole switch electronically communicates with the single pole switch and the at least two test points. One of the lights is able to inform the user whether power is being applied to the test set, another light is able to inform the user whether the double pole switch is open.","It is a feature of the invention to provide a test set that is reliable and inexpensive.","It is a feature of the invention to provide a test set that increases usage life of bleed air shutoff valves by determining which components need to be replaced or repaired.","It is a feature of the invention to provide a test set that provides no electrical hazard to the user.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example in . As seen in , the test set  includes a circuit breaker , at least two test points , a single pole switch , a double pole switch , and a set of test lights . The at least two test points  are for reading amperage when testing a bleed air shutoff valve  in an aircraft. The at least two test points  electronically communicate with the circuit breaker . The single pole switch  electronically communicates with the circuit breaker  and the at least two test points . The double pole switch  is able to open, close and shut off the bleed air shutoff valve  electronically. The double pole switch  electronically communicates with the single pole switch  and the at least two test points . At least one of the test lights  is able to inform a user whether power is applied to the test set , while another test light  is able to inform a user whether the double pole switch  is open.","In the discussion of the present invention, the system will be discussed in an aircraft environment, specifically a military aircraft engine environment; however, the system can also be utilized for any type of system that utilizes a valve.","A circuit breaker  may be defined, but without limitation, as an automatic device which, under abnormal conditions, will open a current carrying circuit without damaging itself, or it can be defined as, without limitation, as a device for interrupting a circuit under normal or abnormal conditions by means of separable contacts. The circuit breaker  may be a one (1) Amp circuit breaker and may remove power from the test set  in case of electrical or mechanical problems with the bleed air shutoff valve .","The preferred single pole switch  is a single pole\/single throw switch . A single pole\/single throw switch  can be defined, but without limitation, as a two terminal switch which either opens or closes one circuit.","The preferred double pole switch  is a double pole\/double throw switch . A double pole\/double throw switch  can be defined, but without limitation, as a switch that has six terminals and is used to connect one pair of terminals to either of the other two pairs.","The test set  may further include a connector  that electronically connects the test set  to the bleed air shutoff valve . The test set  may also include an enclosure . The circuit breaker , the at least two test points , the single pole switch , the double pole switch  may be disposed within the enclosure . The set of test lights  may be disposed on the outside portion  of the enclosure  such that the test lights  may be seen without opening the enclosure . The single pole switch  may have a single pole switch button  or flip switch, which allows a user to open or close the single pole switch . The double pole switch  may have a double pole switch button  or flip switch, which allows a user to open or close the double pole switch . The single pole switch button  or flip switch and the double pole switch button  or flip switch may be located on the outside portion  of the enclosure  so that the switch or button may be manipulated without opening the enclosure .","The test set  may also include an external meter , which allows reading of amperage when testing the bleed air shutoff valve . The external meter  may be disposed on the outside portion  of the enclosure .","The test set  may also include a power ground . A power ground  may be defined, but without limitation, as the ground between units which is part of a circuit for the main source of power to, or from, these units.","To test the bleed air shutoff valve , the test set  is connected to the bleed air shutoff valve  via the connector  using an interface test cable . The preferred set up is shown in . Power is applied to the test set , which in turn applies power to the bleed air shutoff valve . Multimeter leads are attached to the bleed air shutoff valve . The single pole switch button  or flip switch is set to the Amp position, which closes the single pole switch . The test set  may have a \u201cclosed\u201d light  and an \u201copen\u201d light  (both being test lights ). The lights show whether the double pole switch  is open or closed. The \u201cclosed\u201d light  or \u201copen\u201d light  should illuminate and the external meter  should indicate 40+\/\u22125 milliamps (ma). If the \u201cclosed\u201d light  or the \u201copen\u201d light  do not illuminate and\/or a reading within the acceptable range of milliamps is not shown on the external meter , this is an indication the motor of the bleed air shutoff valve  or the external meter  is malfunctioning. Replace the external meter  and test the bleed air shutoff valve  again. If the outcome is the same then the motor of the bleed air shutoff valve  needs to be replaced.","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements. The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.","Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features, aspect and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims, and accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
