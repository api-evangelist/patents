{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/486,526 filed May 16, 2011 by Wang Guo Qiang et al. and entitled \u201cSelective Content Routing and Storage Protocol for Information-Centric Network,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","In a content oriented network (CON), a content router is responsible for routing user requests and content to proper recipients. In the CON or an Information-Centric Network (ICN), a domain-wide unique name is assigned to each entity that is part of a content delivery framework. The entities may comprise data content, such as video clips or web pages, and\/or infrastructure elements, such as routers, switches, or servers. The content router uses name prefixes, which can be full content names or proper prefixes of content names instead of network addresses, to route content packets within the content network. In the CON, content delivery including publishing, requesting, managing (e.g., modification, deletion, etc.) may be based on content name and not content location. One aspect of the CON that may be different from traditional Internet Protocol (IP) networks is the ability of the CON to interconnect multiple geographical points and cache content temporarily or store content on a more persistent basis. This may allow content to be served from the network instead of an original server, and thus may substantially improve user experience. The caching\/storing may be used for real time data that is fetched by the user or for persistent data that belongs to the user or to a content provider, e.g., a third party provider.","In one embodiment, a network component comprising a receiver configured to receive an advertisement for a content name for content associated with a list of secured router identifiers (SRIDs) that indicates a plurality of content routers authorized for routing and caching the content, a processor configured to determine whether to flood the advertisement to a plurality of neighboring nodes if a locally assigned SRID is included in the list of SRIDs received in the advertisement or to drop the advertisement otherwise, a transmitter configured to flood the advertisement on a plurality of ports coupled to the neighboring nodes, and a storage configured to cache received content if the received content is associated with the locally assigned SRID.","In another embodiment, the disclosure includes a method implemented by at least one network component, comprising receiving at a content router an advertisement for a published content that comprises a content name, a list of SRIDs for a plurality of content routers authorized to route and cache the content, and a list of virtual private group (VPG) identifiers (IDs) for virtual private network (VPN) instances associated with the content and the content routers, populating a routing table with the content name if the content router's own assigned SRID is detected in the list of SRIDs, flooding the advertisement to a plurality of neighboring nodes if the content router's own assigned SRID is detected in the list of SRIDs, and dropping or further flooding (based on routing policy) the advertisement without populating the routing table if the content router's own assigned SRID is not detected in the list of SRIDs.","In a third aspect, the disclosure includes the disclosure includes a system comprising one or more content routers coupled to each other and configured to route and cache content data, one or more customer nodes coupled to at least some of the content routers and configured to publish and subscribe content data, wherein the customer nodes are enabled by a context-based networking framework to publish content data with user-empowered policy control for selective content access, storage, and routing.","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","ICN is one form of CON that is being considered as next generation Internet architecture to support both content dissemination traffic and conversational traffic. Different from today's IP routers, ICN routers may combine content routing, content computing power, and content local cache\/storage capabilities. Achieving reliable and secure content distribution may be a challenge in ICN, such as when users have some controls over content distribution. In some ICN models, such as content centric network (CCN)\/named data networking (NDN) models, a content name (e.g., a prefix) may be used for content routing, which may define the content reachability to guide content retrieval from ICN routers. Internet routing protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), have been proposed to be extended to populate content prefix to every ICN router (e.g., within a network, domain, or group) for content routing operation.","Due to the characteristics of the OSPF \u201cflooding\u201d protocol, the prefixes may be populated globally, i.e., to every router in the network or domain. This global flooding may be suitable for typical or traditional IP routing networks, which may rely on the topological links to form IP connectivity and host reachability. In such networks, every router may need a global knowledge of network topology. However, in ICN, the information publisher may want to impose constrains, e.g., based on privacy and security policy, on where content may be forwarded and temporarily cached (or permanently stored). For example, an enterprise may want to create a VPN in the ICN, which may only allow a designated subset of content routers to route and store content data. This content-based VPN may be established by consolidating a plurality of parameters of ICN network resources, such as link bandwidth, computing power, cache capacity, and the cached\/stored content. Current OSPF\/BGP protocols may not support such a content-based VPN.","Disclosed herein is a system and methods for implementing a selective content routing and storage protocol to support content-based VPN in ICN architecture. Content-based VPN, as a service, may allow a content publisher to isolate\/divide ICN resources as a dedicated virtual domain over a publicly sharable infrastructure taking into account VPN service level agreements (SLAs), such as performance, security, reliability, and availability requirements, which may span both the intelligent content and transport plane of the ICN. Further the ICN service provider (SP) may expose several service application programming interfaces (APIs) to enable content publishing and request of content from the ICN. The system and methods may scope the VPN interactions within a privatized context in the ICN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","110","110","120","130","120","130","130","100","120","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","100","200","210","220","230"]},"The user nodes  may comprise a plurality of logical blocks or components for context based services or operations, including application, application context, content delivery context, access adaptation, and access technology or interface, such as wireless interfaces for mobile users (e.g., Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), 3\/4generation mobile telecommunications (3G\/4G)). The content routing nodes  may also comprise a plurality of logical blocks or components for context based services or operations, including service delivery context, content delivery context, content routing and storage, and strategic content transportation adaptation. The transport\/relay\/server  nodes may also comprise a plurality of logical blocks or components for context based services or operations, including application context, content delivery context, and content transport network adaptation.","To enable content dissemination in a VPN's context, the publishing of content may be extended to or scoped within a subset of content routers that may correspond to the VPN's instance. Scoping the published content to a subset of content routers for the VPN may be achieved according to how the control plane is instantiated. For instance, if each VPN in the ICN is instantiated with its own control plane, then each VPN's own control plane may also scope the flooding of any publishing action from the user. However, this approach may have relatively high provisioning and management cost.","Alternatively, a single instance of the control plane, e.g., with appropriate IDs, may be used to control the flooding for multiple VPNs. In this case, network routing protocols, such as the OSPF and\/or BGP, may be extended to carry a selected set of secured router IDs (SRIs or SRIDs), for example a public key or hashed public key of each router, in a routing protocol data unit. The SRIDs may be associated with a content prefix that indicates a content object. The SRIDs may indicate the authorized content routers for forwarding content interests (requested content), forwarding content interest responses (content objects), and caching content corresponding to the prefix. Additionally, the routing protocol may carry a selected set of VPN IDs, which may indicate the VPN instances that are associated with the content routers for the content prefix. A set of VPN IDs may be associated with the set of SRIDs to group the content routers into logical VPN groups.","In an embodiment, a list of VPN IDs may be paired with a list for SRIDs and combined with a name prefix, e.g., (prefix, {VPN-ID list}, {router-ID list}), to form a binding relationship that defines which content router may or may not flood VPN specific LSAs to adjacent neighbors, and which content router may or may not cache the content data with the given prefix.  illustrates an embodiment of a LSA flooding scheme , which may be part of the context-based networking framework . The LSA flooding scheme  may be implemented to publish or flood VPN LSAs using a list for VPN IDs, a list of SRIDs, and a content prefix. The LSAs may be flooded in an ICN to populate content prefixes (in routing tables) in authorized or selected content routers that correspond to selected VPN instances or logical groups. The flooded prefixes in the ICN may uniquely identify content objects that may be published and delivered to customers based on request. Populating the prefix in selected content routers for selected VPN instances may virtually partition the content routing space as disjoint privatized sub-spaces of content routers and associated network resources, also referred to herein a VPNs, VPN instances, virtual private groups (VPGs), or VPG instances, interchangeably. The ICN may comprise a plurality of network nodes  that may be coupled to each other and to a plurality of customer nodes\/sites . The ICN may also comprise an ICN SP controller , e.g., at a control plane of the ICN. The components of the ICN may be arranged as shown in .","The network nodes  may be coupled to each other via network links, e.g., fixed connections. The network nodes  may be any nodes, devices, or components that support transportation of traffic, e.g., frames and\/or packets, through the ICN. The network nodes  may pass the traffic onto or receive the traffic from other nodes in the ICN. The network nodes  may comprise a plurality of content servers that store or cache content, which may be provided to users or subscribers, e.g., upon demand. For example, the network nodes  may be routers, switches, or bridges, such as backbone core bridges (BCBs), provider core bridges (PCBs), or label switch routers (LSRs).","Additionally, the network nodes  may comprise content routers that forward content based on content name prefixes. The content routers may be configured to route, cache, and\/or store content. Some of the content routers, e.g., edge nodes, may be coupled to the customer nodes\/sites , e.g., via a plurality of access networks, wired links, or wireless links. The content routers may be edge nodes and possibly core nodes in the ICN that forward content traffic to the customer nodes\/sites  based on a customer request or demand. The content routers may also receive content requests from the customer nodes\/sites . For example, the content routers may be enhanced versions of traditional routers or bridges, such as backbone edge bridges (BEBs), provider edge bridges (PEBs), or label edge routers (LERs) that forward content based on content name prefixes. From a transport perspective, the roles of these nodes may be the same (even for backward compatibility), but more importantly they may be enabled for content distribution through features like dynamic\/persistent caching, and application level assistance. These content routers may also be functional CCN routers or content routers based on other proposals, in which case the goal of content dissemination is ingrained in the transportation layer. The ICN may be a combination of such enhanced content routers, traditional router\/switches, or a combination thereof.","The customer nodes\/sites  may be nodes, devices, or components configured to deliver content to and receive content requests from the users or user applications. For instance, the customer nodes may be fixed or mobile user-oriented devices, such as desktop computers, notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or cellular telephones. Alternatively, the customer nodes\/sites  may be connectivity devices at customer premises, such as modems or set-top boxes. The customer nodes\/sites  may also comprise customer equipment (not shown) that may be configured to receive content from the ICN, e.g., via access networks, and distribute the content to a plurality of customers. For instance, the customer nodes\/sites  may comprise optical network terminals (ONUs) and\/or very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) transceiver units at residential locations (VTU-Rs). The access networks may be any networks that provide access to the content in the OCN, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The customer nodes\/sites  may also comprise service stations such as application servers.","At least some of the customer nodes\/sites  may be mobile devices that may be coupled to the network nodes , e.g., edge nodes, via wireless links. The customer nodes\/sites  may publish (push) and\/or subscribe or request (pull) content in the ICN. The customer nodes\/sites  may correspond to users and\/or user applications. The users may be publishers, subscribers, Enterprises (e.g., Healthcare, Financial, Insurance, Movie studios, etc.), Social Networks, Governments, First Responder networks, Sensor Networks, Data Transmission Networks, Mobile-to-Mobile (M2M) networks, other content user types, or combinations thereof. The ICN may provide a plurality of services to the customer nodes\/sites , including content publishing\/subscribing or requesting, content cashing\/storing, customer mobility support, security, and\/or other content oriented services.","The ICN SP controller  may be a control plane entity that communicates with the network nodes  to distribute keys, e.g., SRIDs and\/or VPN IDs, to the network nodes , e.g., content routers. The ICN SP controller  may also communicate with the customer nodes\/sites  to authorize\/authenticate users or customers and hence allow content publication\/subscription, as described below. In an embodiment, the SRID may be obtained from a global name service, e.g., a Domain Name System (DNS). The SRID may be stored in the DNS with a corresponding readable name, for example content-router@Santa-Clara.ATT. When an application (by a publisher) sends its name to the DNS server, the SRID may be resolved by the server and returned to the application.","In the LSA flooding scheme , a SRID list may be routed in an opaque Type-Length-Value (TLV) in an extended LSA. The LSA may also comprise a VPN ID list and a prefix associated with content or content object. Each content router that receives the LSA message may check if the SRID list in the LSA includes the content router's own assigned SRID (e.g., by the ICN SP controller ). The prefix in the LSA may be associated with all the VPN instances that match the received VPN ID list in the LSA. The content router may decide if it is allowed to further flood the LSA message, e.g., to neighbor nodes, or to drop the LSA message. For instance, the default operation may be to flood the advertisement message to the content router's neighbors, but the advertisement message may be dropped if the content router's policies prevent it from further flooding the advertisement message.","Specifically, if the SRID list comprises the content router's SRID, then the content router may add an entry in a local routing table for the prefix in the LSA and associate the prefix with the VPN IDs in the VPN ID list. If an entry for the prefix already exists in the local routing table, then the content router may add any VPN ID in the list that is not already associated with the prefix in the existing entry. The content router may then flood the LSA message to its neighbors. If the content router's own SRID is not included in the SRID list in the LSA, then the content router may drop the LSA without further flooding.","The LSAs may be transmitted by content publishers to enable user-empowered policy control for content access, storage, and routing. For instance, the ICN SP controller  may allow or expose service APIs for the customer nodes\/sites  to enable content publishing and request of content in the ICN. As such, the ICN SP controller  may provide the SRID list to content publishers. The LSAs may be routed in the ICN using any supported routing protocol such as OSPF and\/or BGP, e.g., using proper extended advertisements. The SRID in the LSA may be optional. If the LSA is routed without including a SRID, then the content routers may use the default routing protocol procedures to process the LSA and implement prefix flooding. As such, all the content routers may flood the prefix, and each router may cache the received content associated with the prefix.","By using this selective routing protocol, the content routers in an Autonomous System (AS) or domain (in the ICN) may have different content prefixes at the routing entries in their routing tables. Thus, this selective routing scheme may virtually partition the content routing space as disjoint sub-spaces, where each sub-space may comprise selected content routers privatized to serve one or more corresponding VPNs. For instance, a determined content prefix may only be routed and cached within its subspace of designated content routers. When a subscriber issues a request for an interested (requested) data, the interest (request) may only be routed in this virtual sub-space, and the returned data (interest response) may only be routed and cached in the content router within the selected sub-space.","Such constraints on advertisement may also be applied to inter-domain routing (routing between domains). In this case, updates (update messages) indicating selected content router(s) and VPN instance(s) (using SRIDs and VPN IDs) may be exchanged between domains. The indicated content routers and VPN instances in the updates may constrain the application of the updates to only those indicated content routers and VPN instances that are authorized to apply the updates across the domains. The updates may comprise publish and\/or subscribe requests for content.","The LSA flooding scheme  may also provide cooperation between reachability policy (using the VPN ID list) and storage policy, under the supervisory of policy context, in the ICN. When a content is relayed back (in a response to a forwarded interest), the content routers associated with the indicated prefix may determine whether to cache or store the content. The content routers may be authorized to store or cache the relayed content according to the indicated SRID list and VPN ID list. Thus, using the SRID list and associated VPN ID list may also enable a selective storage approach.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","100","400","412","414","420","412","414"]},"The content may be routed and cached when an interest is received and forwarded from a subscriber or user (e.g., from one of the customer nodes\/sites ). The interest may comprise a name prefix that indicates the requested content. The interest may be forwarded to a source content router (e.g., one of the network nodes ) that initially stores the content from a publisher. Each content router that receives the interest may determine if the prefix in the interest matches an entry in the content router. If a prefix match is found, then the content router may forward the interest on the ports indicated in the prefix entry in the local routing table. Otherwise, the content router may drop the interest. As such, the interest may be forwarded in the ICN until the interest reaches a content router that stores or caches the indicated content, which may be the source content router that initially stores the content from a publisher or any content router in the ICN that caches the content.","The content may then be routed from the source content router or the caching content router across the ICN to reach the subscriber. The content may be fetched from the content router and routed back via a plurality of content routers according to the routing entries in the content routers, e.g., on a hop-by-hop basis. The routing entries may be pre-established using the LSA flooding scheme , where only the authorized content routers according to the SRID list and VPN ID list maintain entries comprising the prefix indicated in the interest. Only the authorized content routers may also cache (temporarily) or store (more permanently) the content while routing the content. The selective caching\/storing may also be based on additional routing\/storing policies or schemes that may be imposed by the ICN control plane or SP, e.g., to improve scalability and reachability.","In an embodiment, one or more SRIDs (or SRID list) may be stored as meta-data combined with the content data. The meta-data may be stored\/cached and routed with the content and may be forwarded in the interest for requesting the content. The SRIDs may be provided by the content publisher or the source content router that stores the content, e.g., using the LSA flooding scheme . The SRIDs may specify the content routers that may access the content (associated with a content prefix) in the ICN. Additionally, the meta-data may also store one or more secured community ID (SCID), e.g., in a SCID list), that may also be provided by the publisher. The SCID may specify an authorized subscriber for accessing or obtaining the content. The SCID may also be associated with a publisher and carried in both interest and content. The publisher SCID may be used to verify the provenance of the publisher (e.g., a fraudulent publisher's content may be rejected by the ICN). The subscriber may also indicate its assigned SCID in the interest forwarded to obtain the content. Thus, the source content router may compare the SCID in the interest with the SCID list associated with the content to decide whether to forward the content. If the SCID in the interest does not match any of the SCIDs in the SCID list, then the source content router may decide not to accept the request and ignore the interest. Similarly, any of the content routers that cached the content or a portion of the content, e.g., from the source content router, may store the meta-data that includes the SRID list and the SCID list. Thus, any of the content routers that cache the content in the ICN and receive the interest may determine whether to accept the request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","100","512","514","510","512","514","510"]},"First, a publisher (one of the customer nodes\/sites ) may publish the content using a publish function that includes the content name or prefix, content data, ACL (SCID list), a signature for published content, and\/or other related information. The publisher may send the content and the other information to an edge content router (one of the network nodes ) for publishing. The content may be initially stored at the edge content router, which may also flood the content prefix in the ICN, e.g., using the LSA flooding scheme . The publisher may also send the SCID list to the authentication service .","Hence, when a subscriber (one of the customer nodes\/sites ) wants to fetch the content, the subscriber may first send an authentication request to the authentication service . The authentication request may comprise subscriber credentials. Upon successful authentication, the authentication service  may return the SCID for the subscriber, e.g., from the SCID list by the provider associated with the same content (content prefix). The subscriber may then send an interest to request the content to the ICN, including the SCID, via one of the content routers (one of the network nodes ), which may be an edge node. The interest request may be sent via a subscribe function that includes the content name prefix and the SCID. The content router may then forward the interest as described above to route content from the source content router or any content router that caches the content in the ICN to the subscriber. The content may also be further cached at one or more content routers along the routing path from the source to the subscriber, e.g., using the ICN content routing and storage scheme .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","100","600","300","300","610","620","600","620","600","630","600","625","630","635","625","600","640","600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","700","700","700","710","712","700","720","720","700","730","732","712","720","732","700"]},"The content aware unit  may also comprise a programmable content forwarding plane block  and one or more storage blocks  that may be coupled to the programmable content forwarding plane block . The programmable content forwarding plane block  may be configured to implement content forwarding and processing functions, such as at an application layer or L3, where the content may be forwarded based on content name or prefix and possibly other content related information that maps the content to network traffic. Such mapping information may be maintained in a content table at the content aware unit  or the network unit . The programmable content forwarding plane block  may interpret user requests for content and accordingly fetch content, e.g., based on meta-data and\/or content name (prefix), from the network or other content routers and may store the content, e.g., temporarily, in the storage blocks . The programmable content forwarding plane block  may then forward the cached content to the user. The programmable content forwarding plane block  may be implemented using software, hardware, or both and may operate above the IP layer or L2. The storage blocks  may comprise a cache  for temporarily storing content, such as content that is requested by a subscriber. Additionally, the storage blocks  may comprise a long-term storage  for storing content relatively longer, such as content submitted by a publisher. For instance, the cache  and the long-term storage  may include Dynamic random-access memories (DRAMs), solid-state drives (SSDs), hard disks, or combinations thereof.","The network components described above may be implemented on any general-purpose network component, such as a computer or network component with sufficient processing power, memory resources, and network throughput capability to handle the necessary workload placed upon it.  illustrates a typical, general-purpose network component  suitable for implementing one or more embodiments of the components disclosed herein.

Secondary storage  may be used to store programs that are loaded into RAM  when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM  is used to store instructions and perhaps data that are read during program execution. ROM  is a non-volatile memory device that typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage .
