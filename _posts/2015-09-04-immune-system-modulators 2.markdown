More particularly, the invention relates to compositions and methods for altering immune function. More specifically, the invention relates to compositions and methods for affecting immune stimulation mediated through Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecules.","Stimulation of the immune system, which includes stimulation of either or both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, is a complex phenomenon that can result in either protective or adverse physiologic outcomes for the host. In recent years there has been increased interest in the mechanisms underlying innate immunity, which is believed to initiate and support adaptive immunity. This interest has been fueled in part by the recent discovery of a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor proteins known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) believed to be involved in innate immunity as receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Compositions and methods useful for modulating innate immunity are therefore of great interest, as they may affect therapeutic approaches to conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, atherosclerosis, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, graft versus host disease (GvHD), infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency.","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition and signaling molecules involved in innate immunity. This family includes at least twelve members, designated TLR1-TLR13, for which the function and specificity are known for most but not all members. Certain of these TLRs are known to signal in response to encounter with particular types of nucleic acid molecules. For example, TLR9 signals in response to CpG-containing DNA, TLR3 signals in response to double-stranded RNA, and TLR7 and TLR8 signal in response to certain single-stranded RNA. There have been a number of reports describing the immunostimulatory effect of certain types of nucleic acid molecules, including CpG nucleic acids and double-stranded RNA. Of note, it was reported that Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes bacterial DNA and CpG DNA while TLR7 and 8 recognize single stranded RNA: Hemmi H et al. (2000) 408:740-5; Bauer S. et al. (2001) 98:9237-42; Heil et al. (2004) 303:1526. In addition to their natural ligands, certain synthetic or artificial ligands for these nucleic-acid responsive TLRs are also known. These include certain CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides (CpG ODN), oligoribonucleotides (ORN) and certain ORN analogs, and certain small molecules including imiquimod (R-837) and resiquimod (R-848). Imiquimod and resiquimod are classified as imidazoaminoquinoline-4-amines; the former is currently marketed as Aldara\u2122 by 3M Pharmaceuticals for topical treatment of anogenital warts associated with papillomavirus infection. In addition to their use in the treatment of certain viral infections such as papillomavirus, certain TLR agonists are also believed to be useful as adjuvants, antitumor agents, and anti-allergy agents. Because a number of diseases and conditions can be treated by enhancing innate immunity, there is a continued need for additional and improved TLR agonists.","It was also recently reported that immune complexes containing IgG and nucleic acid can stimulate TLR9 and participate in B-cell activation in certain autoimmune diseases. Leadbetter E. A. et al. (2002) 416:595-8. Similar and additional documentation of these claims have been made for TLR7, 8 and 9: reviewed in Sun S. et al. (2007) Inflammation and Allergy\u2014Drug Targets 6:223-235.","Compounds as immune system modulators bearing a pteridine core are described. The molecules described herein can alter TLR-mediated immunostimulatory signaling by inhibiting TLR signaling and thus can be useful as inhibitors of immune stimulation. Compositions and methods described herein are useful for inhibiting immune stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Such compositions and methods thus are useful in a number of clinical applications, including as pharmaceutical agents and methods for treating conditions involving unwanted immune activity, including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The compositions of the invention can also be used in methods for the preparation of medicaments for use in the treatment of conditions involving unwanted immune activity, including a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"35.64mm","wi":"57.91mm","file":"US09637489-20170502-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}]},"if Z is present, then\n\n","if Z is absent, then\n\n","X is absent or is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or heterocycle;","Q is H, (CH)NRR, NR(CH)NRR, OR, SR, or CRRR, in which q is 0 or 1 and p is 2-4;","R, R, and R are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, heterocycle, alkylheterocycle, or Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded form a heterocycle, which may be optionally substituted by from one to four groups which may be the same or different selected from (C-C)alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, C(\u2550O)R, (CH)OR, and (CH)NRR, in which p is 2-4;","Rand R are each independently H, alkyl, heteroaryl,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0023"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"19.30mm","wi":"20.32mm","file":"US09637489-20170502-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["3","4","1","4","a\u2032","b\u2032","c\u2032","1","4"]},"Rand Rare each independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, heteroaryl, aryl or alkylaryl, or Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded form a heterocycle; wherein the heteroaryl or aryl is optionally substituted by (C-C)alkyl, halogen, or amino;","Y is oxygen, sulfur, or NR, where Ris hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, or aryl group;","Ris alkyl, aryl, or heterocycle;","L and L\u2032 are each independently alkyl or alkenyl containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms;","Rand Rare each independently hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, CF, OCF, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl, heterocycle, OR, SR, S(\u2550O)R, S(\u2550O)R, NRR, S(\u2550O)NRR, C(\u2550O)OR, C(\u2550O)R, C(\u2550O)NRR, OC(\u2550O)R, OC(\u2550O)NRR, NRC(\u2550O)OR, NRC(\u2550O)R, alkaryl, alkylheterocyclic, or NR(CH)NRR;","each occurrence of Ris independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, heterocycle, or aryl; and","each occurrence of R, and Ris independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycle, aryl, or said Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded optionally form a heterocycle comprising 1-4 heteroatoms, wherein the heterocycle is optionally substituted by (C-C)alkyl;","provided that when Rand Rare H or methyl, then Q is not H.","In some embodiments, X is absent.

Cytokines include interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor beta, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), chemokines, as well as others. Various cytokines affect innate immunity, acquired immunity, or both. Cytokines specifically include, without limitation, IFN-a, IFN-p, IFN-y, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, TNF-a, TGF-\u03b2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Chemokines specifically include, without limitation, IL-8, IP-10, I-TAC, RANTES, MIP-1a, MIP-1p, Gro-a, Gro-, Gro-y, MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3.","Most mature CD4+T helper cells can be categorized into cytokine-associated, cross-regulatory subsets or phenotypes: Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg. Th1 cells are associated with IL-2, IL-3, IFN, GM-CSF and high levels of TNF-a. Th2 cells are associated with IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, GM-CSF and low levels of TNF-a. The Th1 subset promotes both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity that is characterized by immunoglobulin class switching to IgG2a in mice. Th1 responses can also be associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity and autoimmune disease. The Th2 subset induces primarily humoral immunity and induces immunoglobulin class switching to IgE and IgGI in mice. The antibody isotypes associated with Th1 responses generally have good neutralizing and opsonizing capabilities, whereas those associated with Th2 responses are associated more with allergic responses.","Several factors have been shown to influence commitment to Th1 or Th2 profiles. The best characterized regulators are cytokines. IL-12 and IFN-y are positive Th1 and negative Th2 regulators. IL-12 promotes IFN-y production, and IFN-y provides positive feedback for IL-12. IL-4 and IL-10 appear to be required for the establishment of the Th2 cytokine profile and to down-regulate Th1 cytokine production; the effects of IL-4 are in some cases dominant over those of IL-12. IL-13 was shown to inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 and TNF-a by LPS-induced monocytes, in a way similar to IL-4.","As used herein, \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to any amount that is necessary or sufficient for achieving or promoting a desired outcome. In some instances an effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount is any amount that is necessary or sufficient for promoting or achieving a desired biological response in a subject. The effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular agent being administered, the size of the subject, or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art can empirically determine the effective amount of a particular agent without necessitating undue experimentation.","As used herein, \u201cgraft rejection\u201d refers to immunologically mediated hyperacute, acute, or chronic injury to a tissue or organ derived from a source other than the host. The term thus encompasses both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection, as well as rejection of both allografts and xenografts.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune cell\u201d refers to a cell belonging to the immune system. Immune cells include T lymphocytes (T cells), B lymphocytes (B cells), natural killer (NK) cells, granulocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and specialized forms of any of the foregoing, e.g., plasmacytoid dendritic cells, plasma cells, NKT, T helper, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune complex\u201d refers to any conjugate including an antibody and an antigen specifically bound by the antibody. In one embodiment, the antigen is an autoantigen.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune complex comprising a nucleic acid\u201d refers to any conjugate including an antibody and a nucleic acid-containing antigen specifically bound by the antibody. The nucleic acid-containing antigen can include chromatin, ribosomes, small nuclear proteins, histones, nucleosomes, DNA, RNA, or any combination thereof. The antibody can but need not necessarily bind specifically to a nucleic acid component of the nucleic acid-containing antigen. In some embodiments, the term \u201cimmune complex comprising a nucleic acid\u201d refers also to non-antibody complexes such as HMGB1, LL-37, and other nucleic acid binding proteins such as histones, transcription factors and enzymes complexed with nucleic acids.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune complex-associated disease\u201d refers to any disease characterized by the production and\/or tissue deposition of immune complexes, including, but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and related connective tissue diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C- and hepatitis B-related immune complex disease (e.g., cryoglobulinemia), Beget's syndrome, autoimmune glomerulonephritides, and vasculopathy associated with the presence of LDL\/anti-LDL immune complexes.","As used herein, \u201cimmunodeficiency\u201d refers to a disease or disorder in which the subject's immune system is not functioning in normal capacity or in which it would be useful to boost a subject's immune response for example to eliminate a tumor or cancer (e.g., tumors of the brain, lung (e.g., small cell and non-small cell), ovary, breast, prostate, colon, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas) or an infection in a subject. The immunodeficiency can be acquired or it can be congenital.","As used herein, \u201cimmunostimulatory nucleic acid-associated response in a subject\u201d refers to a measurable response in a subject associated with administration to the subject of an immunostimulatory nucleic acid. Such responses include, without limitation, elaboration of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, or immunoglobulin; expression of immune cell surface activation markers; Th1\/Th2 skewing; and clinical disease activity.","As used herein, the terms \u201cinfection\u201d and, equivalently, \u201cinfectious disease\u201d refer to a condition in which an infectious organism or agent is present in a detectable amount in the blood or in a normally sterile tissue or normally sterile compartment of a subject. Infectious organisms and agents include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The terms encompass both acute and chronic infections, as well as sepsis.","As used herein, the term \u201cinnate immune response\u201d refers to any type of immune response to certain pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Innate immunity, which is also known in the art as natural or native immunity, involves principally neutrophils, granulocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells, NKT cells, and NK cells. Innate immune responses can include, without limitation, type I interferon production (e.g., IFN-a), neutrophil activation, macrophage activation, phagocytosis, opsonization, complement activation, and any combination thereof","As used herein, the term \u201cself-DNA\u201d refers to any DNA derived from the genome of a host subject. In one embodiment, self-DNA includes complementary DNA (cDNA) derived from a host subject. Self-DNA includes intact and degraded DNA.","As used herein, the term \u201cself-RNA\u201d refers to any RNA derived from the genome of a host subject. In one embodiment self-RNA is a messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from a host subject. In another embodiment self-RNA is a regulatory RNA such as micro RNAs. In one embodiment self-RNA includes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) derived from a host subject. Self-RNA includes intact and degraded RNA.","As used herein, the term \u201csubject\u201d refers to a vertebrate animal. In one embodiment the subject is a mammal. In one embodiment the subject is a human. In other embodiments the subject is a non-human vertebrate animal, including, without limitation, non-human primates, laboratory animals, livestock, domesticated animals, and non-domesticated animals.","As used herein, \u201csubject having or at risk of developing TLR-mediated immunostimulation\u201d refers to a subject exposed to or at risk of exposure to a PAMPs, DAMPs or other TLR ligand.","As used herein, the terms \u201cToll-like receptor\u201d and, equivalently, \u201cTLR\u201d refer to any member of a family of at least thirteen highly conserved mammalian pattern recognition receptor proteins (TLR1-TLR13) which recognize PAMPs, DAMPs and act as key signaling elements in innate immunity. TLR polypeptides share a characteristic structure that includes an extracellular (extracytoplasmic) domain that has leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular (cytoplasmic) domain that is involved in TLR signaling. TLRs include but are not limited to human TLRs.","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for all ten currently known human TLRs are available from public databases such as GenBank. Similarly, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for various TLRs from numerous non-human species are also available from public databases including GenBank. For example, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR9 (hTLR9) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF245704 (coding region spanning nucleotides 145-3243) and AAF78037, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR9 (mTLR9) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF348140 (coding region spanning nucleotides 40-3138) and AAK29625, respectively. The deduced human TLR9 protein contains 1,032 amino acids and shares an overall amino acid identity of 75.5% with mouse TLR9. Like other TLR proteins, human TLR9 contains extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a cytoplasmic Toll\/interleukin-1R (TIR) domain. It also has a signal peptide (residues 1-25) and a transmembrane domain (residues 819-836).","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR8 (hTLR8) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF245703 (coding region spanning nucleotides 49-3174) and AAF78036, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR8 (mTLR8) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AY035890 (coding region spanning nucleotides 59-3157) and AAK62677, respectively.","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR7 (hTLR7) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF240467 (coding region spanning nucleotides 135-3285) and AAF60188, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR7 (mTLR7) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AY035889 (coding region spanning nucleotides 49-3201) and AAK62676, respectively.","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR3 (hTLR3) can be found as GenBank accession numbers NM003265 (coding region spanning nucleotides 102-2816) and NP003256, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR3 (hTLR3) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF355152 (coding region spanning nucleotides 44-2761) and AAK26117, respectively.","While hTLR1 is ubiquitously expressed, hTLR2, hTLR4 and hTLR5 are present in monocytes, polymorphonuclear phagocytes, and dendritic cells. Muzio M et al. (2000) J Leukoc Biol 67: 450-6. Recent publications reported that hTLR1, hTLR6, hTLR7, hTLR9 and hTLR10 are present in human B cells. Human TLR7 and hTLR9 are present in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), while myeloid dendritic cells express hTLR7 and hTLR8 but not hTLR9. Human TLR8, however, appears not to be expressed in pDCs.","As members of the pro-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family, TLRs share homologies in their cytoplasmic domains called Toll\/IL-1R homology (TIR) domains. See PCT published applications PCT\/US98\/08979 and PCT\/US01\/16766. Intracellular signaling mechanisms mediated by TLRs appear generally similar, with MyD88 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) believed to have critical roles. Wesche H et al. (1997) Immunity 7: 837-47; Medzhitov R et al. (1998) Mol Cell 2: 253-8; Adachi O et al. (1998) Immunity 9: 143-50; Kawai T et al. (1999) Immunity 11: 115-22); Cao Z et al. (1996) Nature 383: 443-6; Lomaga M A et al. (1999) Genes Dev 13: 1015-24. Signal transduction between MyD88 and TRAF6 is known to involve members of the serine-threonine kinase IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, including at least IRAK-1 and IRAK-2. Muzio M et al. (1997) Science 278: 1612-5.","Briefly, MyD88 is believed to act as an adapter molecule between the TIR domain of a TLR or IL-1R and IRAK (which includes at least any one of IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-4, and IRAK-M). MyD88 includes a C-terminal Toll homology domain and an N-terminal death domain. The Toll homology domain of MyD88 binds the TIR domain of TLR or IL-1R, and the death domain of MyD88 binds the death domain of the serine kinase IRAK IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which acts as an entryway into at least two pathways, one leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-KB and another leading to activation of Jun and Fos, members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family. Activation of NF-KB involves the activation of TAK-1, a member of the MAP 3 kinase (MAPK) family, and IKB kinases. The IoB kinases phosphorylate IKB, leading to its-degradation and the translocation of NF-KB to the nucleus. Activation of Jun and Fos is believed to involve MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs) and MAP kinases ERK, p38, and JNK\/SAPK. Both NF-KB and AP-1 are involved in controlling the transcription of a number of key immune response genes, including genes for various cytokines and costimulatory molecules. See Aderem A et al. (2000) Nature 406: 782-7; Hacker H et al. (1999) EMBO J 18: 6973-82.","As used herein, the terms \u201cTLR ligand\u201d and, equivalently, \u201cligand for a TLR\u201d and \u201cTLR signaling agonist\u201d, refer to a molecule, other than a small molecule according to Formula I described herein that interacts, directly or indirectly, with a TLR through a TLR domain other than a TIR domain and induces TLR-mediated signaling. In one embodiment a TLR ligand is a natural ligand, i.e., a TLR ligand that is found in nature. In one embodiment a TLR ligand refers to a molecule other than a natural ligand of a TLR, e.g., a molecule prepared by human activity. In one embodiment the TLR is TLR9 and the TLR signal agonist is a CpG nucleic acid.","Ligands for many but not all of the TLRs have been described. For instance, it has been reported that TLR2 signals in response to peptidoglycan and lipopeptides. Yoshimura A et al. (1999) J Immunol 163: 1-5; Brightbill H D et al. (1999) Science 285: 732-6; Aliprantis A O et al. (1999) Science 285: 736-9; Takeuchi O et al. (1999) Immunity 11: 443-51; Underhill D M et al. (1999) Nature 401: 811-5. TLR4 has been reported to signal in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). See Hoshino K et al. (1999) Immunol 162: 3749-52; Poltorak A et al. (1998) Science 282: 2085-8; Medzhitov R et al. (1997) Nature 388: 394-7. Bacterial flagellin has been reported to be a natural ligand for TLR5. See Hayashi F et al. (2001) Nature 410: 1099-1103. TLR6, in conjunction with TLR2, has been reported to signal in response to proteoglycan. See Ozinsky A et al. (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97: 13766-71; Takeuchi O et al. (2001) Int Immunol 13: 933-40.","Recently it was reported that TLR9 is a receptor for CpG DNA. Hemmi H et al. (2000) Nature 408: 740-5; Bauer S et al. (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98: 9237-42. CpG DNA, which includes bacterial DNA and synthetic DNA with CG dinucleotides in which cytosin is unmethylated, is described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Marshak-Rothstein and colleagues also recently reported their finding that TLR9 signaling can occur in certain autoimmune diseases in response to immune complexes containing IgG and chromatin. Leadbetter E A et al. (2002) Nature 416: 595-8. Thus, in a broader sense it appears that TLR9 can signal in response to self or non-self nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, when the nucleic acid is presented in a suitable context, e.g., as part of an immune complex.","Recently it was reported that certain imidazoquinoline compounds having antiviral activity are ligands of TLR7 and TLR8. Hemmi H et al. (2002) Nat Immunol 3: 196-200; Jurk M et al. (2002) Nat Immunol 3: 499. Imidazoquinolines are potent synthetic activators of immune cells with antiviral and antitumor properties. Using macrophages from wildtype and MyD88-deficient mice, Hemmi et al. recently reported that two imidazoquinolines, imiquimod and resiquimod (R848), induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) and activate NF-KB only in wildtype cells, consistent with activation through a TLR. Hemmi H et al. (2002) Nat Immunol 3: 196-200. Macrophages from mice deficient in TLR7 but not other TLRs produced no detectable cytokines in response to these imidazoquinolines. In addition, the imidazoquinolines induced dose-dependent proliferation of splenic B cells and the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in cells from wildtype but not TLR7\u2212\/\u2212 mice. Luciferase analysis established that expression of human TLR7, but not TLR2 or TLR4, in human embryonic kidney cells results in NF-KB activation in response to resiquimod. The findings of Hemmi et al. thus suggested that these imidazoquinoline compounds are non-natural ligands of TLR7 that can induce signaling through TLR7. Recently it was reported that R848 is also a ligand for human TLR8. See Jurk M et al. (2002) Nat Immunol 3:499. Nat Immunol 3: 499. It has also been reported that ssRNA is natural ligand and that aberrant stimulation of TLR7 and or TLR8 by RNA: complexes is involved in autoimmunity.","It was recently reported that ligands of TLR3 include poly (I:C) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). For purposes of this invention, poly (I:C) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are classified as oligonucleotide molecules. By stimulating kidney cells expressing one of a range of TLRs with poly (I:C), Alexopoulou et al. reported that only cells expressing TLR3 respond by activating NF-aB. See Alexopoulou L et al. (2001) Nature 413: 732-8.","Alexopoulou et al. also reported that wildtype cells stimulated with poly (I:C) activate NF-KB and produce inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-a, whereas the corresponding responses of TLR3\u2212\/\u2212 cells were significantly impaired. In contrast, TLR3\u2212\/\u2212 cells responded equivalently to wildtype cells in response to lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and CpG dinucleotides. Analysis of MyD88\u2212\/\u2212 cells indicated that this adaptor protein is involved in dsRNA-induced production of cytokines and proliferative responses, although activation of NF-KB and MAP kinases are not affected, indicating distinct pathways for these cellular responses. Alexopoulou et al. proposed that TLR3 may have a role in host defense against viruses.","As used herein, a \u201ccell expressing a TLR\u201d refers to any cell which expresses, either naturally or artificially, a functional TLR. A functional TLR is a full-length TLR protein or a fragment thereof capable of inducing a signal in response to interaction with its ligand.","Generally, the functional TLR will include at least a TLR ligand-binding fragment of the extracellular domain of the full-length TLR and at least a fragment of a TIR domain capable of interacting with another Toll homology domain-containing polypeptide, e.g., MyD88. In various embodiments the functional TLR is a full-length TLR selected from TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, and TLR10.","Compounds","In one aspect, novel pteridine compounds are described. Applicants have surprisingly discovered pteridine compounds as immune system modulators. It is unexpected that the pteridine compounds as disclosed herein are useful in methods for inhibiting an immune response, both in vitro and in vivo, including methods for treating immune complex associated diseases and autoimmune disorders. In another aspect, the invention provides novel pteridine compositions. As described further below, these compositions and other pteridine compositions have been discovered to be useful in methods for inhibiting an immune response, both in vitro and in vivo, including methods for treating immune complex associated diseases and autoimmune disorders. It is also believed that the novel pteridine compositions as described herein can be used for prevention and treatment of malaria, as well as for treatment of other diseases.","In one aspect, a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is described:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0287"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00023","num":"00023"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00023","he":"35.64mm","wi":"57.91mm","file":"US09637489-20170502-C00023.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Z is absent or present;","if Z is present, then\n\n","if Z is absent, then\n\n","X is absent or is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or heterocycle;","Q is H, (CH)NRR, NR(CH)NRR, OR, SR, or CRRR, in which q is 0 or 1 and p is 2-4;","R, R, and R are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, heterocycle, alkylheterocycle, or Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded form a heterocycle, which may be optionally substituted by from one to four groups which may be the same or different selected from (C-C)alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, C(\u2550O)R, (CH)OR, and (CH)NRR, in which p is 2-4;","Rand R are each independently H, alkyl, heteroaryl,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0262","num":"0302"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00024","num":"00024"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00024","he":"19.30mm","wi":"20.07mm","file":"US09637489-20170502-C00024.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["3","4","1","4","a\u2032","b\u2032","c\u2032 ","1","4"]},"Rand Rare each independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or alkylaryl, or Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded form a heterocycle; wherein the heteroaryl or aryl is optionally substituted by (C-C)alkyl, halogen, or amino;","Y is oxygen, sulfur, or NR, where Ris hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, or aryl group;","Ris alkyl, aryl, or heterocycle;","L and L\u2032 are each independently alkyl or alkenyl containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms;","Rand Rare each independently hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, CF, OCF, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl, heterocycle, OR, SR, S(\u2550O)R, S(\u2550O)R, NRR, S(\u2550O)NRR, C(\u2550O)OR, C(\u2550O)R, C(\u2550O)NRR, OC(\u2550O)R, OC(\u2550O)NRR, NRC(\u2550O)OR, NRC(\u2550O)R, alkaryl, alkylheterocyclic, or NR(CH)NRR;","each occurrence of Ris independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, heterocycle, or aryl; and","each occurrence of R, and Ris independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycle, aryl, or said Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded optionally form a heterocycle comprising 1-4 heteroatoms, wherein the heterocycle is optionally substituted by (C-C)alkyl;","provided that when Rand Rare H or methyl, then Q is not H.","In certain embodiments, X is absent.

It is now known that RPMI 8226 cells secrete a number of other chemokines and cytokines including IL-8, IL-10 and IP-10 in response to immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Because this cell line expresses TLR9, through which immunostimulatory nucleic acids such as for example CpG nucleic acids mediate their effects, it is a suitable cell line for use in the methods of the invention relating to CpG nucleic acids as reference and test compounds, as well as to other TLR9 ligands.","Similar to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the RPMI 8226 cell line has been observed to upregulate its cell surface expression of markers such as CD71, CD86 and HLA-DR in response to CpG nucleic acid exposure. This has been observed by flow cytometric analysis of the cell line. Accordingly, the methods provided herein can be structured to use appropriately selected cell surface marker expression as a readout, in addition to or in place of chemokine or cytokine production or other readouts described elsewhere herein.","The RPMI 8226 cell line has also been found to respond to certain small molecules including imidazoquinoline compounds. For example, incubation of RPMI 8226 cells with the imidazoquinoline compound R848 (resiquimod) induces IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 production. It has recently been reported that R848 mediates its immunostimulatory effects through TLR7 and TLR8. The ability of RPMI 8226 to respond to R848 suggests that the RPMI 8226 cell line also expresses TLR7, as previously reported for normal human B cells.","The RPMI cell line can be used in unmodified form or in a modified form. In one embodiment, the RPMI 8226 cell is transfected with a reporter construct. Preferably, the cell is stably transfected with the reporter construct. The reporter construct generally includes a promoter, a coding sequence and a polyadenylation signal. The coding sequence can include a reporter sequence selected from the group consisting of an enzyme (e.g., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), secreted alkaline phosphatase, etc.), a bioluminescence marker (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP, U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,084), etc.), a surface-expressed molecule (e.g., CD25), a secreted molecule (e.g., IL-8, IL-12 p40, TNF-\u03b1, etc.), and other detectable protein products known to those of skill in the art. Preferably, the coding sequence encodes a protein having a level or an activity that is quantifiable.","In certain embodiments, the functional TLR is artificially expressed (including over-expressed) by a cell, for example by introduction into the cell of an expression vector bearing a coding sequence for the functional TLR wherein the coding sequence is operably linked to a gene expression sequence. As used herein, a coding sequence and the gene expression sequence are said to be operably linked when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription and\/or translation of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the gene expression sequence. Two DNA sequences are said to be operably linked if induction of a promoter in the 5\u2032 gene expression sequence results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequence, or (3) interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a gene expression sequence would be operably linked to a coding sequence if the gene expression sequence were capable of effecting transcription of that coding sequence such that the resulting transcript is translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.","In some embodiments, a coding sequence refers to a nucleic acid sequence coding for a functional TLR. In some embodiments, a coding sequence refers to a nucleic acid sequence coding for a reporter.","A cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR can be a cell that does not express the functional TLR but for the TLR expression vector. For example, human 293 fibroblasts (ATCC CRL-1573) do not express TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, or TLR9. As described in the examples below, such cells can be transiently or stably transfected with suitable expression vector (or vectors) so as to yield cells that do express TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, or any combination thereof. Alternatively, a cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR can be a cell that expresses the functional TLR at a significantly higher level with the TLR expression vector than it does without the TLR expression vector.","For use in the methods of the instant invention, a cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR is preferably a stably transfected cell that expresses the functional TLR. Such a cell can also be stably transfected with a suitable reporter construct.","Assays for Effectiveness","The methods of the invention can be assessed using any of a number of possible readout systems based upon a TLR\/IL-1R signal transduction pathway. In some embodiments, the readout for the method is based on the use of native genes or, alternatively, transfected or otherwise artificially introduced reporter gene constructs which are responsive to the TLR\/IL-1R signal transduction pathway involving MyD88, TRAF, p38, and\/or ERK. H\u00e4cker H et al. (1999) 18:6973-82. These pathways activate kinases including \u03baB kinase complex and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. Thus reporter genes and reporter gene constructs particularly useful for the assays include, e.g., a reporter gene operably linked to a promoter sensitive to NF-\u03baB. Examples of such promoters include, without limitation, those for NF-\u03baB, IL-113, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IP-10, CD80, CD86, and TNF-\u03b1. The reporter gene operably linked to the TLR-sensitive promoter can include, without limitation, an enzyme (e.g., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, \u03b2-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), etc.), a bioluminescence marker (e.g., green-fluorescent protein (GFP, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,084), blue fluorescent protein (BFP, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,486,382), etc.), a surface-expressed molecule (e.g., CD25, CD80, CD86), and\/or a secreted molecule (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, TNF-\u03b1). In certain embodiments the reporter is selected from IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB-luciferase (NF-\u03baB-luc; H\u00e4cker H et al. (1999) 18:6973-82), IL-12 p40-luc (Murphy T L et al. (1995) 15:5258-67), and TNF-luc (H\u00e4cker H et al. (1999) 18:6973-82). In assays relying on enzyme activity readout, substrate can be supplied as part of the assay, and detection can involve measurement of chemiluminescence, fluorescence, color development, incorporation of radioactive label, drug resistance, or other marker of enzyme activity. For assays relying on surface expression of a molecule, detection can be accomplished using flow cytometry (e.g., FACS) analysis or functional assays. Secreted molecules can be assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or bioassays. Many of these and other suitable readout systems are well known in the art and are commercially available.","Reporter Constructs","A cell expressing a functional TLR and useful for the methods of the invention has, in some embodiments, an expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling. The expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling can include a reporter gene under control of a promoter response element (enhancer element). In some embodiments, the promoter response element is associated with a minimal promoter responsive to a transcription factor believed by the applicant to be activated as a consequence of TLR signaling. Examples of such minimal promoters include, without limitation, promoters for the following genes: AP-1, NF-\u03baB, ATF2, IRF3, and IRF7. These minimal promoters contain corresponding promoter response elements sensitive to AP-1, NF-\u03baB, ATF2, IRF3, and IRF7, respectively. In other embodiments the expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling can include a gene under control of a promoter response element selected from response elements sensitive to IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40 subunit, a type I IFN, RANTES, TNF, IP-10, I-TAC, and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). The promoter response element generally will be present in multiple copies, e.g., as tandem repeats. For example, in one reporter construct, coding sequence for luciferase is under control of an upstream 6\u00d7 tandem repeat of NF-\u03baB response element. In some embodiments, an ISRE-luciferase reporter construct useful in the invention is available from Stratagene (catalog no. 219092) and includes a 5\u00d7 ISRE tandem repeat joined to a TATA box upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. As described herein, the reporter itself can be any gene product suitable for detection by methods recognized in the art. Such methods for detection can include, for example, measurement of spontaneous or stimulated light emission, enzyme activity, expression of a soluble molecule, expression of a cell surface molecule, etc.","Readouts typically involve usual elements of Toll\/IL-1R signaling, e.g., MyD88, TRAF, and IRAK molecules, although in the case of TLR3 the role of MyD88 is less clear than for other TLR family members. As described herein, such responses include the induction of a gene under control of a specific promoter such as a NF-\u03baB promoter, increases in particular cytokine levels, increases in particular chemokine levels, etc. The gene under the control of the NF-\u03baB promoter can be a gene which naturally includes an NF-\u03baB promoter or it can be a gene in a construct in which an NF-\u03baB promoter has been inserted. Genes and constructs which include the NF-\u03baB promoter include but are not limited to IL-8, IL-12 p40, NF-\u03baB-luc, IL-12 p40-luc, and TNF-luc.","Increases in cytokine levels can result from increased production, increased stability, increased secretion, or any combination of the forgoing, of the cytokine in response to the TLR-mediated signaling. Cytokines generally include, without limitation, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF. Th1 cytokines include but are not limited to IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12. Th2 cytokines include but are not limited to IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10.","Increases in chemokine levels can result from increased production, increased stability, increased secretion, or any combination of the forgoing, of the chemokine in response to the TLR-mediated signaling. Chemokines of particular significance in the invention include but are not limited to CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL9 (Mig), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC), IL-8, and MCP-1.","Abbreviations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0672","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0037","list-style":"none"},"li":["ACN Acetonitrile","EA Ethyl acetate","DMF Dimethyl formamide","PE Petroleum ether","DCM Dichloromethane","THF Tetrahydrofuran","HOBT 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole","EDCI 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide","HBTU 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate","HATU N-[(dimethylamino)(3H-1,2,3-triazolelo(4,4-b)pyridin-3-yloxy)methylene]-N-methylmethaneaminium hexafluorophosphate","PyBOP 1H-Benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphoniumhexafluorophosphate","BOPCl Bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride","BOP Benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(diethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophospahte","TEA Triethylamine","DIPEA Diisopropylethylamine","DMAP 4-Dimethylaminopyridine","PCC Pyridinium chlorochromate","PDC Pyridinium dichromate","NBS N-bromosuccinimide","NCS N-chlorosuccinimide","NIS N-iodosuccinimide","9-BBN 9-Borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane","TsOH p-Toluenesulfonic acid","TFA Trifluoroacetamide","CDI Carbonyldiimidazole\n\nMethods of Preparation\n"]}},"Following are general synthetic schemes for manufacturing compounds of the present invention.

This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. One strategy for depot injections includes the use of polyethylene oxide-polybutylene oxide copolymers wherein the vehicle is fluid at room temperature and solidifies at body temperature.","Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsuled matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled.

The SEAP reporter gene is placed under the control of the IFN-b minimal promoter fused to five NF-kB and AP-1 binding sites. Stimulation with a TLR9 ligand activates NF-kB and AP-1 which induces the production of SEAP.
