{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES"],"p":["This application is a continuation U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/394,146, filed Feb. 27, 2009 and claims the benefit of U.S. Application 61\/031,831, filed on Feb. 27, 2008, the entirety of each application is incorporated by reference herein.","The government may have certain rights in this invention. This work was supported by a grant from the Division of Chemical Sciences, Office of Basic Energy Research, U.S. Department of Energy (DE-FGO2-02ER15299). Additional support was provided by MRSEC (DMR-00-79909) and NSEC (DMR-0425780) Programs of the National Science Foundation.","The present invention relates to the field of polymer chemistry. The present invention also relates to the field of polymer synthesis.","Ethyne-bridged conjugated polymers impact a wide-range of technologies. The efficacy of these species derives not only from their established semiconducting and optical properties but also from the facts that these rigid, rod-like structures are readily processable and manifest high photo and thermal stabilities.","Poly(p-phenyleneethynylene)s (PPEs) define the archetypal examples of ethyne-bridged conjugated polymers. These species have been utilized in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) field-effect transistors (FETs), molecular electronics, nonlinear optical materials, solar energy conversion devices,and in a variety of sensory applications. Considerable effort has been directed toward the development of synthetic protocols for repeating arene-ethyne structural motifs.","The palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira reaction and acyclic diyne metathesis (ADIMET) are two approaches to PPEs. While the Sonogashira reaction is compatible with polar functional groups and water, it requires both dihaloarene and diethynylarene synthons, and is accordingly susceptible to the introduction of butadiyne defects in the PPE polymer, which defects are estimated to range from 1 to 10% even under the carefully controlled reaction conditions.","An ADIMET-based synthesis may circumvent butadiyne defect sites, but this method is generally incompatible with sensitive functional groups that include water-soluble side chains; furthermore, the syntheses of carbyne precursors for ADIMET protocols require inert reaction conditions and cannot be implemented in the presence of water.","Despite the fact that water-soluble PPEs have attracted increasing interest in biosensing and bioconjugation applications, relatively few such materials have been reported.","Accordingly, there is a need for an environmentally benign synthetic approach for PPE synthesis, separation, and purification in neat water under an aerobic atmosphere.","In meeting the challenges set forth, the disclosed invention first provides oligomers or polymers, comprising a plurality of aryleneethynylene units composed of arylene units covalently bonded to ethynylene units, each of the arylene units comprising at least one water solubilizing group. The disclosed invention also provides oligomers or polymers comprising a plurality of [aromatic heterocycle]ethynylene units composed of aromatic heterocycle units covalently bonded to ethynylene units, wherein each the aromatic heterocycle units comprises at least one water solubilizing functional group.","The present invention further discloses oligomers or polymers, comprising a plurality of [conjugated macrocycle]ethynylene units composed of a conjugated macrocycle group covalently bonded to an ethynylene group, and each of the conjugated macrocycle groups comprising at least one water solubilizing functional group.","The present invention also discloses the compounds poly[p-{2,5-bis(3-propoxysulfonicacidsodiumsalt)}phenylene]ethynylene, oligo[p-{2,5-bis(3-propoxysulfonicacidsodiumsalt)}phenylene]ethynylene, poly[2,6-{1,5-bis(3-propoxysulfonicacidsodiumsalt)}napthalene]ethynylene, and oligo[2,6-{1,5-bis(3-propoxysulfonicacidsodiumsalt)}napthalene]ethynylene.","Also provided are compounds having the formula (OR)B\u2014CC\u2014B(OR), and (OR)3B\u2014CC\u2014B(OR), FB\u2014CC\u2014BF, (OR)B\u2014CC\u2014CC\u2014B(OR), (OR)B\u2014CC\u2014CC\u2014B(OR), FB\u2014CC\u2014CC\u2014BF, and combinations thereof.","Further provided are methods for synthesizing an oligomer or a polymer, comprising contacting a bisborylated alkyne and an arene bis([water-solubilizing group]) salt, the contacting being performed in an aqueous environment.","Also disclosed are methods for synthesizing an alkyne synthon, comprising contacting an ethyne dianion with an alkoxydioxaborolane to give rise to a boro-alkyne; and contacting the boro-alkyne with an acid.","The general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. Other aspects of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the detailed description of the invention as provided herein.","The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying figures and examples, which form a part of this disclosure. It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific devices, methods, applications, conditions or parameters described and\/or shown herein, and that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting of the claimed invention.

All manipulations were carried out under nitrogen prepurified by passage through an Oscrubbing tower (Schweizerhall R3-11 catalyst) and a drying tower (Linde 3-\u212b molecular sieves) unless otherwise noted. Standard Schlenk techniques were employed to manipulate air sensitive solutions. All solvents utilized in this work were obtained from Fisher Scientific (HPLC grade). The catalyst, Pd(OAc), were obtained from Aldrich, tri(4,6-dimethyl-3-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine trisodium (TXPTS) were obtained from Strem. Sodium hydroxide was obtained from Fisher Scientific. 1,5-hydroxynapthanol was obtained from Aldrich and used as precursor for 2,6-Diiodo-1,5-hydroxynapthanol from which {[2,6-diiodo-1,5-bis(3-propoxy-sulfonic acid)napthalene]sodium salt} was synthesized reacting with 1,3-Propane Sultone (from Aldrich) according to the procedure published in the literature.

Chromatographic purification (Bio-Gel) P-4 Gel 90-180 mm, Bio-Rad Laboratories) of polymer compounds was performed on the bench top.","Instrumentation. Electronic spectra were recorded on an OLIS UV\/vis\/NIR spectrophotometry system that is based on the optics of a Cary 14 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog luminescence spectrophotometer that utilized a T-channel configuration with a red sensitive R2658 Hamamatsu PMT detector: these spectra were corrected for variations in photomultiplier response over wavelength using correction curves generated from the spectral output of a calibrated light source supplied by the National Bureau of Standards. All spectroscopic measurements were carried out at 23\u00b11\u00b0 C. The fluorescence quantum yield was determined using quinine sulfate (F=0.546 in 1.0 N HSO, OD=0.015) as a standard.All solutions were purged with Argon prior to measurements. Solutions of OD(l) \u02dc1.0 (76 mg\/L) and OD(l) \u02dc0.015 were used for UV-visible absorption and fluorescence measurements, respectively. NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz AC-Bruker spectrometer. Chemical shifts for H NMR spectra are relative to residual protium in the deuterated solvents (DO=4.75 ppm, DMSO-d=2.54 ppm). The molecular weights of polymers were determined by anion exchange chromatography using a Varian Prostar HPLC system equipped with an anion exchange column (NS1500; 75\u00d77.6 mm; Biochrom Labs) and a Varian UV-Vis detector. Polymeric materials were eluted with a salt gradient (0 to 1 M NaSCN in 60 min dissolved in 20 mM MES buffer) in 10% DMF-HO mixture at a flow rate of 2.0 mL\/min. Molecular weights are reported relative to poly[4-(3-propoxysulfonicacidsodiumsalt)styrene] (PSPS) standard(Mn=17,596\u224866 units). Microwave assisted reactions were performed with Emrys Personal Chemistry System (Biotage).","Synthesis","General Procedure of PNES Synthesis Under Inert Atmosphere (Scheme 3):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00048","num":"00048"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00048","he":"189.15mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08288497-20121016-C00048.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A 5 mL microwave vial (Biotage) was charged with {[2,5-diiodo-1,4-bis(3-propoxy-sulfonic acid)napthalene]sodium salt}, 1,2-bis(4\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032,5\u2032-tetramethyl[1\u2032,3\u2032,2\u2032]dioxaborolan-2\u2032-yl)ethyne, Pd(OAc), tri(4,6-dimethyl-3-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine trisodium (TXPTS),and a magnetic stir bar. After sealing with a vial cap, this vessel was subject to vacuum and charged with argon. The vacuuming\/charging cycle was repeated 3 times. An aqueous 1 M NaOH solution, previously degassed with argon for 1 h, was added via syringe. The vessel was placed into the microwave cavity. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 min and then microwave irradiated at 30 W. The temperature was ramped from room temperature to the set point. Once the set temperature was reached, the reaction mixture was held at that temperature for a designated time period. After the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, the reaction vessel was opened. The resulting solution was viscous, greenish brown in color and exhibited an intense yellowish green fluorescence when illuminated with a 365 nm UV lamp. This solution was diluted with deionized water and then filtered through a glass frit and filter paper, successively. The filtrate was concentrated to about 3 mL, and loaded on the top of the size exclusion column (2\u00d750 cm) packed with Bio-Gel\u00ae P-4 Gel (90-180 mm, Bio-Rad Laboratories), and eluted with deionized water without any additional buffer, providing clean separation of a yellowish green product band. Following evaporation of the solvent, a glossy film was obtained. The molecular weight of PNES was determined to be \u02dc6.6-25 kD by anion exchange chromatogram, which corresponds to a degree of polymerization (DP) of 18\u02dc47.","Sample Batch 1: {[2,5-Diiodo-1,4-bis(3-propoxy-sulfonic acid)napthalene]sodium salt}=66 mg (94.3 mmol; 78.5 mM concentration), 1,2-bis(4\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032,5\u2032-tetramethyl[1\u2032,3\u2032,2\u2032]dioxaborolan-2\u2032-yl)ethyne=33.4 mg (120 mmol), Pd(OAc)=6.4 mg (28.6 mmole; 30 mole % relative to monomer), tri(4,6-dimethyl-3-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine trisodium (TXPTS)=66 mg (101 mmole), 1 M NaOH solution=1.2 mL, Reaction temperature=208\u00b0 C., Reaction time=30 min Isolated yield=38 mg (88% based on 94.3 mmol {[2,5-diiodo-1,4-bis(3-propoxy-sulfonic acid)napthalene]sodium salt}.
