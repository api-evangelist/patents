The entire content of the foregoing are herby incorporated herein by reference.","This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Ser. No. 61\/515,165, filed Aug. 4, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to compounds which inhibit serine\/threonine kinases and which are useful for treating hyperproliferative and neoplastic diseases by inhibiting signal transduction pathways which commonly are overactive or overexpressed in cancerous tissue. The present compounds are selective inhibitors of ERK (extracellular-signal regulated kinase). The present invention further relates to methods for treating cancer or hyperproliferative diseases with compounds within the scope of the present invention.","The processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways that are activated in cancer cells. The ERK pathway plays a central role in regulating mammalian cell growth by relaying extracellular signals from ligand-bound cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK's) such as ErbB family, PDGF, FGF, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Activation of an RTK induces a cascade of phosphorylation events that begins with activation of Ras. Activation of Ras leads to the recruitment and activation of Raf, a serine-threonine kinase. Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEK1\/2, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1\/2. When activated, ERK1\/2 phosphorylates several downstream targets involved in a multitude of cellular events including cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activation. The ERK\/MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation, and it is believed that the ERK\/MAPK pathway is frequently activated in many tumors. Ras genes, which are upstream of ERK1\/2, are mutated in several cancers including colorectal, melanoma, breast and pancreatic tumors. The high Ras activity is accompanied by elevated ERK activity in many human tumors. In addition, mutations of BRAF, a serine-threonine kinase of the Raf family, are associated with increased kinase activity. Mutations in BRAF have been identified in melanomas (60%), thyroid cancers (greater than 40%) and colorectal cancers. These observations indicate that the ERK1\/2 signaling pathway is an attractive pathway for anticancer therapies in a broad spectrum of human tumors. (M. Holum and J. Pouyssegur, 2003 5:219).","The ERK pathway has also been cited as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pain and inflammation (Ma, Weiya and Remi Quirion. \u201cThe ERK\/MAPK pathway, as a target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.\u201d 9(4) (2005): pp. 699-713, and Sommer, Claudia and Frank Birklein. \u201cResolvins and inflammatory pain.\u201d 1000 3:19 (2011)).","Therefore, small-molecular inhibitors of ERK activity (i.e., ERK1 and\/or ERK2 activity) would be useful for treating a broad spectrum of cancers, such as, for example, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Such a contribution is provided by this invention.","There is a continuing need for new and novel therapeutic agents which can be used for cancer and hyperproliferative conditions. The Raf\/MEK\/ERK pathway is an important signaling pathway which is frequently overexpressed and\/or overactive in many cancerous tissues. Design and development of new pharmaceutical compounds is essential.

That is, the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases \u201chaving at least\u201d or \u201cincluding at least\u201d. When used in the context of a process, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the process includes at least the recited steps, but may include additional steps. When used in the context of a compound or composition, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the compound or composition includes at least the recited features or components, but may also include additional features or components.","The term \u201cindependently\u201d is used herein to indicate that a variable is applied in any one instance without regard to the presence or absence of a variable having that same or a different definition within the same compound. Thus, in a compound in which R\u2033 appears twice and is defined as \u201cindependently carbon or nitrogen\u201d, both R\u2033s can be carbon, both R\u2033s can be nitrogen, or one R\u2033 can be carbon and the other nitrogen.","When any variable (e.g., R, R, Ar, Xor Het) occurs more than one time in any moiety or formula depicting and describing compounds employed or claimed in the present invention, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.

For example, \u201coptionally substituted\u201d means that the optionally substituted moiety may incorporate a hydrogen or a substituent.","The term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to mean approximately, in the region of, roughly, or around. When the term \u201cabout\u201d is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies that range by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In general, the term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 20%.","As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus, for a variable which is inherently discrete, the variable can be equal to any integer value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a variable which is inherently continuous, the variable can be equal to any real value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As an example, a variable which is described as having values between 0 and 2, can be 0, 1 or 2 for variables which are inherently discrete, and can be 0.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or any other real value for variables which are inherently continuous.","Compounds of formula I exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equilibrium and attempts to isolate an individual tautomers usually produce a mixture whose chemical and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates; while in phenols, the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto\/enol (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014OH)\u2550CH\u2014), amide\/imidic acid (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014OH)\u2550N\u2014) and amidine (\u2014C(\u2550NR)\u2014NH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014NHR)\u2550N\u2014) tautomers. The latter two are particularly common in heteroaryl and heterocyclic rings and the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds.","It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that some of the compounds of formula I may contain one or more chiral centers and therefore exist in two or more stereoisomeric forms. The racemates of these isomers, the individual isomers and mixtures enriched in one enantiomer, as well as diastereomers when there are two chiral centers, and mixtures partially enriched with specific diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention. The present invention includes all the individual stereoisomers (e.g., enantiomers), racemic mixtures or partially resolved mixtures of the compounds of formula I and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms thereof.","The compounds of formula I may contain a basic center and suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples of salts of inorganic acids include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, phosphate, and hydrogen phosphate.

of the present invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below. The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. Generally applicable synthetic procedures have been described in treatises are set forth in references such as ; Wiley & Sons: New York, Volumes 1-21; R. C. LaRock, , 2nd edition Wiley-VCH, New York 1999, B. Trost and I. Fleming (Eds.) vol. 1-9 Pergamon, Oxford, 1991, A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees (Eds) Pergamon, Oxford 1984, vol. 1-9, A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees (Eds) Pergamon, Oxford 1996, vol. 1-11; and , Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.","The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: chiral, reverse-phase and normal phases; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.","Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about \u221278\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C., more preferably from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 125\u00b0 C., and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20\u00b0 C.","In the methods of preparing the compounds of this invention, it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., 1975 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions (see, e.g., , Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York 1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid, can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. Eliel and S. Wilen, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate, in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. 1982 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d 1989 W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, 1990 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Racemic mixtures can be separated by supercritical fluid chromatography using a Mettler Toledo MG II chromatograph using a 5 \u03bcm AS-H SFC 21.2\u00d7250 mm column or AD-H SFC column using MeOH or IPA containing 0.1% TFA as a cosolvent. Typical conditions include a flow rate of 50 mL\/min, a column temperature of 40\u00b0 C. Run time was typically 5 to 10 min.","Some compounds in the following schemes are depicted with generalized substituents; however, one skilled in the art will immediately appreciate that the nature of the R groups can be varied to afford the various compounds contemplated in this invention. Moreover, the reaction conditions are exemplary and alternative conditions are well known.

This aminoquinazoline is then converted to the 2-bromo-quinazoline B-2b with antimony tribromide and tert-butyl nitrite in CBr. Displacement of the bromide of B-2b with tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-amine afforded B-2c. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the reaction can be carried out with the requisite amines to afford other quinazolines within the scope of the invention. The 7-carboxy substituent is introduced via a palladium-catalyzed carboxylation using potassium 2-ethoxy-2-oxoacetate as the source of the carboxyl group to afford the quinazoline ester B-3a. Subsequent hydrolysis of the ester with hydroxide affords the carboxylic acid B-3b which can be further converted to amides using standard coupling protocols. Alternatively, 4-bromo-2,6-difluorobenzaldehyde is cyclized with guanidine bis(carbonate) to afford B-5 which can then be subject to similar functional group transformations albeit in a different sequence. Carbonylation to introduce the methoxy carbonyl (step 7) precedes introduction of the cyclopropylmethylamine (steps 8 and 9). Hydrolysis of the ester affords the substituted quinazoline analogous to B-3b.","The amine A-4 may be prepared as described in SCHEME C, where aryl-heteroaryl amines (C-3) may be prepared by steps 1 through 2, and aryl-heterocyclyl amines (C-6) may be prepared by steps 3 through 7. The requisite aryl-heteroaryl amines A-4 (C-3, R=pyrazolyl, triazolyl oxadiazolyl, oxazolyl or isoxazolyl), which are optionally chiral, can be prepared using the general method depicted in steps 1 and 2 of SCHEME C. Addition of an aryl Grignard or aryl lithium reagent to the N-tert-butylsulfinyl imines (C-2) afforded amines (A-4\/C-3) after hydrolysis of the intermediate sulfinamides. Chiral amines are prepared by addition of an aryl Grignard or lithium to a chiral sulfinamide. (D. A. Cogan et al., 1999 55:8883-8904).

Hughes, The Mitsunobu Reaction, in Organic Reactions, Volume 42, 1992, John Wiley & Sons, New York; pp. 335-656) comprise activating alcohols with a mixture of a phosphine, such as a trialkylphosphine like tributylphosphine ((n-Bu)P), triphenylphosphine (PhP) and the like and a diazo-compound like DEAD, DIAD or di-tert-butyl-azodicarboxylate in an inert solvent. Commonly used solvents include, but are not limited to, THF, toluene and DCM. There is no particular limitation on the nature of the solvent to be employed, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or the reagents involved and that it can dissolve the reagents, at least to some extent. The reaction can take place over a wide range of temperatures ranging from ambient temperatures to the reflux temperature of the solvent employed","Condensation of the quinazolines A-2b or B-3b and the amine A-4 was carried out with activated esters using known protocols. Activated carboxylic acids include acid chlorides or symmetrical or mixed acid anhydrides which react with amines in a solvent such as DMF, DCM, THF, with or without water as a co-solvent at temperatures between 0\u00b0 C. and 60\u00b0 C. generally in the presence of a base, such as NaCO, NaHCO, KCO, DIPEA, TEA or pyridine. Carboxylic acids are converted into their acid chlorides using standard reagents well known to someone skilled in the art, such as thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, phosphoryl chloride and the like. Those reagents can be used in presence of bases, such as DIPEA, TEA or pyridine.","Alternatively a carboxylic acid can be converted in situ into activated acids by treating the carboxylic acid with EDC, DCC, BOP, PyBrOP, or 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium p-toluenesulphonate (Mukaiyama's reagent) and the like, optionally in the presence of modifiers such as HOBt, with or without a base, such as NMM, TEA or DIPEA, in an inert solvent, such as DMF or DCM, at temperatures between 0\u00b0 C. and 60\u00b0 C.

Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability, i.e., proliferation (IC), cytotoxicity (EC).","The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments containing the compounds of the invention and at least one therapeutically inert carrier, diluent or excipient, as well as methods of using the compounds of the invention to prepare such compositions and medicaments. In one example, compounds of Formula I with the desired degree of purity may be formulated by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a dosage form at ambient temperature and at the appropriate pH. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but typically ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example, a compound of Formula I is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In another embodiment, the compounds of Formula I are sterile. The compound may be stored, for example, as a solid or amorphous composition, as a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","Compositions are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the severity of the disorder, the particular patient being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ceffective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to inhibit ERK activity. Typically such amount may be below the amount that is toxic to normal cells, or the patient as a whole.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well-known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","A dose to treat human patients may range from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg of a compound of formula I. A typical dose may be about 1 mg to about 300 mg of the compound. A dose may be administered once a day (QD), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.","The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means, including oral, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intradermal, intrathecal, epidural and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier or excipient. Suitable carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in, e.g., Ansel, H. C., et al., Ansel's . Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2004; Gennaro, Alfonso R., et al. . Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and Rowe, R. C., , Chicago, Pharmaceutical Press, 2005. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.","An example of a suitable oral dosage form is a tablet containing about 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90-30 mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40 mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about 1-10 mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment.","In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition also includes at least one additional anti-proliferative agent.","An embodiment, therefore, includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. A further embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of formula I may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of formula I is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound that has anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of formula I such that they do not adversely affect each other. The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above co-administered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of formula I and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing materials useful for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described above is provided. In one embodiment, the kit comprises a container comprising a compound of formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The kit may further comprise a label or package insert on or associated with the container.

Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container may hold a compound of formula I or a formulation thereof which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a compound of formula I. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutical diluent, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution.
