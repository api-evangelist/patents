{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION","EXAMPLES"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/492,053 titled \u201cSurface Segregating Additives for Enhanced Chemical Agent Resistant Topcoats\u201d filed on Jun. 1, 2011 listing Dr. Joshua A. Orlicki as a sole inventor, the entire contents, including all attachments and appendices of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States government.","The present invention relates to a modifier for either a water-dispersible or solvent-borne topcoat for a chemical agent resistant coating, and in particular to a two-component polymer topcoat having an additive comprised of a polyfunctional scaffold with a buoy group coupled to the polyfunctional scaffold.","Military vehicles and support equipment are known to use or employ chemical agent resistant coatings (CARC) to minimize absorption of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in the event of battlefield exposure. Presently, current technology provides passive protection, but there is no inherent self-decontaminating capability. Therefore, a chemical agent resistant coating that has the ability to at least partially self-clean, and thereby reduce a logistical footprint associated with decontamination operations, would be desirable.","A modifier for either a water-dispersible or solvent-borne topcoat for a chemical agent resistant coating (CARC) is provided. The topcoat can include either one-component or a two-component polymer paint or coating incorporating an additive having a polyfunctional scaffold in the form of a hyperbranched polymer (HBP) and a buoy group coupled to the polyfunctional scaffold. The HBP can be an ABtype condensation system that has points of functionalization at B groups of the ABtype condensation system. In addition, the HBP can have a poyethyleneimine backbone, a polyester backbone and the like. Hyperbranched materials prepared by radical mechanisms may also be suitable for use in this invention, although fractional coupling of functional moieties to the end groups of these polymers may be more challenging to control.","The buoy group can contain fluorinated chain ends, siloxane chain ends (e.g. oligo-polydimethylsiloxane-based chain ends), fluorinated and aliphatic chain ends and\/or wholly aliphatic chain ends. In some instances, a fluorinated chain end can be the ester or amide of a poly-fluorinated species such as perfluorooctanoic acid (HOCOCF, PFOA) or a longer-chain acid; and an aliphatic chain end can be the ester or amide of lauric acid (HOCOCH), palmitic acid (HOCOCH), stearic acid (HOCOCH) or behenic acid (HOCOCH). However, it is appreciated that any chain end of sufficiently low surface energy (n) relative to its deposition solvent and matrix can serve as a buoy group.","The additive for the water-dispersible or solvent-borne topcoat can also include a \u201cdelivered\u201d group that is coupled to the HBP, which provides a functional aspect of the additive to the system. The delivered group can contain at least one of an ionic species, a fluorescent tag, a bioreactive site, a catalyst and the like. For example and for illustrative purposes only, the delivered group can be a catalyst in the form of a gold containing nanoparticle for sensing applications, a silver containing nanoparticle for antimicrobial applications, a titania containing nanoparticle for light-activated self-cleaning applications, and the like. However, it is appreciated by those skilled in the art that a wide variety of nanoparticles would be suitable for attachment to the HBP-based additive.","In addition to the above, fluorescent tags such as pyrene butyric acid and similar compounds that are useful in the development of fluorescence quenching assays can be a delivered group, as can larger aromatics such as the class of phthalocyanines or fluoresceins. It is also appreciated by those skilled in the art that functionalization of the HBP core is useful for fluorescent molecules to both control their distribution in the bulk matrix and also control their local concentration. For example, high loading on the HBP core can induce excimer formation and other coupled fluorescence effects, while low loading can reduce the occurrence of inter-molecular interaction.","Suitable ionic groups for delivery can include quaternary ammonium salts known to those skilled in the art, especially those suitable for antimicrobial applications, or in the alternative, groups like N-oximes, zwitterionic species and the like. With respect to repellant or self-cleaning additives, a buoy group can also serve as an \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cdelivered\u201d group. For example, an HBP functionalized with both lauric and behenic acid esters can be largely solubilized by lauric ester chain ends, while both chain ends can provide a driving force to maximize additive concentration at the air interface of the matrix. In addition, long chain behenic esters can dominate properties at a surface of the topcoat while long aliphatic chains crystallize and reduce susceptibility to wetting by environmental contaminants.","The additive to the water-dispersible topcoat can also include an anchor group coupled to the HBP core. The anchor group provides a means to permanently fix the additive in the matrix upon curing or drying. However, it is appreciated that the kinetics of this reaction must be controlled to allow for migration to an air interface. For example and for illustrative purposes only, the anchor group can be an epoxy, a (meth)acrylate, an isocyanate and the like; in a polyurethane system such as a CARC, the anchor can be a residual unreacted alcohol or amine that is native to the polyester or polyethyleneimine HBP core, respectively.","To improve dispersion in the water-dispersible topcoat, the HBP additive can also be suspended or dissolved in a compatible solvent, for example the solvent can be 2-butanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, various alcohols and the like.","In some instances, the HBP coupled with the buoy group, delivered group and\/or anchor group can afford increased hydrophobicity and\/or oleophobicity to the surface of the topcoat, depending on the identity of the buoy and delivered groups. In addition, the use of similar HBPs can provide different levels of hydrophobicity depending on their core molecular weight. For example, a first HBP having a relatively high core molecular weight can provide increased hydrophobicity compared to a second HBP that has a core with a relatively low molecular weight relative to the first HBP.","The present invention also provides a method for reducing the spread of a chemical agent, for example blister chemical agent 2,2\u2032-dichlorodiethyl sulfide also known sulfur mustard or nerve agent O-ethyl S-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methylphosphonothiloate also known as VX nerve agent, on a polyurethane containing surface on an object, wherein the method comprises including an additive in a polyurethane containing formulation, the additive comprising a functionalized hyperbranched polymer (HBP) having a polyfunctional scaffold in the form of a hyperbranched polymer (HBP); and a buoy group coupled to said polyfunctional scaffold, said buoy group containing at least one aliphatic chain end and a fluorinated chain end; and applying the polyurethane containing formulation to a surface of an object. In certain embodiments, the HBP is a radically-grown HBP and said HBP has at least one of a poyethyleneimine backbone and a polyester backbone. In certain desirable embodiments, the fluorinated chain end is perfluorooctanoic acid and said aliphatic chain end is selected from a group consisting of an ester or amide of COCH, COCH, COCH, and COCH. The additive may further comprise a delivered group coupled to said HBP, said delivered group selected from a group consisting of an ionic species, a fluorescent tag, a bioreactive site and a catalyst. The additive may further comprise an anchor group coupled to said HBP, said anchor group selected from a group consisting of an epoxy, a (meth)acrylate, an isocyanate, a residual unreacted alcohol native to said HBP and a residual unreacted amine native to said HBP.","A water-dispersible or solvent-borne topcoat that is at least partially self-cleaning with respect to chemical warfare agents is provided. As such, the water-dispersible or solvent-borne topcoat disclosed herein has use as a topcoat for a military vehicle as well as a protective coating for maritime and architectural applications, for textiles in general and soldier clothing in particular, and surfaces of miscellaneous tactical assets.","The topcoat can include an additive that has a polyfunctional scaffold in the form of a hyperbranched polymer (HBP) with a buoy group coupled to the HBP. In some instances, the HBP can also have a \u201cdelivered\u201d group, an anchor group and\/or a solubilizing group coupled thereto as illustratively shown in .","The HBP can be an ABtype condensation system with B groups of the ABtype condensation system providing functionalization points for the HBP. For example and for illustrative purposes only, the HBP can be or have a poyethyleneimine backbone, a polyester backbone and the like.","The performance of the HBP can be influenced by the core molecular weight of the HBP. As one example, two of the Boltorn line of hyperbranched polyesters produced by Perstorp, which has a range of grades from the H20 (1750 g\/mol nominal weight) to the H50 (ca. 10 kg\/mol nominal weight) were partially funcationalized (ca. 20% PFOA-ester, 20% lauric ester) and blended into a thermoplastic polyurethane film. The H20-based material exhibited a lower contact angle with water (\u02dc59\u00b0) while the H50-based material exhibited a higher contact angle with water (\u02dc90\u00b0). In addition, the surface composition of these materials determined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was very similar, and as such the key determinant to the surface behavior was concluded to be the molecular weight of the HBP core.","The additive can be used to provide a desired property to the surface of the topcoat, for example an increase in hydrophobicity. In addition, the behavior of the additive can be controlled by the selected buoy group, which can be a fluorinated chain end, and aliphatic chain end and\/or a combination of the two. For example and for illustrative purposes only, a fluorinated chain end that serves as a buoy group that is coupled to the HBP can be the ester or amide of perfluorooctanoic acid (HOCOCF). In addition, an aliphatic chain end could be coupled via an ester or amide bond and be based on aliphatic acids such as of lauric (HOCOCH), palmitic (HOCOCH), stearic (HOCOCH), or behenic acids (HOCOCH).","In addition to the buoy group, the additive may be functionalized with a delivered group that can be used to couple an ionic species, a fluorescent tag, a bioreactive site and\/or a catalyst to the HBP. In this manner, the chemical reactivity of the water-dispersible topcoat can be tailored to react more or less with a particular component or components that may come into contact therewith.","Regarding an anchor group that is coupled to the HBP, the anchor group allows for covalent bonding to the topcoat matrix. Depending on the necessary chemistry, non-functionalized chain ends can directly react to the matrix, or may be used to install reactive moieties to the chain ends of the HBP, for example by coupling an epoxy, a (meth)acrylate and\/or an isocyanate to the HBP. The HBP can also have a solubilizing group coupled thereto in order to afford greater solubility of the HBP. The solubilizing group is typically chosen relative to the intended solvent, such a solubilizing group illustratively including the lauric acid ester or amide to impart solubility in non-polar solvents; the ester or amide of an oligo-ethylene glycol can be suitable to impart solubility in polar solvents such as water; amphiphilic solubilizing groups such as the ester or amide of the glycol ethoxylate lauryl ether can impart solubility in both polar and non-polar solvents.","It is appreciated that the HBP with the buoy group, delivered group, anchor group and\/or solubilizing group coupled thereto can afford for segregation of the HBP to an upper or outer surface of the topcoat formulation as illustratively shown in  and thereby result in a desired property of the surface to be obtained. In addition, and in order to provide an illustrative example of the invention and yet not limit the scope in any way, at least one example of such a formulation is provided below.","Table 1 provides a list of four water-dispersible topcoat compositions according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. The two soluble compositions (SA-1, SA-2) had an HBP with buoy groups of fluorinated chain ends and aliphatic chain ends coupled thereto while the two water-dispersible compositions (DA-1, DA-2) had an HBP with only aliphatic ester chain ends attached thereto.","The identifiers SA-1 and DA-1 correspond to an HBP prepared from the Boltorn H20 core whereas the identifiers SA-2 and DA-2 correspond to the same HBP chain end composition prepared from the Boltorn H50 core, and therefore having a higher core molecular weight. Both of the solvent-borne HBP samples (SA-1, SA-2) had a buoy group of perfluorooctanoic esters (PFOA) coupled thereto. In addition, each of the HBP samples had the aliphatic ester chain ends of \u2014OCOCH(C) coupled thereto. In contrast, both of the water-dispersible HBP samples (DA-1, DA-2) had the aliphatic ester chain ends of \u2014OCOCH(C) and \u2014OCOCH(C) attached thereto with no PFOA present. It should be appreciated that Table 1 provides the mole fraction (Mol) of chain ends that were coupled with the fluorinated buoy group and the aliphatic buoy groups. In addition, the chain end functionalization is a mole fraction based on the known repeat unit mass of the HBP core.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Identifier","Core MW","MolPFOA","MolC","MolC"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["SA-1","H20","0.206","0.707","0.00"]},{"entry":["SA-2","H50","0.203","0.730","0.00"]},{"entry":["DA-1","H20","0.00","0.441","0.446"]},{"entry":["DA-2","H50","0.00","0.458","0.450"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The expression of extent of end functionalization as a fraction of chain ends is suitable for ABtype polycondensates, where the number of available chain ends scales with the degree of polymerization, n. Neglecting the potential for cyclization during polymerization, the number of chain ends will scale with degree of polymerization such that the number of residual sites is n(x\u22121)+1; or in the case of an AB-type HBP, n(2-1)+1=n(1)+1, and the number of chain ends scales with degree of polymerization. As such, the number of B groups per chain was n+1 barring any cyclization events.","The polymers shown in Table 1 were dissolved (SA-1, SA-2) or dispersed (DA-1, DA-2) in 4-methyl-2-pentanone with a loading of approximately 1.5 grams of additive into 3 grams of solvent. This mixture was then combined with a two-component polyurethane formulation with moderate titania loading for pigmentation. The additives were disbursed through the two-component polyurethane formulation using high-shear mixing and then the solution was sprayed onto both glass panels and tin-coated steel. The samples were then allowed to dry and cure at room temperature for a minimum of seven days.","The surfaces of the sprayed panels and tin-coated steel were analyzed using contact angle analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The contact angle analysis provided a relative measure of hydrophobicity and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provided a measure of surface composition.","Table 2 provides results of the contact angle analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for a reference coating that contained no additives and the SA-1, SA-2, DA-1 and DA-2 coatings. As shown in Table 2, the composition of the surface of the SA-1 and SA-2 sprayed panels was substantially altered with respect to fluorine (F) and nitrogen (N), and the SA-1 sample showed an increase in silicon (Si). Furthermore, the average contact angle, as defined by the angle \u03b8 shown in , for a drop of water on the coatings shifted approximately 24 degrees with respect to the reference coating, thereby indicating an increase in net hydrophobicity. In contrast, the dispersible additives shifted the contact angle only slightly and the trend was towards a more hydrophilic nature. It should also be appreciated that the SA-2 and DA-2 samples, having the greater core molecular weight (H50), performed better than the corresponding two additives with the lower molecular weight (H20) core.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"XPS Atomic Concentration (%)","Contact"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Sample","C","F","N","O","Si","Angle (\u03b8)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Reference","72.46","0.00","5.92","20.24","1.38","62.73"]},{"entry":"Coating"},{"entry":["SA-1","68.93","1.18","0.92","19.85","9.12","87.26"]},{"entry":["SA-2","74.24","6.31","0.55","18.52","0.38","85.41"]},{"entry":["DA-1","69.86","0.00","5.45","19.96","4.73","56.64"]},{"entry":["DA-2","73.76","0.00","4.36","19.67","2.22","59.90"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Actual testing of coated panels against a blister chemical agent (HD, 2,2\u2032-dichlorodiethyl sulfide) and a nerve agent (VX, O-ethyl S-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methylphosphonothiolate) also showed improved performance of the solvent-borne and water-dispersible coatings compared to the reference coating with performance of the coatings measured as a function of the total area of spread or coverage of the HD agent or VX agent over a period of up to 24 hours.
