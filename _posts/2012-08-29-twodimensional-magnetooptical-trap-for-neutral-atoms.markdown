title: Two-dimensional magneto-optical trap for neutral atoms
abstract: A two-dimensional (2D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) for alkali neutral atoms establishes a zero magnetic field along the longitudinal symmetry axis. Two of three pairs of trapping laser beams do not follow the symmetry axes of the quadruple magnetic field and are aligned with a large non-zero degree angles to the longitudinal axis. In a dark-line 2D MOT configuration, there are two orthogonal repumping beams. In each repumping beam, an opaque line is imaged to the longitudinal axis, and the overlap of these two line images creates a dark line volume in the longitudinal axis where there is no repumping light. The zero magnetic field along the longitudinal axis allows the cold atoms maintain a long ground-state coherence time without switching off the MOT magnetic field, which makes it possible to operate the MOT at a high repetition rate and a high duty cycle.

The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field","The present disclosure relates to a neutral atom trapping device with high optical depth for quantum optics experiments.","2. Background","Since laser cooling and trapping was developed in 1980's [E. L. Raab, M. Prentiss, A. Cable, S. Chu, and D. E. Pritchard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 2631 (1987)] that led to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997, the magneto-optical trap (MOT) has been widely applied and implemented to provide cold atom sources for scientific researches in the field of atomic physics and quantum optics. Many cold atom devices have been invented for possible applications in atomic sensors and some of them have been commercialized [See ColdQuanta Inc; D. Z. Anderson and J. G. J. Reichel, US Patent 2005\/0199871; D. Z. Anderson et al, US Patent 2010\/0200739; M. Hyodo, U.S. Pat. No. 7,816,643 B2]. The most commonly used cold atom device is the three-dimensional (3D) MOT with a configuration of six trapping laser beams and a 3D quadrupole magnetic field where the cold atoms are trapped at the position of zero magnetic field spherically. In that configuration, there is only one point of zero magnetic field and the atoms experience magnetic gradients along every direction. Therefore, for experiments and applications which require long atomic coherence time, such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), atomic quantum memory, and single-photon generation, the magnetic field must be switched off before the experimental time window [A. Kuzmich, W. P. Bowen, A. D. Boozer, A. Boca, C. W. Chou, L.-M. Duan, and H. J. Kimble, Nature 423, 731 (2003).]. This significantly adds complicity in the controlling system and prevents the experimental data collected from a high repetition rate because it always takes time to switch off the current in a magnetic coil due to the inductance. The quantum optics and photon counting experiments based on the 3D MOT are typically time consuming.","One approach changes a 3D quadrupole magnetic field to a 2D quadrupole magnetic field with a line of zero magnetic fields. This is called a 2D MOT where the cold atoms are trapped in the zero magnetic field line along the longitudinal symmetry axis. There are two configurations in the conventional 2D MOT devices. In the first configuration, there are only 4 trapping laser beams transmitted perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis [T. G. Tiecke, S. D. Gensemer, A. Ludewig, and J. T. M. Walraven, Phys. Rev. A 80, 013409 (2009)]. As a result, the cooling and trapping occur only two-dimensionally and there is no cooling and trapping along the longitudinal symmetry axis where the atoms are free to move. In the second configuration, two more counter-propagating trapping laser beams are added along the longitudinal axis to provide the additional cooling in the third dimension [K. Dieckmann, R. J. C. Spreeuw, M. Weidemuller, and J. T. M. Walraven, Phys. Rev. A 58, 3891 (1998)]. In that setup, the optical accesses along the longitudinal symmetry axis are blocked or shared by the two trapping beams along that direction. The conventional 2D M","High optical depth (OD) is sought for much quantum optics research [A. V. Gorshkov, A. Andre, M. Fleischhauer, A. S. Sorensen, and M. D. Lukin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 123601 (2007)], but in the traditional MOT optical configuration high OD is commonly obtained by increasing the MOT size where more cold atoms can be obtained in the cloud. But the MOT size is usually determined by the MOT laser beam size which is limited by the total laser power. Another way to improve the OD is increasing the atomic density in the cloud using a dark-spot configuration [W. Ketterle, K. B. Davis, M. A. Joffe, A. Martin and D. E. Pritchard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2253(1993)], but the magnetic field gradient is often required to switched off for applications. Also, in conventional 2D MOTs, there is a limitation for optical access due to its geometry and the OD may need to be further improved.","A two-dimensional (2D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) comprises an atom source, a bakeable ultra-high vacuum cell, a two-dimensional quadrupole magnetic field, at least 6 trapping laser beams, and at least one repumping laser beams. In the dark-line 2D MOT configuration, we use two orthogonal repumping laser beams with a dark line crossover at center along the longitudinal axis. At least two pairs trapping laser beams do not follow the symmetry axis of the quadrupole magnetic field: they are aligned with non-zero degree angles relative to the longitudinal axis of the MOT.","Overview","A two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D MOT) system uses six trapping laser beams. The 2D MOT has no trapping beam in the symmetry axis so that it allows full optical access to further experiments. For conducting quantum optics experiments, there is no need to switch off the magnetic field for maintaining long atomic coherence time. In the following description, for the purpose of illustration, Rb atoms are taken as a demonstrated example. The principles described here can be applied to other neutral atoms.","In one embodiment, the 2D MOT apparatus comprises a compact bakeable ultra-high vacuum cell, a single hollow-core wire magnetic coil, and an optical alignment with six trapping laser beams. The bakeable ultra-high vacuum cell comprises a glass cell with optical quality, a six-way all-metal cross chamber, an atomic dispenser source, an ion pump, and a turbo molecular pump. The glass cellcan take either an octagonal or rectangular shape. The magnetic coil, taking a single-wire design, produces a 2D quadrupole magnetic field with a zero magnetic field line along the longitudinal axis.","For the trapping laser, a six-beam configuration is used. Two counter-propagating trapping laser beams are transmitted perpendicularly to the longitudinal symmetry axis, and the other four (two counter-propagating pairs) trapping laser beams are aligned with a 45\u00b0 angle to the symmetry axis. The cold atoms are trapped along the symmetry axis. Because there is no trapping beam in the symmetry axis, the device provides a full optical access along the symmetry axis. As a result of the six-beam configuration, a three-dimensional cooling effect is achieved, so the cooling effect of the MOT occurs in all directions though the atoms are trapped (two-dimensionally) in a line.","This 2D MOT is capable of trapping a stable line-shaped cold atomic cloud with a high optical depth. The zero magnetic field line along the symmetry axis leads to a long ground-state coherence time of the atoms without turning off the MOT magnetic field. Therefore, the 2D MOT is suitable for quantum optics research experiments at a high repetition rate, such as electromagnetically induced transparency, atomic memory and storage, single-photon and bi-photon generation.","The configuration differs from the conventional configuration in that two (of three) pairs of trapping laser beams in the disclosed 2D MOT setup do not follow the symmetry axis of the quadrupole magnetic field, but instead are aligned with a large non-zero degree angles. In one non-limiting example, an alignment of 45\u00b0 is selected as an optimal alignment, with the optimal alignment used as a target alignment.","The six-beam alignment is considered to be an optimal configuration for a given total trapping laser power. With the six-beam configuration as a base, one can add more counter-propagating beam pairs to achieve similar trapping results. The selection of the six-beam configuration is made to obtain high optical depth and trap as many atoms as possible. It is possible to achieve a working MOT with more than 6 beams, but the non-six beam configurations are not optimal for a given total laser power.","In one disclosed configuration, a dark-line 2D MOT system is implemented. This configuration includes (a) an atom source, (b) a bakeable ultra-high vacuum cell, (c) a two-dimensional quadrupole magnetic field, (d) at least 6 trapping laser beams; and (e) two orthogonal repumping laser beams with a dark linecrossover at center along the longitudinal axis.","In this embodiment, two orthogonal repumping laser beams are used. In each repumping beam, an opaque line is imaged to the longitudinal axis of the 2D MOT. The overlap of these two line images creates a dark line volume in the longitudinal axis where there is no repumping light.","In one example of a dark-line 2D Rb MOT, with a trapping laser power of 40 mW and repumping laser power of 18 mW, we can obtain an atomic OD up to 160 in an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) scheme, which corresponds to an density-length product of NL=2.05\u00d710m. In a closed two-state system, the OD can get as large as 600 or greater. The example 2D MOT configuration allows for full optical access of the atoms in its longitudinal direction without interfering with the trapping laser beams spatially. Moreover, the zero magnetic field along the longitudinal axis allows the cold atoms to maintain a long ground-state coherence time without switching off the MOT magnetic field, which makes it possible to operate the MOT at a high repetition rate and a high duty cycle. The 2D MOT is ideal for atomic ensemble based quantum optics applications, such as EIT, entangled photon pair generation, optical quantum memory, and quantum information processing.","An example configuration uses two orthogonal repumping laser beams. In each repumping beam, an opaque line is imaged to the longitudinal axis of the 2D MOT. An opaque line is placed outside the glass cell and in the path of the repumping beams to block some part of light. A lens is used to create an image of the wire to the middle of the atoms in the 2D MOT, resulting in two images of the opaque line. Overlap of the two wire images from both repumping beams creates a dark-line volume where the repumping light is absent. In one non-limiting example, the opaque line is established by a copper wire with a diameter of 0.6 mm, and the two images are images of the wire.","The six trapping laser beams still cover the entire MOT. Compared to the previous version without the repumping dark line, this dark-line 2D MOT is capable of producing a line-shaped cold atom trap with a much higher optical depth but with lower laser powers.","Configuration","The 2D MOT device allows production of laser cooled atomic ensemble with a high optical depth and a low ground-state dephasing rate (or a long coherence time). The apparatus comprises a bakeable ultra-high vacuum cell, a single hollow-core wire magnetic coil, and an optical alignment with six trapping laser beams. The features of the apparatus include the 2D quadrupole magnetic field generated from the magnetic coil and the laser beam alignment that allows maximum optical access to the cold atoms along the symmetry axis. The system can be run at a high repetition rate because the long atomic ground state coherence time can be achieved without the need of turning off the magnetic field.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["111","120","131","132","133","134","135","136","111","140","143","145","151","153","161","163","140","145","151","153","143","161","151","163","153","161","163","151","161","161","163","161","140","120","131","132","133","134","135","136"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["120","120","221","222","221","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["140","300","315","317","300","331","332","333","339","315"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["140","120","131","136","131","136","131","132","331","332","133","134","335","339","135","136","337","333","334","336","338"]},"An alternative choice of the glass cell can be a rectangle shape.  are schematic drawings of the rectangle glass cell.  shows the schematic drawing of a second embodiment of the glass vacuum cell  with a rectangle shape and its magnetic and optical alignments.

The arrows along the magnetic lines  indicate the directions of the magnetic field. To illustrate clearly how the laser beams are aligned, the 3D plots are separated onto y-z and x-z planes, where z is the longitudinal symmetry axis.

One pair of counter-propagating trapping laser beams  and  are aligned along the x axis. Different form the conventional 2D and 3D MOT optical alignments, the other four trapping beams are not aligned along the symmetry axes of the magnetic field. For example, in the conventional 2D MOT configuration, these four trapping beams are aligned along y and z axes. In contrast, in the present 2D MOT setup, these four trapping beams , , , and  are aligned at non-zero degree (the optimal value is 45\u00b0) angles to the y and z axes, as shown in . Because the atoms are trapped along the longitudinal x axis, this configuration opens full optical access along the atom line which is the direction for high optical depth. With the illustrated magnetic coil current direction and magnetic field, the polarizations \u03c3 and \u03c3 of the six trapping beams are also shown in , B and C. To efficiently making use of the trapping laser power, the two 45\u00b0 beams are retro reflected by the mirrors  and  through quarter wave plates  and  as shown in . Two repumping laser beams are used. The repumping beam  overlaps with the trapping beam  along the x axis. The repumping beam  is aligned along the y axis. In each repumping beam, there is an opaque wire line. The images of these opaque wires, through a lens imaging system in each beam, overlaps at the center of the 2D MOT and creates a dark line  of the repumping beams along the z axis. In the dark line regime, the atoms are pumped into the dark state without interacting with the trapping laser and thus avoid the radiation trapping loss and heating. In the demonstrated Rb 2D MOT example, the trapping laser is red detuned by 20 MHz from the transition |5S, F=3\u2192|5P, F=4, and the repumping laser is on resonance with the transition |5S, F=2\u2192|5P, F=2. Both trapping and repumping beams have the same beam diameter of 2 cm. The total laser powers are 40 mW and 18 mW, for the trapping laser and repumping laser, respectively.","Water-cooled magnetic coil shown in  is made of a single hollow-core copper wire with a square cross section, which is similar to that shown in .  depict the magnetic fields established by magnetic coil . The small inductance (\u02dc100 \u03bcH) of this coil also allows us to switch on and off the magnetic field in a short time. Controlling the magnetic field is necessary for obtaining the atomic ground state coherence time of more than 10 \u03bcs. A dephasing rate of \u03b3=2\u03c0\u00d70.03 MHz between the two ground levels is obtained, which corresponds to a coherence time of \u03c4=5.3 \u03bcs, without switching off the 2D MOT quadrupole magnetic field during the measurement. If such several-\u03bcs coherence time is long enough for applications, the quadrupole magnetic field can be caused to remain on continuously and the magnetic coil can be simplified. In this case, the magnetic coil  set can be assembled from four independent coils (, , , and ), as shown in . There are multiple turns in each coil so that they can be driven by a low current power supply without additional water cooling. Such a steady MOT magnetic field can also be generated by 4 permanent magnet bars (, , , and ) aligned in the configuration shown in . Using permanent magnet bars dramatically simplify the system and reduce the power consumption because it can be self-standing without using any electrical power supply. While water cooling is described, it is anticipated that alternate liquid coolants may be used.","Therefore, the magnetic field can remain on continuously during an experiment while maintaining a ground state coherence time of up to 5 \u03bcs.
