title: Metal air battery and buoyancy module for life vests
abstract: An individual flotation device includes a shell that has a cavity for receiving air and a housing that is connected to the shell. The housing has a metal air battery compartment that is dimensioned and configured to receive a metal air battery and also has an aperture. The housing may be located on the shell such that the aperture will generally remain above water during use of the flotation device. A membrane that may comprise hydrophobic properties may be located within the aperture of the housing.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to survival devices and, more particularly, to power sources for use with such devices.","2. Related Art","The Department of Defense has recently stated that the development of lightweight and longer lasting survival devices for fixed wing and rotary aircraft crews is a high priority. It has been found that, in general, a reduction in the weight of survival devices is beneficial both during normal operation and during emergency operation. In the case of normal operation, the wearer and the equipment benefits from a reduced weight through increased performance (especially for high performance aircraft) and, in the case of emergency operation, the wearer will benefit by an increased mobility and buoyancy.","One example of a survival device is shown in  of U.S. Pat. No. 6,439,941 to McClure et al. This patent describes a flotation system that supports a satellite radio-telephone , a transmission antenna , an immersion sensor , a GPS receiver  and antenna system  all powered by a battery pack . The battery pack  uses high-powered lithium batteries that may last up to four days by transmitting on an intermittent basis.","However, to date, no generally light weight and sufficiently high capacity battery has been employed with survival devices such as life vests.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an individual flotation device comprises a shell that has a cavity for receiving air and a housing that is connected to the shell. The housing comprises a metal air battery compartment that is dimensioned and configured to receive a metal air battery and also comprises an aperture. The housing may be located on the shell such that the aperture will generally remain above water during use of the flotation device. A membrane that may comprise hydrophobic properties may be located within the aperture of the housing.","One embodiment of the present invention concerns an individual flotation device that comprises a metal air battery that has more than three times the energy, by weight, of lithium and mercury batteries available today.","Referring now to , an individual flotation device  comprises a generally known construction including a flexible outer shell , composed of, e.g., a polymeric substance, and a central cavity  () filled with a gaseous medium such as air (not shown). The flotation device  may be operated, as shown, by a soldier  who has been ejected from a downed aircraft (not shown) and is floating in a body of water .","Referring now to  and in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a metal air battery module is illustrated generally at . In this embodiment, the metal air battery module  comprises a housing  and a metal air battery .","The housing  may include a generally rectangular shape in cross section and may comprise a composite, polymeric substance similar to that of the shell . In such a case, both the shell  and the housing  may be molded during fabrication and then adhered together. In one example, the housing comprises a medium density polyethylene.","The housing  may comprise walls , , , which are located within the central cavity  of the shell , and a wall that may be generally planar with the shell . The walls , , and may define a generally rectangular shape in cross-section in addition to a metal air battery compartment . An aperture , having a generally rectangular configuration may be provided in a wall . The aperture  and wall is located on the shell  such that it will remain above the water  (see ).","A hydrophobic membrane  may be located within the battery compartment  and, for example, may comprise polyamide or polytetrafluoroethylene. One suitable polyamide membrane is sold by the General Electric Company under the mark Magna Nylon Hydrophobic Membrane. The membrane  may function to prevent the ingress of water into the metal air battery compartment and may be adhered to an air permeable spacer .","A cover , such as an adhesive tape, may be fastened over the membrane  to maintain a vacuum seal and prevent the passage of oxygen into the metal air battery compartment  prior to desired operation of the individual flotation device . During operation of the flotation device  and upon removal of the cover , air may fill the battery compartment  and provide for the operation of the metal air battery , as described below. Optionally, the cover  may be at least partially composed of, and\/or adhered by, a water soluable material to aid in the event of an unconscious soldier .","The metal air battery  may be constructed in a known manner and may comprise a gas permeable container  comprising openings , an anode  and a cathode . The container  may comprise a nickel plated steel wherein openings  provide for the passage of oxygen. The anode  may comprise a gel composed of zinc and an electrolyte and the cathode  may comprise a binder, carbon particles and a reducing agent such as a manganese compound. During operation, oxygen from air may initiate operation of the battery  by being reduced at the cathode and forming metal oxides at the anode. Further details of a metal air battery may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,046 to Payne et al which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","An electrical cable  and connector  may be employed to conduct electrical energy from the metal air battery  to power additional equipment such as an emergency radio.","Optionally, the metal air battery module  may further comprise a transmitter\/receiver compartment  in which a transmitter, receiver and\/or GPS receiver (none of which are shown) may be positioned. Referring back to  now, there is depicted the metal air battery module , housing , aperture , electrical cable , connector  and an antenna . The antenna  is depicted in a T-shaped configuration, but other suitable configurations and arrangements are also possible. The antenna  may be thin film antenna further comprising a metallic substance deposited on thin film antenna's substrate, and may be positioned on the shell  as shown in  for enhanced transmission and reception.","While the present invention has been described in connection with what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to these herein disclosed embodiments. Rather, the present invention is intended to cover all of the various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The following detailed description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
