title: Bioreactor design and process for engineering tissue from cells
abstract: A scaled-up multi-coaxial fiber bioreactor, and variations of this bioreactor. The device is characterized by a hollow housing and an array of from about 20 to about 400 modules of hollow fibers, where each module includes at least three coaxial semipermeable hollow fibers. The innermost fiber provides a boundary for an innermost compartment which is connected to inlet and outlet ports. Arranged coaxially around the central hollow fiber are several other hollow fibers with their respective compartments, each compartment defined by a respective annular space between adjacent fibers and each including inlet and outlet ports. An outermost compartment for permitting integral aeration is the space between the outer side of the outermost fibers and the inner side of the housing, and has inlet and outlet ports. The hollow housing has inlet and outlet manifolds and flow distributors for each of the compartments. In a preferred embodiment the bioreactor is used as an extracorporeal liver. Liver cells, are introduced into one or more annular compartments and media and aeration are provided in others. Plasma from an ailing patient is introduced into another compartment for biotransformation of blood-borne toxins and biosynthesis of proteins, lipids, and other metabolic products.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/137,594, filed Jun. 3, 1999, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with support under 1 F32 DK09713-01 awarded by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to devices and processes of making and using devices for cell culture. In particular, the present invention relates to devices and processes of making and using devices for growth or maintenance of eukaryotic cells. One embodiment of the invention performs functions of the human liver.","Liver failure is classified into several major types, including acute liver failure, chronic liver disease, and multiorgan failure. The main etiologies of liver failure are viral hepatitis and hepatotoxicity induced by drugs and toxins. Advanced liver failure results in encephalopathy and coma, and may be fatal. Treatment focuses on stabilization of the patient until spontaneous recovery of liver function, or until liver transplantation. In the aggregate, the annual mortality attributable to liver failure exceeds 27,000 annually in the United States.","Artificial organs, which are devices made entirely of non-biological materials, have greatly advanced health care. Artificial organs and tissue substitutes, including kidney dialysis machines, mechanical respirators, cardiac pacemakers, and mechanical heart pumps have sustained many people with desperate life-threatening diseases. The utility of such artificial organs is reflected in their widespread use. Pacemakers, for example, serve admirably as substitutes for their biological analogs.","The artificial kidney, sometimes termed the kidney dialysis machine, illustrates both the benefits and shortcomings of purely artificial organs. Kidney dialysis machines are effective in removing urea, creatinine, water, and excess salts from the blood, thus partly fulfilling major roles of the natural kidney. Clearly, artificial kidneys have postponed deaths of patients in renal failure. However, kidney dialysis machines are insufficiently selective and inappropriately remove biological components, such as steroid hormones, that a functioning natural kidney does not. Consequently, dialysis over an extended period may result in bone loss, clotting irregularities, immunodeficiencies, and sterility.","The patient in hepatic failure, unlike the patient in renal failure, cannot be specifically treated. Renal dialysis, which revolutionized the treatment of renal failure, does not presently have a hepatic equivalent. Currently, the only available treatment for refractory liver failure is hepatic transplantation. Many patients in hepatic failure do not qualify for transplantation because of concomitant infection, or other organ failure. Because of organ shortages and long waiting lists, even those who qualify for liver transplantation often die while awaiting an allograft. UCLA reported that one quarter of their transplant candidates died before a liver could be obtained. Organs suitable for transplant in the pediatric age group are even more scarce (Busuttil, R. W. et al. 1987, 206, 387).","The natural liver has four major classes of biochemical functions. First, the liver biosynthesizes a wide range of proteins, including major acellular components of blood, such as serum albumin, alpha-anti-trypsin, alpha-macroglobulin, enzymes, clotting factors, carrier molecules for trace elements, and the apo-lipoproteins. The liver then releases these components to the blood circulation. The liver also maintains appropriate plasma concentrations of amino and fatty acids. Second, the liver has a major role in detoxification reactions. The liver oxidizes or conjugates many harmful external poisons, processes that usually, but not always, diminish the poisonous character of the toxins. The liver also destroys excess hemoglobin, metabolizes the porphyrin molecules of hemoglobin, and recycles the iron component. Third, waste products, such as bilirubin, are conjugated and excreted via the biliary tree. Fourth, the liver synthesizes and secretes the bile salts, which serve as detergents that promote the emulsification and digestion of lipids. The multiplicity and biochemical character of liver function vastly increase the complexity of extracorporeal hepatic support.","Bioartificial organs are artificial organs designed to contain and sustain a viable biological component. Many biological functions are even more complex than simply generating a voltage potential at regular intervals, as occurs in the simplest of pacemakers. Examples include biosynthesis of blood components and catabolic processing of deleterious agents. The liver, endocrine glands, bone marrow, and kidney are prominent in such specialized biochemical functions. Artificial organs without a biological component cannot reproduce the complex biochemical functions executed by these organs.","Historically, non-biologic artificial liver substitutes have depended on hemodialysis and hemoperfusion, but have been of very short-term and highly limited benefit (Abe, T. et al., Therapeutic Apheresis 2000, 4:26). In contrast to purely artificial organs, an effective liver replacement must have a biological component. The liver is the most massive organ in the human body, exclusive of distributed organs such as skin, gut, hematopoietic system, and vasculature. Sustaining a large mass of functioning liver cells in vitro presents a variety of hurdles. At least eight major problems to developing a functional bioartificial liver can be described: 1) growing or obtaining appropriate and viable cells; 2) providing for a critical minimum mass of cells; 3) supplying oxygen to the cells; 4) supplying nutrients to the cells, and removing cell waste products efficiently; 5) limiting shear forces and hydrostatic pressures, 6) inducing or sustaining a differentiated cell phenotype with the capacity for biosynthesis and biotransformation of toxins; 7) maintaining sterility; and 8) preventing liver tissue rejection or lysis by complement.","1) Growing or obtaining appropriate and viable cells. Liver cells for potential use in bioartificial livers can be established cell lines, primary isolates from human or animal livers, or primordial liver cells however, secretion of tumorigenic factors is negatively affecting FDA approval of BAL designs incorporating cell lines (Xu, A. S. L. et al., 2000 in , Lanza, R. P., Langer R., and Vacanti, J. (Ed.), Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 559\u2013597). Cell lines of liver are available, for example HepG2 and C3A, that express many functions of differentiated liver. Cell lines offer the potential of growing sufficient numbers of cells in an extracorporeal mass cell culture system, or bioreactor, for sustaining a patient because the growth of cell lines is not limited by cell senescence, but by nutrient availability. Primary human or animal liver cells can also be obtained in the numbers required for a functional bioartificial liver. However, the use of human liver for cell preparation is limited by its lack of availability, and the use of animal liver for cell preparation suffers from some degree of cellular incompatibility. Acute cellular incompatibility results from the binding of antibodies that recognize foreign cells followed by the binding of proteins of the complement system and lysis of the foreign cells. Longer-term cellular incompatibility mechanisms also exist, but should not present any problems for the use of bioreactors as interim or \u201cbridge\u201d medical products. A possible alternative to initial inoculation with a large mass of differentiated cells is the expansion of liver stem cells that are progenitors of mature liver cells. Recent reports suggest that liver progenitor cells go through multiple cell divisions on the path toward maturation and differentiation (Brill, S. et al., 1995, 59, 95; Sigal S. H. et al., 1995, 59, 35). Suitable control of the growth and differentiation processes with staged application of appropriate cytokines can permit preparation of a clinically useful quantity of cells.","2) Providing for a critical minimum mass of cells. The adult human liver has a mass of about 1400\u20131600 grams, and features a considerable reserve, or redundant, capacity. It is estimated that human survival can be sustained with about 15\u201320% of the total liver mass. The figure of 20% of the liver mass corresponds to about 5\u00d710cells (Kasai et al. 1994, 18, 348). Most, if not all, previous bioartificial liver designs suffer from a woefully inadequate cell capacity. That is, such devices are capable of sustaining far fewer than 5\u00d710cells, often orders of magnitude fewer cells. Without the cell mass critical for biosynthesis of plasma components and detoxification reactions, these other designs have little clinical utility.","3) Supplying oxygen to the cells. The functional units of most organs such as nephron, acinus, alveoli, microvilli, skin, etc. consists of a capillary bed across which is a physico-chemical gradient. These gradients are controlled by mass transfer effects. Oxygen is the primary nutrient that is limiting in cell cultures (Macdonald, J. M. et al. 1998, 11, 1; Glacken M. W. et al. 1983, 413, 355). \u2018Integral\u2019 oxygenation, or aeration inside the bioreactor containing the biological or chemical material of interest, greatly enhances mass transfer of oxygen and carbonic acid. The formation of the latter can be used to control pH.","Oxygen is generally the limiting nutrient in hollow fiber bioartificial livers (Catapano, G. et al. 1996, 19, 61) primarily because hepatocytes are highly aerobic cells which causes problems of oxygen mass transfer. Oxygen has a relatively high diffusion coefficient and its mass transfer from blood in the liver sinusoids to hepatocytes is dominated by diffusion rather than convection (i.e., convection and perfusion are caused by pressure gradients). These effects are because an oxygen molecule is much smaller than other nutrients such as a glucose molecule, or than biosynthetic products such as proteins, and because the hepatocytes generate steep concentration gradients in bioartifical livers. With known rates of oxygen diffusion and oxygen consumption, and reasonable estimates of cell density, the diffusion distance at which oxygen utilization becomes the rate-limiting factor for growth is approximately 200 \u03bcm (Macdonald, J. M. et al., 1999, in , Kuhtreiber, W., Lanza, R. P. and Chick, W. L. (Eds.) Birkhauser Boston, Cambridge, pp. 252\u2013286. In bioartificial livers with serial oxygenation aerated with air, oxygen becomes axially limiting in perfusion media by 25 mm (Macdonald et al., 1999, supra).","Hepatocytes have a high metabolic rate and require a continuous oxygen supply. The oxygen consumption rate ranges from 0.59 to 0.7 nmole\/s\/10cells for HepG2 cells (Smith, M. D. et al 1996, 19, 36) and is 0.42 nmole\/s\/10cells for isolated hepatocytes (Rotem, A. et al. 1992, 40, 1286). Integral oxygenation, that is, continuous supply of oxygen along the path of media supply to the cells, is essential to supplying oxygen to liver cells. Serial oxygenation, which is oxygenation at one or a few places in the fluid line of media supply cannot sustain the mass of liver cells needed for an effective bioartificial liver. A difficulty with serial oxygenation is that the solubility of oxygen in aqueous media unsupplemented with oxygen carriers is so low that any oxygen present is quickly depleted by cell metabolism. In fact, in longitudinal flow along a conventional bioreactor semipermeable membrane, hepatocytes deplete oxygen within 2.5 centimeters along the path and therefore convective oxygen mass transfer via increasing Starling flow is improved. Increasing flow rates through conventional bioreactors can cause fiber breeches and adversely affect hepatocyte function (Callies, R. et al., Bio\/Technology 1994 12:75). Thus, bioartificial liver designs that do not provide for adequate oxygen delivery are able to support only a limited number of cells. In addition, the flux of oxygen in a diffusion-limited system constrains cells to grow very near (less than about 0.2 mm) to the supply of oxygen. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,857 to Goffe discloses a bioreactor with some coaxial and some parallel semi-permeable hollow fibers. The Goffe design allows integral oxygenation but does not constrain the thickness of the cell compartment. The fiber-to-fiber spacing in that design is 3\u20135 mm so that there is not strict control of the oxygen diffusion distance. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,566 to Darnell et al. discloses a bioreactor with bundles of hollow fibers in parallel. The Darnell et al. design does not permit a multitude of individual multi-coaxial fiber bundles to be built-up with accurate and reproducible diffusion distances, and the design is not easily scaled-up. The Darnell et al. design uses bundles of parallel fibers, again not effectively addressing the issue of oxygen diffusion. Thus, a need remains for a bioreactor which deals effectively with the diffusion-limited thickness of the cell mass, with providing a critical mass of cells, and with supplying oxygen throughout the length of the bioreactor without adverse shear force effects.","4) Supplying nutrients to the cells, and removing cell waste products efficiently. The issue of supplying nutrients such as carbohydrates, lipids, minerals, and vitamins has been successfully solved by several variants of hollow fiber technology, and these features must be successfully incorporated into any viable bioartificial liver or bioartificial organ design. Similarly, the issue of removing metabolic wastes is usually handled by the same system that supplies the nutrients. The consumption rates for glutamate, pyruvate, and glucose are typically in the range of 0.03 to 0.3 nmol\/s\/10cells, with reasonable assumptions for cell density and growth rate (Cremmer, T. et al. 1981, 106, 99; Imamura, T. et al. 1982, 124, 353; Glacken, M. Dissertation 1987). The diffusion rates of oxygen in tissue are similar to those of pyruvate in water, and higher than those of glucose. As these consumption rates are less than the oxygen consumption rate, oxygen is the limiting nutrient in most conditions.","5) Limiting shear forces and hydrostatic pressure. For a given bioreactor there is an optimum balance of convection and diffusion for adequate oxygen mass transfer without creation of severe oxygen gradients. For example, using a nontoxic oxygen range, <0.4 mM (solubility constant is 1.06 mM\/atm, for air solubility is 0.2 mM at 37\u00b0 C.), the convective component of oxygen mass transfer should be increased as cells are increasingly farther than 0.2 mm from supply of oxygen (Macdonald et al., 1999, supra.). Although the partial oxygen tension in the liver sinusoid is about 70 mm Hg near the portal triad dropping to 20 mm Hg near the central vein, which equates to a range of 0.096 to 0.027 mM of free oxygen, the hemoglobin-bound oxygen ranges from 6.26 to 2.91 mM. The velocity of blood flow in the liver sinusoid is about 0.02 cm\/s while the oxygen diffusion coefficient is about 4 orders-of-magnitude less, or 2\u00d710cm\/s. However, hepatic function is adversely affected with increasing shear forces, and in vivo hepatocytes are protected by a layer of endothelia and extracellular matrix in the space of Disse. Sufficient shear forces will kill hepatocytes. Others have found that shear forces induce specific cytochrome P450's (Mufti N. A. and Shuler, M. L., 1995, 11, 659). A recent study has shown that liver regenerates faster with 90% than with 70% hepatectomy and this was attributed to greater shear forces (Sato, Y. et al., 1997, 27, 518). However, this faster regeneration could also be due to enhanced oxygen, nutrient, and agonist mass transfer. Therefore, there is some maximum level of shear force that hepatocytes can sustain while still displaying optimal function. This maximum level can be increased if a layer of endothelia protects hepatocytes.","To increase convection, hydrostatic pressure gradients are increased. Elevated hydrostatic pressures can implode hepatocytes. Therefore, it is important to stay below these pressures. It is possible to cause 100% mortality of isolated rat hepatocytes by generating hydrostatic pressures of greater than 7 psi (>300 mm Hg) for longer than 2 minutes while inoculating these cells into coaxial bioreactor using a syringe.","6) Inducing or sustaining a differentiated cell phenotype with the capacity for biosynthesis and biotransformation of toxins. The use of the differentiated phenotype of liver cells is necessary to produce a useful bioartificial liver because the specialized functions of the liver, including biosynthesis of blood components and detoxification of toxins, are associated with the differentiated phenotype. These specialized functions are lost in whole, or in part, as the cells dedifferentiate, which often happens in isolated primary cell culture. In contrast, the form of liver cells capable of rapid growth is the dedifferentiated phenotype, leaving the practitioner to balance two opposing needs (Enat, R. et al. 1984, 81, 1411). Some reports suggest that the phenotype of liver cells may be modulated by the presence of cytokines and extracellular matrix components. In particular, the extracellular matrix components rich in collagen IV and laminin, produced by the Engelbrech-Holm Sarcoma (EHS) cells and available commercially as MATRIGEL\u2122, when used with hormonally defined media induces a differentiated phenotype (Enat, R. et al., supra; Bissell, D. M. -1988, 151,1; Brill, S. et al. 1993, 204, 261).","7) Maintaining sterility. The implementation of facile sterilization procedures for bioreactors and associated components is essential for clinical utility of extracorporeal bioartificial organs. Fortunately, the procedures for sterilization are well established, including standard methods both for sterilization of extracorporeal devices and for maintaining asepsis by standard in-line filters.","8) Preventing liver tissue rejection or lysis by complement. Rejection of foreign tissue may occur by a rapid process known as complement-mediated lysis that involves binding of circulating antibodies to the foreign cell surface, attachment of the proteins of the complement system, and lysis of the offending cell. The cell-mediated immune system is responsible for delayed rejection reactions. However, the cell-mediated immune system should not play a major role in bioreactor systems that do not permit direct contact of host and donor cells. Foreign body reactions, for example, against the structural components of bioreactors, are also cell-mediated and should therefore not constitute substantial obstacles.","Needed Improvements.","In view of the above, a clear need exists for bioartificial livers to sustain patients in liver failure. Specifically, a need exists for an improved version of a bioartificial liver that would have a high biological cell capacity in very thin layers of cells, readily accessible to oxygen and nutrients. There is a need for an apparatus or bioreactor, that provides efficient oxygen delivery to large masses of cells in cell culture and permits transfer of beneficial biosynthetic cell products to the patient. Similarly, there exists a need for effective methods of use of such an apparatus.","The problems with existing bioreactor designs include inadequate oxygenation, minimal capacity for the biological cell component, limited capability for removal of toxins, excessive shear and hydrostatic forces, and difficulty in transferring biosynthetic cell products for patient use. In addition, existing bioreactor designs have not dealt effectively with the diffusion-limited thickness of the cell mass, with providing a critical mass of cells, and with supplying oxygen throughout the length of the bioreactor.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide varying embodiments of an apparatus which provides efficient oxygen delivery to large masses of cells in a bioreactor cell culture and transfer of beneficial biosynthetic cell products to the patient, and methods of use therefor.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus which permits cells to be contained in a thin annular space adjacent to continuously oxygenated and flowing nutrient medium that provides essential oxygen and nutrients and carries away metabolic products.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for the collection of the biosynthetic products of large masses of cells in a bioreactor.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus to detoxify blood or plasma from a patient unable to remove or inactivate these toxins.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus to serve as a substitute liver.","The present invention provides a scaled-up multi-coaxial hollow fiber bioreactor, having: a housing having an inner side; and an array of about 20 to about 400 modules of hollow fibers, each module having at least three coaxial semipermeable hollow fibers. The module of hollow fibers has a first fiber nested within a second fiber; the second fiber nested within a third fiber; and so on. Each fiber has an inner side and an outer side. A first compartment is defined by the inner side of the first fiber, and has at least one first inlet port and at least one first outlet port. A second compartment is defined by a first annular space between the outer side of the first fiber and the inner side of the second fiber, and has at least one second inlet port and at least one second outlet port. A third compartment is defined by a second annular space between the outer side of the second fiber and the inner side of the third fiber, and has at least one third inlet port and at least one third outlet port; and successive compartments are defined by the adjacent fibers. An outermost compartment for permitting integral aeration is defined by an annular space between the outer side of the outermost fiber and the inner side of the housing, and has at least one outermost inlet port, and at least one outermost outlet port. The housing has at least one inlet manifold and at least one outlet manifold for each compartment.","An additional embodiment of the present invention features a serially-linked bioreactor with multiple scaled-up multi-coaxial hollow fiber bioreactors in which two or more compartments are connected in a continuous and serial manner. This implementation is particularly useful for both the biotransformation of toxins in patient plasma and the biosynthesis of plasma components to supplement patient blood.","A further embodiment of the present invention includes a one-sided multi-coaxial hollow fiber bioreactor that is particularly adapted to NMR studies and uses in which access to all ports from one side or one end is necessary.","Yet a further embodiment of the present invention includes a two-sided multi-coaxial hollow fiber bioreactor that is particularly adapted to small scale investigations.","A still further embodiment of the present invention includes a tight-packed hollow fiber bioreactor. This implementation is particularly useful for high density culture of cells in a compact arrangement and is suitable for both the transformation of toxins in patient plasma and the biosynthesis of plasma components to supplement patient blood.","The bioreactor of the present invention, when used as a bioartificial liver, has a modular design to allow an easy adjustment in liver functional capacity depending on the weight of the patient, whether that patient is infant, child, adolescent or adult, man or woman, and on the degree of remaining liver function in the patient. The bioreactor of the present invention further has both plasma and nutrient medium compartments to permit the biotransformation of toxins in the patient plasma and to enhance the effective transfer of biosynthetic products from the bioartificial liver to the patient. When used with liver or other cells, this invention is useful in the preparation of biosynthetic products for patients, in experimental use, and use as a supplemental biotransformation apparatus for detoxification of blood. The toxins in the blood may include, but are in no way limited to, metabolic wastes, products of cell or erythrocyte break-down, overdoses of ethical pharmacologic agents such as acetaminophen, and overdoses of illicit pharmacologic agents. Ease of manufacture of the invention enables cost-effective commercial development.","There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.","In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.

The Gunn rat model, which is the animal model for Crigler-Naijar syndrome in humans is an ideal model for demonstrating the efficacy of the bioreactor as an extracorporeal liver assist device.

The defect, present in homozygous recessive animals, is in the gene encoding UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme necessary for the conjugation and biliary excretion of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin in senescent red blood cells). The Gunn rat therefore cannot conjugate and excrete bilirubin and becomes hyperbilirubinemic, having serum bilirubin levels of about 5\u201320 mg\/dL, compared with 1 mg\/dL in normal rats. Experimental Protocol. A scaled-up multi-coaxial hollow fiber bioreactor is used as an extracorporeal liver assist device with Gunn rats. The livers of heterozygous (phenotypically normal) Gunn rats are perfused and the cells are isolated. The cells are suspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and 10cells are introduced into the second compartment of the bioreactor. Blood from the femoral artery of a Gunn rat (total average blood volume ca. 10 to 12 mL) is perfused through compartment 3 of the bioreactor, separated from the liver cell annular space by the wall of the hollow fiber, at a flow rate of about 0.6\u20130.8 mL\/min with the aid of a peristaltic pump. At the same time, DMEM is flowed through the compartment one of the bioreactor at a flow rate of about 0.5 mL\/min. Blood flowing out of the bioreactor is returned to the Gunn rat.","The levels of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin in blood exiting the bioreactor are determined over the course of six hours using the Sigma Total and Direct Bilirubin assay system according to the instruction supplied by Sigma Chemical Company (Sigma Procedure #522\/553).","6.4 Biosynthetic Hepatocyte Function in a Scaled-Up Multi-Coaxial Hollow Fiber Bioreactor\/BAL.","Liver cells isolated as in Example I are further separated by zonal centrifugation in sucrose density gradients. Density fractions corresponding to parenchymal cells are collected and introduced into the aseptic cell compartment (compartment 2) of the scaled-up multi-coaxial bioreactor.","The parenchymal cells are maintained by circulating warm Ham's F-12 nutrient medium through compartments 1 and 3, and 95% air with 5% COthrough compartment 4. The effluent from compartment 1 is collected and fractions are analyzed for parameters of biosynthetic liver function. Albumin synthesis is measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.","6.5 Biotransformatory Function in a Scaled-Up Multi-Coaxial Hollow Fiber Bioreactor\/BAL.","Liver cells isolated as in Example I are further separated by zonal centrifugation in sucrose density gradients. Density fractions corresponding to Kupffer cells are collected and introduced into the compartment 2 (cell compartment) of the scaled-up multi-coaxial hollow fiber bioreactor.","The cells in the bioreactor are maintained by circulating DMEM (without Phenol Red) through the inlet and outlet ports for compartments 1 and 3 and 95% air with 5% COthrough the ports for compartment 4. The cells are permitted to adhere within the compartment, followed by the introduction of free hemoglobin (1\u201310 mg\/ml) into compartment 1. The appearance of hemoglobin and the metabolic products of hemoglobin in compartment 3 are monitored with an in-line spectrophotometer.","6.6 The Serially-Linked Bioreactor with Human Cells for Patient Treatment.","Human hepatoma C3A cells are cultured as described (Mickelson, J. K. et al. 1995, 22, 866) and introduced into all the second compartments of the serially-linked bioreactor. Nutrient medium and 95% air with 5% COare pumped through the third and outermost compartments, respectively, and cell growth is monitored by glucose utilization. When the cells have attained the plateau, or stationary, growth phase, the albumin output is monitored.","The blood of a patient suffering liver failure is separated into plasma and cells by plasmapheresis and the plasma is pumped into the first compartment of the first bioartificial liver subunit. A portion of the plasma flows radially from the first compartment through the cell compartment to the third compartment to form biotransformed effluent. The plasma exits the first compartment of the first bioartificial liver subunit and flows into the third compartment of the second bioartificial liver subunit. The biotransformed effluent from the third compartment of the first bioartificial liver subunit flows into the first compartment of the second bioartificial subunit. Radial flow in the first bioartificial liver subunit detoxifies a portion of the plasma and radial flow in the second bioartificial liver subunit contributes biosynthetic products to the plasma to form supplemented plasma. Vital signs, jaundice, and blood level of toxins are monitored at regular intervals. Flow rates of plasma and medium are adjusted to maximize biotransformation of circulating toxins. Survival of the patient is measured.","6.7 Extracellular Matrix Effects on Differentiation of Hepatocytes in the Scaled-Up Multi-Coaxial Hollow Fiber Bioreactor.","Parenchymal cells are isolated by zonal centrifugation as in example IV, above, suspended in reconstituted basement matrix from the Englebreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma, and introduced into the compartment 2 (cell compartment) of the scaled-up multi-coaxial bioreactor. The hepatocytes are arrested in a Gstate by adhesion to the basement matrix, and are maintained in the normal hepatic phenotype (Rana et al., 1994). The highly differentiated state is characterized by synthesis of albumin and hepatic transcription factors such as C\/EBP-. The parenchymal cells are maintained by circulating warm Ham's F-12 nutrient medium through compartments 1 and 3, and 95% air with 5% COthrough compartment 4. The effluent from compartment 1 is collected and fractions are analyzed for parameters of biosynthetic liver function. Albumin synthesis is measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.","6.8 Growth and Differentiation of Human Hepatocytes in the Scaled-Up Multi-Coaxial Hollow Fiber Bioreactor.","Human parenchymal hepatocytes are isolated by the method of (Block, G. D. et al. 1996, 132, 1133) and introduced into compartment 2 of the scaled-up multi coaxial hollow fiber bioreactor. The parenchymal cells are propagated by exposure to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF\/SF), epidermal factor, and transforming growth factor alpha in nutrient medium HGM introduced into compartment 3 and air:CO(19:1) introduced into compartment 4. The ratio of transcription factor C\/EBP to C\/EBP is decreased by this process and the cell synthesis of albumin also is decreased. The medium flowing through compartment  is modified to include transforming growth factor and epidermal growth factor to induce differentiation of the cells and synthesis of albumin, in the formulation described (Sanchez, A. et al. 1998, 242, 27).","6.9 Biosynthesis of Hormones and Factors in the Scaled-Up Multi-Coaxial Hollow Fiber Bioreactor.","Parathyroid glands are obtained aseptically, minced, and treated with collagenase as described (Homicek, F. L. et al. 1988, 4, 157). The dispersed cells are suspended in CMRL-1415 nutrient medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and introduced into compartment  of the scaled-up multi-coaxial bioreactor. A mixture of 95% air and with 5% COis pumped through port . Warm medium is pumped through ports  and  and the effluent from the chamber is concentrated by ultrafiltration for collection of parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hypertensive factor, and other cell products. The hormones and factors are purified by immunoprecipitation and chromatography.","6.10 The Five Compartment Serially-Linked Bioreactor with Human Cells for Patient Treatment.","Human hepatoma C3A cells are grown as in example VI, above, except in the third compartment of a five-compartment serially-linked bioreactor. The innermost compartment (compartment 1) and the outermost compartment (compartment 5) are suffused with the gas mix, 95% air with 5% CO. Nutrient medium is pumped through the second and fourth compartments, respectively, and cell growth is monitored by glucose utilization. When the cells have attained the plateau, or stationary, growth phase, the albumin output is monitored.","The blood of a patient suffering liver failure is separated into plasma and cells by plasmapheresis and the plasma is pumped through the serially connected second compartments of the bioreactor. Vital signs, jaundice, and blood level of toxins are monitored at regular intervals. Flow rates of plasma and medium are adjusted to maximize biotransformation of circulating toxins. Survival of the patient is measured.","6.11 Construction of the Five Compartment Serially-Linked Bioreactor with Tight-Packed Fiber Arrangement and use with Human Cells for Patient Treatment.","Bioreactor subunits are constructed with 300 outermost coaxial fibers (3 millimeter o.d.) forming a part of the outer boundary of the annular cell compartments. A hollow fiber of 1.3 millimeter o.d. is inserted into each of the 3 millimeter fibers, forming part of the inner boundary of the annular cell compartments and part of the outer boundary of the compartments number 2. One micro bore hollow fiber (300 \u03bcm o.d.) is inserted into each of the 1.3 millimeter fibers as the innermost compartment of each coaxial fiber module and another set of 300 microfibers is placed parallel and adjacent to the coaxial modules. Both sets of microfibers carry aeration gas to oxygenate the plasma and the medium. The outermost compartment is compartment number  and is formed by the outside of the outermost coaxial fibers (of 3 millimeter o.d.), the outside of the microfibers that are adjacent to the coaxial modules, and the inside of the housing.","The serially-linked bioreactor and associated tubing and connections are sterilized.","Human hepatocytes are isolated as in Example VIII and introduced into the annular cell compartments, compartments 3, of each of two bioreactor subunits. The hepatocyte cells are propagated by exposure to nutrient medium and growth factors described in Example VII until the cell density is sufficient for treatment of a patient in liver failure. The bioreactor subunits with a complement of viable liver cells are now termed BAL subunits.","In use for patient treatment, patient plasma enters compartment number 2 of the first BAL subunit, through the first plasma entrance port, media enters compartment number 4 of the first BAL through the first media entrance port and gas enters the first BAL through first gas entrance port. Radial flow in the first subunit is produced by a pressure gradient across the fibers, such that the hydraulic pressure in the plasma compartment is higher than the pressure in the cell or media compartments. In consequence, part of the plasma flows from compartment number 2 through the annular cell compartment into compartment number 4. In the process the liver cells in the cell compartment can biologically detoxify the plasma passing through the cell compartment. As the detoxified plasma flows into compartment 4 the medium is modified with a detoxified plasma component. The remaining plasma then exits the first BAL subunit through the first plasma exit port, media exits the first BAL subunit through the first compartment number  exit port and gas exits the first BAL subunit through the first gas exit port. The flow scheme is then switched in the second subunit such that the fluid (medium containing detoxified plasma) from the first compartment number  exit port enters the second BAL subunit through the second compartment number 2 entrance port. Similarly, plasma from first compartment 2 exit port enters the second BAL subunit through the second compartment 4 entrance port and gas enters the second BAL subunit through the second gas entrance port. A portion of the media flows radially from the compartment number 2 entrance port through the annular cell layer and into the second compartment number 4. The liver cells add proteins and other biosynthetic products to the medium that flows through the cell compartment in subunit . As this enriched medium flows into the remaining plasma, the resultant, modified plasma is in part detoxified and in part enriched with biosynthetic proteins. The remaining medium then exits the second BAL subunit through the second compartment 2 exit port, the modified plasma exits the second BAL subunit through the second compartment 4 exit port and gas exits the second BAL subunit through the second gas exit port. The modified plasma, effluent from second compartment 4, is returned to the patient to sustain life.","6.12 Manufacture of Scaled Up Multi-Coaxial Hollow Fiber Bioreactor.","An apparatus is used to assemble a bioreactor in which a vacuum head, that is attached as necessary to a negative pressure source, holds a bundle of hollow fibers against a mesh for rapid insertion of smaller fibers. The opposite end of the hollow fibers is inserted into a manifold and placed in a vessel. Polyurethane epoxy is applied to bond the hollow fibers to the manifold and the assembly of manifold, epoxy, and hollow fibers subjected to a centrifugal force to remove epoxy from the inside of the fibers. Upon curing, the free ends of the hollow fibers are trimmed with a saw. The process is repeated for insertion of the next smaller set of hollow fibers by applying the vacuum, gluing the ends to the next manifold, centrifuging, and trimming.","The purpose of the above description and examples is to illustrate some embodiments of the present invention without implying any limitation.
