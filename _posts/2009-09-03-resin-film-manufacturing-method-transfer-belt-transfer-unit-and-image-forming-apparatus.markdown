Technical Field","The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a resin film, and also to a transfer belt, a transfer unit, and an image forming apparatus.","2. Related Art","Some resin films containing functional particles in resin are used as functional films. Various methods for producing these films have been studied and developed.","An image forming apparatus using an electrographic system is one example of an apparatus in which a resin film in which functional particles are included in a resin is used.","In the image forming apparatus using an electrographic system, a charge is formed on an image holder, which is a photoconductive photoreceptor formed of an inorganic or organic material, an electrostatic latent image is formed with laser light or the like generated by modulation of image signals, and then the electrostatic latent image is developed with a charged toner into a visible toner image. Subsequently, the toner image is electrostatically transferred to a material such as recording paper directly or via an intermediate transfer medium, thereby giving a reproduced image.","According to an aspect of the invention, a tubular body is provided, which includes a layer containing a resin and conductive particles, the layer having a first region that is free of the conductive particles and is provided at an outermost surface, and a second region that has higher conductivity than other regions and is provided closer to an innermost surface than the first region.","The exemplary embodiments of the present invention are further described below with reference to drawings.","-First Exemplary Embodiment-",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In the method for manufacturing a resin film according to the present exemplary embodiment, firstly, a coating liquid containing functional particles A, a resin material, and a solvent is prepared. Then, as shown in , the coating liquid is applied to a substrate , thereby forming a coating film  of the coating liquid.","The form of the substrate  is selected according to the resin film to be produced, and may be, for example, a tube-shaped or flat-shaped die.","The method for applying the coating liquid to the substrate  is not particularly limited. For example, when the substrate  is a cylindrical die, the outer peripheral surface is immersed in the coating liquid, the coating liquid is applied to the inner peripheral surface, the coating liquid is applied to the inner peripheral surface, followed by rotation of the die, or the coating liquid is charged into an injection die, thereby forming an endless coating film . When the substrate is a flat-shaped die, for example, the coating film  may be formed using a wire bar or an inkjet method.","Thereafter, the coating film  applied to the substrate  is dried. The coating film  is dried such that the proportion of residual solvent is 25% or less, preferably 20% or less, and more preferably 15% or less. If the proportion of residual solvent in the coating film  is too high, the below-described localization (increase of density) of the functional particles A hardly occurs. The lower the proportion of residual solvent, the more readily the below-described localization (increase of density) of the functional particles A occurs. The control of the proportion of residual solvent in the coating film , that is, the dry state of the coating film  allows the control of the degree of localization (congestion) of the functional particles A described below, and the location of the region containing the functional particles A in a localized state (particle-localized resin layer B) in the thickness direction of the resin film  to be produced.","The proportion of residual solvent refers to the proportion of the solvent weight remaining in the dried coating film with reference to the solvent weight contained in the coating liquid to be applied. The proportion of residual solvent is determined as described below.","For example, when the weight of the solid resin material (dry weight of resin material) and the weight of the functional particles are known, the total weight of the undried coating film is accurately measured, whereby the solvent weight contained in the total weight of the coating film is calculated. Then, the total weight of the dried coating film is accurately measured, the decrement is calculated as the weight of dissipated solvent by the formula: (weight of undried coating film\u2212weight of dried coating film)\/(weight of undried coating film\u2212weight of solid resin\u2212weight of functional particles), thereby determining the proportion of residual solvent.","The proportion of residual solvent may be determined using a thermal extraction gas chromatograph-mass spectrograph. An example of the measurement is described below. For example, a portion of the dried coating film is cut out with a weight of about 2 mg or more and 3 mg or less to make a sample, the sample is weighed, and heated to 400\u00b0 C. in a thermal extraction apparatus (trade name: PY2020D, manufactured by Frontier Laboratories Ltd.). The volatile components are injected into a gas chromatograph-mass spectrograph by way of an interface at 320\u00b0 C. (trade name: GCMS-QP2010, manufactured by Shimadzu Co., Ltd.), and the quantity is determined. More specifically, helium gas as a carrier gas is injected in an amount of 1\/51 (split ratio, 50:1) of the amount of evaporation from the sample into a column (trade name: capillary column UA-5, manufactured by Frontier Laboratories Ltd.) having an inside diameter of 0.25 \u03bcm and a length of 30 m at a linear velocity of 153.8 cm\/second (carrier gas flow rate of 1.50 ml\/minute and pressure of 50 kPa at column temperature of 50\u00b0 C.). The column is kept at 50\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, and then the column temperature is increased to 400\u00b0 C. at a ratio of 8\u00b0 C.\/minute, and the temperature is kept for 10 minutes, thereby desorbing the volatile components. Further, the volatile components are injected into the mass spectrograph at an interface temperature of 320\u00b0 C., and the peak area corresponding to the solvent is determined. The quantitative determination is carried out on the basis of an analytical curve prepared using the same solvent in known amounts. The determined solvent weight is divided by the weight of the dried sample, thereby calculating the proportion of residual solvent. The above-described procedure of measurement is one example, and the conditions may be changed according to the temperature at which the resin is decomposed or changed, or the boiling point of the solvent.","Then, as shown in , an eluting solvent  for eluting the resin material is applied to the surface of the dried coating film . In the region coated with the eluting solvent , the eluting solvent  permeates through the dried coating film  to swell the region below the coated surface of the coating film . At this time, the amount of the eluting solvent  on the coated surface of the coating film  is greater, that is, the solvent concentration is higher than that in the region below the coated surface of the coating film , so that the resin material is more readily eluted into the portion of the eluting solvent  on the coated surface of the coating film .","As shown in , since the functional particles A will not dissolve in the eluting solvent , the density of the functional particles A in the region where the resin materials has dissolved increases with the elution of the resin material and becomes greater than that in the other regions. As a result, a region containing the functional particles A in a localized state is formed. In , B represents the region where the functional particles A are localized.","The coating weight of the eluting solvent  is, for example, 0.001 g\/cmor more and 1 g\/cmor less, preferably 0.01 g\/cmor more and 1 g\/cmor less, and more preferably 0.01 g\/cmor more and 0.5 g\/cmor less.","The eluting solvent  is applied by the method used for applying the coating liquid containing the functional particles A and the resin material.","Thereafter, as shown in , the eluting solvent  applied to the surface of the coating film  is dried. The eluting solvent  is to be dried such that the proportion of residual solvent is, for example, 10% or less. The proportion of residual solvent is selected in accordance with, for example, the type of the resin material to be used, the intended use of the resin film produced, and the strength and maintainability of the resin film produced.","As described above, the eluting solvent  contains the resin material dissolved therein. Therefore, the resin material deposits on drying of the eluting solvent , and forms a layer on the region where the functional particles A are localized. The eluting solvent  is free of or contains the functional particles A in a lower amount than the other regions, so that a particle-free resin layer A containing no functional particles A is formed on the region containing the functional particles A in a localized state. Then, a particle-localized resin layer B containing the functional particles A in a localized state is formed below the particle-free resin layer A, and a particle-containing resin layer C containing the functional particles A at a lower density is formed below the particle-localized resin layer B. The particle-free resin layer A normally contains no particle, but may contain some functional particles A which had migrated into the applied eluting solvent  depending on the method.","Through the above-described processes, the resin film  composed of three regions having different particle densities (particle-free resin layer A, particle-localized resin layer B, and particle-containing resin layer C) is produced. Thereafter the resin film  is removed from the substrate , and is subjected to forming and processing according to the intended use.","When a resin precursor such as a polyimide resin is used as the resin material, drying of the eluting solvent  is followed by calcination, thereby producing the resin film .","The state of localization (congestion) of the functional particles A is observed by, for example, atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis. For example, when conductive particles are used as the functional particles, they are observed using D3000 and NANOSCOPE III manufactured by Digital Instruments under following conditions: measurement mode: contact mode, cantilever: Au-coated conductive cantilever, spring constant: 0.2 N\/m, and applied voltage: \u22125 V. The observation sheet is embedded, a silver paste electrode is formed in parallel to the depth direction, and used as the counter electrode of the cantilever. Under the above-described conditions, the state of localization of the particles is observed on the basis of the conductive points in a 10 \u03bcm square and height information. On the other hand, when nonconductive particles are used as the functional particles, the presence or absence of the functional particles is confirmed on the basis of height information.","In the method for manufacturing the resin film  according to the present exemplary embodiment, the coating film  formed from the coating liquid containing the functional particles A and the resin material is dried, and then the eluting solvent  for eluting the resin material is applied thereto. As a result, as described above, the functional particles A are localized in the coating film  coated with the eluting solvent . Thereafter, the eluting solvent  is dried to deposit the resin material dissolved in the eluting solvent  on the region where the functional particles A are localized, thereby forming the particle-free resin layer A free of the functional particles A. More specifically, in the region coated with the eluting solvent , the particle-localized resin layer B containing the functional particles A in a localized state is covered with the particle-free resin layer A, so that the functional particles A are not exposed at the surface of the resin film produced, but embedded in the film. Accordingly, in comparison with other method, the present method more easily produces a resin film containing the functional particles A in a localized state.","In the method for manufacturing the resin film  according to the present exemplary embodiment, the eluting solvent  is applied to the entire surface of the dried coating film . Alternatively, the eluting solvent  may be applied to a portion of the surface of the coating film .","For example, when the eluting solvent  is applied to the entire surface of the dried the coating film , as described above, the particle-free resin layer A formed of the resin film surface serves as a protective layer to prevent the functional particles A from being exposed from the resin film. More specifically, for example, when the functional particles A are conductive particles, owing to the prevention of exposure of the conductive particles, an antistatic film is produced in which the front surface resistivity is lower than the back surface resistivity.","On the other hand, when the eluting solvent  is applied to a portion of the surface of the dried coating film , the eluting solvent  may be applied in a pattern such as mesh, dots, or lattice on the dried coating film .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["12","14","16","16","16","14","18","14"]},"More specifically, for example, when the functional particles A are conductive particles, the particle-localized resin layer B is formed in the region coated with the dots of the eluting solvent  (that is, the conductive particles congregate densely in the region), so that the resin film produced has low volume resistivity overall, while the particle-free resin layer A, which is formed so as to cover the particle-localized resin layer B, serves as a protective layer to prevent exposure of the conductive particles, whereby the resin film produced has high surface resistivity overall. As a result, the anisotropic conductive film thus produced has higher surface resistivity and lower volume resistivity than other anisotropic conductive films having a different structure.","Alternatively, for example, when the functional particles A are hydrophilic particles, in the region coated with the eluting solvent , the particle-localized resin layer B containing the localized hydrophilic particles is covered by the particle-free resin layer A so as to have no hydrophilicity, while in the region uncoated with the eluting solvent , the hydrophilic particles are exposed to exhibit hydrophilicity. As a result, a flexible plate useful as a PS plate (lithographic plate) for offset printing is obtained.","The materials used in the method for manufacturing the resin film  according to the present exemplary embodiment are described below. The reference numerals are omitted hereinafter.","Firstly, the coating liquid is described.

Therefore, the eluting solvent is selected from solvents which dissolve the resin material. When a solvent dissolves a resin material, it means that 10 wt % or more of the resin solid content is soluble in the solvent at 25\u00b0 C.","Specific examples of the eluting solvent include those used in the coating liquid containing the functional particles and resin material. It is preferred that the eluting solvent is identical with the solvent contained in the coating liquid.","The above-described method for manufacturing a resin film according to the present exemplary embodiment is useful for the manufacture of, for example, antistatic films for electronic components, anisotropic conductive films for IC substrates, and PS plates (lithographic plates) according to the type of the functional particles contained in the film.","-Second Exemplary Embodiment-","(Transfer Belt: Tubular Body)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},"A transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment is endless as shown in , and is formed of a tubular body consisting of a single base material layer containing at least a resin and conductive particles. The transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment is formed of a single layer, but may include another functional layer(s) on the outer or inner peripheral surface of the belt.","The transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment includes a particle-free resin region A (first region) which is free of the conductive particles  and which is provided at the outermost surface; a particle-localized resin region B (second region) which contains the conductive particles  in a localized state and which is provided closer to the innermost surface than the particle-free resin region A; and a particle-containing resin region C (third region) which contains the conductive particles  at a lower particle density than the particle-localized resin region B and which is provided closer to the innermost surface than the particle-localized resin region B. The particle-localized resin region B contains the conductive particles  at a higher density than the particle-containing resin region C, and has a higher conductivity than other regions particle-free resin region A and particle-containing resin region C). Each of these regions is provided in the form of layer along the circumferential direction of the belt.","It is assumed that the decrease of electrical resistance of the belt is caused by the deterioration of the conductive particles and the resin surrounding them through the repeated discharge from the conductive particles (for example, discharge caused by removal of the recording medium from the belt). Detailed analysis of the outermost surface of the belt has shown that projections derived from conductive particles are present in the areas where the decrease of electrical resistance occurs. Electrical resistance more noticeably decreases with the increase of surface resistance. On the other hand, the decrease of surface resistance (that is, the increase of conductivity of the belt surface) requires the addition of a large amount of conductive particles to the belt, which results in the decrease of surface resistance and decrease of volume resistance.","On the other hand, in the transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment, the particle-free resin region A (first region) free of the conductive particles and provided at the outermost surface decreases the asperities on the outermost surface, that is, decreases the projections derived from the conductive particles , thus decreasing the points from which the decrease of electrical resistance occurs. The particle-localized resin region B having higher conductivity than other regions (particle-free resin region A and particle-containing resin region C) and provided closer to the innermost surface than the particle-free resin region A decreases surface resistance while preventing the decrease of volume resistance.","In addition, in the surface layer region at the outermost surface (that is, the particle-free resin region A (first region)), even if the resin is degraded to form points having low resistance, few conductive particles are present in the surface layer region at the outermost surface, so that the rate of change in conductivity is very small, and substantial resistance change is negligible.","Accordingly, in the transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment, the change in electrical resistance is small. As a result of this, image defects due to the change in electrical resistance caused by repeated use are prevented. Examples of such defects include defective transfer caused by the failure to form an electric field necessary for effectively transferring the toner.","In addition, in the transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment, the particle-free resin region A has a thickness of 0.5 \u03bcm or more and 3 \u03bcm or less, preferably 0.5 \u03bcm or more and 1.5 \u03bcm or less, thereby serving as a protective layer of the belt, and smoothening the belt surface. If the thickness of the particle-free resin region A is too small, it is difficult to prevent the decrease of electrical resistance. On the other hand, if the thickness of the particle-free resin region A is too great, the outermost surface of the belt becomes too insulative, which results in the excessive increase of surface resistance and volume resistance.","The particle-free resin region A and the particle-localized resin region B are preferably arranged in the region from the outermost surface to a depth of approximately 15 \u03bcm (preferably 10 \u03bcm) in the thickness direction. In addition, conductivity of the particle-localized region is five times or more higher, preferably five times or more and 100 times or less, and even more preferably five times or more and 50 times or less in comparison with that of the particle-containing resin region C provided deeper than the range from the outermost surface to a depth of approximately 15 \u03bcm (preferably 10 \u03bcm).","This means that the maximum electric current flowing through the region extending from the outermost surface to a depth of approximately 15 \u03bcm in the thickness direction (that is, the maximum electric current flowing through the particle-localized resin region B) is greater than the maximum electric current flowing through the region provided beyond a depth of approximately 15 \u03bcm in the thickness direction from the outermost surface to the innermost surface (that is, the maximum electric current flowing through the particle-containing resin region C). When the above-described relationship of the conductivity (maximum electric current values) is satisfied, a low surface resistance is achieved while the decrease of volume resistance is prevented.","The presence or absence of the conductive particles  in the particle-free resin region A, particle-localized resin region B, and particle-containing resin region C may be confirmed on the basis of direct observation of the particles contained in a section of the belt, which has been sliced by focused ion beam (FIB), by a transmission electron microscope, or on the basis of height information on a section, which has been sliced by a microtome, obtained with an atomic force microscope (AFM).","The conductivity of the region between the outermost surface and a depth of approximately 15 \u03bcm in the thickness direction and the conductivity of the region provided beyond a depth of approximately 15 \u03bcm in the thickness direction from the outermost surface to the innermost surface are compared on the basis of AFM observation of a belt section, which has been prepared using a microtome, in a conducting mode. Specifically, the maximum current in each regions is measured in a 10 \u03bcm square of a section (sample) of the belt using D3000 and NANOSCOPE III manufactured by Digital Instruments under following conditions of measurement mode: contact mode, cantilever: Au-coated conductive cantilever, spring constant: 0.2 N\/m, and applied voltage: \u22125 V.","The section (sample) of the belt is sliced from the embedded belt using a microtome, a silver paste electrode is bonded in parallel to the sample depth direction, and used as the counter electrode of the cantilever. The belt section (sample) is observed in an area of 10 \u03bcm square, and the electric current value (conductivity) and height information are obtained.","The above-described conditions are only one example and shall not be taken as limiting. The measurement range, applied voltage, and spring constant may be optionally changed according to the belt section (sample).","The maximum current determined by the above-described method is used to compare the electric conductivity.","The transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment is further described below regarding its constituent materials and properties.","Firstly, the resin (hereinafter referred to as resin material) is described.","The Young's modulus of the resin material varies depending on the belt thickness, and is preferably 3500 MPa or more, more preferably 4000 MPa or more so as to exhibit sufficient machine properties of the belt.

Examples of the resin include a polyimide resin, a polyamide resin, a polyamide imide resin, a polyether ether ester resin, a polyarylate resin, a polyester resin, and a reinforced polyester resin.","The Young's modulus is determined by a tensile test in accordance with JIS K 7127 (1999); a tangent is drawn to the curve in the initial strain region of the stress-strain curve obtained, and the Young's modulus is determined from the decline of the tangent. The measurement is carried out under the following conditions of strip specimen (width, 6 mm; length, 130 mm), No. 1 dumbbell, and test speed 500 mm\/minute, and that the thickness is a belt body thickness.","Among the above-described resin materials, a polyimide resin is preferred. Since a polyimide resin is a material having a high Young's modulus, it is less deformed during driving (under stress of a supporting roll or a cleaning blade) than other resins, and thus provides a transfer belt giving less image defects such as mis color registration. A polyimide resin is usually produced by polymerizing equimolar amounts of tetracarboxylic dianhydride or its derivative and a diamine in a solvent to obtain a solution of a polyamic acid.

The viscosity of the polyamic acid solution is not particularly limited, but is usually 1 Pa\u00b7s or more and 500 Pa\u00b7s or less so as to give good processability.","The conductive particles are described below.","The conductive particles may be conductive or semiconductive powder. The conductivity is not particularly limited as long as the belt stably achieves certain electrical resistance. Examples of the conductive particles include ketjen black, acetylene black, carbon black such as oxidized carbon black having a pH of 5 or less, metals such as aluminum or nickel, oxidized metal compounds such as tin oxide, and potassium titanate.

When two or more carbon blacks are used as described above, at least one of them is preferably oxidized carbon black thereby increasing miscibility and dispersibility between the carbon blacks.","The properties of the transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment are described below.","When the transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment is an intermediate transfer belt, the surface resistivity of the outer peripheral surface is preferably 9 (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) or more and 13 (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) or less in terms of common logarithm, and more preferably 10 (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) or more and 12 (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) or less. If the common logarithm of the surface resistivity is greater than 13 (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) after voltage application for 30 msec, the recording medium electrostatically may adsorb to the intermediate transfer belt during secondary transfer, which hinders removal of the recording medium. On the other hand, if the common logarithm of the surface resistivity is less than 9 (Log \u03a9\/\u25a1) after voltage application for 30 msec, the toner image primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer belt may have insufficient retentivity, which results in uneven image graininess or image disorder. The common logarithm of the surface resistivity is controlled by the type and amount of the below-described conductive agent.","The surface resistivity is measured as follows using a circular electrode (for example, trade name: UR PROBE of HIRESTA IP, manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd.) in accordance with JIS K6911. The method for measuring the surface resistivity is described below with reference to drawings.  are a schematic plan view and a schematic cross sectional view of a circular electrode, respectively. The circular electrode shown in  includes a first voltage application electrode A and a plate insulator B. The first voltage application electrode A is provided with a column electrode C and a cylindrical ring electrode D which has an inside diameter greater than the outside diameter of the column electrode C, and surrounds the column electrode C at a certain distance. A belt T is sandwiched between the column electrode C, ring electrode D, and the plate insulator B in the first voltage application electrode A. The electric current I (A) flowing through the belt upon the application of a voltage V (V) between the column electrode C and ring electrode D in the first voltage application electrode A is measured, and the surface resistivity \u03c1s (\u03a9\/\u25a1) of the transfer surface of the belt T is calculated according to the following formula:\n\n\u03c1=\u03c0\u00d7()\/()\u00d7()\n","wherein d (mm) represents the outside diameter of the column electrode C, and D (mm) represents the inside diameter of the ring electrode D.","The surface resistivity is calculated using a circular electrode (trade name: UR PROBE of HIRESTA IP, manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd., outside diameter of column electrode C: 16 mm, inside diameter of ring electrode D: 30 mm, outside diameter of ring electrode D: 40 mm) on the basis of the electric current value after the application of a voltage of 500 V for 10 seconds in a 22\u00b0 C.\/55% RH environment.","When the transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment is an intermediate transfer belt, the entire volume resistivity is preferably 8 (Log \u03a9cm) or more and 13(Log \u03a9cm) or less in terms of common logarithm. If the volume resistivity is less than 8 (Log \u03a9cm) in terms of common logarithm, electrostatic force for keeping the charge of the unfixed toner image transferred from the image holder to the intermediate transfer belt is hardly exerted. As a result of this, the toner may be scattered around the image by the electrostatic repulsive force of toner particles and the fringe electric field near the edges of the image to give an image with a big noise. On the other hand, if the volume resistivity is greater than 13 (Log \u03a9cm) in terms of common logarithm, charge retentivity is so great that the surface of the transfer belt is charged by the transfer electric field formed by the primary transfer, which may result in the necessity for a discharging device. The common logarithm of the volume resistivity is controlled by the type and amount of the below-described conductive agent.","The volume resistivity is measured as follows using a circular electrode (for example, trade name: UR PROBE of HIRESTA IP, manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd.) in accordance with JIS K6911. The method for measuring the volume resistivity is described below with reference to drawings. The measurement uses the same apparatus as that used for the measurement of surface resistivity, except that the circular electrode shown in  includes a second voltage application electrode B\u2032 in place of the plate insulator B for measuring the surface resistivity. A belt T is sandwiched between the column electrode C, ring electrode D, and the second voltage application electrode B\u2032 in the first voltage application electrode A. The electric current I (A) flowing through the belt upon the application of a voltage V (V) between the column electrode C and the second voltage application electrode B in the first voltage application electrode A is measured, and the volume resistivity \u03c1v (\u03a9cm) of the belt T is calculated according to the following formula:\n\n\u03c119.6\u00d7()\u00d7\n","wherein t represents the thickness of the belt T.","The volume resistivity is calculated using a circular electrode (trade name: UR PROBE of HIRESTA IP, manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd., outside diameter of column electrode C: 16 mm, inside diameter of ring electrode D: 30 mm, outside diameter of ring electrode D: 40 mm) on the basis of the electric current value after the application of a voltage of 500 V for 10 seconds in a 22\u00b0 C.\/55% RH environment.","The value 19.6 in the above formula is an electrode coefficient for converting into resistivity, and is calculated as \u03c0d\/4t from the outside diameter d (mm) of the column electrode and the sample thickness t (cm). The thickness of the belt T is measured using an eddy current-type film thickness meter (trade name: CTR-1500E, manufactured by Sanko Electronic Laboratory Co., Ltd.).","The method for manufacturing a transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment is described below.  is a process chart showing the method for manufacturing a transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment.","In the method for manufacturing the transfer belt  according to the present exemplary embodiment, firstly, a coating liquid containing the conductive particles , a resin material, and a solvent is prepared. As shown in , the coating liquid is applied to a cylindrical die  to form a coating film  of the coating liquid.","The method for applying the coating liquid to the cylindrical die  is not particularly limited. For example, the outer peripheral surface is immersed in the coating liquid, the coating liquid is applied to the inner peripheral surface, the coating liquid is applied to the inner peripheral surface, followed by rotation of the die, or the coating liquid is charged into an injection die thereby forming an endless coating film . Before the belt formation, it is preferred that the die be treated with a releasing agent.","For example, a polyamic acid solution containing dispersed carbon black (conductive particles) is prepared as the coating liquid, but not limited to this. Firstly, purified carbon black is dispersed in an organic polar solvent. It is preferred that preliminary stirring be carried out before dispersion with a disperser or homogenizer. As is the case with the purification of carbon black, contamination with fine media deteriorates the purity of carbon black. Therefore, the dispersion method preferably uses no medium, and is particularly preferably a jet mill capable of dispersing while preventing the unevenness of a high viscosity solution.","The above-described diamine and acid anhydride components are dissolved and polymerized in the dispersion liquid of carbon black obtained as described above, thereby preparing a polyamic acid solution containing dispersed carbon black. At that time, the monomer concentration (the total concentration of the diamine and acid anhydride components in the solvent) is established according to various conditions, but is preferably 5% by weight or more and 30% by weight or less. The reaction temperature is preferably 80\u00b0 C. or less, particularly preferably 5\u00b0 C. or more and 50\u00b0 C. or less. The reaction period is 5 hours or more and 10 hours or less.","The polyamic acid solution containing dispersed carbon black is a highly viscous solution, so that the bubbles included during preparation will not naturally disappear, but cause defects such as projections, depressions, or holes in the belt upon application of the solution. Therefore the solution is preferably subjected to deaeration. Therefore, deaeration is preferably carried out immediately before the application of the solution.","Subsequently, the coating film  applied to the cylindrical die  is dried. The drying operation is carried out such that the proportion of residual solvent in the coating film  is 25% or less, preferably 20% or less, and more preferably 15% or less. If the proportion of residual solvent in the coating film  is too high, the below-described localization (increase of density) of the conductive particles  hardly occurs. The lower the proportion of residual solvent, the more readily the below-described localization (increase of density) of the conductive particles  occurs. The control of the proportion of residual solvent in the coating film , or the dry state of the coating film  allows the control of the below-described degree of localization (congestion) of the conductive particles , and the location of the region containing localized conductive particles  (particle-localized resin layer B) in the thickness direction of the transfer belt  to be produced.","The proportion of residual solvent refers to the proportion of the solvent weight remaining in the dried coating film with reference to the solvent weight contained in the coating liquid to be applied. The proportion of residual solvent is determined as described below.","For example, when the weight of the solid resin material (dry weight of resin material) and the weight of the functional particles are known, the total weight of the undried coating film is accurately measured, whereby the solvent weight contained in the total weight of the coating film is calculated. Then, the total weight of the dried coating film is accurately measured, the decrement is calculated as the weight of dissipated solvent by the formula: (weight of undried coating film\u2212weight of dried coating film)\/(weight of undried coating film\u2212weight of solid resin\u2212weight of functional particles), thereby determining the proportion of residual solvent.","The proportion of residual solvent may be determined using a thermal extraction gas chromatograph-mass spectrograph. An example of the measurement is described below. For example, a portion of the dried coating film is cut out with a weight of about 2 mg or more and 3 mg or less to make a sample, the sample is weighed, and heated to 400\u00b0 C. in a thermal extraction apparatus (trade name: PY2020D, manufactured by Frontier Laboratories Ltd.). The volatile components are injected into a gas chromatograph-mass spectrograph by way of an interface at 320\u00b0 C. (trade name: GCMS-QP2010, manufactured by Shimadzu Co., Ltd.), and the quantity is determined. More specifically, helium gas as a carrier gas is injected in an amount of 1\/51 (split ratio, 50:1) of the amount of evaporation from the sample into a column (trade name: capillary column UA-5, manufactured by Frontier Laboratories Ltd.) having an inside diameter of 0.25 \u03bcm and a length of 30 m at a linear velocity of 153.8 cm\/second (carrier gas flow rate of 1.50 ml\/minute and pressure of 50 kPa at column temperature of 50\u00b0 C.). The column is kept at 50\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, and then the column temperature is increased to 400\u00b0 C. at a ratio of 8\u00b0 C.\/minute, and the temperature is kept for 10 minutes, thereby desorbing the volatile components. Further, the volatile components are injected into the mass spectrograph at an interface temperature of 320\u00b0 C., and the peak area corresponding to the solvent is determined. The quantitative determination is carried out on the basis of an analytical curve prepared using the same solvent in known amounts. The determined solvent weight is divided by the weight of the dried sample, thereby calculating the proportion of residual solvent. The above-described procedure of measurement is one example, and the conditions may be changed according to the temperature at which the resin is decomposed or changed, or the boiling point of the solvent.","Then, as shown in , an eluting solvent  for eluting the resin material is applied to the surface of the dried coating film . In the region coated with the eluting solvent , the eluting solvent  permeates through the dried coating film  to swell the region below the coated surface of the coating film . At this time, the amount of the eluting solvent  on the coated surface of the coating film  is greater, that is, the solvent concentration is higher than that in the region below the coated surface of the coating film , so that the resin material is more readily eluted into the portion of the eluting solvent  on the coated surface of the coating film .","As shown in , since the conductive particles  will not dissolve in the eluting solvent , the density of the conductive particles  in the region where the resin materials has dissolved increases with the elution of the resin material and becomes greater than that in the other regions. As a result, a region containing the conductive particles  in a localized state is formed. In , A represents the region where the conductive particles  are localized.","The eluting solvent is described.","The eluting solvent  is used for eluting the resin material. Therefore, the eluting solvent is selected from solvents which dissolve the resin material. When a solvent dissolves a resin material, it means that 10 wt % or more of the resin solid content is soluble in the solvent at 25\u00b0 C.","The eluting solvent is preferably the same solvent with that contained in the coating liquid. For example, when the coating liquid is a polyamic acid solution, the solvent may be a polar solvent. Preferred examples of the polar solvent include N,N-dialkylamides, and specific examples thereof include low molecular dialkylamides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N,N-diethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylmethoxyacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphortriamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, pyridine, tetramethylene sulfone, and dimethyltetramethylene sulfone. These compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof.","The coating weight of the eluting solvent  is, for example, 0.001 g\/cmor more and 1 g\/cmor less, preferably 0.01 g\/cmor more and 1 g\/cmor less, and more preferably 0.01 g\/cmor more and 0.5 g\/cmor less.","The eluting solvent  is applied by the method used for applying the coating liquid containing the conductive particles  and the resin material.","Thereafter, as shown in , the eluting solvent  applied to the surface of the coating film  is dried. The eluting solvent should be dried such that the proportion of residual solvent is, for example, 10% or less. The proportion of residual solvent is selected in accordance with, for example, the type of the resin material to be used, the intended use of the resin film produced, and the strength and maintainability of the resin film produced.","As described above, the eluting solvent  contains the resin material in a dissolved state. Therefore, the resin material deposits on drying of the eluting solvent , and forms a layer on the region containing the conductive particles  in a localized state. The eluting solvent  is free or contains the conductive particles  in a lower amount than other region, so that a particle-free resin layer A containing no conductive particles  is formed on the region containing the conductive particles  in a localized state. Then, a particle-localized resin layer B containing the conductive particles  in a localized state is formed below the particle-free resin layer A, and a particle-containing resin layer C containing the conductive particles  at a lower density is formed below the particle-localized resin layer B. The particle-free resin layer A normally contains no particle, but may contain some particles migrated from the conductive particles  into the eluting solvent .","Through the above-described process, the transfer belt  including the three regions having different particle densities (particle-free resin region A, particle-localized resin region B, and particle-containing resin region C) is obtained.","When the resin material is a resin precursor such as a polyimide resin (polyamic acid solution), the eluting solvent  is dried, and then calcined to produce the transfer belt . The calcination, more specifically conversion of polyamide into imide is usually carried out at a high temperature of 200\u00b0 C. or more. If the temperature is below 200\u00b0 C., sufficient imide conversion will not be achieved. On the other hand, high temperature treatment favors imide conversion, and provides stable properties. However, the use of heat energy deteriorates thermal efficiency and increases the cost, so that the heat treatment temperature must be selected in consideration of the properties and productivity of the transfer belt.","(Transfer Unit)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0134"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["130","101","101","131","132","101","101","101","130","101","131","132"]},"(Image Forming Apparatus)","The image forming apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment includes an image holder; a charging unit that charges the surface of the image holder; a latent image forming unit that forms a latent image on the surface of the image holder; a development unit that develops the latent image with a toner into a toner image; a transfer unit that transfers the toner image to a recording medium; and a fixing unit that fixes the toner image on the recording medium, the transfer unit having a transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment.","More specifically, the image forming apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment may include a transfer unit composed of an intermediate transfer belt, a primary transfer unit that primarily transfers the toner image formed on the image holder to the intermediate transfer belt, and a secondary transfer unit that secondarily transfers the toner image from the intermediate transfer belt to a recording medium, the intermediate transfer belt being the transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment.","Alternatively the image forming apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment may include a transfer unit composed of a conveyor\/transfer belt that carries a recording medium, and a transfer device that transfers the toner image formed on the image holder to the recording medium transferred by the conveyor\/transfer belt, the transfer belt that carries the recording medium being the transfer belt according to the present exemplary embodiment.","The image forming apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment may be, for example, an ordinary monocolor image forming apparatus composed of a development device containing a single color toner, a color image forming apparatus wherein toner images held on an image holder are sequentially subjected to primary transfer to an intermediate transfer belt, or a tandem type color image forming apparatus wherein plural image holders having different color developing devices are arranged in tandem on an intermediate transfer belt.","The image forming apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment is further described below with reference to drawings.  is a schematic structural view showing an image forming apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment.  is a schematic structural view showing an image forming apparatus according to another exemplary embodiment.  shows an image forming apparatus including an intermediate transfer belt, and  shows an image forming apparatus including a recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt.","The image forming apparatus shown in  includes first to fourth image forming units Y, M, C, and K on electrographic system for outputting yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K) color images according to the color-decomposed image data.

The bias power supplies are controlled by a control unit (not shown) to vary the transfer bias to be applied to the primary transfer rolls.","The action of forming an yellow image in the first unit Y is described below. Firstly, previous to the action, the surface of the photoreceptor Y is charged to a potential of about \u2212600 V or more and \u2212800 V or less by the charging roll Y.","The photoreceptor Y is formed on a conductive substrate (volume resistivity at 20\u00b0 C.: 1\u00d710\u03a9cm or less) as a laminate of photosensitive layers. The photosensitive layer normally has high resistance (resistance equivalent to that of common resins), and has the property of changing the specific resistance of the area irradiated with the laser beam Y. On this account, the laser beam Y is emitted to the surface of the charged photoreceptor Y via the exposure device  according to the image data for yellow transmitted from the control unit (not shown). The laser beam Y is radiated to the photosensitive layer on the surface of the photoreceptor Y, thereby an electrostatically charged image of yellow printing pattern is formed on the surface of the photoreceptor Y.","An electrostatically charged image is an image formed by charging on the surface of the photoreceptor Y, and is a so-called negative latent image formed as follows: irradiation with the laser beam Y decreases the specific resistance of the photosensitive layer in the irradiated area, thereby the electrified charges on the surface of the photoreceptor Y pass through, while electric charges remain in the area which has not irradiated with the laser beam Y to form an image.","The electrostatically charged image formed on the photoreceptor Y as described above is rotated to the predetermined development position along with the traveling of the photoreceptor Y. Then, at the development position, the electrostatically charged image on the photoreceptor Y is developed into a visible image (developed image) by the development device Y.","The development device Y accommodates, for example, an yellow toner. The yellow toner is friction-charged by being stirred in the development device Y to have an electric charge having the same polarity (negative polarity) with the electrified charge on the photoreceptor Y, and is held on the developer roll (developer holder). Then the surface of the photoreceptor Y passes through the development device Y, thereby the yellow toner electrostatically adheres to the discharged latent image area on the surface of the photoreceptor Y, and the latent image is developed by the yellow toner. The photoreceptor Y having the yellow toner image keeps traveling at a predetermined rate, and the toner image developed on the photoreceptor Y is carried to a predetermined primary transfer position.","When the yellow toner image on the photoreceptor Y is carried to the primary transfer, a predetermined primary transfer bias is applied to a primary transfer roll Y, and an electrostatic force from the photoreceptor Y toward the primary transfer roll Y is exerted on the toner image, thereby the toner image on the photoreceptor Y is transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt . The applied transfer bias has a positive polarity opposite to the negative polarity of the toner, and for example, in the first unit Y, the bias is controlled by the control unit (not shown) to about +10 \u03bcA.","The toner remaining on the photoreceptor Y is removed and collected by the cleaning device Y.","Further, the primary transfer bias applied to primary transfer rolls M, C, and K in the second unit M and afterward is also controlled in the same manner as in the first unit.","In this manner, the yellow toner image is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt  in the first unit Y, and the intermediate transfer belt  is sequentially carried through the second to fourth units M, C, and K, wherein the toner images of each color are transferred to the belt in layers.","Through the first to fourth units, four color toner images are transferred in layers to the intermediate transfer belt , and the intermediate transfer belt  comes to a secondary transfer part composed of the intermediate transfer belt , the supporting roll  in contact with the inner surface of the intermediate transfer belt , and a secondary transfer roll (secondary transfer unit)  arranged on the intermediate transfer belt  at the image supporting side. A recording medium P is fed at a predetermined time via a feeding mechanism to the gap where the secondary transfer roll  and the intermediate transfer belt  are pressed against each other under pressure, and a predetermined secondary transfer bias is applied to the supporting roll . At that time, the applied transfer bias has the same polarity (\u2212) with the polarity of the toner (\u2212), thereby an electrostatic force from the intermediate transfer belt  toward the recording medium P is exerted on the toner image, and the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt  is transferred onto the recording medium P. The secondary transfer bias is determined according to the resistance detected by a resistance detection means (not shown) for detecting the resistance in the secondary transfer part, and is subjected to voltage control.","Subsequently the recording medium P is sent to a fixing device (fixing unit) , the toner image is heated, and the multicolored toner image is melted and fixed on the recording medium P. The recording medium P on which the fixing of the color image has been completed is carried toward an ejection part, thus the process of color image formation is finished.","In the above-described image forming apparatus, a toner image is transferred to the recording medium P via the intermediate transfer belt . Alternatively, the toner image may be transferred to the recording medium P directly from the photoreceptor.","In the image forming apparatus shown in , the image forming units Y, M, C, and BK include photoreceptor drums Y, M, C, and BK, respectively, the photoreceptor drums being rotatable in a clockwise direction shown by the arrow at a certain peripheral speed (process speed). The photoreceptor drums Y, M, C, and BK are surrounded by charging rolls Y, M, C, and BK, exposure devices Y, M, C, and BK, development devices for each color (yellow development device Y, magenta development device M, cyan development device C, and black development device BK), and photoreceptor drum cleaning members Y, M, C, and BK, respectively.","The four image forming units Y, M, C, and BK are arranged in parallel to a recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt , the image forming units BK, C, M, and Y in this order. The image forming units Y, M, C, and BK may be appropriately changed according to the image formation method.","The recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt  is stretched by belt supporting rolls , , , and  from the inner surface side, thereby forming a transfer unit for an image forming apparatus. The recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt  is rotatable in a counterclockwise direction shown by the arrow at the same peripheral speed with the photoreceptor drums Y, M, C, and BK, and is arranged so as to be partially in contact with the photoreceptor drums Y, M, C, and BK between the belt supporting rolls  and . The recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt  is provided with a belt cleaning member .","Transfer rolls Y, M, C, and BK are arranged in contact with the inner surface of the recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt  so as to oppose the photoreceptor drums Y, M, C, and BK, respectively. The transfer rolls Y, M, C, and BK and the photoreceptor drums Y, M, C, and BK form a transfer region for transferring a toner image to a recording medium  via the recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt . The transfer rolls Y, M, C, and BK may be located immediately below the photoreceptor drums Y, M, C, and BK, or deviated from the points immediately below the drums.","A fixing device  is arranged such that a recording medium  is carried thereto after traveling through the transfer regions between the recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt  and the photoreceptor drums Y M, C, and BK.","The recording medium  is carried by a recording medium conveyor roll  to the recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt .","In the image forming unit BK, the photoreceptor drum BK is rotated. The charging roll BK is driven in synchronization with the photoreceptor drum BK, whereby the surface of the photoreceptor drum BK is charged to have a certain polarity and electric potential. The photoreceptor drum BK having a charged surface is then exposed imagewise by the exposure device BK, whereby an electrostatic latent image is formed on the surface.","Subsequently, the electrostatic latent image is developed by the black development device BK, whereby a toner image is formed on the surface of the photoreceptor drum BK. The developer used herein may be of one-component or two-component type.","When the toner image travels through the transfer region between the photoreceptor drum BK and the recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt , the recording medium  is electrostatically adsorbed to the recording medium conveyor\/transfer belt  and carried to the transfer region, and then transferred to the surface of the recording medium  in turn by the electric field formed by the transfer bias applied by the transfer roll BK.","Thereafter, the toner remaining on the photoreceptor drum BK is removed by the photoreceptor drum cleaning member BK. Then, the photoreceptor drum BK sets about the next image transfer.","The above-described image transfer is carried out also in the image forming units C, M, and Y in the same manner.","The recording medium  having a toner image transferred by the transfer rolls BK, C, M, and Y is carried to the fixing device , where the toner image is fixed.","Through the above process, an image is formed on the recording medium.","The present invention is further described below with reference to examples, but the invention will not limited to these examples.","Firstly, carbon black (trade name: SPECIAL BLACK 4, manufactured by Evonik Degussa Japan) is added at a solid weight ration of 8% by weight to a solution of polyamic acid in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (trade name: U IMIDE KX, manufactured by Unitika, Ltd., solid concentration: 20% by weight) containing biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and p-phenylenediamine (PDA), and the mixture is dispersed (200 N\/mm, five times) using a jet mill disperser (trade name: GEANUS PY, manufactured by Geanus Co.).

Thereafter, the coating film is dried under heating at 125\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes, thus obtaining a dried coating film. The proportion of residual solvent in the dried coating film is 14%.","Thereafter, a punched metal plate having holes with a diameter of 0.5 mm arranged at a pitch of 1 mm is brought into intimate contact with the dried coating film, and then coated with an NMP solvent (coating weight: 0.1 g\/cm), thereby applying the NMP solvent to the dried coating film in the form of dots. The SUS plate is allowed to stand in this state for 15 minutes, heated at 165\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes to dry the applied NMP solution, and then calcined at 250\u00b0 C., thus producing a polyimide resin film.","A polyimide resin film is produced in the same manner as in Example 2, except that calcination is carried out at 250\u00b0 C. without the application of the NMP solution to the dried coating film.","(Evaluation 2)","The volume resistivity and surface resistivity of the polyimide resin films produced in Example 2 and Comparative Example 2 are measured.","The polyimide resin film produced in Example 2 has a surface resistivity of 11.0 Log \u03a9 at the surface coated with the NMP solution, and a volume resistivity of 7.2 Log \u03a9, indicating that the film has anisotropic conductivity.","On the other hand, the polyimide resin film produced in Comparative Example 2 has a surface resistivity of 11.4 Log \u03a9, a volume resistivity of 10.5 Log \u03a9, indicating that the film has no anisotropic conductivity.","These results suggest that the polyimide resin film produced in Example 2 has anisotropic conductivity, and is useful as an anisotropic conductive film.","The surface resistivity and volume resistivity are measured by the methods described in the second exemplary embodiment on the basis of .","Firstly, carbon black (trade name: SPECIAL BLACK 4, manufactured by Evonik Degussa Japan) is added at a solid weight ration of 8% by weight to a solution of polyamic acid in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (trade name: U IMIDE KX, manufactured by Unitika, Ltd., solid concentration: 20% by weight) containing biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and p-phenylenediamine (PDA), and the mixture is dispersed (200 N\/mm, five times) using a jet mill disperser (trade name: GEANUS PY, manufactured by Geanus Co.).
