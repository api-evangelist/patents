File classification information may or may not be stored in the file itself. For example, file classification data for a particular file may be stored as metadata or tags in the particular file or file classification data may be stored in cloud-based storage, database storage, a file system Alternate Data Stream (ADS), or other external storage. File classification information may be useful for backup, archive, and other purposes. However, when a file is attached to an email, file classification information may be lost. For example, an archive management application may not have access to file classification information for an email attachment when the file classification information is stored in cloud-based storage, database storage, a file system Alternate Data Stream (ADS), or other external storage, because such external file classification information may not be included in the email or the attachment. Furthermore, even when file classification information for an email attachment is stored in the email attachment itself, access to the file classification information may be lost. For example, different applications may store file classification information in different formats and\/or different locations within a file, so an application attempting to access file classification information may not know how to access it.","In view of the foregoing, it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with current file classification information retention technologies.","Techniques for file classification information retention are disclosed.

As illustrated, one or more portions of file classification information retention module may reside at a network centric location. For example, server A may be a server, a firewall, a gateway, or other network element that may perform one or more actions to retain file classification information. According to some embodiments, network  may be an external network (e.g., the Internet) and server A may be a gateway or firewall between one or more internal components and clients and the external network.","File classification information retention module  may detect attachment of a file to an email, an instant message, a web posting, or other electronic communication. File classification information retention module  may analyze an attachment and\/or external data for to identify file classification information. For example, according to one or more embodiments, file classification information may be stored using Microsoft's File Classification Infrastructure\u2122 (FCI). In such embodiments, file classification information may be retrieved from an attachment using a FCI Application Programming Interface (API).","According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may retrieve file classification information whether the file classification information is internal to the file or external to the file. For example, file classification information retention module  may use an API or other method to retrieve classification information stored in a file itself. File classification information retention module  may have information identifying a format, location, and other access information for file classification information based on a file type or other attributes. For example, a certain file type may store file classification information such as, for example, file classification tags or metadata in the same place and the same format for every file (e.g., a file type of \u201cxyz\u201d may store file classification tags in a specific field header of a file in XML format, a second file type may use an ordered list or a string to store classification information). File classification information retention module  may contain a lookup table or other data structure mapping one or more file attributes (e.g., a file type) with access information permitting retrieval of file classification information. According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may receive access information (e.g., a data structure\/format of file classification information, a location, and\/or parsing or retrieval instructions) from an external source. According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may use an API to transparently access file classification information in one or more locations.","File classification information retention module  may retrieve file classification information for an email attachment from storage external to the email. For example, storage external to the email may include or more of cloud-based storage, database storage, and a file system Alternate Data Stream (ADS).","File classification information retention module  may retrieve file classification information at one or more times. File classification information retention module  may retrieve file classification information as soon attachment of a file to an email is detected, insertion of a file into an instant message is detected, insertion of a file into a web posting is detected, or insertion of a file into another form of electronic communication is detected. Capturing file classification information while an original source file is being attached or inserted into a communication may preserve file classification information that may otherwise be lost. For example, file classification information for a document that is stored using Microsoft's FCI\u2122 may be lost when a document is attached as an email. Thus, detection of an attachment and capturing of classification information may prevent such loss.","According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may determine whether to extract file classification information for the email attachment. The determination may be based at least in part on a determination of whether an email attachment type is a file type for which file classification information is stored internal to the email attachment or external to the email attachment. For example, some email attachments may use Microsoft's FCI\u2122 to store classification information. Microsoft's FCI\u2122 may store classification information internal to a document being classified when the document is a Microsoft Office\u2122 document type (e.g., Microsoft Word\u2122, Powerpoint\u2122, etc.) Microsoft's FCI may, by default, store file classification information externally (e.g., in a file system Alternate Data Stream (ADS)) for other file types. Thus, file classification information retention module  may be able to determine based on a file type that classification data is internally stored. According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may retrieve file classification information when an attachment or insertion of a file in an electronic communication is detected and when the file type is a type which may not store file classification information in the attachment.","Retrieved file classification information may be stored by file classification information retention module  in one or more locations so that such information is accessible for later use. For example, file classification information retention module  may store file classification information in Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) properties of the email. According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may store file classification information in other locations such as a database and\/or network accessible storage.","According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may defer retrieval of file classification information if it is known that such information may be retrieved later. For example, file classification information retention module  may detect an email attachment, determine that it is a file type that stores classification information internal to the file, a defer retrieval of the file classification information until needed. Document types other than Microsoft Office\u2122 documents may also store classification information internally. For example, third party vendors may use a Microsoft File Classification Infrastructure (FCI) API to store classification information in a file being classified. Additionally, other classification software and\/or systems may provide internal metadata or classification tags.","File classification information may also be stored externally such as, for example, in cloud-based storage, database storage, a file system Alternate Data Stream (ADS), or other electronic storage. According to some embodiments, if file classification information retention module  determines that such classification information is accessible later, retrieval of such information may be deferred. According to some embodiments, location information may be associated with the email or other electronic communication to which the classified file is attached. For example, an email with an attached document may have the location of external classification information inserted into MAPI properties of the email (e.g., a network storage location or address, database information, etc.).","According to one or more embodiments, file classification information for an email attachment may always be extracted and associated with an email (e.g., inserted into MAPI properties of the email).","According to some embodiments, file classification information retention module  may also receive and handle requests for file classification information. For example, an email may be processed by one or more applications which use classification information. Such applications may include, for example, data loss prevention software, anti-virus software, encryption software, archive management software, backup management software, replication software, and indexing software. For example, encryption software may use file classification information to determine a level of encryption to apply to a file. Archive management software may use file classification information to determine whether to store a file in near-line storage, in off-line storage, or on another storage platform. Archive management software may also use file classification information to determine how long to retain a file or whether a file may be expired.
