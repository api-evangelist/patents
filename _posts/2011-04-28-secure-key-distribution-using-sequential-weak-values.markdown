title: Secure key distribution using sequential weak values
abstract: A method is provided for distributing a random list of binary values between first and second parties. The method includes sending photons from the second party into an interferometer at a first beam splitter; performing a first weak measurement on photons as a first pointer result into a first time-ordered list for photons; performing a second weak measurement by the first party on photons that pass through a second beam splitter as being a second pointer result into a second time-ordered list; recording identification for first and second detectors that the photons arrive via a third beam splitter as respective first and second detector registrations for collecting in a third time-ordered list as respective first and second detection lists; determining first and second averages of the respective first and second detection lists; and comparing the averages to verify existence of a non-trivial difference that indicates secure communication status of the element's binary value.

In particular, this invention relates to quantum key distribution using weak measurement of sequentially emitted photons.","Secure communication involves exchange of information between intended communicants, e.g., Alice and Bob, without an eavesdropper, e.g., Eve, from unauthorized interception of the information message. Quantum cryptography represents an example of this process. Such methods include development of conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. Separately, weak measurements of quantum states have been investigated for various purposes.","The earliest conventional QKD protocol involves a method of securely communicating a private key from one party to another for use in onetime pad encryption. This procedure is documented by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in \u201cQuantum Cryptography: Public Key Distribution and Coin Tossing\u201d, at the & , December 1984, and commonly referred to as BB84. See http:\/\/www.research.ibm.com\/people\/b\/bennetc\/bennettc198469790513.pdf for details.","The weak value of an observable of a quantum system at an intermediate time is equally determined by both the initial state of the system and the state resulting from a final projective measurement. In this manner, the weak value contains a signature of the correlations between past and future states of the system. The time-symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics first introduced the concepts of weak measurement and weak values. See Y. Aharonov et al. \u201cHow . . . measurement . . . \u201d, 60 (1988) 1351; Y. Aharonov et al., \u201cProperties of a quantum system . . . \u201d 41 (1990) 11; B. Reznik et al., \u201cOn the time symmetric formulation . . . \u201d, 52 (1995) 2538. While debate continues over the meaning of weak values, their utility has been experimentally demonstrated in many areas, particularly in relation to Hardy's Paradox. See Y. Aharonov et al., \u201cRevisiting Hardy's Paradox . . . \u201d, 301 (2002) 130; K. Yokota et al., \u201cDirect observation . . . \u201d, 11 (2009) 033011; J.

Brunner et al., \u201cMeasuring small longitudinal phase shifts . . . \u201d, 105 (2010) 010405.","Conventional communication methods and systems yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, a communication method is provided for securely transmitting a shared random key between first and second parties. The first party (Alice) has a mirror. The second party (Bob) has an interferometer pair that includes first, second and third beam splitters, and first and second detectors.","The process for various exemplary embodiments include: sending a plurality of photons from Bob into the interferometer at the first beam splitter; performing a first weak measurement on each photon as |11|being a first pointer result; incorporating the first pointer result into a first time-ordered list Lfor each photon; performing a second weak measurement by Alice on each photon that passes through the second beam splitter to the first mirror as |11|being a second pointer result; incorporating the second pointer result into a second time-ordered list Lfor each photon that passes through; recording identification as one of the first and second detectors that each photon arrives via the third beam splitter as respective first and second detector registrations.","The exemplary process further includes: distinguishing the first and second detector registrations into a third time-ordered list F for each photon; collecting the first and second detector registrations from the third time-ordered list F that correspond to the first time-ordered list Las respective first and second detection lists Band B; determining first and second averages of the respective first and second detection lists; and comparing the first and second averages to verify existence of a non-trivial difference that indicates secure communication status.","Additional exemplary embodiments provide a method that further includes: sending by the second party to the first party a transfer list from the second time-ordered list Lin one of an altered form to transmit a \u201c0\u201d and an unaltered form to transmit a \u201c1\u201d, the altered form shifting elements of each the second pointer result; collecting the first and second detector registrations from the third time-ordered list F corresponding to the transfer list as respective third and fourth detection lists Aand A; multiplying respective elements from the first and third detection lists to obtain a first product list R, and from the second and fourth detection lists to obtain a second product list R; and determining third and fourth averages of respective the first and second product lists, such that the \u201c0\u201d sent from the second party corresponds to both the third and fourth averages being zero, and the \u201c1\u201d sent from the second party corresponds to a ratio between the third and fourth averages being minus one.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components, process steps, and\/or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and\/or general purpose machines. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a floating point gate array (FPGA) or other related component.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a secure communication method that utilizes the properties of the sequential weak values of a quantum observable to prevent eavesdropping. Due to the different quantum resource utilized, the exemplary communication protocol potentially has advantages over traditional quantum key distribution (QKD) methods. A fundamentally better tolerance to optical losses represents one very important potential advantage.","This disclosure describes a weak value method to enable communication of a shared secure key between two parties (Alice and Bob) that does not rely on traditional encryption methods, nor the use of conventional QKD methods. This exemplary quantum communication (QC) process remains nevertheless secure against an eavesdropper (Eve). This weak value communication protocol utilizes the properties of quantum systems in a novel manner to enable security. Instead of relying on the no-cloning property as does single photon based QKD, or Bell non-locality as does entanglement based QKD, this exemplary communication protocol utilizes the resource of the temporal non-locality of weak values of a quantum system.","Alice possesses a \u201craw key\u201d list of random binary values. On conclusion of transmitting the raw key's elements, Alice and Bob implement classical information error correction and privacy amplification to distill a smaller shared private key that is secure. These techniques of error correction and privacy amplification are well established in the art. See e.g., C. Bennett et al., \u201cGeneralized Privacy Amplification\u201d, 41 (1995) 1915.","In association with QKD communication protocol, a brief review of the concepts of weak measurement and weak values is presented. Y. Aharonov introduced the notion of the weak value of a quantum mechanical observable over two decades ago (in above citations). This weak value is experimentally obtained from the result of measurements performed upon a pre-selected and post-selected (PPS) ensemble of quantum systems when the interaction between the measurement apparatus and each system is sufficiently weak.","Unlike the standard strong measurement of a quantum mechanical observable, which disturbs the measured system and \u201ccollapses\u201d its state into an eigenstate of the observable, a weak measurement does not appreciably disturb the quantum system, and yields the weak value as the measured value of the observable. This is possible because very little information about the observable is extracted in a single weak measurement. Experimentally determining the weak value requires performing weak measurements on each member of a large ensemble of identical PPS systems and averaging the resulting values.","The standard (i.e., conventional) formulation of quantum mechanics describes a quantum system at a reference time tusing a state evolving from the past to t. The time-symmetric reformulation of quantum mechanics (TSQM), described in Reznik et al., uses also a second state which can be interpreted as a state evolving backward in time from the future to t. The weak values measured at time tare influenced by this post-selected state. Many experiments have verified the surprising and counter-intuitive aspects of weak values, e.g., weak values can lie far outside the associated observable's eigenvalue spectrum and can be complex valued, as reported in the Hardy's paradox references cited above.","Weak measurements can be described using the general von Neumann model of quantum measurement. See the Aharanov references and J. Tollaksen, \u201cPre- and post-selection . . . \u201d, 40 (2007) 9033. Consider an observable \u00c2 (i.e., a quantum physical characteristic subject to observation) pertaining to a quantum system pre-selected to be in the ket state |\u03c8, where \u03c8represents the pre-select wave-function of the vector space. The interaction Hamiltonian Hdescribing the system and measuring device (MD) is the interaction:\n\n()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere {circumflex over (Q)}is the position operator for the MD and g(t) is the interaction's coupling strength.\n","The evolution operator Ufor the system and MD is then given by the relation:\n\n=exp[\u2212\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere the coupling strength g, defined by g=\u222bg(t)dt, is integrated over the interaction time interval 2\u03b5 (from time t\u2212\u03b5 to t+\u03b5). The measurement interaction is weakened by minimizing g\u0394Q. Let the MD's initial state |\u03a6 be a real Gaussian pointer with unit variance in momentum. Then the weakness of the measurement can be established (i.e., set) by setting g<<1, and \u0394Q=1. This enables the following approximation:\n\nexp[\u2212|\u03a6\u2245[1\u2212|\u03a6,\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere |a represents the eigenstate of the operator \u00c2 with eigenvalue a.\n","The final state of the measuring device can be seen to be a superposition of Gaussians in momentum space each of which is shifted by gawhere the aare eigenvalues of \u00c2. Thus, MD is a Gaussian with the mean shifted by g\u00c2. The measurement can be shown to yield \u201cinformation without disturbance\u201d in the limit of vanishing g, by the following process. First, the important result from Tollaksen indicates that:\n\n,\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere \u0394A is the variance of \u00c2, and |\u03a8 is a disturbance state such that \u03a8|\u03a8=0, (i.e., zero probability amplitude for \u03a8 collapsing to \u03a8). This obtains:\n\n[1\u2212=[1\u2212.\u2003\u2003(5)\n","From this one can observe that the probability of the state remains unchanged after the weak measurement interaction constitutes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"mo":"\u2758","msub":{"mi":["\u03c8","in"]}}},{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c8","in"]},"mo":"\u2758"}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"g","mn":"2"},"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"Q","mo":"\u22d2"},"mi":"MD"}},"mn":"2"},{"mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mover":{"mi":"A","mo":"\u22d2"}},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"g","mn":"2"},"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"Q","mo":"\u22d2"},"mi":"MD"}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"A","mo":"\u22d2"},"mn":"2"}}}}]},"mo":"->","mn":"1"}],"mo":"="},{"mrow":{"mi":["as","g"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"->","mn":"0."}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"mo":"\u2758","msub":{"mi":"\u03c8","mrow":{"mi":"in","mo":"\u22a5"}}}},{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c8","mrow":{"mi":"in","mo":"\u22a5"}},"mo":"\u2758"}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msup":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"g","mn":"2"},"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"Q","mo":"\u22d2"},"mi":"MD"}},"mn":"2"},{"mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mi":"\u0394A"},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"g","mn":"2"},"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"Q","mo":"\u22d2"},"mi":"MD"}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"A","mo":"\u22d2"},"mn":"2"}}}}]},"mo":"->","mn":"1"}],"mo":"="},{"mrow":{"mi":["as","g"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"->","mn":"0."}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"7"}}]}}}}},"The probability to disturb the state falls off as g, while the shift in the measurement pointer is only reduced linearly in coupling strength g.

This optical arrangement constitutes a central part of the secure communication protocol.  illustrates the configuration under consideration of a twin Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The left portion MZI #1 is tuned so that all photons entering from the lower side always exit inside the second beam-splitter on the upper side.","In particular,  shows a plan diagram view  of the twin MZI. A source (e.g., a laser beam) emits a photon . The MZI includes three beam splitters ,  and , along with four mirrors , ,  and . In addition, the MCI includes first and second weak measurement devices: WM as  and WM as , as well as first and second detectors: Das  and Das . The photon  reaches the first beam splitter , which directs the photon to either path A through WM  to the first mirror  or else to path B to the second mirror . Reflecting off either the first or second mirrors, the photon reaches the second beam splitter  and in this configuration approaches the third mirror  via path C rather than the fourth mirror  through WM  via path D. Reflecting off the third mirror , the photon reaches the third beam splitter  to either the first or second deflectors , .","In this example, the basis state |0 means that the photon  is on the upper side of the beam splitter and state |1 means the photon  is on the lower side. Therefore, the general state of a photon \u03c8 is represented by:\n\n|\u03c8=\u03b1|0+\u03b2|1,\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are probability coefficients for the upper and lower sides.\n","Weak measurements can be performed of the operator |11| at two different points in time as shown the view .

Similarly for the subset associated with detector D, Bob creates the list A.","Step #.

These processors may be integrated into a unitary device or represent application-specific components devoted to at least one particular task.","Security of the information transmitted to Bob rests on the inability of Eve to infer that Alice has permuted the order of her local weak measurement results that have been transmitted to Bob. Eve lacks any manner even in principle to use only the transmitted list to know the weak measurement because there is no statistical difference between them. Therefore Eve must have more information about the photons than just the (non-post-selected) weak value of |11|.","Also, even in principle, Eve can't know the post-selection information (i.e., at which of the two detectors that each photon arrives) because this is determined and stored locally by Bob. Finally, Eve can't predict these values because each photon is equally likely to arrive at each detector.","Instead, the only action Eve can take is to perform her own pre- and\/or post-selection on each photon as it passes. For instance, Eve can perform non-demolition ideal measurements of |11| on each photon before or after Alice's weak measurement.","In this manner, Alice's weak measurement results can now be placed into two different pre-selection ensembles, yielding different weak values when Eve does not observe a photon and when she does, then:\n\n(|11|)=0\u2003\u2003(36)\n\nand\n\n(|11|)=1,\u2003\u2003(37)\n\nrespectively.\n","If these ensembles are large enough, Eve will be able to distinguish whether or not Alice has permuted her list of weak measurement pointer results. This is because if Alice permutes her results, the weak value that Eve calculates for the two pre-selected ensembles both must equal the expectation value:\n\n|11|.\u2003\u2003(38)\n\nTherefore Eve's task is to accurate measure the average of Alice's pointer results conditioned by not detecting a photon, a, and the average conditioned on detecting a photon a.\n","Now suppose that it takes M photons for Bob to accurately determine the weak value of |11|using his weak measurement results and post-selection information. Because the number of photons N, that Bob must send through the device in order to accurately determine Alice's bit choice is much larger than M, Eve could perform her own pre-selection measurements on each photon and would likely be able to determine the bit from the conditional averages of Alice's pointer results. However, Bob would very easily detect Eve's intervention because her pre-selection measurement along path D would have changed the weak value of his local weak measurement results of |11|.","For details on the effect of which-path measurements on the weak values of an observable equivalent to Bob's, see J. Tollaksen et al., \u201cQuantum interference experiments . . . \u201d, 12 (2010) 013023.
