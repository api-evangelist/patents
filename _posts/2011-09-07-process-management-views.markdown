title: Process management views
abstract: Two different process management views can be displayed, and a user can request to switch between the two views. The user can select a process in either view and have the selected process terminated. One view is a simplified view that identifies processes and whether they are non-responsive. The other view is an expanded view that identifies processes and the amount of various system resources used by each of those processes. Various additional information can be displayed in the expanded view, such as identifiers of various windows, tabs, and/or services associated with each of the processes.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Modern computers typically are able to execute numerous programs in parallel. This can result in various problems, such as reduced computer performance due to the number of programs or behavior of a particular program, reduced performance due to a program no longer operating correctly, reduced performance due to the behavior of multiple processes and their impact on one another, and so forth. To resolve these problems, users sometimes desire to terminate execution of a particular program that does not appear to be the top contributor to a problem in the hopes that freeing up resources will help another program (e.g., which can use those freed resources). However, user interfaces allowing users to terminate programs tend to be overly complicated, which can make it difficult for a user to accurately select the appropriate program to terminate in order to resolve the problem he or she is having.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In accordance with one or more aspects, a first process management view is displayed on a device. The first process management view displays process identifiers of multiple processes on the device, and for each of the multiple processes that is not responding an indication that the process is not responding. A user request to have a second process management view displayed is received. In response to the user request, a second process management view is displayed. The second process management view displays the process identifiers of the multiple processes, for each of the multiple processes that is not responding an indication that the process is not responding, and for each of multiple resources of the device a usage of the resource by each of the multiple processes.","In accordance with one or more aspects, one or more processes running on a device are identified. Additionally, for one of the one or more processes, one or more windows related to the one process are identified. In a first process management view, process identifiers of the one or more processes are displayed, and for each of multiple resources of the device a resource usage by each of the one or more processes is displayed. Additionally, for the one process, in the first process management view identifiers of the one or more windows are displayed as associated with the process identifier of the one process.","Process management views are discussed herein. A user can select from two different process management views, and can readily switch between the two views, thus providing a single place for users to go to solve problems regardless of the skill level of the user. The user can select a process in either view and have the selected process terminated. One view is a simplified view that identifies processes (e.g., as application names) and their status (e.g., whether they are non-responsive). The other view is an expanded view, which is an expanded version of the simplified view that identifies processes, the amount of various resources used by each of those processes, and the status of those processes (e.g., not responsive, waiting for user, suspended, etc.). Identifiers of various windows, tabs, and\/or services associated with each of the processes are also displayed, allowing the user to readily identify what will cease executing if the process is terminated. The expanded view can also include various indicators to assist the user in identifying potential problems, such as color-coding resource usage indications for different processes, highlighting the resource that is most likely to be the cause of slow performance, and so forth. As both novice and expert users typically desire to terminate processes from time to time, but the level of technical understanding differs greatly between novice and expert users, the process management views discussed herein addresses these separate skill levels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100","100"]},"Device  includes a processor , memory , storage device , and network component . Memory  can include volatile memory (e.g., random access memory (RAM)) and\/or nonvolatile memory (e.g., Flash memory). Memory  stores instructions that are executed by processor . Storage device , such as a magnetic disk, solid state (Flash memory) disk, and so forth provides nonvolatile storage for applications and data. Network component  manages communication with other devices via a wired and\/or wireless network.","Memory  includes an operating system  and one or more processes . Various different programs can be run on device  as processes , such as entertainment programs, gaming programs, resource programs, utility programs, productivity programs, and so forth. Operating system  manages running of processes , including launching processes  in response to user requests to run programs, and ceasing execution of processes  in response to user requests to terminate a process. In one or more embodiments, operating system  exposes an application programming interface (API) that can be invoked (e.g., by process management module  discussed below) to terminate a process. An identifier of the process to be terminated is provided as a parameter of the API, and in response operating system  terminates the process.","Operating system  includes a process management module  that obtains information regarding processes  running on device  as well as the resources of device  used by those processes . Process management module  also generates one or more process management views, including a simplified view and an expanded view as discussed in more detail below. These process management views are displayed or otherwise presented by module  via a user interface (UI). Various user inputs can also be provided via the UI using a variety of different input mechanisms, such as by pressing one or more keys of a keypad or keyboard of device , pressing one or more keys of a controller of device , pressing a particular portion of a touchpad or touchscreen of device , making a particular gesture on a touchpad or touchscreen of device , making a particular gesture on a controller of device , providing audible inputs to a microphone, making particular motions of hands or other body parts observed by an image capture component, and so forth. Through these various user inputs a user is able to select a particular button, portion of a display, menu option, and so forth. Although a single process management module  is illustrated in , it should be noted that the functionality of module  can alternatively be separated into multiple modules.","Process management module  displays, in the process management views, identifiers of processes running on device . Process management module  can identify which processes are running on device  in a variety of different manners. In one or more embodiments, process management module  obtains an indication of processes running on device  from another module or component of operating system  that monitors which processes are running on device . In other embodiments, process management module  accesses a database, event log, or other record (e.g., maintained by operating system ) of the processes running on device  and obtains an indication of which processes are running on device  from this database, event log, or other record. A process running on device  refers to a process that has begun executing but has not been terminated or otherwise closed. Thus, a process can be running even though malfunctioning and not being executed, even though suspended or otherwise not scheduled for execution by processor , and so forth.","Typically, process management module  generates and displays a process management view in response to a user input requesting that the process management view be displayed. Alternatively, process management module  can generate and display a process management view in response to a variety of different events, such as a request from another component or module of device . In one or more embodiments, process management module  maintains a default management view and initially displays the default view when displaying a process management view. The default view is the most recently displayed one of the simplified view and the expanded view. Thus, if a user inputs a request to switch from displaying the simplified view to displaying the expanded view, module  maintains the expanded view as the default view. Accordingly, the next time process management module  displays a process management view, module  initially displays the expanded view.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","200","200","202","202"]},"Adjacent to list of identifiers  is list of status indications . Each status indication  corresponds to one of identifiers , and indicates the status of the process identified by the corresponding identifier. In one or more embodiments, the status is an indication that the process is running normally (e.g., having a value of \u201cok\u201d or being left blank) or that the process is not running normally (e.g., having a value of \u201cnot responding\u201d). Thus, in the example of , it can be seen that \u201cProcess C\u201d is not running normally, and that the other processes are running normally. Alternatively, various other status indications could be included as status indications , such as \u201csuspended\u201d to indicate that the process is not being scheduled for execution, \u201cwaiting for a user\u201d to indicate that the process is waiting for input from a user before proceeding, and so forth.","The status (e.g., running normally or not responding) can be determined by process management module  of  in a variety of different manners. In one or more embodiments, process management module  obtains an indication of the status of processes from another module or component of the operating system that monitors the status of the processes running on the device. In other embodiments, process management module  accesses a database, event log, or other record (e.g., maintained by the operating system) of the processes and their status and obtains the identification of the status of the various processes from this database, event log, or other record. In other embodiments, process management module  queries each process, requesting a response from the process. If the process does not return a response then the process is determined to be not responding, if the process responds by displaying a dialog requesting user input then the process is determined to be waiting for a user, and if the process returns a different response (rather than displaying a dialog requesting user input) then the process is determined to be responding.","In one or more embodiments, a user can select a process to terminate by providing a user input selecting the identifier of the process and then selecting an end task or end process button . Alternatively, the user can select a process to terminate based on simplified process management view  in a variety of other manners. For example, a user input double-tapping or double-clicking on a process identifier  can be a user input requesting that that process identifier  be terminated, a menu can be displayed in response to a user input selecting a process identifier  and a user input selecting a menu option to terminate the process can be received, and so forth. In response to a user request to terminate a process, the process management module (e.g., process management module  of ) terminates the process.","Additionally, from simplified process management view  a user can request to view an expanded process management view in which additional details regarding resource usage in the device are displayed. A user request for the expanded process management view to be displayed can be received by the user selecting a more details or expanded view button . Alternatively, the user can request to view the expanded process management view by providing other inputs, such as by selecting a menu item, selecting an icon, and so forth. In response to a user request to view an expanded process management view, simplified process management view  is replaced by an expanded process management view.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","302","202","302","304","204","304","300","300"]},"Expanded process management view  includes an end task or end process button  that can be used to terminate a process analogous to button  of . Alternatively, a process to be terminated can be selected in other manners analogous to the discussion above regarding simplified process management view .","Additionally, from expanded process management view  a user can request to view a simplified process management view (e.g., simplified process management view  of ). A user request to view the simplified process management view can be received by the user selecting a fewer details or simplified view button . Alternatively, the user can request to view the simplified process management view by providing other inputs, such as by selecting a menu item, selecting an icon, and so forth. In response to a user request to view a simplified process management view, expanded process management view  is replaced by a simplified process management view. Thus, the user can quickly switch back and forth between the simplified process management view and the expanded process management by requesting to view the appropriate one of the expanded process management view or simplified process management view.","In addition to status indications , expanded process management view  includes an indication of resource usage by each of the processes. This indication of resource usage can be an amount of resource usage and\/or other indications as discussed in more detail below. Generally, a resource refers to a hardware, software, and\/or firmware component of the device. For example, resources can include the processor or CPU of the device (e.g., processor  of ), memory of the device (e.g., memory  of ), disk (or other storage device) input\/output (I\/O) for the device (e.g., storage device  of ), and a network component (e.g., network component  of ). The usage of the processor resource refers to how much of the processing capacity of the processor is being used by the process (e.g., how much processor time the process is scheduled for). The usage of the memory resource refers to how much of the memory of the device is being used by the process (e.g., how much memory is allocated to the process, how much physical memory is being used by the process, how much memory is in a reference set of the process, and so forth). The usage of the disk I\/O refers to an amount of data input to and\/or output from the storage device by the process. The usage of the network refers to an amount of data sent and\/or received via the network component by the process. Although resource usage for four different types of resources is discussed herein, it should be noted that resource usage for one or more of these types of resources may not be displayed. Additionally, it should be noted that resource usage for additional types of resources can also be displayed.","The resource usage can be displayed using the same data units for all resources. For example, resource usage can be displayed as a percentage of the particular resource, such as a percentage of resource capacity used (e.g., a percentage of the total available processor time), a percentage of the amount of the resource being used (e.g., a percentage of the total amount of data input to and\/or output from the storage device by all processes, and so forth). Alternatively, different data units can be used for different resources with the particular data unit for a resource being dependent on the resource. For example, the data unit can be a percentage of the particular resource for the processor resource, a number of bytes for the memory resource, a number of bytes per second for the disk resource I\/O resource, and a number of bits per second for the network resource. Additionally, data units can be scaled as appropriate (e.g., can show Kilobytes (KB), Megabytes (MB), Gigabytes (GB), and so forth as appropriate).","The resource usages are displayed in columns along with the list of process identifiers  and the list of status indications . Accordingly, included in expanded process management view  are processor (CPU) usage list , memory usage list , disk I\/O usage list , and network usage list . Thus, for example, it can be readily seen from expanded process management view  that program C is using 19% of the processor resource, 92 Megabytes (MB) of the memory resource, 2 Megabytes per second (MB\/s) of the disk I\/O resource, and 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) of the network resource.","The usage of each resource by each process can be determined in a variety of different manners. In one or more embodiments, the operating system (e.g., operating system  of ) includes one or more modules that track an amount of each resource used by each process. In such embodiments, process management module  obtains the amounts of resource usage by each process from these one or more modules. Alternatively, the usage of each resource by each process can be determined in other manners. For example, each individual resource or manager of the resource (e.g., processor scheduler, memory manager, disk controller, network controller, etc.) may track the amounts of usage of that resource by each process, and process management module can obtain the amounts of resource usage by each process from these individual resources or resource managers.","Regardless of how the amounts of resource usage are determined, the received amounts themselves can be displayed or alternatively used to calculate the value that is displayed. For example, process management module  can employ a rolling average technique in which the amount displayed at any given time is dependent on the amounts received over a previous period of time (e.g., 3 or 5 seconds).","A set of headings  are also displayed for processor usage list , memory usage list , disk I\/O usage list , and network usage list . Headings  include a heading for each resource, and for each resource identify an overall amount of usage of the resource by all (or greater than a threshold number of) processes running on the device. For example, the heading  for disk I\/O usage list  indicates that the overall usage of the disk I\/O resource by the running processes is 9% of the disk I\/O resource capacity. The resource usage in headings  can be displayed using the same data units for all resources or different data units for different resources analogous to the discussion above regarding the display of resource usage in lists -.","The overall resource usages identified in headings  can be determined in a variety of different manners. In one or more embodiments, the operating system (e.g., operating system  of ) includes one or more modules that track an amount of each resource used, and process management module  obtains the amounts of resource usage from these one or more modules. Alternatively, the overall resource usages can be determined in other manners, such as by adding together the resource usages by the various processes. The determined resource usage amounts themselves can be displayed or alternatively used to calculate the value that is displayed (e.g., using a rolling average technique).","In one or more embodiments, in addition to displaying the amount of resource usage for each of the processes, different resource usages can be color-coded to indicate how much of a resource is being used by a process. This color-coding can be a heat map, which is a graphical representation of data where the values taken by a variable are represented as \u201cintensities\u201d (a combination of decreasing luminosity and increasing saturation). This can be visually manifested by different colors or shades. The use of a heat map allows for quick visual identification of resources and which applications are having the most or least impact on the resources.","The different colors for this color-coding can be, for example, different intensities of a similar color (e.g., orange or red), with more intense colors indicating higher usage than less intense colors. These different colors can be used in different ways, such as displaying the amounts of resource usage for each process in these different colors, highlighting the amounts of resource usage for each process using these different colors, surrounding (e.g., in a table cell) the amounts of resource usage for each process using these different colors, and so forth.","Table I illustrates an example of color intensities that can be used for different resource usage amounts. In the example of Table I, resource usage amounts are determined as a percentage of resource capacity used, and lower numbered intensities are less intense than higher numbered intensities (e.g., intensity 1 is less intense than intensity 5). The difference in intensities between different intensity values is typically non-linear, but can alternatively be linear. For example, the difference in intensity between intensity 1 and intensity 2 can be the same as the difference in intensity between intensity 6 and intensity 7, or the differences can be different (e.g., the difference in intensity between intensity 1 and intensity 2 may be less than the difference in intensity between intensity 6 and intensity 7). It should be noted that Table I is an example of color intensities that can be used, but that any number of intensities can be used, any level of granularity can be used, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["% of Resource Capacity Used","Intensity"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u20030","Intensity 1"]},{"entry":["1-9","Intensity 2"]},{"entry":["10-19","Intensity 3"]},{"entry":["20-39","Intensity 4"]},{"entry":["40-59","Intensity 5"]},{"entry":["60-79","Intensity 6"]},{"entry":["80-99","Intensity 7"]},{"entry":["100","Intensity 8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Alternatively, rather than color-coding based on the percentage of the total resource capacity used, the color-coding can be based on other measurements, such as the relative usage across processes. For example, if one process were using 10 times the resources of another process, then that one process would have a different intensity or color than the other process to indicate this large difference in usage of the resource by the processes relative to one another.","In other embodiments, rather than displaying the amount of resource usage for each of the processes and using different colors to indicate how much of a resource is being used by a process, no amount of resource usage for the processes may be displayed. The different colors alone can be displayed (e.g., surrounding where the amount would be displayed or in a table cell where the amount would be displayed) to indicate how much of a resource is being used.","The ordering of processes in list of processes  can be determined in a variety of different manners. In one or more embodiments, processes are grouped according to process type. The process types can be application process, background process, and operating system process, although other process types can alternatively be used. Application processes refer to processes that are visible to the user while running, such as a process displaying a UI, a process displaying data in a task bar or tool bar, gadgets, and so forth. Background processes refer to processes that are not visible to the user while running\u2014no visual representation of the processes is displayed by the device. Operating system processes refer to operating system components that do not run third party code. However, it should be noted that different criteria can alternatively be used to determine whether a process is an application process, background process, or operating system process.","Application processes are displayed first, followed by background processes, followed by operating system processes, although other orderings can alternatively be used. As illustrated in expanded process management view , an indication of the process types as well as the number of processes of each type can be displayed. For example, \u201cApplications (5)\u201d can be displayed to identify the processes of the application process type, and that there are five processes of the application process type. These indications of process types can optionally be contracted (e.g., so that the process type indication is displayed but identifiers of the processes of that process type are not displayed) or expanded (e.g., so that both the process type and identifiers of the processes of that process type are displayed). A user selection to expand or contract a process type indication can be received in a variety of different manners, such as selection of the process type indication, selection of an arrow or other icon displayed adjacent to the process identifier, selection of a menu item, and so forth.","Within each group, processes are displayed alphabetically by process identifier. Alternatively other orderings can be used to display process identifiers within groups, such as based on when the process began executing, the amount of a resource that is used by a process, and so forth. This ordering can optionally be user-selectable.","In one or more embodiments, processes  in expanded process management view  can be sorted according to various criteria, such as those indicated in headings . For example, a user can sort processes  by name, processor usage, memory usage, disk I\/O usage, network usage, and so forth. Which criteria to sort on can be identified in different manners, such as by user selection of one of the headings  (e.g., the user touches \u201cName\u201d in heading ), user selection of a menu option, and so forth. In response to selection of the name criteria, processes  are displayed in groups as discussed above. In response to selection of another criteria (e.g., memory usage), the processes are broken up and displayed in order based on the selected criteria (e.g., from highest to lowest memory usage, from lowest to highest memory usage, etc.) rather than in groups. If the name criteria were to be selected again, then processes  are again displayed in groups as discussed above.","When a program is run on a device, it can be run as any number of related processes. Process management module  identifies these different related processes and displays them together under a common process identifier. By displaying these related processes together, the expanded process management view provides an indication to a user of the device of all the processes that will be terminated if a particular process identifier is selected for termination.","Each process  can include one or more windows, tabs, and\/or services. A window refers to a displayed window within which a process can present data. For example, a word processing process may include multiple windows, and have a different document for editing displayed in each window. A tab refers to different displays for the window, and a process can display different information within different tabs. For example, a Web browser process may include multiple tabs in a window, and have a different Web page displayed in each tab. A service refers to a module or set of instructions that provides functionality used by a process. For example, a communication process may include a cryptographic service to encrypt data that is sent and decrypt data that is received.","When a program is run or executed, a process is launched that is an executing instantiation of that program. The process that is launched is also referred to herein as a frame process. A process (or window of a process) can optionally have one or more additional processes launched by the process. For example, a window of a frame process can launch multiple tab processes. Thus, there can be a parent\/child relationship between processes, windows, tabs, and services. Each process, window, tab, and service can be a parent, and can include one or more children that are processes, windows, tabs and\/or services. A process, window, tab, or service that includes (e.g., displays) or launches another process, window, tab, or service is referred to as a parent, and that other process, window, tab, or service that was included or launched by the parent is referred to as a child. It should be noted that a process, window, tab, or service can be both a parent to one or more other processes, windows, tabs, or services, and also be a child of another process, window, tab, or service.","In one or more embodiments, process management module  enumerates the frame processes being managed by the operating system. For each frame process, process management module  then identifies the windows and\/or services associated with the frame process. Process management module  then identifies the tabs or other windows (e.g., task bar or tool bar windows) associated with those windows.","Process management module  can identify the different windows, tabs, and\/or services (if any) for each process  in other manners. In one or more embodiments, process management module  queries each process, requesting an identification of the different windows, tabs, and\/or services that that process includes. In response, the process returns to module  an indication of the different windows, tabs, and\/or services that that process includes. In other embodiments, process management module  obtains an indication of the different windows, tabs, and\/or services included in each process from another module or component of the operating system that is aware of the different windows, tabs, and\/or services included in each process. In other embodiments, process management module  accesses a database or other record (e.g., maintained by the operating system) of the different windows, tabs, and\/or services that are included in each process and obtains the identification of the different windows, tabs, and\/or services included in each process from this database or record.","All of the processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services that are related to one another via a parent\/child relationship are associated with one another and are displayed as associated with a process identifier . The process identifier  identifies a frame process, and the processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services related to the frame process are displayed as associated with the process identifier . The processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services related to the frame process can be displayed as associated with the process identifier  in different manners, such as by displaying identifiers of the processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services related to the frame process below the process identifier in list of identifiers .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","300","400","402"]},"Window B1, Window B2, and Service B3. The user of the device can thus readily see that if he or she selects to terminate Process A, that all three of Window B1, Window B2, and Service B3 will be terminated.","In one or more embodiments the resource usage for all related processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services is displayed as a combined value. For example, rather than displaying resource usage for Window B1, Window B2, and Service B3 individually, a combined resource usage for Window B1, Window B2, and Service B3 is displayed. Alternatively, if information regarding separate amounts of resource usage for the individual related processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services is available, then individual resource usages for each of the related processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services can be displayed.","In one or more embodiments, process identifiers  of  and\/or process identifiers  of  are displayed including an indication of how many different processes are related to the identified process. For example, \u201cProcess B (3)\u201d can be displayed to identify that the process with the identifier \u201cProcess B\u201d actually has three different related processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services. A user selection to expand a process identifier  can also be received, in response to which identifiers of these related processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services are displayed. Similarly, a user selection to contract a processor identifier  can also be received, in response to which identifiers of these related processes, windows, tabs, and\/or services are no longer displayed.

Process management module  can use a variety of different techniques to identify which resource is expected to be causing slow performance of the device, examples of which are discussed in more detail below.","Process management module  indicates via expanded process management view  which of the resources is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. Generally, for the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device, the display of the identifier of that resource in headings  and\/or the list indicating usage of that resource is altered, highlighted, or otherwise visually called out to indicate that that resource is the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. In one or more embodiments, module  indicates which of the resources is expected to be causing slow performance of the device by highlighting an identifier of the resource in headings , and also outlining the list (e.g., with a thicker line than lines in the other lists) indicating usage of that resource. For example, if the processor were to be identified as the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device, then the identifier of the processor in headings  is highlighted and processor usage list  is outlined with a thick line (e.g., 2 or 3 times thicker than other lines used in lists -) as illustrated in .","In one or more embodiments, various different contention determination techniques are used for different resources to identify which resource is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. For each resource, the contention determination technique corresponding to that resource is used to determine whether that resource is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. Typically only one of the contention determination techniques indicate the corresponding resource is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. However, situations may arise in which multiple contention determination techniques indicate the corresponding resources are expected to be causing slow performance of the device. In such situations, one of these corresponding resources is selected as the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device (e.g., the resource having the largest overall usage identified in headings , the resource having a corresponding contention determination technique report a higher contention value than other contention determination techniques, etc.). Alternatively, the multiple corresponding resources can be identified as the resources that are expected to be causing slow performance of the device (e.g., two or more lists - can be outlined with a thick line).","The processor contention determination technique uses one or more of various performance counters to determine whether processor contention is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. Processes can be executed as multiple threads, and these performance counters can monitor performance of threads, processes, or other information related to threads and\/or processes. If the performance counters satisfy (e.g., equal or exceed) a threshold value, then the processor is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. These performance counters can be implemented by process management module  of  and\/or other modules of the operating system (e.g., operating system  of ).","In one or more embodiments, the processor contention determination technique uses a performance counter that tracks the amount of time that a processor has one or more threads in its ready queues (threads ready and waiting to be executed). The performance counter can optionally track only threads of a particular one or more priorities (e.g., normal or higher priority threads may be tracked, but low priority threads may not be tracked). The value of the performance counter is divided by a measurement period (e.g., 3 to 5 seconds) to generate a resultant value that indicates for what percentage of the measurement period the processor had threads in its ready queues. If the resultant value satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 0.9), then the processor is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. This resultant value can be a contention value for the processor resource.","In other embodiments, the processor contention determination technique uses performance counters that track for each process a percentage of the processor time used by that process. The values of the performance counters for all processes (or optionally only processes of a particular one or more priorities, such as normal or higher priority processes) are added together, and the resultant value is compared to a threshold amount. If the resultant value satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 95%), then the processor is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. This resultant value can be a contention value for the processor resource.","In other embodiments, the processor contention determination technique uses a performance counter that tracks a percentage of the processor time used by all threads of a particular one or more priorities (e.g., normal or higher priority processes). If the value of the performance counter satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 95%), then the processor is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. This value of the performance counter can be a contention value for the processor resource.","In other embodiments, the processor contention determination technique uses performance counters that track for each thread a percentage of the processor time used by that thread and for each thread the priority of that thread. The values of the performance counters for threads of a particular one or more priorities (such as normal or higher priority threads) are added together, and the resultant value is compared to a threshold amount. If the resultant value satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 95%), then the processor is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. This resultant value can be a contention value for the processor resource.","The memory contention determination technique uses one or more of various metrics to determine whether memory contention is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. If one or more metrics are below (e.g., are equal to or less than) a threshold value, then the memory is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. These metrics can be measured by process management module  of  and\/or other modules of the operating system (e.g., operating system  of ).","In one or more embodiments, the memory contention determination technique uses a metric that is the average lifetime of pages on a standby list over a particular period of time (e.g., the previous minute). The pages on the standby list are pages of memory that store cached data, and although can be associated with a process can also be allocated to and associated with various other processes if desired (e.g., by a memory manager). A value that is the average lifetime of pages on the standby list is obtained and if the value is below (e.g., is equal to or less than) a threshold amount, then the processor is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. Multiple threshold amounts can be used. For example, if the value is less than or equal to one threshold value (e.g., 15 minutes), then the memory resource is determined to be the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device only if no other resource (e.g., processor, disk I\/O, or network) is also determined as being the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. However, if the value is less than or equal to another threshold value (e.g., 5 minutes), then the memory resource is determined to be the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device regardless of whether any other resource (e.g., processor, disk I\/O, or network) is also determined as being the resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device.","The disk I\/O contention determination technique uses one or more of various metrics to determine whether disk I\/O contention is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. If one or more metrics satisfy (e.g., equal or exceed) a threshold value, then the disk I\/O is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. These metrics can be measured by process management module  of  and\/or other modules of the operating system (e.g., operating system  of ).","In one or more embodiments, the disk I\/O contention determination technique uses a metric that is overall disk utilization. The overall disk utilization refers to a percentage of the disk I\/O capacity (the total bandwidth or largest amount of data that can be input to and\/or output from the disk over a particular period of time). If the overall disk utilization satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 95%) when averaged over a particular period of time (e.g., ten seconds), and if over each of two previous amounts within that particular period of time (e.g., two five-second amounts of time) the process with the most disk I\/O operations is below (e.g., is equal to or less than) another threshold amount (e.g., 85%) of the disk I\/O operations in the particular period of time, then the disk I\/O is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. Additionally, once the disk I\/O is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device, the determination can be maintained for at least a threshold amount of time (e.g., three seconds). The overall disk utilization averaged over a particular period of time can be a contention value for the disk I\/O resource.","In other embodiments, the disk I\/O contention determination technique uses performance counters that track for each thread a percentage of the disk time used by that thread and for each thread the I\/O priority of that thread. The values of the performance counters for threads of a particular one or more priorities (such as normal or higher priority threads) are added together, and the resultant value is compared to a threshold amount. If the resultant value satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 95%), then the disk is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device.","In other embodiments, the disk I\/O contention determination technique uses a performance counter that tracks the amount of time that a disk has one or more I\/O in its queues (I\/Os ready and waiting to be serviced by the disk). The performance counter can optionally track only threads of a particular one or more I\/O priorities (e.g., normal or higher priority threads may be tracked, but low priority threads may not be tracked). The value of the performance counter is divided by a measurement period (e.g., 3 to 5 seconds) to generate a resultant value that indicates for what percentage of the measurement period the disk had I\/Os waiting in its queue. If the resultant value satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 0.9), then the disk is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. This resultant value can be a contention value for the disk resource.","The network contention determination technique uses one or more of various metrics to determine whether network contention is expected to be causing slow performance of the device. If one or more metrics satisfy (e.g., equal or exceed) a threshold value, then the network is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. These metrics can be measured by process management module  of  and\/or other modules of the operating system (e.g., operating system  of ).","In one or more embodiments, the network contention determination technique uses a metric that is overall network interface utilization. The overall network interface utilization refers to a percentage of the network interface capacity (the total bandwidth or largest amount of data that can be received and\/or sent by the network interface over a particular period of time). If the overall network interface utilization satisfies (e.g., equals or exceeds) a threshold amount (e.g., 85%) when averaged over a particular period of time (e.g., five seconds), and the process with the most network usage operations is below (e.g., is equal to or less than) another threshold amount (e.g., 80%) of the overall bandwidth of the network interface that is used, then the network is determined as expected to be causing slow performance of the device. The overall network interface utilization averaged over a particular period of time can be a contention value for the network resource.","In situations in which a device includes multiple network interfaces, the more-utilized network interface is identified and the network contention determination technique is applied to the more-utilized network interface. The more-utilized network interface can be determined by determining a usage value for each of the multiple network interfaces. The usage value for a network interface is determined by dividing a value of a performance counter indicating the total number of bytes per second the network interface is transferring (received and\/or sent) by a value of a performance counter indicating a current bandwidth of the network interface (the largest amount of data that can be received and\/or sent by the network interface per second). The network interface having the largest usage value is determined to be the more-utilized network interface. When applying the network contention determination technique for the more-utilized network interface, network resource usage by only those processes that are using the more-utilized network interface is considered (network resource usage by processes not using the more-utilized network interface is not used by the network contention determination technique). Which processes are using which network interfaces can be determined in different manners, such as by identifying the network subnet used by the network interface, and identifying processes sending and\/or receiving data for that network subnet as using that network interface.","In the discussions herein, particular simplified and expanded process management views are illustrated. It should be noted that these illustrations include example layouts, and that other layouts can alternatively be used. For example, rather than having lists of process identifiers, lists of status indications, and so forth laid out in columns as illustrated in , , and , the lists can be laid out in rows.","The process management views techniques discussed herein support various usage scenarios. A user can easily switch between views, allowing the user to select whether he or she desires the less-detailed view of the simplified process management view, or the more-detailed view of the expanded process management view. Additionally, because the expanded process management view identifies all of the windows, tabs, services, and\/or processes that will be terminated if a particular process is terminated, a user can readily see what the results will be (in terms of windows, tabs, services, and\/or processes that are terminated) if he or she terminates a particular process. Furthermore, because the expanded process management view displays resource usage on a per resource basis for each process (as well as related windows, tabs, services, and\/or other processes), and can be color-coded, a user can readily identify which processes are using more of particular resources than other processes. In addition, because the expanded process management view displays an indication of a resource that is expected to be causing slow performance of the device, a user can readily identify which list of resource usages to pay attention to in selecting one or more processes to terminate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":["800","800","100","800","800"]},"In process , a simplified process management view is displayed (act ).
