title: Location check-in via short range communication
abstract: In general, techniques and systems for updating a user status with check-in information in a user account are described. In one example, a method includes obtaining, with a computing device, location information from a target device using near field communication (NFC), retrieving check-in information based on the location information obtained from the target device, wherein the check-in information comprises greater detail about a destination associated with the target device than the location information, and updating a user status in a user account with the check-in information. In some examples, the location information may instruct the computing device to retrieve check-in information from at least one information source different from the target device.

For instance, a user may install, view, or delete an application on a computing device.","In some instances, a user may use a mobile device (e.g., mobile phone, tablet computer, smart phone, or the like) to communicate with other devices or systems. For instance, a user may transmit information from the mobile device to a remote computing device.","In one example, a method includes obtaining, with a computing device, location information from a target device using near field communication (NFC), retrieving check-in information based on the location information obtained from the target device, wherein the check-in information comprises greater detail about a destination associated with the target device than the location information; and updating a user status in a user account with the check-in information.","In another example, a computer-readable storage medium is encoded with instructions that cause one or more processors of a computing device to obtain, with a computing device, location information from a target device using near field communication (NFC), retrieve check-in information based on the location information obtained from the target device, wherein the check-in information comprises greater detail about a destination associated with the target device than the location information, and update a user status in a user account with the check-in information.","In another example, a computing device includes a near field communication (NFC) module configured to obtain location information from a target device and a processor configured to retrieve check-in information based on the location information obtained from the target device, wherein the check-in information comprises greater detail about a destination associated with the target device than the location information, and update a user status in a user account with the check-in information.","The details of one or more aspects of this disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","In general, this disclosure is directed to techniques for using near field communication (NFC) to at least partially automate a user check-in processes for a user account (e.g., a user account associated with a social networking service). Typically, a user is required to perform several manual steps in order to \u201ccheck-in,\u201d or update the user's account to share the user's location with other contacts. These manual steps of the check-in process may include opening a social networking application associated with the social networking service, entering or typing the user's location, and updating the user's status with the entered location.","Techniques of this disclosure may, in various instances, enable a user to complete the check-in process with little or no user input by utilizing a location device (e.g., an NFC target or tag) associated with the location of the user. Location devices may be provided by businesses, restaurants, movie theaters, schools, events, sporting arenas, or any other location that the user may visit. Therefore, each location device may provide different location information specific to that particular location device.","When an NFC module is enabled within a user's computing device (e.g., a mobile phone or tablet computing device) the user may \u201ctap\u201d the computing device against the location device or otherwise place the computing device within sufficient proximity of the location device. The NFC module of the user's computing device may, in various instances, power the location device to subsequently obtain location information from the location device. The computing device may then retrieve check-in information based on the location information and subsequently update the user account with the check-in information. For example, the updated user account may be presented as check-in information in the user's status or other area of the user account. Although the user account may be associated with a social networking service, the user account may be any other web-accessible page with information about the user, such as a website or a blog.","The location information obtained from the location device may not directly provide the check-in information used to update the user account. Instead, the location information may function as a pointing device that instructs the computing device on where to retrieve more detailed check-in information appropriate for updating the user account. In this manner, the location device may only need to store and provide a small amount of data for the location information. The check-in information may then include greater detail, or additional details, about the destination associated with the target device than the location information. The check-in information may also be formatted to be placed in the user status (e.g., information readable or usable by a user), but the location information may include a command or other instructions that is then executed by the user computing device. The check-in information may also be updated without needing to modify the location information stored by the location device. For example, the location information may include latitude and longitude coordinates that the user computing device provides to an Internet-based mapping service in order to retrieve the check-in information from the Internet-based mapping service. In another example, the location information may include a website address that the user computing device can use to access and download the check-in information from a server or other computing device via a network.","Although the user computing device may completely automate the check-in process such that no user input is required subsequent to placing the computing device close proximity to the location device, the computing device may prompt the user for input during the check-in process. In some examples, the computing device may prompt the user to confirm the check-in information before updating the user account with the check-in information. In other examples, the computing device may present a list of preselected contact groups, selectable by the user, that will be able to view the updated check-in information. In additional examples, the computing device may present destination information from which the user may select one or more elements to include in the check-in information. After the user makes any selections, the computing device may accordingly update the user account with the check-in information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["12","22","10","12","22","16","18","20","12","12","12","16"]},"Computing device  may include an NFC module (not shown) capable of initiating wireless communication with location device , a target device, over a short distance. For example, this short distance may be less 100 meters, less than 10 meters, less than 1 meter, or even less than 10 centimeters. Although only one location device  is provided in the example of , location device  is representative of any number of location devices configured to communicate with computing device  using an NFC protocol. Since each location device  may be relatively simple and configured to communicate with any number of other NFC devices, computing device  may be capable of establishing communication with thousands or even millions of different location devices.","Computing device  may operate in at least two different modes to communicate with location device  using NFC. For example, computing device  and location device  may be configured to operate in a passive mode and an active mode of operation. In an active mode of operation, computing device  may generate a first radio field that is received by location device  in physical proximity to computing device . In response, location device  may generate a second radio field that is received by computing device . In this way, data may be communicated between computing device  and location device  such as using peer-to-peer communication. In the active mode, computing device  may also power or activate a passive device to retrieve data from the passive device, as further described below.","In a passive mode of operation, load modulation techniques may be employed to facilitate data communication between computing device  and location device . In a passive mode, location device  does not generate a radio field in response to the radio field of computing device . Instead, location device  may include electrical hardware (e.g., an NFC module) that generates a change in impedance in response to the radio field generated by computing device . For example, computing device  may generate a radio field that is received by location device . Electrical hardware in location device  may generate a change in impedance in response to the radio field. The change in impedance may be detected by the NFC module of computing device . In this way, load modulation techniques may be used by computing device  to obtain location information  from location device . In other words, computing device  may obtain location information  from location device , but location device  would not receive any data from computing device  in the passive mode. Other well-known modulation techniques including phase modulation and\/or amplitude modulation may also be employed to facilitate data communication between computing device  and location device  in other examples.","Generally, location device  may operate in passive mode. In passive mode, location device  may be referred to as an NFC tag or NFC target. In other words, computing device  may include active NFC hardware and location device  may include passive NFC hardware. Since a passive location device  does not need a dedicated power supply, location device  may be placed in a variety of locations, on any surface, or even as part of smaller items. For example, location device  may be embodied as a sticker or adhesive poster that is placed on the wall of a building. Passive location devices  may also be less expensive and more difficult to corrupt with computing device . In this manner, location device  may include electrical hardware that generates a change in impedance in response to a radio field. However, location device  may be another computing device in other examples. For example, location device  may be a computing device that operates in a passive NFC mode and\/or an active NFC mode. In other words, location device  may include active NFC hardware. This active NFC hardware may be configured to emulate passive NFC hardware or participate in active near field communication.","In an example of a passive location device , location device  may deliver location information  to computing device  in response to receiving a radio field generated by the NFC module of computing device . In other words, location information  may be data stored on location device . Upon receiving the radio field (e.g., receiving power sufficient to transmit data) computing device  may receive location information . In this manner, location device  may only be capable of delivering or sending location information  when computing device  is within close physical proximity to location device . Although the user may physically touch, bump, or tap computing device  to location device , computing device  may be capable of receiving location information  from location device  without physically touching location device .","Location information  may not include the check-in information posted to the user status of the user account. Instead, location information  may act as a pointing device, or include instructions, regarding where computing device  can retrieve the check-in information. In this manner, location information  may instruct computing device  to retrieve check-in information from at least one information source different from location device . For example, computing device  may retrieve check-in information, or at least a portion of the check-in information, from a database stored within computing device . Computing device  may store check-in information for a variety of destinations that have a location device , and location information  obtained from each particular location device  may instruct computing device to select predetermined check-in information from the database or other specified resource that is associated with the obtained location information . In some examples, computing device  may retrieve the check-in information from a cache stored in computing device , such as cached mapping data. Location information  may thus include a URL or other command that computing device  uses to retrieve the cached information.","In another example, location information  may include latitude and longitude coordinates that identify the geographical location of location device  (e.g., the associated destination to which the user is checking-in). Computing device  may use the coordinates to identify the destination from geographical mapping information stored in the memory of computing device  and generate check-in information based on the identified destination. The check-in information may include the destination name, a summary describing the destination, a map link to a geographical area around the destination, or any other information associated with the destination that corresponds to the latitude and longitude coordinates.","Computing device  may also use location information  to retrieve check-in information via network . Network  may be any wired or wireless network that allows computing device  to access another computing device and\/or the Internet. For example, computing device  may connect to network  to retrieve check-in information from remote server  (e.g., a computing device). Once computing device  requests the check-in information from remote server , remote server  may access remote database  to acquire portions of the check-in information. Remote server  may then compile the complete check-in information and deliver the check-in information back to computing device  via network .","In this manner, the ability of computer device  to access remote information via network  may increase an amount of information, a variety of information, and an accuracy of information available as the check-in information. With check-in information retrieved from another source, location information  stored within location device  may not need to be updated over time. Instead, the check-in information may be managed in a central server (e.g., remote server ), a central database (e.g., remote database ), or any web-based resource. Location information  may include a web address, remote server Internet protocol address, or any other such pointing data. Alternatively, location information  may include data in a form recognizable by computing device . For example, location information  may include data specific to a particular application installed in computing device . Upon obtaining location information , computing device  may select and open the application configured to interpret the location information. The application may then retrieve the check-in information from remote server  via network . Computing device  may employ one or more of these techniques to retrieve check-in information via network .","In one example, computing device  may obtain latitude and longitude coordinates from location information  and enter the latitude and longitude coordinates into an Internet-based mapping service. The Internet-based mapping service may then interface with remote server  via network  and subsequently generate check-in information associated with the destination of the coordinates, and computing device  may retrieve the check-in information from the mapping service. In other examples, location information  may include the name, city, and state or other address information of the destination. Computing device  may similarly utilize the Internet-based mapping service to retrieve associated check-in information based on the address information. In this example, computing device  may utilize network  to retrieve the check-in information.","In another example, location information  may include a web address. Computing device  may use the web address to access and retrieve check-in information from the web page or data identified by the web address. The check-in information may be managed by the owner or manager of location device . For example, location device  may be placed in a restaurant, and the restaurant may maintain the check-in information to which location information  directs customers' computing devices. Alternatively, the location information  may direct computing device  to a third-party managed site that provides check-in information associated with the location information of the particular location device .","The check-in information may contain any information related to the destination associated with location device . Therefore, check-in information may include any subset or subsets of destination information related to the destination. For example, the destination information may include any or all of a name of the destination, a description of the destination, a website link, a picture, a video, a rating, a review, and an event. Each of these elements of the destination information may be part of the check-in information updated in the user status. Although all of the destination information may be used to update the user status, only a subset of the destination information may be used as part of the check-in information in the user status. This subset of destination information may be automatically selected based on user preferences or previous user selections.","Alternatively, the subset of destination information used in the check-in information may be selected by the user. Computing device  may retrieve all of the destination information from remote server . Then, computing device  may be configured to allow the user to select which elements from the destination information to include in the check-in information posted in the user status. Computing device  may utilize user interface  to present the destination information and receive the user selections.","User interface  may include an input device and an output device so that the user can communicate with computing device . In one example user interface  may be a touch screen interface. In other examples, user interface  may include a display and one or more buttons, pads, joysticks, mice, or any other device capable of turning user actions into electrical signals that control computing device . In addition, computing device  may include one or more microphones, speakers, cameras, or tactile feedback devices to deliver information to the user or receive information. In any example, the user may interact with user interface  to provide input during the check-in process.","For example, user interface  may present the destination information to the user. The destination information may be in the form of a list, a drop down menu, icons, or any other presentation view. User interface  may then receive an information selection input from the user that selects at least one of the elements from the presented destination information. After the user selection is made, computing device  may update the user status with the user selected elements from the destination information as the check-in information. For example, the user may select the name of the destination and the event that the user is attending at the destination. In alternative examples, the user may request that computing device  retrieve alternative destination information or otherwise customize the check-in information as desired.","In alternative example, computing device  may completely automate the check-in process once computing device  obtains location information  from location device . For example, computing device  may automatically obtain location information  when location device  is in range of computing device . Computing device  may then automatically use location information  to automatically retrieve the check-in information from remote server  via network . Once computing device  has retrieved the check-in information, computing device  may automatically update the user status in the user account according to the retrieved check-in information. If the check-in information retrieved from remote server  includes destination information with multiple elements, computing device  may automatically select certain elements from the destination information. These automatically selected elements may be determined based on user selected preferences for certain types of elements in the check-in information, default elements identified within the destination information, or previous types of destination information selected by the user in past check-in processes. In this manner, the check-in information may be customizable for the user without the user always needing to manually select each element or the form of the check-in information posted in the user status.","The user may control any automated processes of the check-in process via preference menus, configuration settings, or other predefined criteria. In one example, user interface  may present a preference menu that enables the user to allow computing device  to automatically update the user status in the user account. This preference menu may provide various options for a fully or partially automatic check-in process. For example, user interface  may then receive user input that allows automatically updating the user status in the user account with computing device  in response to automatically obtaining the location information and automatically retrieving the check-in information.","In another example, user interface  may receive user input that requests computing device  prompt the user, at various stages of the check-in process, to confirm a presented action by computing device . In this manner, the user may require user interface  to confirm the check-in information prior to computing device  updating the user status with the check-in information. For example, user interface  may present a check-in prompt to the user in response to retrieving the check-in information and update the user status in response to receiving the check-in input from the user. According to these examples, user interface  may provide the user with any number of different options for customizing the level of autonomy of computing device  in the check-in process. The user may be capable of changing these preferences over time.","In addition to user selectable elements for check-in information, the user may be able to identify which contacts associated with the user account will be able to view the check-in information in the user status. For example, the user account may include multiple preselected contact groups. Each contact group may include contacts that have something in common to the user. Contacts may be grouped into \u201cfriends,\u201d \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cco-workers,\u201d or the like. Since the user may only want to allow certain contacts to view the updated check-in information, user interface  may allow the user to select the contact groups that will have access to the check-in information. In this manner, computing device  may update the user status viewable or accessible by at least one preselected contact group associated with the user account.","The user may select the desired contact groups from a list of contact groups presented by user interface . Prior to updating the user status, user interface  may present the list of contact groups associated with the user account. User interface  may then receive a user selection of at least one of the contact groups, and computing device  may subsequently update the user status in response to the user selection. In other examples, the user may predefine the contact groups that may view check-in information in the user status. Alternatively, the user may allow certain contact groups to view check-in information from predetermined categories of destinations. For example, any check-in information associated with a restaurant may be viewable by the preselected contract group of \u201cfriends.\u201d","As described herein, the user account may be any electronic location where information about the user is provided. For example, the user account may be associated with one of more social networking services. Each of these social networking services may be accessed by the user using an application, web browser, or any other user interface that enables the user to interact with the service. In this manner, a social networking application may be associated with one or more social networking services. Therefore, computing device  may update the user status in one of more social networking service to which the user is logged in. The social networking service may accessed through a standalone social networking applications that operates with the operating system of computing device  and\/or a social networking application that is a sub-routine built into an operating system running on computing device . With a social networking application built into the operating system as a sub-routine, the social networking service may be reachable without computing device  launching a separate application. Instead, the operating system may include the required functionality to directly interface with the social networking service (e.g., directly calling application programming interfaces (APIs) of the social networking service with the operating system of computing device ).","If the social networking application is not already running on computing device , computing device  may automatically launch one or more social networking applications on computing device  in response to detecting location device  or receiving location information . This automatic launching of the social networking application may prevent the user from having to manually launch the application. The automatic launch may also allow computing device  to more quickly retrieve the check-in information from network  and update the user status with the check-in information.","In some examples, user interface  may present a list of multiple social networking services (or social networking applications available on computing device ) to the user prior to updating the user status. From this list, the user may select one of more of the social networking services to post the check-in information. In this manner, the user may streamline the use of multiple social networking services. User interface  then receives the user selection of at least one of the plurality of social networking services and computing device  updates the user status in each of the social networking services selected by the user in response to receiving the user selection. If any applications required to access the selected social networking application are not running when selected, computing device  may also automatically launch the required social networking applications upon the selection.","Computing device  may also include techniques to handle errors in the check-in processes. For example, computing device  may not recognize or be able to interpret location information  received from location device . In this event, computing device  may prompt the user via user interface  to address this error in location information . User interface  may present the received location information  to the user. The user may then have the opportunity to modify location information  or simply manually enter the desired check-in information.","Remote server  and remote database  may each include one or more servers or databases, respectively. In this manner, remote server  and remote database  may be embodied as any hardware necessary to deliver check-in information, or destination information, to computing device  over network . Remote server  may include one or more desktop computers, mainframes, minicomputers, or other computing devices capable of executing computer instructions and storing data. Remote database  may include one or more memories, repositories, hard disks, or any other data storage device. In some examples, remote database  may be included within remote server .","Remote server  may connect to network . Network  may be embodied as one or more of the Internet, a wireless network, a wired network, a cellular network, or a fiber optic network. In other words, network  may be any data communication protocol that facilitates data between two or more devices.","In some examples, remote database  may include Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) software. In one example, remote database  may be a relational database and accessed using a Structured Query Language (SQL) interface that is well known in the art. Remote database  may alternatively be stored on a separate networked computing device and accessed by remote server  through a network interface or system bus. Remote database  may in other examples be an Object Database Management System (ODBMS), Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database or other suitable data management system.","Various aspects of the disclosure may be operable only when the user has explicitly enabled such functionality. In addition, various aspects of the disclosure may be disabled by the user. Thus, a user may elect to prevent computing device  from requesting and\/or check-in information from remote server . More generally, privacy controls may be applied to all aspects of the disclosure based on a user's privacy preferences to honor the user's privacy preferences for opting in or opting out of the functionality described in this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","12","12","12"]},"As shown in the specific example of , computing device  includes one or more processors , memory , a network interface , one or more storage devices , user interface , battery , GPS device , and NFC device .

However, the user may customize what type of check-in information is posted to the user status. The user may select destination information menu  to view a greater variety of destination information (e.g., a plurality of elements associated with the destination). This destination information is further described in . The user may also clear or erase the destination and check-in information from status field  by selecting clear button .","In addition, screen  may allow the user select the contacts that will be able to view the check-in information in the user status. In some cases, the user may not want all contacts associated with the user account to view the check-in information. Therefore, screen  may provide groups menu . Groups menu  may list the currently selected groups of contacts that will be able to view the updated user status. In addition, the user may select groups menu  to view a list of available contact groups. This list of contact groups is further described in . Although the user may be able to select the contact groups from groups menu , user interface  may present one or more default contact groups based on the type of destination and\/or user preferences.","Once the user is satisfied with the check-in information that will be posted in status field , the user may select post button  to initiate updating of the user status with the displayed check-in information. If the user does not want to update the user status with the check-in information, the user may press discard button  to return to another screen of user interface .","Screen  may be presented to the user when the user has not selected to make the entire check-in process automatic. In other words, screen  provides an opportunity to the user to confirm the retrieved check-in information or change the check-in information. In some examples, screen  may be the only screen in which a user input is required to update the user status with the check-in information. After computing device  automatically obtains location information  from location device  and subsequently retrieves the check-in information, the user may simply need to provide a single input of selecting post button . In other examples, the user may be prompted to provide additional input (e.g., accept the launch of application ), allow computing device  to access remote server  via network , or any other user preferred manual step. However, in any example, the user does not need to manually obtain or enter check-in information because of the location information obtained from location device .","In alternative examples, computing device  may not present screen  to the user. If the user has determined that the check-in process is to be fully automated by computing device , then computing device  may automatically update the user status with the check-in information whenever location information  is obtained from a location device . However, even in fully automated check-in mode, computing device  may, in some examples, signal to the user that the user status was updated. For example, computing device  deliver an audible indication and\/or a status icon in status bar  that indicates check-in information was successfully posted to the user status of the user account.","Screen  may also be formatted to facilitate use in a touch screen user interface . In other words, all of the user inputs may be large enough for a user to touch with a single finger.
