title: Image processing method using sensed eye position
abstract: A method for processing an image previously captured by a camera and stored in a memory of the camera, includes the steps of sensing the position of an eye in the captured image; generating eye position information; and processing said captured image using the eye position information. The step of processing involves detecting a face within the capture image, and applying a morph to the detected face to modify the captured image. The step of processing further involves a step of applying a graphical object at a location within the image and relative to the detected face.

No. 11\/778,561 filed Jul. 16, 2007, which is a Continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 10\/636,226 filed on Aug. 8, 2003, now issued U.S. Pat. No. 7,256,824, which is a Continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 09\/112,746 filed on Jul. 10, 1998, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,690,419 all of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to an image processing method and apparatus and, in particular, discloses a process for Utilising Eye Detection Methods in a Digital Image Camera.","The present invention relates to the field of digital image processing and in particular, the field of processing of images taken via a digital camera.","Recently, digital cameras have become increasingly popular. These cameras normally operate by means of imaging a desired image utilising a charge coupled device (CCD) array and storing the imaged scene on an electronic storage medium for later down loading onto a computer system for subsequent manipulation and printing out. Normally, when utilising a computer system to print out an image, sophisticated software may available to manipulate the image in accordance with requirements.","Unfortunately such systems require significant post processing of a captured image and normally present the image in an orientation to which is was taken, relying on the post processing process to perform any necessary or required modifications of the captured image. Further, much of the environmental information available when the picture was taken is lost.","According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for processing an image previously captured by a camera and stored in a memory of the camera comprises the steps of sensing the position of an eye in the captured image; generating eye position information; and processing said captured image using the eye position information. The step of processing involves detecting a face within the capture image, and applying a morph to the detected face to modify the captured image. The step of processing further involves a step of applying a graphical object at a location within the image and relative to the detected face.","The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in the concurrently filed application entitled \u201cA Digital Image Printing Camera with Image Processing Capability\u201d, the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by cross reference and the details of which, and other related applications are set out in the tables below.","The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system, hereinafter known as an \u201cArtcam\u201d type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit. Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in any output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards hereinafter being known as Artcards. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power by an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP) which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.","In the preferred embodiment, the Artcam device is modified so as to include an eye position sensor which senses a current eye position. The sensed eye position information is utilised to process the digital image taken by the camera so as to produce modifications, transformations etc. in accordance with the sensed eye position.","The construction of eye position sensors is known to those skilled in the art and is utilised within a number of manufacture's cameras. In particular, within those of Canon Inc. Eye position sensors may rely on the projection of an infra red beam from the viewfinder into the viewer's eye and a reflection detected and utilized to determine a likely eye position.","In the preferred embodiment, it is assumed that the eye position sensor is interconnected to the ACP unit of the Artcam device as discussed in the aforementioned Australian Provisional Patent Application which is converted to a digital form and stored in the Artcam memory store for later use.","Turning now to , the eye position information  and the image  are stored in the memory of the Artcam and are then processed  by the ACP to output a processed image  for printing out as a photo via a print head. The form of image processing  can be highly variable provided it is dependant on the eye position information . For example, in a first form of image processing, a face detection algorithm is applied to the image  so as to detect the position of faces within an image and to apply various graphical objects, for example, speech bubbles in a particular offset relationship to the face. An example of such process is illustrated in  wherein, a first image  is shown of three persons. After application of the face detection algorithm, three faces ,  and  are detected. The eye position information is then utilised to select that face which is closest to an estimated eye view within the frame. In a first example, the speech bubble is place relative to the head . In a second example , the speech bubble is placed relative to the head  and in a third example , the speech bubble is placed relative to the head . Hence, an art card can be provided containing an encoded form of speech bubble application algorithm and the image processed so as to place the speech bubble text above a pre-determined face within the image.","It will be readily apparent that the eye position information could be utilised to process the image  in a multitude of different ways. This can include applying regions specific morphs to faces and objects, applying focusing effects in a regional or specific manner. Further, the image processing involved can include applying artistic renderings of an image and this can include applying an artistic paint brushing technique. The artistic brushing methods can be applied in a region specific manner in accordance with the eye position information . The final processed image  can be printed out as required. Further images can be then taken, each time detecting and utilising a different eye position to produce a different output image.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","The present invention is further best utilized in the Artcam device, the details of which are set out in the following paragraphs although it is not restricted thereto.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal inkjet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric inkjet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewide print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the inkjet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new inkjet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the inkjet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. 45 different inkjet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below.","The inkjet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the inkjet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","The following table is a guide to cross-referenced patent applications filed concurrently herewith and discussed
