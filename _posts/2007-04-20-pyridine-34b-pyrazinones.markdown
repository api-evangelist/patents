{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/793,971 filed Apr. 21, 2006.","The present invention comprises a class of pyridine[3,4-b]pyrazinone compounds having the structure of Formula I and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula I. The present invention also comprises methods of treating a subject by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to the subject. In general, these compounds inhibit, in whole or in part, the enzyme: cyclic guanylate monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5).","The prevalence of hypertension in developed countries is about 20% of the adult population, rising to about 60-70% of those aged 60 or more. Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and renal impairment. Despite the large number of anti-hypertensive drugs available in various pharmacological categories, additional agents useful for the treatment of hypertension are still needed.","Vascular endothelial cells secrete nitric oxide (NO). This acts on vascular smooth muscle cells and leads to the activation of guanylate cyclase and the accumulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The accumulation of cGMP causes the muscles to relax and the blood vessels to dilate, leading to a reduction in blood pressure. The cGMP is inactivated by hydrolysis to guanosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (GMP) by a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase. One important cGMP-phosphodiesterase has been identified as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Inhibitors of PDE5 decrease the rate of hydrolysis of cGMP and so potentiate the actions of nitric oxide.","Improved drug therapies for the treatment of subjects suffering from or susceptible to a cardiovascular condition are desirable. In particular, there still is a need for a new class of PDE-5 inhibitors for treating cGMP-mediated conditions and corresponding drug therapies.","In one embodiment, the invention comprises compounds having the structure of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"26.67mm","wi":"57.83mm","file":"US07902195-20110308-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2","6A","6B","8 "]},"In another embodiment, the invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound having the structure of Formula I.","In another embodiment, the invention comprises methods of treating a condition in a subject by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having the Formula I to the subject.

In this assay, a test compound elicits a relaxation of an aortic ring by enhancing the cGMP signal evoked by a stable exogenous nitric oxide donor, diethyltriamine NONOate (diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate) (\u201cDETA-NO\u201d). An EC, with 95% confidence intervals, for compound-evoked relaxation is calculated as an index of potency. The ECis the concentration of a test compound which produces 50% of the maximum possible effective response for a test compound.","Male ague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) are asphyxiated using COgas and their thoracic aortas carefully excised and placed in Krebs buffer. The aortas are then carefully dissected free of connective tissue and divided into 8 sections, each 3-4 mm in length.","Aortic rings are suspended between parallel stainless steel wires in a water jacketed (37\u00b0 C.), 15 mL tissue bath under a resting tension of 1 gram. Tension is measured using isometric tension transducers and recorded using Ponemah tissue platform system. Each preparation is allowed to equilibrate for at least 60 minutes prior to compound testing. During this time, the tissues are also incubated with 200 uM NG-monomethyl L-arginine (\u201cL-NMMA\u201d), and the incubation media changed every 15 to 20 minutes (L-NMMA is added after each wash to maintain the final concentration at 200 uM in each tissue bath).","Following the equilibration period, baseline tensions are recorded for each tissue. The vasoconstrictor response to phenylepherine (1 uM) is assessed and when the response to phenylepherine reaches a maximum, vascular reactivity is subsequently assessed by a challenge of acetylcholine (1 uM). Following another washout period, a second baseline value is recorded after adding the vasoconstrictor noradrenaline (25 nM) to each bath and incubating the tissues for a time period (about 15 minutes) sufficient for the tissues to achieve a stable tone. An exogenous nitric oxide drive is supplied using the stable nitric oxide donor, DETA-NO. The concentration of DETA-NO is titrated (cumulatively in half-log increments) to achieve approximately 5 to 15% relaxation of the noradrenaline-evoked preconstriction. Cumulative concentration-response curves are constructed in a single ring, typically using 5 doses\/ring and allowing 15 minutes between each addition.","Method 4: Alternative Aortic Ring Assay","Method 3 can be modified to provide an alternative protocol for to measuring the direct relaxation of rat aortic rings exposed to a test compound. This alternative method varies from Method 3 as described below:","For the alternative method, the endothelium is first removed by gently rubbing the lumen of the vessel together between the fingers prior to preparing the rings (denuded rings). The resting tension is set at 2 grams and the vasoconstrictor response to a maximal concentration of phenylephrine (1 \u03bcM) is assessed, followed (after a washout period) by two further exposures to 300 nM of phenylephrine. The concentration-response relationship to noradrenaline is constructed in each tissue over concentration range 0.1 to 300 nM. After another washout period, the tissues are constricted with an ECconcentration of noradrenaline for compound testing.","Method 5: Culex\u2122 Assay","The effect of a test compound on systemic arterial blood pressure can be evaluated in a conscious pre-cannulated spontaneously hypertensive rat (\u201cSHR\u201d) model. This assay is conducted using an automated blood sampler (\u201cABS\u201d) system. The Culex\u2122 ABS system (Bioanalytical System, Inc., West Lafayette, Ind.) comprises a laptop computer, four control units and metabolic cages. This ABS system allows for the collection of multiple blood samples from a single rat without causing undue stress to the animal. In addition, the ABS system allows for the collection of urine samples that can be potentially used for biomarker identifications. Through this approach, efficacy and standard pharmacokinetic studies are conducted in the conscious unrestrained SHR rats simultaneously to define the relationship between plasma free drug concentration or potential biomarker(s) and pharmacological effect (reduction of mean arterial blood pressure).","SHR rats at 12 to 16 weeks of age, weighing about 300 g, undergo surgical cannulation of both jugular veins and the right carotid artery. After surgical recovery, animals are placed in the Culex\u2122 cages and tethered to a movement-responsive arm with a sensor that controls cage movement when the animal moves to prevent the catheters from being twisted. Connections are made between the right jugular catheter and the Culex\u2122 sterile tubing set for blood sampling, and the left jugular catheter for compound administration, and the catheter in the right carotid artery is connected to a pressure transducer for monitoring blood pressure. To keep the patency of the catheters, the right jugular cannula is maintained by the \u201ctend\u201d function of the Culex\u2122 that flushes the catheter with 20 \u03bcL heparin saline (10 units\/mL) every 12 minutes or between sampling events, and the left jugular cannula is filled with heparin saline (20 units\/mL). The patency of the right carotid cannula is maintained by slow infusion of heparin saline either directly into the extend tubing when blood pressure is not recorded or through the pressure transducer during the blood pressure monitoring. Animals are allowed to acclimate for at least two hours before compound evaluation. A test compound may be administered intravenously or by oral gavage. Blood sampling protocols (sampling time and volume) are programmed using the Culex\u2122 software. The total amount of blood withdrawn from each animal will not exceed 750 \u03bcL\/24 hrs and 10 mL\/kg within two weeks. Heart rate, blood pressure, and drug concentration are monitored. Systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate are recorded by PONEMAH (Gould Instrument System, Valley View, Ohio), a pressure transducer through a data acquisition system for recording blood pressure and heart rate, for 6 to 24 hours based on experimental protocol. Mean arterial blood pressure (primary endpoint) is analyzed for assessing the efficacy of the compound.","Blood samples are analyzed for measuring plasma drug concentration, using the LC\/MS\/MS method described below, and for evaluating potential biomarkers.","LC\/MS\/MS Method","Sample Preparation: Plasma samples (50 \u03bcL unknown, control or blank) are mixed with 10 \u03bcL acetonitrile:water or a standard solution of a test compound and 150 \u03bcL of internal standard solution (100 ng\/mL of a test compound in acetonitrile). The mixture is centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and 125 \u03bcL of the supernatant transferred to a 96 well plate. The solvent is evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and the residue is reconstituted with 80 \u03bcL acetonitrile\/0.1% aqueous formic acid (20:80 v\/v).","A 20 \u03bcL volume of each prepared sample is injected onto a Phenomenex Synergi 4 \u03bcm MAX-RP 2.0\u00d775 mm column and eluted at 0.4 mL\/min using gradient elution from 0.1% aqueous formic acid (mobile phase A) to acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The gradient program consists of initial application of 90% mobile phase A, followed by a linear gradient to 75% mobile phase B from 0.2 to 1.15 min after injection and held at 75% mobile phase B until 2.0 min. The mobile phase was linearly changed back to 90% mobile phase A from 2.00 to 2.10 minutes, and the next injection took place at 3.00 min. Detection was performed by mass spectrometry using positive ion electrospray (ESI) with multiple reaction monitoring of the transitions m\/z 454.00 (MH+a test compound)\u2192m\/z 408.00, m\/z 466.24 (MH+a test compound)\u2192409.33. The ion spray voltagea is set at 5000. A calibration curve is constructed by using peak area ratios of the analyte relative to the internal standard. Subject concentrations are determined by inverse prediction from their peak area ratios against the calibration curve.","Method 6: Implantation of Radio Transmitters and Subsequent Blood Pressure Screening by Telemetry in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats","SHR Rats are anesthetized with isoflurane gas via an isoflurane anesthesia machine that is calibrated to deliver isoflurane over a range of percentages as oxygen passes through the machine's inner chambers. The animals are placed in an induction chamber and administered isoflurane at 4-5% to reach a surgical plane of anesthesia. They are then maintained at 1-2% during the surgical procedure via a nose cone, with isoflurane delivered via a smaller isoflurane anesthesia device on the surgical table.","Following administration of anesthesia, the rats are implanted with transmitters using aseptic procedures with commercially available sterile radio-telemetry units (Data Sciences, International, Roseville, Minn. 55113-1136). Prior to surgery the surgical field is shaved, scrubbed with Dial\u2122 brand antimicrobial solution (containing 4% chlorhexidine gluconate and 4% isopropyl alcohol) followed by an application of iodine (10%) spray solution. A 2.5 to 3.0 cm laparotomy is preformed and the radio-telemetry units implanted into the abdomen, with the catheter tip inserted into the abdominal aorta. Baby Weitlaner retractors are used to retain soft tissue. A 1 cm section of the abdominal aorta is partially dissected and that section cross-clamped briefly, punctured with a 21-gauge needle and the transmitter catheter tip introduced into the vessel and secured by a single 4.0 silk suture anchored to the adjacent psoas muscle. The transmitter body is then inserted into the abdominal cavity and simultaneously secured to the abdominal muscle wall while closing with running 4.0 silk suture. The skin layer is closed with subdermal continuous 4.0 absorbable suture. A subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of marcaine followed by a topical application of iodine is administered into and around the suture line, respectively, upon closing. All rats receive a postoperative injection of buprenorphine @ 0.05 mg\/kg, s.c. before regaining consciousness. A typical dose volume for a 0.300 kg rat will be 0.050 ml. The rats must be fully recovered from their operative anesthesia before the administration of buprenorphine. They then receive the same dose once daily for 2 consecutive days, unless the animal demonstrates that it is in compromising postoperative pain.","Following surgery, the rats are returned to their cages and housed individually on solid bottom caging with paper bedding. A period of no less than 7 days is allowed for recovery before experimental procedures are initiated. It has been observed that the rats are typically hypertensive for several days following surgery and return to \u201cnormotensive\u201d levels by approximately the 7day post-surgery. They are fed standard rat chow and water ad libitum throughout the experimental time line.","Test compounds are administered intragastrically (i.g.) via gavage, using of a stainless steel, 2\u00bd inch, 18 gauge gavage needle with a balled end. For single daily dosing, the target volume is 3.33 ml\/kg, i.g. The dose volume for a test compound is approximately 1 ml\/rat. The vehicles in which a test compound is administered is methylcellulose (0.5%)+Tween 80 (0.1%) in 50 mM citrate buffer pH=5.0.","Blood pressure data will be obtained using Data Sciences International's data acquisition program (Version 3.0). Blood pressure samples are recorded at 1.5-3 minute intervals for a 5 second duration 24 hours per day for the entire study. This data is processed by Data Science's data analysis software into averages of a desired time intervals. All other data reduction is performed in Microsoft Excel\u2122 spreadsheets.","All documents mentioned in this application are expressly incorporated by reference as if fully set forth at length.
