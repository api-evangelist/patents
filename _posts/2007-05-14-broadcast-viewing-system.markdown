title: Broadcast viewing system
abstract: In a broadcast viewing system including a television receiver A and a recording/reproducing device B, the television receiver A and the recording/reproducing device B are connected by an HDMI cable. By using a remote control device C on the recording/reproducing device B side, a setting data required for viewing a broadcast is requested by using a control signal from the recording/reproducing device B side, and subsequently, the television receiver A replies with the setting data required for viewing a broadcast to the recording/reproducing device B by a control signal by using data required for viewing a broadcast set in the television receiver A side in advance through the HDMI cable. This simplifies the operation of setting for viewing a television program.
