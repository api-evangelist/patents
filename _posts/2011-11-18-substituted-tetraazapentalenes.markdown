title: Substituted tetraazapentalenes
abstract: Substituted tetraazapentalenes have two benzenoid rings and eight substitutable positions. Substitutions are made of hydrogen or Câ€”H groups in favor of amino groups, nitro groups or nitrogen atoms. The tetraazapentalenes are synthesized through an intermediate azo, which is made from a 1:1:1 molar ratio of a nitroaniline, sodium nitrite and an amine.

According to the '430 patent, an amine, which could be nitroaniline, is coupled with 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine. Sodium nitrite in an aqueous-mineral acid medium is used for diazotization of aminobenzenesulfonic or aminobenzenecarboxylic acid. In the disclosed method, 48 parts of 2-nitroaniline-4-sulfonic acid are dissolved in 750 parts by volume of water with 50 parts 30% sodium hydroxide. After filtration with 1 part of decolourising carbon, 110 parts of 30% hydrochloric acid are rapidly stirred into the clear solution. The suspension thereby obtained is cooled to 0\u00b0 C., and 50 parts by volume of 4N sodium nitrite solution is introduced at 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C. over the course of 15 minutes.

The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 C. Stirring is continued until the coupling is complete, and the coupling mixture is then warmed to 40\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 C. over the course of 1 hour. The coupling mixture is then filtered.
