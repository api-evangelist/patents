The government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to the production of one or more terpenoids through microbial engineering.","Terpenoids are a class of compounds with diverse uses, including in fragrances, cosmetics, food products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. Thus, methods for their efficient and cost effective production are needed.","For example, Taxol and its structural analogs have been recognized as the most potent and commercially successful anticancer drugs introduced in the last decade.Taxol was first isolated from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree,and early stage production methods required sacrificing two to four fully grown trees to supply sufficient dosage for one patient.Taxol's structural complexity necessitated a complex chemical synthesis route requiring 35-51 steps with highest yield of 0.4%.However, a semi-synthetic route was devised whereby the biosynthetic intermediate baccatin III was first isolated from plant sources and was subsequently converted to Taxol.While this approach and subsequent plant cell culture-based production efforts have decreased the need for harvesting the yew tree, production still depends on plant-based processeswith accompanying limitations of productivity and scalability, and constraints on the number of Taxol derivatives that can be synthesized in search for more efficacious drugs.","Methods for the production of terpenoids and derivatives of these compounds, and methods of making products that comprise such compounds, are needed.","Recent developments in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology offer new possibilities for the overproduction of complex natural products through more technically amenable microbial hosts.Although exciting progress has been made in the elucidation of the biosynthetic mechanism of Taxol in Taxus,commercially relevant Taxol-producing strains have eluded prior attempts aiming at the transfer of this complex biosynthetic machinery into a microbial host.Yet, as with other natural products, microbial production through metabolically engineered strains, offers attractive economics and great potential for synthesizing a diverse array of new compounds with anti-cancer and other pharmaceutical activity.","The metabolic pathway for Taxol and its analogs consists of an upstream isoprenoid pathway that is native to , and a heterologous downstream terpenoid pathway (). The upstream mevalonic acid (MVA) or methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways can produce the two common building blocks, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), from which Taxol and other isoprenoid compounds are formed.Recent studies have highlighted the engineering of the above upstream pathways to support biosynthesis of heterologous isoprenoids such as lycopene and artemisinic acid.The downstream taxadiene pathway has been reconstructed in , but, to-date, titers have not exceeded 1.3 mg\/L.","The above rational metabolic engineering approaches focused on either the upstream (MVA or MEP) or the downstream terpenoid pathway, implicitly assuming that modifications are additive, i.e. a linear behavior.While this approach can yield moderate increases in flux, it generally ignores non-specific effects, such as toxicity of intermediate metabolites, cellular effects of the vectors used for expression, and hidden unknown pathways that may compete with the main pathway and divert flux away from the desired target. Combinatorial approaches can avoid such problems as they offer the opportunity to adequately sample the parameter space and elucidate these complex non-linear interactions.However, they require a high throughput screen, which is often not available for many desirable natural products.Yet another class of pathway optimization methods has explored the combinatorial space of different sources of the heterologous genes comprising the pathway of interest.Still dependent on a high throughput assay, these methods generally ignore the need for determining an optimal level of expression for the individual pathway genes and, as such, have proven less effective in structuring an optimal pathway.","In the present work, as an example of aspects of the invention, we focus on the optimal balancing between the upstream, IPP-forming pathway with the downstream terpenoid pathway of taxadiene synthesis. This is achieved by grouping the nine-enzyme pathway into two modules\u2014a four-gene, upstream, native (MEP) pathway module and a two-gene, downstream, heterologous pathway to taxadiene (). Using this basic configuration, parameters such as the effect of plasmid copy number on cell physiology, gene order and promoter strength in an expression cassette, and chromosomal integration are evaluated with respect to their effect on taxadiene production. This modular and multivariable combinatorial approach allows us to efficiently sample the main parameters affecting pathway flux without the need for a high throughput screen. The multivariate search across multiple promoters and copy numbers for each pathway module reveals a highly non-linear taxadiene flux landscape with a global maximum exhibiting a 15,000 fold increase in taxadiene production over the control, yielding 300 mg\/L production of taxadiene in small-scale fermentations. Further, we have engineered the P450 based oxidation chemistry in Taxol biosynthesis in , with our engineered strains improving the taxadien-5\u03b1-ol production 2400-fold over the state of the art. These improvements unlock the potential for the large scale production of thousands of valuable terpenoids by well-established microbial systems.","Aspects of the invention relate to methods involving recombinantly expressing a taxadiene synthase enzyme and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) enzyme in a cell that overexpresses one or more components of the non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway.

However, reliable and cost-efficient production of Taxol or Taxol analogs by traditional production routes from plant extracts is limited. Here, we report a multivariate-modular approach to metabolic pathway engineering to amplify by 15000 fold the production of taxadiene in an engineered . Taxadiene, the first committed Taxol intermediate, is the biosynthetic product of the non-mevalonate pathway in comprising two modules: the native upstream pathway forming Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate (IPP) and a heterologous downstream terpenoid-forming pathway. Systematic multivariate search identified conditions that optimally balance the two pathway modules to minimize accumulation of inhibitory intermediates and flux diversion to side products. We also engineered the next step, after taxadiene, in Taxol biosynthesis, a P450-based oxidation step, that yielded >98% substrate conversion and present the first example of in vivo production of any functionalized Taxol intermediates in . The modular pathway engineering approach not only highlights the complexity of multi-step pathways, but also allowed accumulation of high taxadiene and taxadien-5\u03b1-ol titers (\u02dc300 mg\/L and 60 mg\/L, respectively) in small-scale fermentations, thus exemplifying the potential of microbial production of Taxol and its derivatives.","This invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d or \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d \u201cinvolving,\u201d and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.","Microbial production of terpenoids such as taxadiene is demonstrated herein. When expressed at satisfactory levels, microbial routes reduce dramatically the cost of production of such compounds. Additionally, they utilize cheap, abundant and renewable feedstocks (such as sugars and other carbohydrates) and can be the source for the synthesis of numerous to derivatives that may exhibit far superior properties than the original compound. A key element in the cost-competitive production of compounds of the isoprenoid pathway using a microbial route is the amplification of this pathway in order to allow the overproduction of these molecules. Described herein are methods that enhance or amplify the flux towards terpenoid production in (). Specifically, methods are provided to amplify the metabolic flux to the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) (a key intermediate for the production of isoprenoid compounds), dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), and farnesyl geranyl diphosphate (FGPP), paclitaxel (Taxol), ginkolides, geraniol, farnesol, geranylgeraniol, linalool, isoprene, monoterpenoids such as menthol, carotenoids such as lycopene, polyisoprenoids such as polyisoprene or natural rubber, diterpenoids such as eleutherobin, and sesquiterpenoids such as artemisinin.","Aspects of the invention relate to the production of terpenoids. As used herein, a terpenoid, also referred to as an isoprenoid, is an organic chemical derived from a five-carbon isoprene unit. Several non-limiting examples of terpenoids, classified based on the number of isoprene units that they contain, include: hemiterpenoids (1 isoprene unit), monoterpenoids (2 isoprene units), sesquiterpenoids (3 isoprene units), diterpenoids (4 isoprene units), sesterterpenoids (5 isoprene units), triterpenoids (6 isoprene units), tetraterpenoids (8 isoprene units), and polyterpenoids with a larger number of isoprene units. In some embodiments, the terpenoid that is produced is taxadiene. In some embodiments, the terpenoid that is produced is Citronellol, Cubebol, Nootkatone, Cineol, Limonene, Eleutherobin, Sarcodictyin, Pseudopterosins, Ginkgolides, Stevioside, Rebaudioside A, sclareol, labdenediol, levopimaradiene, sandracopimaradiene or isopemaradiene.","Described herein are methods and compositions for optimizing production of terpenoids in cells by controlling expression of genes or proteins participating in an upstream pathway and a downstream pathway. The upstream pathway involves production of isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which can be achieved by two different metabolic pathways: the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and the MEP (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate) pathway, also called the MEP\/DOXP (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate\/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate) pathway, the non-mevalonate pathway or the mevalonic acid-independent pathway.","The downstream pathway is a synthetic pathway that leads to production of a terpenoids and involves recombinant gene expression of a terpenoid synthase (also referred to as terpene cyclase) enzyme, and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) enzyme. In some embodiments, a terpenoid synthase enzyme is a diterpenoid synthase enzyme. Several non-limiting examples of diterpenoid synthase enzymes include casbene synthase, taxadiene synthase, levopimaradiene synthase, abietadiene synthase, isopimaradiene synthase, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, syn-stemar-13-ene synthase, syn-stemod-13(17)-ene synthase, syn-pimara-7,15-diene synthase, ent-sandaracopimaradiene synthase, ent-cassa-12,15-diene synthase, ent-pimara-8(14), 15-diene synthase, ent-kaur-15-ene synthase, ent-kaur-16-ene synthase, aphidicolan-16\u03b2-ol synthase, phyllocladan-16\u03b1-ol synthase, fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene synthase, and terpentetriene cyclase.","Surprisingly, as demonstrated in the Examples section, optimization of terpenoid synthesis by manipulation of the upstream and downstream pathways described herein, was not a simple linear or additive process. Rather, through complex combinatorial analysis, optimization was achieved through balancing components of the upstream and downstream pathways. Unexpectedly, as demonstrated in , taxadiene accumulation exhibited a strong non-linear dependence on the relative strengths of the upstream MEP and downstream synthetic taxadiene pathways.","Aspects of the invention relate to controlling the expression of genes and proteins in the MEP pathway for optimized production of a terpenoid such as taxadiene. Optimized production of a terpenoid refers to producing a higher amount of a terpenoid following pursuit of an optimization strategy than would be achieved in the absence of such a strategy. It should be appreciated that any gene and\/or protein within the MEP pathway is encompassed by methods and compositions described herein. In some embodiments, a gene within the MEP pathway is one of the following: dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, idi, ispA or ispB. Expression of one or more genes and\/or proteins within the MEP pathway can be upregulated and\/or downregulated. In certain embodiments, upregulation of one or more genes and\/or proteins within the MEP pathway can be combined with downregulation of one or more genes and\/or proteins within the MEP pathway.","It should be appreciated that genes and\/or proteins can be regulated alone or in combination. For example, the expression of dxs can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, idi, ispA and ispB. The expression of ispC can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, idi, ispA and ispB. The expression of ispD can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, idi, ispA and ispB. The expression of ispE can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispF, ispG, ispH, idi, ispA and ispB. The expression of ispF can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispG, ispH, idi, ispA and ispB. The expression of ispG can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispH, idi, ispA and ispB. The expression of ispH can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, idi, ispA and ispB. The expression of idi can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, ispA and ispB. The expression of ispA can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, idi and ispB. The expression of ispB can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, idi and ispA. In some embodiments, expression of the gene and\/or protein of one or more of dxs, ispC, ispD, ispE, ispF, ispG, ispH, and idi is upregulated while expression of the gene and\/or protein of ispA and\/or ispB is down-regulated.","Expression of genes within the MEP pathway can be regulated in a modular method. As used herein, regulation by a modular method refers to regulation of multiple genes together. For example, in some embodiments, multiple genes within the MEP pathway are recombinantly expressed on a contiguous region of DNA, such as an operon. It should be appreciated that a cell that expresses such a module can also express one or more other genes within the MEP pathway either recombinantly or endogenously.","A non-limiting example of a module of genes within the MEP pathway is a module containing the genes dxs, idi, ispD and ispF, as presented in the Examples section, and referred to herein as dxs-idi-ispDF. It should be appreciated that modules of genes within the MEP pathway, consistent with aspects of the invention, can contain any of the genes within the MEP pathway, in any order.","Expression of genes and proteins within the downstream synthetic terpenoid synthesis pathway can also be regulated in order to optimize terpenoid production. The synthetic downstream terpenoid synthesis pathway involves recombinant expression of a terpenoid synthase enzyme and a GGPPS enzyme. Any terpenoid synthase enzyme, as discussed above, can be expressed with GGPPS depending on the downstream product to be produced. For example, taxadiene synthase is used for the production of taxadiene. Recombinant expression of the taxadiene synthase enzyme and the GGPPS enzyme can be regulated independently or together. In some embodiments the two enzymes are regulated together in a modular fashion. For example the two enzymes can be expressed in an operon in either order (GGPPS-TS, referred to as \u201cGT,\u201d or TS-GGPPS, referred to as \u201cTG\u201d).","Manipulation of the expression of genes and\/or proteins, including modules such as the dxs-idi-ispDF operon, and the TS-GGPPS operon, can be achieved through methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, expression of the genes or operons can be regulated through selection of promoters, such as inducible promoters, with different strengths. Several non-limiting examples of promoters include Trc, T5 and T7. Additionally, expression of genes or operons can be regulated through manipulation of the copy number of the gene or operon in the cell. For example, in certain embodiments, a strain containing an additional copy of the dxs-idi-ispDF operon on its chromosome under Trc promoter control produces an increased amount of taxadiene relative to one overexpressing only the synthetic downstream pathway. In some embodiments, expression of genes or operons can be regulated through manipulating the order of the genes within a module. For example, in certain embodiments, changing the order of the genes in a downstream synthetic operon from GT to TG results in a 2-3 fold increase in taxadiene production. In some embodiments, expression of genes or operons is regulated through integration of one or more genes or operons into a chromosome. For example, in certain embodiments, integration of the upstream dxs-idi-ispDF operon into the chromosome of a cell results in increased taxadiene production.","It should be appreciated that the genes associated with the invention can be obtained from a variety of sources. In some embodiments, the genes within the MEP pathway are bacterial genes such as genes. In some embodiments, the gene encoding for to GGPPS is a plant gene. For example, the gene encoding for GGPPS can be from a species of such as (). In some embodiments, the gene encoding for taxadiene synthase is a plant gene. For example, the gene encoding for taxadiene synthase can be from a species of such as (). Representative GenBank Accession numbers for GGPPS and taxadiene synthase are provided by AF081514 and U48796, the sequences of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","As one of ordinary skill in the art would be aware, homologous genes for use in methods associated with the invention can be obtained from other species and can be identified by homology searches, for example through a protein BLAST search, available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) internet site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Genes and\/or operons associated with the invention can be cloned, for example by PCR amplification and\/or restriction digestion, from DNA from any source of DNA which contains the given gene. In some embodiments, a gene and\/or operon associated with the invention is synthetic. Any means of obtaining a gene and\/or operon associated with the invention is compatible with the instant invention.","In some embodiments, further optimization of terpenoid production is achieved by modifying a gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell. In some embodiments, the GGPPS enzyme has one or more of the follow mutations: A162V, G140C, L182M, F218Y, D160G, C184S, K367R, A151T, M185I, D264Y, E368D, C184R, L331I, G262V, R365S, A114D, S239C, G295D, 1276V, K343N, P183S, I172T, D267G, 1149V, T234I, E153D and T259A. In some embodiments, the GGPPS enzyme has a mutation in residue S239 and\/or residue G295. In certain embodiments, the GGPPS enzyme has the mutation S239C and\/or G295D.","In some embodiments, modification of a gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell involves codon optimization for expression in a bacterial cell. Codon usages for a variety of organisms can be accessed in the Codon Usage Database (www.kazusa.or.jp\/codon\/). Codon optimization, including identification of optimal codons for a variety of organisms, and methods for achieving codon optimization, are familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art, and can be achieved using standard methods.","In some embodiments, modifying a gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell involves making one or more mutations in the gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell. For example, a mutation can involve a substitution or deletion of a single nucleotide or multiple nucleotides. In some embodiments, a mutation of one or more nucleotides in a gene will result in a mutation in the protein produced from the gene, such as a substitution or deletion of one or more amino acids.","In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to use a cell that has been optimized for production of a terpenoid. For example, in some embodiments, a cell that overexpresses one or more components of the non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway is used, at least in part, to amplify isopentyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), substrates of GGPPS. In some embodiments, overexpression of one or more components of the non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway is achieved by increasing the copy number of one or more components of the non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway. For example, copy numbers of components at rate-limiting steps in the MEP pathway such as (dxs, ispD, ispF, idi) can be amplified, such as by additional episomal expression.","In some embodiments \u201crational design\u201d is involved in constructing specific mutations in proteins such as enzymes. As used herein, \u201crational design\u201d refers to incorporating knowledge of the enzyme, or related enzymes, such as its three dimensional structure, its active site(s), its substrate(s) and\/or the interaction between the enzyme and substrate, into the design of the specific mutation. Based on a rational design approach, mutations can be created in an enzyme which can then be screened for increased production of a terpenoid relative to control levels. In some embodiments, mutations can be rationally designed based on homology modeling. As used herein, \u201chomology modeling\u201d refers to the process of constructing an atomic resolution model of one protein from its amino acid sequence and a three-dimensional structure of a related homologous protein.","In some embodiments, random mutations can be made in a gene, such as a gene encoding for an enzyme, and these mutations can be screened for increased production of a terpenoid relative to control levels. For example, screening for mutations in components of the MEP pathway, or components of other pathways, that lead to enhanced production of a terpenoid may be conducted through a random mutagenesis screen, or through screening of known mutations. In some embodiments, shotgun cloning of genomic fragments could be used to identify genomic regions that lead to an increase in production of a terpenoid, through screening cells or organisms that have these fragments for increased production of a terpenoid. In some cases one or more mutations may be combined in the same cell or organism.","In some embodiments, production of a terpenoid in a cell can be increased through manipulation of enzymes that act in the same pathway as the enzymes associated with the invention. For example, in some embodiments it may be advantageous to increase expression of an enzyme or other factor that acts upstream of a target enzyme such as an enzyme associated with the invention. This could be achieved by over-expressing the upstream factor using any standard method.","Optimization of protein expression can also be achieved through selection of appropriate promoters and ribosome binding sites. In some embodiments, this may include the selection of high-copy number plasmids, or low or medium-copy number plasmids. The step of transcription termination can also be targeted for regulation of gene expression, through the introduction or elimination of structures such as stem-loops.","Aspects of the invention relate to expression of recombinant genes in cells. The invention encompasses any type of cell that recombinantly expresses genes associated with the invention, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In some embodiments the cell is a bacterial cell, such as spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp. and spp. The bacterial cell can be a Gram-negative cell such as an () cell, or a Gram-positive cell such as a species of . In other embodiments, the cell is a fungal cell such as a yeast cell, e.g., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., and industrial polyploid yeast strains. Preferably the yeast strain is a strain or a spp. strain. Other examples of fungi include spp., to spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., spp., and spp. In other embodiments, the cell is an algal cell, or a plant cell. It should be appreciated that some cells compatible with the invention may express an endogenous copy of one or more of the genes associated with the invention as well as a recombinant copy. In some embodiments, if a cell has an endogenous copy of one or more of the genes associated with the invention then the methods will not necessarily require adding a recombinant copy of the gene(s) that are endogenously expressed. In some embodiments the cell may endogenously express one or more enzymes from the pathways described herein and may recombinantly express one or more other enzymes from the pathways described herein for efficient production of a terpenoid.","Further aspects of the invention relate to screening for bacterial cells or strains that exhibit optimized terpenoid production. As described above, methods associated with the invention involve generating cells that overexpress one or more genes in the MEP pathway. Terpenoid production from culturing of such cells can be measured and compared to a control cell wherein a cell that exhibits a higher amount of a terpenoid production relative to a control cell is selected as a first improved cell. The cell can be further modified by recombinant expression of a terpenoid synthase enzyme and a GGPPS enzyme. The level of expression of one or more of the components of the non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway, the terpenoid synthase enzyme and\/or the GGPPS enzyme in the cell can then be manipulated and terpenoid production can be measured again, leading to selection of a second improved cell that produces greater amounts of a terpenoid than the first improved cell. In some embodiments, the terpenoid synthase enzyme is a taxadiene synthase enzyme.","Further aspects of the invention relate to the identification and characterization (via GC-MS) of a previously unknown metabolite in bacterial cells (). The level of accumulation of the newly identified metabolite, indole, can be controlled by genetically manipulating the microbial pathway by the overexpression, down regulation or mutation of the isoprenoid pathway genes. The metabolite indole anti-correlates as a direct variable to the taxadiene production in engineered strains (,  and ). Further controlling the accumulation of indole for improving the flux towards terpenoid biosynthesis in bacterial systems (specifically in cells, such as cells) or other cells, can be achieved by balancing the upstream non-mevalonate isoprenoid pathway with the downstream product synthesis pathways or by modifications to or regulation of the indole pathway. In so doing, the skilled person can reduce or control the accumulation of indole and thereby reduce the inhibitory effect of indole on the production of taxadiene, and other terpenoids derived from the described pathways, such as: monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids (including amorphadiene), diterpenoids (including levopimaradiene), triterpenes, and tetraterpenes. Other methods for reducing or controlling the accumulation of indole include removing the accumulated indole from the fermentation through chemical methods such as by using absorbents, scavengers, etc.","In other embodiments, methods are provided that include measuring the amount or concentration of indole in a cell that produces one or more terpenoids or in a culture of the cells that produce one or more terpenoids. The amount or concentration of indole can be measured once, or two or more times, as suitable, using methods known in the art and as described herein. Such methods can be used to guide processes of producing one or more terpenoids, e.g., in process improvement. Such methods can be used to guide strain construction, e.g., for strain improvement.","The identification of the means to achieve this balancing yielded a 15000 fold improvement in the overproduction of terpenoids such as taxadiene, compared to wild type bacterial cells, expressed with a heterologous taxadiene biosynthetic pathway. The production was further increased through modified fermentation methods that yielded concentrations of approximately 2 g\/L, which is 1500 fold higher compared to any prior reported taxadiene production. As demonstrated herein, by genetically engineering the non-mevalonate isoprenoid pathway in the accumulation of this metabolite can now be controlled which regulates the flux towards the isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacterial cells. Also demonstrated herein is further channeling of the taxadiene production into the next key precursor to Taxol, taxadien-5\u03b1-ol, achieved through engineering the oxidation chemistry for Taxol biosynthesis. Example 5 presents the first successful extension of the synthetic pathway from taxadiene to taxadien-5\u03b1-ol. Similar to the majority of other terpenoids, the Taxol biosynthesis follows the unified fashion of \u201ctwo phase\u201d biosynthetic process, (i) the \u201ccyclase phase\u201d of linear coupling of the prenyl precursors (IPP and DMAPP) to GGPP followed by the molecular cyclization and rearrangement for the committed precursor taxadiene (, VIII-IX).After the committed precursor, (ii) the \u201coxidation phase\u201d, the cyclic olefin taxadiene core structure is then functionalized by seven cytochrome P450 oxygenases together with its redox partners, decorated with two acetate groups and a benzoate group by acyl and aroyl CoA-dependent transferases, keto group by keto-oxidase, and epoxide group by epoxidase lead to the late intermediate baccatin III, to which the C13 side chain is attached for Taxol ((, X-XIII).Although a rough sequential order of the early oxidation phase reactions are predicted, the precise timing\/order of some of the hydroxylations, acylations and benzoylation reactions are uncertain. However it is clear that the early bifurcation starts from the cytochrome p450 mediated hydroxylation of taxadiene core at C5 position followed the downstream hydroxylations using a homologous family of cytochrome p450 enzymes with high deduced similarity to each other (>70%) but with limited resemblance (<30%) to other plant p450's.In addition, the structural and functional diversity with the possible evolutionary analysis implicit that the taxadiene-5\u03b1-ol gene can be the parental sequence from which the other hydroxylase genes in the Taxol biosynthetic pathway evolved, reflecting the order of hydroxylations.","Further aspects of the invention relate to chimeric P450 enzymes. Functional expression of plant cytochrome P450 has been considered challenging due to the inherent limitations of bacterial platforms, such as the absence of electron transfer machinery, cytochrome P450 reductases, and translational incompatibility of the membrane signal modules of P450 enzymes due to the lack of an endoplasmic reticulum.","In some embodiments, the taxadiene-5\u03b1-hydroxylase associated with methods of the invention is optimized through N-terminal transmembrane engineering and\/or the generation of chimeric enzymes through translational fusion with a CPR redox partner. In some embodiments, the CPR redox partner is a cytochrome P450 reductase (TCPR; ). In certain embodiments, cytochrome P450 taxadiene-5\u03b1-hydroxylase (T5\u03b1OH) is obtained from (GenBank Accession number AY289209, the sequence of which is incorporated by reference herein). In some embodiments, NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (TCPR) is obtained from (GenBank Accession number AY571340, the sequence of which is incorporated by reference herein).","The taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase and TCPR can be joined by a linker such as GSTGS (SEQ ID NO:50). In some embodiments, taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase and\/or TCPR are truncated to remove all or part of the transmembrane region of one or both proteins. For example, taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase in some embodiments is truncated to remove 8, 24, or 42 N-terminal amino acids. In some embodiments, the N-terminal 74 amino acids of TCPR are truncated. An additional peptide can also be fused to taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase. For example, one or more amino acids from bovine 17\u03b1 hydroxylase can be added to taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase. In certain embodiments, the peptide MALLLAVF (SEQ ID NO:51) is added to taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase. A non-limiting example of polypeptide comprising taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase fused to TCPR is At24T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR.","In some embodiments, the chimeric enzyme is able to carry out the first oxidation step with more than 10% taxadiene conversion to taxadiene-5\u03b1-ol and the byproduct 5(12)-Oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane. For example, the percent taxadiene conversion to taxadiene-5\u03b1-ol and the byproduct 5(12)-Oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane can be at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, approximately 99% or approximately 100%.","In certain embodiments, the chimeric enzyme is At245\u03b1OH-tTCPR, which was found to be capable of carrying out the first oxidation step with more than 98% taxadiene conversion to taxadiene-5\u03b1-ol and the byproduct 5(12)-Oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane (OCT; ). Engineering of the step of taxadiene-5\u03b1-ol production is critical in the production of Taxol and was found to be limiting in previous efforts to construct this pathway in yeast. The engineered construct developed herein demonstrated greater than 98% conversion of taxadiene in vivo with a 2400 fold improvement over previous heterologous expression in yeast. Thus, in addition to synthesizing significantly greater amounts of key Taxol intermediates, this study also provides the basis for the synthesis of subsequent metabolites in the pathway by similar P450 chemistry.","As used herein, the terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cpolypeptide\u201d are used interchangeably and thus the term polypeptide may be used to refer to a full-length polypeptide and may also be used to refer to a fragment of a full-length polypeptide. As used herein with respect to polypeptides, proteins, or fragments thereof, \u201cisolated\u201d means separated from its native environment and present in sufficient quantity to permit its identification or use. Isolated, when referring to a protein or polypeptide, means, for example: (i) selectively produced by expression cloning or (ii) purified as by chromatography or electrophoresis. Isolated proteins or polypeptides may be, but need not be, substantially pure. The term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d means that the proteins or polypeptides are essentially free of other substances with which they may be found in production, nature, or in vivo systems to an extent practical and appropriate for their intended use. Substantially pure polypeptides may be obtained naturally or produced using methods described herein and may be purified with techniques well known in the art. Because an isolated protein may be admixed with other components in a preparation, the protein may comprise only a small percentage by weight of the preparation. The protein is nonetheless isolated in that it has been separated from the substances with which it may be associated in living systems, i.e. isolated from other proteins.","The invention also encompasses nucleic acids that encode for any of the polypeptides described herein, libraries that contain any of the nucleic acids and\/or polypeptides described herein, and compositions that contain any of the nucleic acids and\/or polypeptides described herein.","In some embodiments, one or more of the genes associated with the invention is expressed in a recombinant expression vector. As used herein, a \u201cvector\u201d may be any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence or sequences may be inserted by restriction and ligation for transport between different genetic environments or for expression in a host cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA, although RNA vectors are also available. Vectors include, but are not limited to: plasmids, fosmids, phagemids, virus genomes and artificial chromosomes.","A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate autonomously or integrated in the genome in a host cell, and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids, replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host cell such as a host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage, replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase.","An expression vector is one into which a desired DNA sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences and may be expressed as an RNA transcript. Vectors may further contain one or more marker sequences suitable for use in the identification of cells which have or have not been transformed or transfected with the vector. Markers include, for example, genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds, genes which encode enzymes whose activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art to (e.g., \u03b2-galactosidase, luciferase or alkaline phosphatase), and genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells, hosts, colonies or plaques (e.g., green fluorescent protein). Preferred vectors are those capable of autonomous replication and expression of the structural gene products present in the DNA segments to which they are operably joined.","As used herein, a coding sequence and regulatory sequences are said to be \u201coperably\u201d joined when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequences. If it is desired that the coding sequences be translated into a functional protein, two DNA sequences are said to be operably joined if induction of a promoter in the 5\u2032 regulatory sequences results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequences, or (3) interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a promoter region would be operably joined to a coding sequence if the promoter region were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence such that the resulting transcript can be translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.","When the nucleic acid molecule that encodes any of the enzymes of the claimed invention is expressed in a cell, a variety of transcription control sequences (e.g., promoter\/enhancer sequences) can be used to direct its expression. The promoter can be a native promoter, i.e., the promoter of the gene in its endogenous context, which provides normal regulation of expression of the gene. In some embodiments the promoter can be constitutive, i.e., the promoter is unregulated allowing for continual transcription of its associated gene. A variety of conditional promoters also can be used, such as promoters controlled by the presence or absence of a molecule.","The precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types, but shall in general include, as necessary, 5\u2032 non-transcribed and 5\u2032 non-translated sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like. In particular, such 5\u2032 non-transcribed regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined gene. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences as desired. The vectors of the invention may optionally include 5\u2032 leader or signal sequences. The choice and design of an appropriate vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art.","Expression vectors containing all the necessary elements for expression are commercially available and known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., , Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989. Cells are genetically engineered by the introduction into the cells of heterologous DNA (RNA). That heterologous DNA (RNA) is placed under operable control of transcriptional elements to permit the expression of the heterologous DNA in the host cell. Heterologous expression of genes associated with the invention, for production of a terpenoid, such as taxadiene, is demonstrated in the Examples section using . The novel method for producing terpenoids can also be expressed in other bacterial cells, fungi (including yeast cells), plant cells, etc.","A nucleic acid molecule that encodes an enzyme associated with the invention can be introduced into a cell or cells using methods and techniques that are standard in the art. For example, nucleic acid molecules can be introduced by standard protocols such as transformation including chemical transformation and electroporation, transduction, particle bombardment, etc. Expressing the nucleic acid molecule encoding the enzymes of the claimed invention also may be accomplished by integrating the nucleic acid molecule into the genome.","In some embodiments one or more genes associated with the invention is expressed recombinantly in a bacterial cell. Bacterial cells according to the invention can be cultured in media of any type (rich or minimal) and any composition. As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, routine optimization would allow for use of a variety of types of media. The selected medium can be supplemented with various additional components. Some non-limiting examples of supplemental components include glucose, antibiotics, IPTG for gene induction, ATCC Trace Mineral Supplement, and glycolate. Similarly, other aspects of the medium, and growth conditions of the cells of the invention may be optimized through routine experimentation. For example, pH and temperature are non-limiting examples of factors which can be optimized. In some embodiments, factors such as choice of media, media supplements, and temperature can influence production levels of terpenoids, such as taxadiene. In some embodiments the concentration and amount of a supplemental component may be optimized. In some embodiments, how often the media is supplemented with one or more supplemental components, and the amount of time that the media is cultured before harvesting a terpenoid, such as taxadiene, is optimized.","According to aspects of the invention, high titers of a terpenoid (such as but not limited to taxadiene), are produced through the recombinant expression of genes as described herein, in a cell expressing components of the MEP pathway, and one or more downstream genes for the production of a terpenoid (or related compounds) from the products of the MEP pathway. As used herein \u201chigh titer\u201d refers to a titer in the milligrams per liter (mg L) scale. The titer produced for a given product will be influenced by multiple factors including choice of media. In some embodiments, the total titer of a terpenoid or derivative is at least 1 mg L. In some embodiments, the total terpenoid or derivative titer is at least 10 mg L. In some embodiments, the total terpenoid or derivative titer is at least 250 mg L. For example, the total terpenoid or derivative titer can be at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 525, 550, 575, 600, 625, 650, 675, 700, 725, 750, 775, 800, 825, 850, 875, 900 or more than 900 mg Lincluding any intermediate values. In some embodiments, the total terpenoid or derivative titer can be at least 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, or more than 5.0 g Lincluding any intermediate values.","In some embodiments, the total taxadiene 5\u03b1-ol titer is at least 1 mg L. In some embodiments, the total taxadiene 5\u03b1-ol titer is at least 10 mg L. In some embodiments, the total taxadiene 5\u03b1-ol titer is at least 50 mg L. For example, the total taxadiene 5\u03b1-ol titer can be at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, or more than 70 mg Lincluding any intermediate values.","The liquid cultures used to grow cells associated with the invention can be housed in any of the culture vessels known and used in the art. In some embodiments large scale production in an aerated reaction vessel such as a stirred tank reactor can be used to produce large quantities of terpenoids, such as taxadiene, that can be recovered from the cell culture. In some embodiments, the terpenoid is recovered from the gas phase of the cell culture, for example by adding an organic layer such as dodecane to the cell culture and recovering the terpenoid from the organic layer.","Terpenoids, such as taxadiene, produced through methods described herein have widespread applications including pharmaceuticals such as paclitaxel (Taxol), artemisinin, ginkolides, eleutherobin and pseudopterosins, and many other potential pharmaceutical compounds. Further applications include compounds used in flavors and cosmetics such as geraniol, farnesol, geranlygeraniol, linalool, limonene, pinene, cineol and isoprene. Further applications include compounds for use as biofuels such as alcohols of 5, 10, and 15 carbon atom length. It is noted that the above compounds are presently produced as extracts of various plants. Plant extract-based methods are tedious, yield very small amounts and are limited as to the actual molecules that can be so obtained, namely, they do not allow the easy production of derivatives that may possess far superior properties than the original compounds.","In one aspect, the invention provides a method for making a product containing a terpenoid or terpenoid derivative. The method according to this aspect comprises increasing terpenoid production in a cell that produces one or more terpenoids by controlling the accumulation of indole in the cell or in a culture of the cells. The terpenoid, or a derivative of the terpenoid prepared through one or more chemical or enzymatic steps, is incorporated into a product to thereby make the product containing a terpenoid or terpenoid derivative. According to this aspect, the cell expressed components of the MEP pathway, and may be a bacterial cell such as or . In various embodiments, the accumulation of indole in the cell or in a culture of the cells is controlled at least in part by balancing an upstream non-mevalonate isoprenoid pathway with a downstream heterologous terpenoid synthesis pathway. For example, the upstream non-mevalonate isoprenoid pathway may be balanced with respect to the downstream heterologous terpenoid synthesis pathway by one or more of:\n\n","In some embodiments, the cell comprises at least one additional copy of at least one of dxs, idi, ispD, and ispF. For example, the cell may comprise a heterologous dxs-idi-ispDF operon.","According to embodiments of this aspect, indole accumulates in the culture at less than 100 mg\/L, or in certain embodiments, at less than 50 mg\/L, at less than 10 mg\/L, or at less than 1 mg\/L, or less than 0.5 mg\/L, or less than 0.1 mg\/L. As an alternative, or in addition to balancing the upstream and downstream pathways, the accumulation of indole in the cell or in a culture of the cells may comprise modifying or regulating the cell's indole pathway.

This is attributed to an initial limitation of taxadiene production by low expression levels of the downstream pathway, which is thus rate limiting with respect to taxadiene production. At high levels of downstream pathway expression we are likely seeing the negative effect of high copy number on cell physiology, hence, a maximum exists with respect to downstream pathway expression. These results demonstrate that dramatic changes in taxadiene accumulation can be obtained from changes within a narrow window of expression levels for the upstream and downstream pathways. For example, a strain containing an additional copy of the upstream pathway on its chromosome under Trc promoter control (Strain 8, ) produced 2000 fold more taxadiene than one overexpressing only the synthetic downstream pathway (Strain 1, ). Furthermore, changing the order of the genes in the downstream synthetic operon from GT (GPPS-TS) to TG (TS-GPPS) resulted in 2-3-fold increase (strains 1-4 compared to 5, 8, 11 and 14). The observed results show that the key to taxadiene overproduction is ample downstream pathway capacity and careful balancing between the upstream precursor pathway with the downstream synthetic taxadiene pathway. Altogether, the engineered strains established that the MEP pathway flux can be substantial, if a wide range of expression levels for the endogenous upstream and synthetic downstream pathway are searched simultaneously.","To provide ample downstream pathway strength while minimizing the plasmid-borne metabolic burden, two new sets of 4 strains each were engineered (strains 25-28 and 29-32) in which the downstream pathway was placed under the control of a strong promoter (T7) while keeping a relatively low number of 5 and 10 copies, respectively. It can be seen () that, while the taxadiene maximum is maintained at high downstream strength (strains 21-24), a monotonic response is obtained at the low downstream pathway strength (strains 17-20, ). This observation prompted the construction of two additional sets of 4 strains each that maintained the same level of downstream pathway strength as before but expressed very low levels of the upstream pathway (strains 25-28 and 29-32, ). Additionally, the operon of the upstream pathway of the latter strain set was chromosomally integrated. It can be seen that not only is the taxadiene maximum recovered, albeit at very low upstream pathway levels, but a much greater taxadiene maximum is attained (300 mg\/L). We believe this significant increase can be attributed to a decrease in cell's metabolic burden. This was achieved by 1) eliminating plasmid dependence through integration of the pathway into the chromosome and 2) attaining a fine balance between the upstream and downstream pathway expression.","The 32 recombinant constructs allowed us to adequately probe the modular pathway expression space and amplify \u02dc15000 fold improvement in taxadiene production. This is by far the highest production of terpenoids from MEP isoprenoid pathway reported (). Additionally, the observed fold improvements in terpenoid production are significantly higher than those of reported combinatorial metabolic engineering approaches that searched an extensive genetic space comprising up to a billion combinatorial variants of the isoprenoid pathway.This suggests that pathway optimization depends far more on fine balancing of the expression of pathway modules than multi-source combinatorial gene optimization. The multiple maxima exhibited in the phenotypic landscape of  underscores the importance of probing the expression space at sufficient resolution to identify the region of optimum overall pathway performance.  depicts the fold improvements in taxadiene production from the modular pathway expression search.","Metabolomic analysis of the previous engineered strains identified an, as yet, unknown, metabolite byproduct that correlated strongly with pathway expression levels and taxadiene production ( and ). Although the chemical identity of the metabolite was unknown, we hypothesized that it is an isoprenoid side-product, resulting from pathway diversion and has been anti-correlated as a direct variable to the taxadiene production ( and ) from the engineered strains. A critical attribute of our optimal strains is the fine balancing that alleviates the accumulation of this metabolite, resulting in higher taxadiene production. This balancing can be modulated at different levels from chromosome, or different copy number plasmids, using different promoters, with significantly different taxadiene accumulation.","Subsequently the corresponding peak in the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) chromatogram was identified as indole by GC-MS, H and C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies (). We found that taxadiene synthesis by strain 26 is severely inhibited by exogenous indole at indole levels higher than \u02dc100 mg\/L (). Further increasing the indole concentration also inhibited cell growth, with the level of inhibition being very strain dependent (). Although the biochemical mechanism of indole interaction with the isoprenoid pathway is presently unclear, the results in  suggest a possible synergistic effect between indole and terpenoid compounds of the isoprenoid pathway in inhibiting cell growth. Without knowing the specific mechanism, it appears strain 26 has mitigated the indole's effect, which we carried forward for further study.","In order to explore the taxadiene producing potential under controlled conditions for the engineered strains, fed batch cultivations of the three highest taxadiene accumulating strains (\u02dc60 mg\/L from strain 22; \u02dc125 mg\/L from strain 17; \u02dc300 mg\/L from strain 26) were carried out in 1 L-bioreactors (). The fed batch cultivation studies were carried out as liquid-liquid two-phase fermentation using a 20% (v\/v) dodecane overlay. The organic solvent was introduced to prevent air stripping of secreted taxadiene from the fermentation medium, as indicated by preliminary findings. In defined media with controlled glycerol feeding, taxadiene productivity increased to 174\u00b15 mg\/L (SD), 210\u00b17 mg\/L (SD), and 1020\u00b180 mg\/L (SD), respectively for strains 22, 17 and 26 (). Additionally, taxadiene production significantly affected the growth phenotype, acetate accumulation and glycerol consumption (-).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0224","num":"0230"},"figref":"FIG. 17","i":"c "},"At \u02dc48 hrs, the initial glycerol is depleted, and the cultivation switches to a fed-batch mode, during which low but constant glycerol levels are maintained. This results in a low overall glycerol flux, which, for strains with high MEP flux (strains 26 and 17), is mostly diverted to the MEP pathway while minimizing overflow metabolism. As a result acetic acid production is reduced or even totally eliminated. Regarding the decline in acetic acid concentration, it is possible that acetic acid assimilation may have happened to some extent, although this was not further investigated from a flux analysis standpoint. Some evaporation and dilution due to glycerol feed are further contributing to the observed acetic acid concentration decline. In contrast, for strains with low MEP flux (strain 22), flux diversion to the MEP pathway is not very significant, so that glycerol flux still supplies all the necessary carbon and energy requirements. Overflow metabolism continues to occur leading to acetate secretion.","Clearly the high productivity and more robust growth of strain 26 allowed very high taxadiene accumulation. Further improvements should be possible through optimizing conditions in the bioreactor, balancing nutrients in the growth medium, and optimizing carbon delivery.","For a more detailed understanding of the engineered balance in pathway expression, we quantified the transcriptional gene expression levels of dxs (upstream pathway) and TS (downstream pathway) for the highest taxadiene producing strains and neighboring strains from and (strains 17, 22 and 25-32) (). As we hypothesized, expression of the upstream pathway increased monotonically with promoter strength and copy number for the MEP vector from: native promoter, Trc, T5, T7, and 10 copy and 20 copy plasmids, as seen in the DXS expression (). Thus we found that dxs expression level correlates well with the upstream pathway strength. Similar correlations were found for the other genes of the upstream pathway, idi, ispD and ispF (). In the downstream gene expression, a fold improvement was quantified after transferring the pathway from 5 to 10 copy plasmid (25-28 series and 29-32 series) ().","While promoter and copy number effects influenced the gene expressions, secondary effects on the expression of the other pathway were also prominent. shows that for the same dxs expression cassettes, by increasing the copy number of the TS plasmid from 5 to 10, dxs expression was increased. Interestingly, the 5 copy TS plasmid (strains 25-28 series) contained substantially higher taxadiene yields () and less growth () than the 10 copy TS plasmid. Control plasmids that did not contain the taxadiene heterologous pathway, grew two fold higher densities, implying growth inhibition in the strains 25-28 series is directly related to the taxadiene metabolic pathway and the accumulation of taxadiene and its direct intermediates (). However the strain 29-32 series only showed modest increases in growth yield when comparing the empty control plasmids to the taxadiene expressing strains (). This interplay between growth, taxadiene production, and expression level can also be seen with the plasmid-based upstream expression vectors (strain 17 and 22). Growth inhibition was much larger in the 10 copy, high taxadiene producing strain (strain 17) compared to the 20 copy, lower taxadiene producing strain (strain 22) (). Therefore product toxicity and carbon diversion to the heterologous pathway are likely to impede growth, rather than plasmid-maintenance.","Also unexpected was the profound effect of the upstream expression vector on downstream expression. would have two straight lines, if there was no cross talk between the pathways. However, \u02dc3 fold changes in TS expression are observed for different MEP expression vectors. This is likely due to significant competition for resources (raw material and energy) that are withdrawn from the host metabolism for overexpression of both the four upstream and two downstream genes.Compared to the control strain 25c, a 4 fold growth inhibition was observed with strain 25 indicated that high overexpression of synthetic taxadiene pathway induced toxicity altering the growth phenotype compared to the overexpression of native pathway (). However, as upstream expression increased, downstream expression was reduced, inadvertently in our case, to desirable levels to balance the upstream and downstream pathways, minimizing growth inhibition (strain 26).","At the extreme of protein overexpression, T7 promoter-driven MEP pathway resulted in severe growth inhibition, due to the synthesis of four proteins at high level (strains 28 and 32). Expression of the TS genes by T7 does not appear to have as drastic effect by itself. The high rates of protein synthesis from the T7 induced expression () could lead to the down regulation of the protein synthesis machinery including components of housekeeping genes from early growth phase impairs the cell growth and lower the increase in biomass.We hypothesized that our observed complex growth phenotypes are cumulative effects of (1) toxicity induced by activation of isoprenoid\/taxadiene metabolism, and (2) and the effects of high recombinant protein expression. Altogether our multivariate-modular pathway engineering approach generated unexpected diversity in terpenoid metabolism and its correlation to the pathway expression and cell physiology. Rational design of microbes for secondary metabolite production will require an understanding of pathway expression that goes beyond a linear\/independent understanding of promoter strengths and copy numbers. However, simple, multivariate approaches, as employed here, can introduce the necessary diversity to both (1) find high producers, and (2) provide a landscape for the systematic investigation of higher order effects that are dominant, yet underappreciated, in metabolic pathway engineering.","A central feature in the biosynthesis of Taxol is oxygenation at multiple positions of the taxane core structure, reactions that are considered to be mediated by cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases.After completion of the committed cyclization step of the pathway, the parent olefin, taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene, is next hydroxylated at the C5 position by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, representing the first of eight oxygenation steps (of the taxane core) on route to Taxol (FIG. ).Thus, a key step towards engineering Taxol-producing microbes is the development of P450-based oxidation chemistry in vivo. The first oxygenation step is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450, taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase, an unusual monooxygenase catalyzing the hydroxylation reaction along with double bond migration in the diterpene precursor taxadiene (). We report the first successful extension of the synthetic pathway from taxadiene to taxadien-5\u03b1-ol and present the first examples of in vivo production of any functionalized Taxol intermediates in ","In general, functional expression of plant cytochrome P450 is challengingdue to the inherent limitations of bacterial platforms, such as the absence of electron transfer machinery, cytochrome P450 reductases, and translational incompatibility of the membrane signal modules of P450 enzymes due to the lack of an endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, through transmembrane (TM) engineering and the generation of chimera enzymes of P450 and CPR reductases, some plant P450's have been expressed in for the biosynthesis of functional molecules.Still, every plant cytochrome p450 is unique in its transmembrane signal sequence and electron transfer characteristics from its reductase counterpart.Our initial studies were focused on optimizing the expression of codon-optimized synthetic taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase by N-terminal transmembrane engineering and generating chimera enzymes through translational fusion with the CPR redox partner from the species, Taxus cytochrome P450 reductase (TCPR) ().One of the chimera enzymes generated, At24T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR, was highly efficient in carrying out the first oxidation step with more than 98% taxadiene conversion to taxadien-5\u03b1-ol and the byproduct 5(12)-Oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane (OCT) ().","Compared to the other chimeric P450s, At24T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR yielded two-fold higher (21 mg\/L) production of taxadien-5\u03b1-ol. As well, the weaker activity of At8T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR and At24T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR resulted in accumulation of a recently characterized byproduct, a complex structural rearrangement of taxadiene into the cyclic ether 5(12)-Oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane (OCT) (FIG. ).The byproduct accumulated at approximately equal amounts as the desired product taxadien-5\u03b1-ol. The OCT formation was mediated by an unprecedented Taxus cytochrome P450 reaction sequence involving oxidation and subsequent cyclizations.Thus, it seems likely that by protein engineering of the taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylases, termination of the reaction before cyclization will prevent the accumulation of such undesirable byproduct and channeling the flux to taxadien-5\u03b1-ol could be achieved.","The productivity of strain 26-At24T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR was significantly reduced relatively to that of taxadiene production by the parent strain 26 (\u02dc300 mg\/L) with a concomitant increase in the accumulation of the previously described uncharacterized metabolite. No taxadiene accumulation was observed. Apparently, the introduction of an additional medium copy plasmid (10 copy, p10T7) bearing the At24T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR construct disturbed the carefully engineered balance in the upstream and downstream pathway of strain 26. Small scale fermentations were carried out in bioreactors to quantify the alcohol production by strain 26-At24T5\u03b1OH-tTCPR. The time course profile of taxadien-5\u03b1-ol accumulation () indicates alcohol production of up to 58\u00b13 mg\/L with an equal amount of the OCT byproduct produced. The observed alcohol production was 2400 fold higher than previous production in Further increases of taxadien-5\u03b1-ol production are likely possible through pathway optimization and protein engineering.","The multivariate-modular approach of pathway optimization has yielded very high producing strains of a critical Taxol precursor. Furthermore, the recombinant constructs have been equally effective in redirecting flux towards the synthesis of other complex pharmaceutical compounds, such as mono-, sesqui- and di-terpene (geraniol, linalool, amorphadiene and levopimaradiene) products engineered from the same pathway (unpublished results). Thus, our pathway engineering opens new avenues to bio-synthesize natural products, especially in the context of microbially-derived terpenoids for use as chemicals and fuels from renewable resources. By focusing on the universal terpenoid precursors IPP and DMAPP, it was possible to, first, define the critical pathway modules and then modulate expression such as to optimally balance the pathway modules for seamless precursor conversion and minimal intermediate accumulation. This approach seems to be more effective than combinatorial searches of large genetic spaces and also does not depend on a high throughput screen.","The MEP-pathway is energetically balanced and thus overall more efficient in converting either glucose or glycerol to isoprenoids. Yet, during the past 10 years, many attempts at engineering the MEP-pathway in to increase the supply of the key precursors IPP and DMAPP for carotenoid, sesquiterpenoidand diterpenoidoverproduction met with limited success. This inefficiency was attributed to unknown regulatory effects associated specifically with the expression of the MEP-pathway in . Here we provide evidence that such limitations are correlated with the accumulation of the metabolite indole, owing to the non-optimal expression of the pathway, which inhibits the isoprenoid pathway activity. Taxadiene overproduction (under conditions of indole formation suppression), establishes the MEP-pathway as a very efficient route for biosynthesis of pharmaceutical and chemical products of the isoprenoid family. One simply needs to carefully balance the modular pathways as suggested by our multivariate-modular pathway engineering approach.","For successful microbial production of Taxol, demonstration of the chemical decoration of the taxadiene core by P450 based oxidation chemistry is essential.Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases constitute about one half of the 19 distinct enzymatic steps in the Taxol biosynthetic pathway. Characteristically, these genes show unusual high sequence similarity with each other (>70%) but low similarity (<30%) with other plant P450s.Due to the apparent similarity among Taxol monooxygenases, expressing the proper activity for carrying out the specific P450 oxidation chemistry was a particular challenge. Through TM engineering and construction of an artificial chimera enzyme with redox partner (TCPR), the Taxol cytochrome P450, taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase, was functionally expressed in and shown to efficiently convert taxadiene to the corresponding alcohol product in vivo. Previous in vitro studies have described the mechanism of converting taxadiene to taxadien-5\u03b1-ol by native taxadiene 5\u03b1-hydroxylase enzyme, but have not discussed the same conversion in vivo.This oxygenation and rearrangement reaction involves hydrogen abstraction from C20 position of the taxadiene to form an allylic radical intermediate, followed by regio- and stereo-specific oxygen insertion at C5 position to yield the alcohol derivative (). The observed modest abundance of the enzyme in cells, and the low kvalues suggested that the 5\u03b1-hydroxylation step of Taxol biosynthesis is slow relative to the downstream oxygenations and acylations in the Taxol pathway.Thus, engineering this step is key to Taxol synthesis, especially in the context of functional engineering of Taxol P450's in prokaryotic host such as . In addition, this step was limiting in previous efforts of constructing the pathway in yeast.The engineered construct in this study demonstrated >98% conversion of taxadiene in vivo with product accumulation to \u02dc60 mg\/L, a 2400 fold improvement over previous heterologous expression in yeast. This study has therefore succeeded not only in synthesizing significantly greater amounts of key Taxol intermediates but also provides the basis for the synthesis of subsequent metabolites in the pathway by similar P450 chemistry.","Prior studies on structure-activity relationship on Taxol have shown that alterations made either by removal or addition of some of its functional groups did not change materially the activity of the Taxol.Such studies, however, were limited due to the restricted ability to introduce changes by chemical synthesis. Availability of a microbial path for Taxol synthesis will drastically expand the space of chemical modifications that can be examined, thus increasing the probability of identifying more potent drug candidates. This offers exciting new opportunities for drug development, especially when considering that such drug candidates will also be associated with an efficient production route.","In the past few decades, Taxol has spawned more interest within the scientific communities and general public than any other natural product drug candidate.A major supply crisis is predicted from the projected increase in the use of Taxol or Taxol analogs for cancer chemotherapy, requiring new production routes, such as engineering of Taxol biosynthetic machinery in microbes.While a few endophytic fungi of species have been isolated capable of producing Taxol naturally, these microbial systems have yet to demonstrate suitability for sustainable production of the drug.The results reported here represent a disruptive step towards a microbially-derived Taxol or Taxol precursor, by removing the bottlenecks in the committed precursor pathway. Furthermore, the assembly of a synthetic pathway offers new possibilities to tailor Taxol analogs by selectively engineering the pathway, thereby altering the taxane structure. These developments raise optimism for a microbial route for the cost-effective production of Taxol or suitable Taxol precursors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0240","num":"0246"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
