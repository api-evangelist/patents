All Rights Reserved.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of algorithms and programming and, in one specific example, the manipulation of images.","Image editing may allow for the manipulation of a plurality of images by a stand alone application that does not require network connectivity to execute. The color and dimensions of an image may be manipulated using an image editing application. An image editing application may allow for additional textures to be added to an image.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of an example embodiment of the present invention. It may be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention will be practiced without these specific details.","In some example embodiments, a system and method is illustrated for generating an image layer stack that includes layers, and sub layers of layers, generated from an image that are organized as a stack. In some example cases, the image layer stack may include layers or sub layers from a plurality of images. An image layer stack may be a stack of displayed images that are layered. The image layer stack includes a layer and at least one additional sub layer or layer. A layer is generated from an image and includes layer data representing pixel values and characteristics associated therewith. A sub layer is generated from a layer and includes pixel values and characteristics associated therewith. Further, the layers and sub layers that make up this image layer stack may have portions of each image in the stack filtered so other portions of other layers and sub layers in the stack may be displayed. Moreover, the layers and sub layers may be toggled between each other such that a particular layer may be brought to the foreground in an image layer stack as displayed. Additionally, edits made to the layer and sub layer may be stored into the image layer stack as an edit history. Edit history may include the change, addition, or removal of properties associated with the layers and sub layers over time. Properties may include pixel values, color codes values, or other suitable values associated with a layer. Images may be digital photos formatted using a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format, Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), or some other suitable file format.","In some example embodiments, the system and method are shown for generating, manipulating, and displaying an image layer stack using computers organized in a client-server arrangement. A client computer may have a web browser or other suitable Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML) interpreter, and associated client engine. The client engine may be FLASH\u2122, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), ACTIVE X\u2122, or Java engine. This client may be referenced herein as a plug-in. Any one of a number of devices may act as a client computer. A server computer, as referenced herein, may be an application server, web server, or some combination of an application server and a web server. An image editing server, or social networking server may be a server computer. An image editing server may be a server that allows for a client computer to manipulate and display an image layer stack and the layers and sub layers included therein. A social networking server may be a server that executes software to build online social networks for communities of people (e.g., natural persons or legal entities such as corporations) who share interests and activities or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others.","In some example embodiments, the system and method are shown for generating, manipulating, and displaying an image layer stack that includes the image editing server generating the image layer stack, and filtering portions of the image layer stack (e.g., sub layers). Filter or filtering may include blocking certain pixel values in an image to allow properties such as pixel values from other images in the image layer stack to be displayed.","In some example embodiments, the system and method may include the client computer receiving a layer and a sub layer. The layer may be composed of a plurality of sub layers stacked onto one another. The client computer may receive input denoting a position identification value for the layer and each of the sub layers. The position identification value denotes a layering priority for each sub layer within the image layer stack. The position identification value may be an integer, alpha-numeric string, or some other suitable value giving a priority to one layer or sub layer relative to another layer or sub layer. The client computer may receive input to filter all or a portion of a layer or sub layer. Through filtering, an image of the image layer stack may be able to be displayed in a GUI.","In some example embodiments, the system and method are shown for generating, manipulating, and displaying the image layer stack that includes the posting of the image layer stack on a social networking web page for a particular user. A social network server may provide the functionality to request and to manipulate the image layer stack. This functionality may be accessed by the client computer, such that the social networking server may act as an intermediary (see below figures) between the client computer and the image editing server.","Example System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","103","108","108","107","103","103","104","105","106","107","108"]},"This layering instruction  is transmitted across a network  to be received by an image editing server .

These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components can be implemented into the system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), or Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)), or other suitable technique. These components are linked to other components via various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and then compiled into one complete server and\/or client application. The method for using components in the building of client and server applications is well known in the art. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above-illustrated components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is located remotely from a second computer system including an interface level (e.g., a GUI). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The various levels can be written using the above-illustrated component design principles and can be written in the same programming language or in different programming languages. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various levels and the components included therein to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, an operation written in C++ using Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) can communicate with another remote module written in JAVA\u2122. Suitable protocols include SOAP, CORBA, and other protocols well-known in the art.","A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client","Some embodiments may utilize the Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference (OSI) model or TCP\/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. For example, operations , , , , , , , and  may use these protocols. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also includes port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data transmitted over a network such as an internet, LAN, WAN, or some other suitable network. In some cases, internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.","A Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":"2700"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a CPU, a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory , and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
