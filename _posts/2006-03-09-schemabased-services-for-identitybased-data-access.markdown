title: Schema-based services for identity-based data access
abstract: A schema-based service for Internet access to per-user services data, wherein access to data is based on each user's identity. The service includes a schema that defines rules and a structure for each user's data, and also includes methods that provide access to the data in a defined way. The services schema thus corresponds to a logical document containing the data for each user. The user manipulates (e.g., reads or writes) data in the logical document by data access requests through defined methods. In one implementation, the services schemas are arranged as XML documents, and the services provide methods that control access to the data based on the requesting user's identification, defined role and scope for that role. In this way, data can be accessed by its owner, and shared to an extent determined by the owner.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This is a divisional application of utility application Ser. No. 10\/017,680 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,302,634, filed Oct. 22, 2001. Utility application Ser. No. 10\/017,680 claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/275,809, filed Mar. 14, 2001 and entitled \u201cIdentity-Based Service Communication Using XML Messaging Interfaces\u201d. The disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention relates generally to computer network data access, and more particularly to systems, methods and data structures for accessing data and data-related services over a network.","There are many types of data that users need to manage and otherwise access. For example, users keep word processing documents, spreadsheet documents, calendars, telephone numbers and addresses, e-mail messages, financial information and so on. In general, users maintain this information on various personal computers, hand-held computers, pocket-sized computers, personal digital assistants, mobile phones and other electronic devices. In most cases, a user's data on one device is not accessible to another device, without some manual synchronization process or the like to exchange the data, which is cumbersome. Moreover, some devices do not readily allow for synchronization. For example, if a user leaves his cell phone at work, he has no way to get his stored phone numbers off the cell phone when at home, even if the user has a computing device or similar cell phone at his disposal. As is evident, these drawbacks result from the separate devices each containing their own data.","Corporate networks and the like can provide users with remote access to some of their data, but many users do not have access to such a network. For many of those that have access, connecting to a network with the many different types of devices, assuming such devices can even connect to a network, can be a complex or overwhelming problem.","Moreover, even if a user has centrally stored data, the user needs the correct type of device running the appropriate application program to access that data. For example, a user with a PDA that runs a simple note taking application program ordinarily will not be able to use that program to open documents stored by a full-blown word processing program at work. In general, this is because the data is formatted and accessed according to the way the application program wants it to be formatted.","What is needed is a model wherein data is centrally stored for users, with a set of services that control access to the data with defined methods, regardless of the application program and\/or device. When accessed, the data for each service should be structured in a defined way that complies with defined rules for that data, regardless of the application program or device that is accessing the data.","Briefly, the present invention provides a set of services for central (e.g., Internet) access to per-user data, based on each user's identity, wherein each service includes a schema that defines rules and a structure for the data, and also includes methods that provide access to the data in a defined way. Note that while \u201cuser\u201d is generally employed herein for simplicity, as used herein the term \u201cuser\u201d is really a substitute for any identity, which may be a user, a group, another entity, an event, a project, and so on. Because the structure of the data is defined from the perspective of the data, not from that of an application program or a device, programs can communicate with the services to access the data, with existing knowledge of the format. In one implementation, the schemas are arranged as XML documents, and the services provide methods that control access to the data based on the requesting user's identification, defined role and scope for that role. In this way, data can be accessed by its owner, and shared to an extent determined by the owner. Extensibility is defined into the schemas.","In one implementation, core services are provided for managing access of various types of data, each service corresponding to a defined schema for the type of data it manages. In addition to defined schemas for the data, the various services implement standard methods that application programs can call in order to obtain access to the data, and also may include custom methods that facilitate access, referred to as domain-specific methods. Core services include myServices, to allow applications to find another service, myApplicationSettings, to allow a user to centrally store settings for the user's various applications, and myCalendar, which manages access to data regarding scheduled events. Other core services include myCategories, to provide a generic classification model, myContacts, to manage access to a user's list of contacts, and myDevices, to manage a user's devices. Other, core services include myDocuments, myFavoriteWebSites, myInbox, myLists, myLocation, myAlerts, myProfile, myPresence and myWallet, as described below. Note that each of these services are alternatively and interchangeably referred to herein by \u201c.NET\u201d followed by their name, e.g., myInbox may be referred to as .NET Inbox, or simply Inbox, myContacts as .NET Contacts, or simply Contacts, and so on. Note that this is only one exemplary set of core services, and that other core services implementations may include a different combination of these services (i.e. a subset) and\/or additional services which may be considered as \u201ccore\u201d services.","Extended (or optional) services are also allowed. The extended services need not be provided by the provider of the core services, e.g., there may be a number of users who subscribe to one companies core services but only subscribe to third party extended services. Likewise, there may be a number of services providers who provide core services or extended services but not both. Thus, it should be understood that a core services provider may also provides extended services, or providers of core or extended services, or both, may be different entities.","Other benefits and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to: personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, tablet devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and so forth, that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in local and\/or remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer . Components of the computer  may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","The computer  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, and removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by the computer . Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during startup, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media, discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers herein to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a tablet, or electronic digitizer, , a microphone , a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices not shown in  may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . The monitor  may also be integrated with a touch-screen panel or the like. Note that the monitor and\/or touch screen panel can be physically coupled to a housing in which the computing device  is incorporated, such as in a tablet-type personal computer. In addition, computers such as the computing device  may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface  or the like.","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet. For example, in the present invention, the computer system  may comprise source machine from which data is being migrated, and the remote computer  may comprise the destination machine. Note however that source and destination machines need not be connected by a network or any other means, but instead, data may be migrated via any media capable of being written by the source platform and read by the destination platform or platforms.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface  or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Data Access Model","The present invention generally operates in an architecture\/platform that connects network-based (e.g., Internet-based) applications, devices and services, and transforms them into a user's personal network which works on the user's behalf, and with permissions granted by the user. To this end, the present invention is generally directed to schema-based services that maintain user, group, corporate or other entity data in a commonly accessible virtual location, such as the Internet. The present invention is intended to scale to millions of users, and be stored reliably, and thus it is likely that a user's data will be distributed among and\/or replicated to numerous storage devices, such as controlled via a server federation. As such, while the present invention will be generally described with respect to an identity-centric model that enables a user with an appropriate identity and credentials to access data by communicating with various core or other services, it is understood that the schema-based services described herein are arranged for handling the data of millions of users, sorted on a per-user-identity basis. Note that while \u201cuser\u201d is generally employed herein for simplicity, as used herein the term \u201cuser\u201d is really a substitute for any identity, which may be a user, a group, another entity, an event, a project, and so on.","As generally represented in , a data access model  includes a generic navigation module  through which applications  and the like may access a wide variety of identity-based data, such as maintained in an addressable store . To access the data, a common set of command methods may be used to perform operations on various data structures that are constructed from the data in the addressable store , even though each of those data structures may represent different data and be organized quite differently. Such command methods may describe generic operations that may be desired on a wide variety of data structures, and include, for example, insert, delete, replace, update, query or changequery methods.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention and as described in detail below, the data is accessed according to various schemas, with the schemas corresponding to identity-based services through which users access their data. As used herein, a \u201cschema\u201d generally comprises a set of rules that define how a data structure may be organized, e.g., what elements are supported, in what order they appear, how many times they appear, and so on. In addition, a schema may define, via color-coding or other identification mechanisms, what portions of an XML document (that corresponds to the data structure) may be operated on. Examples of such XML-based documents are described below. The schema may also define how the structure of the XML document may be extended to include elements not expressly mentioned in the schema.","As will be understood below, the schemas vary depending on the type of data they are intended to organize, e.g., an email-inbox-related schema organizes data differently from a schema that organizes a user's favorite websites. Further, the services that employ schemas may vary. As such, the generic navigation module  has associated therewith a navigation assistance module  that includes or is otherwise associated with one or more schemas . As will be understood, a navigation assistance module  as represented in  corresponds to one or more services, and possesses the information that defines how to navigate through the various data structures, and may also indicate which command methods may be executed on what portions of the data structure. Although in  only one navigation assistance module  is shown coupled to the generic navigation module , there may be multiple navigation assistance modules that may each specialize as desired. For example, each navigation assistance module may correspond to one service. Moreover, although the navigation assistance module  is illustrated as a separate module, some or all of the operations of the navigation assistance module  may be incorporated into the generic navigation module , and vice versa. In one embodiment, the various data structures constructed from the schema and addressable store data may comprise XML documents of various XML classes. In that case, the navigation assistance module  may contain a schema associated with each of the classes of XML documents.","The present invention provides a number of schema-based services that facilitate data access based on the identity of a user. Preferably, the user need not obtain a separate identity for each service, but rather obtains a single identity via a single set of credentials, such as with the Microsoft\u00ae Passport online service. With such an identity, a user can access data via these services from virtually any network connectable device capable of running an application that can call the methods of a service.","Services and Schemas","\u201c.NET My Services\u201d comprises identity-centric services which may be generally implemented in XML (extensible Markup Language) Message Interfaces (XMIs). While the present invention will be described with respect to XML and XMI, it can readily be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular language or set of interfaces. The .NET My Services model essentially corresponds to one implementation of the generic data access model  of .","As generally represented in , .NET My Services  is implemented as a set of Web services -, each bound to a .NET Identity (PUID, such as a Passport\u00ae unique identifier similar to a globally unique identifier when Passport\u00ae is the authentication service). The services - can communicate with one another via a service-to-service communications protocol (SSCP), described below. As also described below, each service presents itself as a set of XML documents that can be manipulated from an application program  () or the like using a set of standard methods and domain-specific methods. To this end, a user device  (endpoint) running such application programs connects a user's applications to the services, and the data controlled by those services, such as over the Internet or an Intranet, such as over the Internet or an Intranet. Note that endpoints can be client devices, applications or services. In keeping with the present invention, virtually any device capable of executing software and connecting to a network in any means may thus give a user access to data that the user is allowed to access, such as the user's own data, or data that a friend or colleague has specified as being accessible to that particular user.","In general, a .NET Identity is an identifier assigned to an individual, a group of individuals, or some form of organization or project. Using this identifier, services bound to that identity can be located and manipulated. A general effect is that each identity (e.g., of a user, group or organization) has tied to it a set of services that are partitioned along schema boundaries and across different identities. As will be understood, the XML-document-centric architecture of .NET My Services provides a model for manipulating and communicating service state that is very different from prior data access models. The XML-document-centric approach, in conjunction with loose binding to the data exposed by the services, enables new classes of application programs. As will also be understood, the .NET My Services model  presents the various services - using a uniform and consistent service and method model, a uniform and consistent data access and manipulation model, and a uniform and consistent security authorization model.","In a preferred implementation, the .NET My Services model  is based upon open Internet standards. Services are accessed by means of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) messages containing an XML payload. Service input and output is expressed as XML document outlines, and each of these document outlines conform to an XML schema document. The content is available to a user interacting with the .NET My Services service endpoint .","One aspect of the present invention is that a schema essentially describes a web service. More particularly, a service author begins to write a web service by defining a schema (e.g., in XML) that defines what the data model looks like, e.g., the supported elements, their relative ordering, how many times they appear, and other similar definitions, as will become apparent below. This service definition also applies to an author determining what roles and methods are supported, e.g., which operations are supported, and the extent of the data that can be returned for each method. Another way of stating this concept is that the author starts by building a complete definition of a service, such as in XML, and specifies the verbs (methods) that an application will use to talk to it.","At this point, the service author has an XML definition that has been declared, and this declarative definition may be run through a compilation process, resulting in a fully operational service. It should be noted that a general purpose interpreter-like mechanism may be fed one of these declarative XML definitions, and result in a service that is capable of operating. In a simple service (e.g., with no domain-specific methods or complex logic), no new code needs to be written to provide such an operational service. As will be understood, such authoring of a service without coding is possible due to the data driven model of the present architecture. As will be understood, however, code can also be written to influence and or work with the service generation process to add value to a service, and\/or provide specific, runtime business logic that is not expressible in a declarative way.","Turning to , in the .NET My Services model, an application  requests performance of a method that operates on data structures. The application may make a request that is generic with respect to the type of data structure being operated upon and without requiring dedicated executable code for manipulating data structures of any particular data type. To this end, the application first contacts a myServices service  (which may be referred to as .NET Service) to obtain the information needed to communicate with a particular service , through a set of methods  of that service . For example, the needed information received from the myServices service  includes a URI of that service . Note that the service  may correspond to essentially any of the services represented in . The myServices service  is further described below with respect to .","The service  includes or is otherwise associated with a set of methods  including standard methods , such as to handle requests directed to insert, delete, replace, update, query or changequery operations on the data. The set of methods of a particular service may also include service specific methods . In general, the only way in which an application can communicate with a service are via that service's methods.","Each service includes service logic  for handling requests and providing suitable responses. To this end, the service logic performs various functions such as authorization, authentication, and signature validation, and further limits valid users to only the data which they are permitted to access. The security aspect of a service is not discussed herein, except to note that in general, for otherwise valid users, the user's identity determines whether a user can access data in a requested manner. To this end, a roleMap  comprising service-wide roleList document templates  and scopes (e.g., part of the overall service's schema ), in conjunction with user-based data maintained in an addressable store , determines whether a particular requested method is allowed, e.g., by forming an identity-based roleList document . If a method is allowed, the scope information in the roleMap  determines a shape of data to return, e.g., how much content is allowed to be accessed for this particular user for this particular request. The content is obtained in accordance with a content document  in the service's schema  and the actual user data corresponding to that content document in the addressable store . In this manner, a per-identity shaped content document  is essentially constructed for returning to the user, or for updating the addressable store, as appropriate for the method. Note that  includes a number of ID-based roleList documents and ID-based content documents, to emphasize that the service  is arranged to serve multiple users. Also, in , a system document  is present as part of the schema , as described below.","Returning to , in one implementation, access to .NET My Services  is accomplished using SOAP messages formatted with .NET My Services-specific header and body content. Each of the services will accept these messages by means of an HTTP POST operation, and generate a response by \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d on the HTTP Response, or by issuing an HTTP POST to a .NET MyServices response-processing endpoint . In addition to HTTP as the message transfer protocol, .NET My Services will support raw SOAP over TCP, a transfer protocol known as Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (or DIME). Other protocols for transferring messages are feasible.","Because each of the .NET My Services services are accessed by protocol, no particular client-side binding code, object models, API layers, or equivalents are required, and are thus optional. The .NET My Services model will support Web Services Description Language (WSDL). It is not mandatory that applications wishing to interact with .NET My Services services make use of any particular bindings, and such bindings are not described herein. Instead, the present invention will be generally described in terms of messages that flow between requesters of a particular service and the service endpoints. In order to interact with .NET My Services, a service needs to format a .NET My Services message and deliver that message to a .NET My Services endpoint. In order to format a message, a client needs to manipulate XML document outlines, and typically perform some simple, known (public-domain) cryptographic operations on portions of the message.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, and as described in  and below, in one preferred implementation, each .NET My Services service presents three logical XML documents, a content document , roleList document  (of the roleMap ), and a system document . These documents are addressable using .NET My Services message headers, and are manipulated using standard .NET My Services methods. In addition to these common methods, each service may include additional domain-specific methods. For example, as described below, the myCalendar service  might choose to expose a \u201cgetFreeBusy\u201d method rather than expose free\/busy as writeable fragments in the content document.","Each .NET My Services service thus logically includes a content document , which in general is the main, service-specific document. The schema for this document  is a function of the class of service, as will become apparent from the description of each service's schema below. For example, in the case of the myCalendar service , the content document presents data in the shape dictated by the myCalendar schema, whereas in the case of the myFavoriteWebSites service , the content document presents data in the shape dictated by a myFavoriteWebSites schema.","Each service also includes a roleList document  that contains roleList information, comprising information that governs access to the data and methods exported by the service . The roleList document is manipulated using the .NET standard data manipulation mechanisms. The shape of this document is governed by the .NET core schema's roleListType XML data type.","Each service also includes a system document , which contains service-specific system data such as the roleMap, schemaMap, messageMap, version information, and service specific global data. The document is manipulated using the standard .NET My Services data manipulation mechanism, although modifications are limited in a way that allows only the service itself to modify the document. The shape of this system document  may be governed by the system document schema for the particular service, in that each service may extend a base system document type with service specific information. For purposes of simplicity herein, the base system document is described once, rather than for each service, with only those services having extended service specific information separately described. Notwithstanding, it should be understood that each service includes at least the base system portion in its system document.","As is understood, the present invention is generally directed to schemas, which in general comprise a set of rules or standards that define how a particular type of data can be structured. Via the schemas, the meaning of data, rather than just the data itself, may be communicated between computer systems. For example, a computer device may recognize that a data structure that follows a particular address schema represents an address, enabling the computer to \u201cunderstand\u201d the component part of an address. The computer device may then perform intelligent actions based on the understanding that the data structure represents an address. Such actions may include, for example, the presentation of an action menu to the user that represents things to do with addresses. Schemas may be stored locally on a device and\/or globally in a federation's \u201cmega-store.\u201d A device can keep a locally-stored schema updated by subscribing to an event notification service (in this case, a schema update service) that automatically passes messages to the device when the schema is updated. Access to globally stored schemas is controlled by the security infrastructure.","General Schema Commonality","The .NET My Services data is defined using annotated XSD (eXtensible or XML Structure Definitions) schema files. The XSD files accurately type the data, but since XSD is a verbose and complex language, it is not a particularly efficient way to convey structure and meaning. Thus, for purposes of simplicity herein, the schemas are described below in terms of schema outlines with accompanying element\/attribute descriptions. These document outlines accurately show the structure of the data contained within a service. However, because the present application is not viewable in color, the nodes, elements and\/or attributes of the schema outlines (which may be described as bold blue, or blue), are represented in the schema outlines as boldface type. Those described as underlined red, or red, are represented as underlined type, while others referred to as black are represented in normal type.","The meaning of these bold (blue), underlined (red) and normal (black) items has significance with respect to the data model and to the data language that accesses and manipulates the data (e.g., via the insert, delete, replace, update, query, changequery or other methods). For example, each document described below contains a root element having an element name that matches that of the service, e.g., the myApplicationsSettings service has a root element named myApplicationsSettings. The .NET My Services name for this item is the root.","Documents contain elements that resemble first-class top-level objects, including, for example, <catDef\/>, <myApplicationsSettings\/> (other another name as appropriate) and <order\/>. Such items are denoted in the outlines as bold (blue), and may be identified using an <xdb:blue\/> tag. Bold (blue) items define major blocks of data within a service. These node sets are directly addressable by an identifier attribute, and their change status is tracked through a changeNumber attribute. Top-level bold blue items may be considered objects. As seen below, some bold (blue) objects contain nested bold blue objects. They usually contain frequently changing underlined (red) properties, which reduces the amount of synchronization traffic. Nested bold (blue) items may be considered property groups.","Each bold blue item contains one or more underlined (red) items which are elements or attributes. These items may be identified using the <\/> tag. These items are special in that they may be used within predicates (filters) to aid in xdb:bold blue selection. These items are also directly addressable and may be manipulated directly by the data manipulation language.","Each colored red element may contain one or more non-colorized elements and attributes, which are valid and semantically meaningful XML items in the service document. Such items are opaque to the data language. These uncolored (i.e., non-bold or underlined) elements and attributes may not be addressed directly, may not be selected in a node selection operation, and may not be used in a predicate node test. Note that if one of these items is in the path to an underlined red item, it may be used in a location step to the underlined red item, but may not be used as the selected node. Note that being opaque does not mean that the item is not considered during schema validation, but rather means that the item may not be used in a predicate, may not be directly addressed, and may not be inserted by itself. As can be readily appreciated, in this manner, the .NET My Services thus limits the granularity of access to nodes within the service document, since only xdb:bold blue and xdb:underlined red marked items are directly addressable, and only those elements and attributes tagged with the xdb:underlined red annotation may be used in predicates to influence node selection. Using this technique, the .NET My Services storage system can efficiently manage indexes, increase the performance of node selection, partially shred the document data, and in general (because the node selections are well defined) fine-tune the node selection logic on a per-xdb:blue basis. The primary purpose of the xdb:blue is to define a base-level XML object that is designed to be operated on as a unit. The primary purpose of the xdb:red items is to aid in the selection of xdb:bold blues. The xdb:red items may be changed by the data language primitives so some level of fine-grained manipulation of the data is available, but only in very limited ways.","Bold blue items have unique IDs, which are usually assigned by .NET My Services, and are returned from update operations within the new blueId node. In all cases, the order of xxxBold blue follows the pre-order traversal of the document XML tree. Item IDs are UUIDs in the following format (h stands for a hexadecimal digit): hhhhhhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhh.","In addition to identifiers, names and change numbers, nodes and especially red nodes may include creator identifiers, category information, and {any} fields. Category information enables data to be grouped and\/or distinguished in some way, such as to share certain calendar information with golf buddies, send an email to immediately family, designate things such as which telephone number is the user's primary number, e.g., if a user has a second home, and so on. Fields of type \u201cany\u201d may comprise fully-typed, namespace-qualified fields that contain any type of content (e.g., free-form XML) therein. Such \u201cany\u201d fields thus allow extensibility of the schema, yet maintain the defined structure of a schema.","In one implementation, the core data-manipulation language implemented by the .NET My Services includes an insertRequest, or insert message. This primitive inserts any schema-valid XML fragment into a selected context, thereby changing the existing state of the document. A queryRequest, or message, retrieves data, such as to retrieve a document. Multiple queries may be specified in one request, and queries that select nothing are considered successful. It is possible to assert that the number of nodes in the selection falls in a given range. This is expressed using minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes. If a minOccurs\/maxOccurs test fails on any node, the request is considered unsuccessful. Note that this is different from a failure code, which would be returned, for example, for a malformed request.","A deleteRequest primitive deletes the selected nodes and all their children. Note that, just like for other requests, attributes may be selected as well as elements. Empty selections result in successful operations, similar to Query. The minOccurs\/maxOccurs tests are supported wherever select is allowed.","A replaceRequest primitive (replace message) is designed to replace the content of each of the selected nodes with the specified new content. Selected nodes themselves are not affected in any way. This may be considered as an atomic delete of the content of the selected node, followed by an insert. The content (text, attributes, elements) in the selected nodes are replaced with the new item specified in this message. The node type of the selected node and of the replacement node are thus required to be the same. The changequery request essentially returns result comprising data that has changed.","As mentioned above, each of the services includes a RoleList document and scope information that describes which users have what type of access to which data. For example, a data owner will have read\/write access to his or her own data, and can provide various types of rights to that data to other users based on their IDs, (e.g., read only to some users, read write to others). Each role list identifier may be associated with a scope, by which the kinds of data stored according to a given schema can be controlled per user. For example, a user can give a friend (with one identity) access via a service to a home telephone number, home address and so forth, but can give other users (with other identities) access only to a business telephone number. In general, a scope can be defined such that that it includes everything except any specifically listed items, or excludes everything except any specifically listed items.","Base System Document Items","The system document is a global document for each service, having content and meaning that is independent of the puid used to address the service. The document is read only to all users. Each system document contains a set of base items common to each .NET My Services service described herein, and is optionally extended by each service to include service-specific global information. Throughout the following examples, an \u201chs\u201d as in <hs: scope . . . > represents the namespace or schematic that may be used to interpret the corresponding element.

A subscription contains a trigger element which selects a scope of coverage.

This attribute is assigned to this element by the .NET My Services system, and the attribute is read-only to applications; attempts to write this attribute are silently ignored. The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/@id (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute is a globally unique ID assigned to this element by .NET My Services. Normally, .NET My Services will generate and assign this ID during an insertRequest operation, or possibly during a replaceRequest. Application software can override this ID generation by specifying the useClientIds attribute in the request message. Once an ID is assigned, the attribute is read-only and attempts to write it are silently ignored.","The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/@creator (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute identifies the creator in terms of userId, appId, and platformId of the node. The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/trigger (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) includes the \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/trigger\/@select (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) item, which specifies an XPATH expression that specifies the nodes that are to be selected and watched for changes. The selection may only select xdb:blue nodes, as described above. A s changes in this node set occur, they trigger the generation of a subscription message. These messages are then sent to the SOAP receiver listed in the \u201cto\u201d element.","The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/trigger\/@mode (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute specifies whether or not the content of the changes that triggered the subscription are delivered in the subscription message, or if the message simply indicates that something changed under the trigger. The attribute may comprise includeData, namely that the data that changed and caused the subscription to trigger is included in the subscription message. Note that deleted nodes are specified by their id, not by value. Alternatively the attribute may comprise excludeData, whereby the data that changed, causing the subscription to trigger, is not included in the subscription message.","The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/trigger\/@baseChangeNumber (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute specifies the changeNumber value that the trigger is relative to. All changes between the specified change number, and the current state of the document relative to the selection are transmitted as subscription messages. This allows a client application to establish a subscription relative to some baseline. As in changeQuery, if the baseChangeNumber is way out of date relative to the current state of the document, and the service can not supply the changes in the subscription message, the subscription insert is rejected. A value of zero (0) means that the current values of the selected nodes are transmitted in the subscription message.","The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/expiresAt (dateTime minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional element specifies an absolute time after which the subscription is no longer active. The subscription node is automatically removed when the subscription expires. If this element is missing, the subscription does not expire. The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/context (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) element returns the context element from the original subscription. Applications should use this element to correlate the subscription response with one of their subscriptions.","The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/context\/@uri (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute specifies the URI value chosen by the subscriber that is associated with this subscription. The \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/context\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) including the \/*actual service name*\/subscription\/to (anyURI minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) attribute specifies the location that is to receive the subscription message. The value of this element may be hs:myAlerts, whereby this URI indicates that generated subscription messages are to be delivered inside the body of a notification and delivered to the default .NET Alerts service of the creator. Alternatively, the value may be protocol:\/\/service, whereby this URI indicates that generated subscription messages are delivered to the specified service at the domain of the creator's platformId. For example, a platformId indicating microsoft.com, and a value in this element of http:\/\/subscriptionResponse would cause delivery of the subscription message to http:\/\/subscriptionResponse.microsoft.com. If this value is not specified, then the subscription message is delivered as a notification to the \u201ccreator's\u201d .NET Alerts service. The \/*actual service name*\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) field allows for extensibility.","Core Service Schemas","A number of the services - () are referred to as core services, which employ schemas to manage access to the data that most users will likely need. Other services, referred to as extended services , will also employ schemas in the same manner, but are more likely to be desirable to certain users and not others. Examples of extended schemas include services such as myPortfolio, myPhotos, myTravel, myMusic, myMovies, myTV, myWishlist, mySchool, myGroceries, myNews, mySports, myTopScores and so on. As will be understood, although the present invention will focus on the core schemas, the present invention is not limited to any schema in particular, but rather is directed to all such schemas. For purposes of organization, the various services and schemas will be described alphabetically by service name, with the one exception being that the \u201cmyServices\u201d service will be described first, since applications typically call the myServices service first, in order to communicate with the other services. Note that this is only one exemplary set of core services, and that other core services implementations may include different services, a different combination of these services (i.e. a subset), and\/or additional services which may be considered as \u201ccore\u201d services. Also, note that the extended services need not be provided by the provider of the core services, e.g., there may be a number of users who subscribe to one companies core services but only subscribe to third party extended services. Likewise, there may be a number of services providers who provide core services or extended services but not both. Thus, it should be understood that a core services provider may also provides extended services, or providers of core or extended services, or both, may be different entities.","myServices","The myServices schema is an XML schema that describes the list of available other myServices for a given identity (i.e. person, organization, business). The myServices schema essentially serves a directory of what and where each of the myServices logically resides, as well as additional information used to identify the service in the use of general communication. Note that the myServices service that provides the URI (and other needed information) should not be confused with the general concept of \u201c.NET My Services\u201d as described above.","Issuing a query request to myServices is part of every application's initial responsibility to figure out where a desired service resides. More particularly, the myServices service  () generally allows an application program to obtain the information (e.g., including a URI) needed to connect to another service. It should be noted that there are multiple instances of each such service, e.g., a provider such as MSN.com will have a different myInbox service instance than XYZ.com will have for its myInbox service, and indeed a single provider may have multiple instances of a service. Moreover, a single user may have email accounts at both MSN.com and XYZ.com, and different users may use the same application program to communicate with possibly many other instances of the myInbox service. As a result, an application program normally does not have URIs hard coded therein or initially cached for the many possible instances of the various services, so the application program contacts the myServices service  to determine the URI of a service for the current user. The application will of course know or otherwise be able to determine the URI of the myServices service . The information returned by the myServices service  can be cached thereafter, whereby the application can talk directly to the service desired. However, at any point in time, a given service may respond to the application with a \u2018not found here\u2019 type of error, which the application should respond to by again contacting the myServices service, as the user's service may have been moved.","An application program's query to myServices may result in multiple sets of information (e.g., multiple XML documents) being returned. For example, a user may have different email addresses and get information on different myInbox services returned in response to a single query. An application that can deal with such multiple sets, such as by prompting the user to select one, can use some or all of the information returned. One of the sets of information may be marked as a primary set, whereby applications that can only work with a single set may simply select the primary.","Thus, the application program  queries the myServices service , represented in  by the arrow labeled with circled numeral one (). In addition to the URI of the desired service instance, (e.g., the MyCalendar service ), in order to communicate with the service  the application program  needs an identity license, for example a Kerberos ticket that identifies the user, application and credential type. To this end, the myServices service  returns the URI , a service principal name (spn), and realm information that corresponds to a Kerberos domain controller (KDC) , as represented in  by the arrow labeled with circled numeral two (). The application program  uses the spn to obtain the identity license from the KDC  based on the realm information, as represented via the arrows labeled three () and four (), wherein a KDC  issues tickets for services in a particular realm . The application program  may then properly communicate with the myCalendar service  (arrow labeled five ()).","In an alternative implementation, represented in , for efficiency, an instance of the myServices service  may be part of a realm  having a KDC . In response to the query (the arrow labeled one ()), if the realm that the myServices service is part of is the same as the realm that would be returned to the application program , the myServices service  will instead automatically obtain the ticket for the application program , as represented in  via the arrows labeled two () and three (). The license ticket is then directly returned, (arrow labeled four ()), whereby the application program  may then properly communicate with the myCalendar service  (arrow labeled five ()). Note that it is typically far faster for the myServices service to communicate with the KDC in its realm (e.g., in the same datacenter) than for an application program to do so over an Internet connection. It should be noted that a myServices instance can also be associated with multiple KDCs, and does not have to belong to any one realm. For example, a myServices service may be able to communicate with a Passport KDC, an MSN.com KDC, a hotmail.com KDC, and so forth. When an application program query results in a realm that corresponds to one of these KDCs, the myServices service can obtain the license ticket directly, as described above.","In most cases, the myServices entry serves as the definitive information for a given user and the service information. However, one possibility is that a myServices instance will not know the specifics of a particular user's needed information, e.g., the desired service's URI, realm and\/or spn. In such an event, the myServices instance can refer the application program to another myServices instance by returning referral information (in a refer field) to the application program in response to the query. To this end, when a <refer> tag is found within a service entry, this means that the entry is a referral, and the <to> element actually points to another second tier myServices service. This capability is important for the ability to distribute the lookup information instead of having one centralized logical point of failure and updates. Ultimately the application program will obtain the address and other information of the desired .NET MyServices service. Note that it is possible for a response to include a referral and also include a license ticket, since a myServices instance may be connected to the appropriate KDC, but not have the URI of the desired service.","myServices\/Roles","The myServices service controls access by using the roleTemplates, rt0, rt1, rt2, rt3, and rt99, using the following scopes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"scope allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=7215df55-e4af-449f-a8e4-72a1f7c6a987>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=t>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=a159c93d-4010-4460-bc34-5094c49c1633>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfSubscriptionElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=b7f05a6d-75cd-4958-9dfb-f532ebb17743>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlyPublicElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=da025540-a0c0-470f-adcf-9f07e5a5ec8f>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[cat\/@ref=\u2018hs:public\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The myServices roleTemplate rt0 role gives give complete read\/write access to the information within the content document of the service being protected through this roleTemplate.

Once an ID is assigned, the attribute is read-only and attempts to write it are silently ignored.","The \/myServices\/service\/@creator (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute identifies the creator in terms of userId, appId, and platformId of the node.","The \/myServices\/service\/cat (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) element is used to categorize the element that contains it by referencing a global category definition in either the .NET Categories service system document or an external resource containing category definitions, or by referencing an identity centric category definition in the content document of the .NET Categories service for a particular puid.","The \/myServices\/service\/cat\/@ref (anyURI minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute references a category definition (<catDef\/>) element using the rules outlined below in the myCategories section of the present application.","The \/myServices\/service\/key (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) element specifies key information used to zoom in on a document being manipulated. This information includes the identifier (puid) of the entity that owns the document, the instance identifier of the document, and the cluster or partition key used to locate the machine resources that hold the document.","In certain situations, a client will want to send the same message to a number of instances of a particular service. In order to do this, the client may repeat this element multiple times. The cluster attributes in all elements must match each other, but the puid and instance attributes may differ. A unique response message is generated for each key specified. The entire contents of this element come from the myServices service  ().","The \/myServices\/service\/key\/@puid (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) element specifies the PUID of the entity that \u201cowns\u201d the service being accessed. In the case of a \u201cmyProfile\u201d service, this element is equivalent to the \u201cmy\u201d. The puid may be used to automatically connect to another set of information for the user. By way of example, consider a user with a two puids, such as a work puid and a home puid. The puid field can contain the user's other puid, which allows one or more instances of a desired service to operate as if the user connected with both.","The \/myServices\/service\/key\/@instance (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) element specifies the particular instance of the service for this id being accessed. For example, if a given id is provisioned with multiple .NET Calendar documents on the same cluster and in the same data center, the documents would differ only by this value. In other words, while services are generally thought of as constructing a document per user identifier, in actuality more than one instance may exist for a given user. For example, a user, with the same puid, may have personal calendar, a work calendar, a top secret calendar, and so forth, each of which corresponds to an instance. The instance id identifies from which instance a user wants to access data.","The \/myServices\/service\/key\/@cluster (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) element specifies information used by the .NET My Services system to locate the document on a particular back-end server or database. It is used as the virtual partition key for the document being addressed. This technique is preferable to computing this partition key based on some hash of the puid\/instance. If the data is later moved to another back-end server or database, the application will need to go back to myServices to obtain its new location.","The \/myServices\/service\/refer (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) element specifies whether the fields below are for a referral, as described above.","The \/myServices\/service\/to (string minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) element specifies the destination URI (typically a URL), e.g., either of the desired service or of a referral address.","The \/myServices\/service\/spn (string minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) element specifies the spn needed that may be needed to obtain a license from a KDC, as described above with reference to . The \/myServices\/service\/realm (string minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) element specifies the authentication realm for the spn in question, as also described above.","The \/myServices\/service\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) and \/myServices\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) fields allow extensibility of the myServices service. For example, if a license was returned directly by the myServices service as described above with respect to , then the license data may be returned in an {any} field. Alternatively, a dedicated <license> field may be built into the myServices content document.","myServices\/System","The myServices system document includes the set of base items common to each of the .NET My Services, as described above. At present, the myServices system document is not optionally extended. Hereinafter, only services with system documents having extended items will include such a separate system section, although it should be understood that each service has a system document corresponding to at least the base system document.","myAlerts","The Microsoft\u00ae .NET Alerts service, generally referred to as myAlerts, provides a single point where short messages can be sent to a specific user and transparently routed to that user's applications or devices. This particular service uses an XML schema to describe Alerts, and the methods by which Alerts can be sent and received. In general, the myAlerts service processes alerts (also referred to as notifications and\/or events).","In keeping with the present invention, an alert is defined as embeddable XML, specifying both standard schema and extensible problem-domain schema, using the problem-domain schema as alert typing. The standard schema is generally directed to conveying alerts, regardless of what the alert is trying to convey. The problem-domain schema extension is used in a dynamically programmable Alert processing mechanism to control alert routing. Like other .NET My Services, .NET Alerts is designed to service the user instead of a particular device or application. Although alerts are posted to a single location, the messages are transparently routed to one or more of the user's applications or devices. The logic for deciding how, where, and when a message is delivered can be customized to meet the needs of a particular user, device, or application.","The myAlerts service includes mechanisms to deliver alerts, comprising a basic model mechanism that provides the baseline functionality of sending and receiving alerts. A streams model mechanism includes more robust features, such as filtering, buffering, and persistence, as well as more refined control over the routing of alerts.","As used herein, a client is any entity that can issue an XMI request to the .NET Alerts service. Clients can send or receive alerts, wherein an alert typically comprises a short XML message delivered to one or more users by .NET Alerts. A receiver is a .NET My Services user who has one or more applications that can receive alerts. Such an application is referred to herein as a userAgent. A userAgent includes any code on any device that can communicate with .NET Alerts.","The myAlerts service provides a variety of ways to communicate with userAgents. For example, as generally represented in , a sender  may send an alert  by issuing an XMI request to the myAlerts service . The sender  can send alerts to the sender's own user, or to another user. Senders and most userAgents are clients because they issue XMI requests to the myAlerts service to send or receive alerts. Because myAlerts supports non-XMI protocols to deliver alerts to userAgents, some userAgents are not clients.","UserAgents - create connections -, respectively, to receive alerts. Each connection (e.g., ) has a query that selects which alerts the connection  will forward to its respective userAgent . The connection  will use a particular protocol to deliver alerts to the userAgent ; different connection types may provide different protocols for a userAgent. As the .NET Alerts service receives alerts, it routes them to zero or more connections, depending on the queries for each connection.","To send an alert , a client sender  issues a notify method request to a user's myAlerts service . To receive alerts, a userAgent (e.g., ) issues an insert method request to create a connection  in the myAlerts content document, and then processes the resulting connection protocol to receive incoming alerts. Different connection types can support different alerts and userAgent protocols (for example, SOAP\/XMI over HTTP, TCP\/DIME, and UDP), and can also include SIP or other non-XMI protocols. Connections generally fall into Push Connections, wherein the myAlerts service proactively pushes an alert to a userAgent, or Pull Connections, wherein the userAgent proactively pulls an alert from the myAlerts service. This requires some alert buffering.","In general, each alert  is a snippet of XML passed to and from the myAlerts service  embedded within XMI method request and response packets. The lifetime (and position) of an alert is transitory. Therefore, alerts are not part of the user content document. Alerts are proactively sent to the myAlerts service or to userAgents with the notify method, described below. Alerts are proactively pulled from the myAlerts service with the poll method, also described below.","Argots  are XML blobs (e.g., strongly-named {any} fields) that may be placed in an alert to convey problem domain-specific data. The outer element name defines the argot; the inner contents of the argot are opaque to general myAlerts processing. At present, argots may be represented formally and informally. An argot is formally declared through an outer argot element, and its name is specified through the argotURI attribute. The actual content of the argot is specified in sub-elements. The formal representation of argots may change to the informal representation in future versions. Informally declared argots are simply declared as an XML element. In this case, the argot name is the name of that element. Such an argot can have sub-elements, as appropriate.","The myAlerts service expects informal argots within the contents element of an alert. The xpQuery element for both streams and connections defines a query against the argot names within the contents element. For example, an xpQuery value of \u201chumanReadable\u201d in a connection causes that connection to get only alerts that contain the humanReadable argot in their contents. To match all argots, an asterisk (\u201c*\u201d) may be specified in the xpQuery value.","The myAlerts service expects formal argots in some of the stream and connection document methods. For example, the push connection requires the pushConnectionParameters formal argot in insert and replace methods, and generates it for query methods.","As generally represented in , a streams model is also provided. Unlike the basic model, the streams model provides a mechanism to filter, buffer, persist, or intelligently control the routing of alerts. A stream of alerts is a set of alerts that match an argot query. The argot query specifies a relation of argot types; an alert is in the stream if it contains argots that match the stream query. To include alerts in a stream, an asterisk (\u201c*\u201d) may be used, or a set of argot types (for example, \u201chumanReadable\u201d) can be specified to include a subset.","A stream (e.g., ) is an object inside a user's myAlerts service  that defines and manages a stream of alerts as they are routed to the user's connections. Clients can create and provision one or more streams to control the alert routing for a user. A user may have multiple streams - to control different streams of alerts. Multiple streams are supported because a user will often receive different types of alerts, each requiring its own filtering, buffering, and so on. For example, the myAlerts service  may focus on human-oriented alerts to implement a stream that controls alerts containing the humanReadable argot. Other services or applications will define their own argots, and will want to control the processing of their alerts.","Clients create, manage, and delete streams through XMI requests to a user's .NET Alerts content document. Generally, a stream operates in four steps:\n\n","These steps are formalized in three objects inside the alert routing, namely streamFork , stream (e.g., the stream ) and connectionFork (). When an alert  is received by the myAlerts service , the streamFork  decides the order in which to invoke streams - on the alert . When invoked, each stream will determine whether to handle the alert and whether to continue or stop the streamFork processing. A stream (e.g., the stream ) can handle or ignore an alert, and can also allow or inhibit later streams from handling the alert.","Each of the streams - then applies its processing algorithm and state to the alerts they handle. A stream can reroute the alert to other streams by continuing or restarting the streamFork process. A stream can deliver an alert by passing it on to the connections through the connectionFork .","The connectionFork  controls communication between streams and connections -, processing and optimizing execution of the connection queries to match alerts to the appropriate connections. Conceptually, as represented in , alerts (e.g., the alert ) moves forward from the sender , through the streamFork , through zero or more streams -, through the connectionFork , through zero or more connections -, to connected userAgents -. Streams - can push alerts to connections - or connections - can pull alerts from streams -. This will match the type of connections (that is, push or pull).","Stream types provide different alert handling algorithms. Five possible stream capabilities includes:\n\n","The myAlerts architecture declares the ordering and non-ordering of alert delivery through a connection. However, alert buffering, multiple streams, and intra-user federation can make it difficult to guarantee ordering, and arbitrary rerouting of alerts by routing streams can make ordering impossible. A virtual stream is the aggregate set of alerts delivered through a particular connection. The order in a virtual stream will be defined by the set of streams contributing alerts to the virtual stream. Simple, buffering, and privacy streams are required to maintain a standard ordering of oldest to newest alerts in a virtual stream. Routing and external streams are also required to maintain that order. Alerts that are inserted into the stream need to be new; an old alert cannot be reinserted out of order or multiple times.","One implementation of myAlerts provides a streamDefault stream class, which always exists and is not reflected in the user's content document, and a streamBuffer stream class. This stream will buffer up to one-hundred of the alerts it selects in memory. Note the number one-hundred is arbitrary, and was just selected as a suitable number for this implementation.","Two connection classes are implemented in one current implementation of myAlerts, namely a pushConnection, wherein the connection will push an alert to an URL by issuing an XMI notify method request, and a pullConnection, wherein the userAgent will issue XMI poll method requests to the connection to retrieve alerts.","The alert schema contains both standard and problem-domain specific portions. The present invention types the problem-domain portions as argots and allows that typing to define the essential semantic naming shared between alert senders and receivers.","The schema for the alert processing mechanism contains both stream objects which control alert processing within our service and connection objects which control delivery and protocol to external user agents. Both types of objects select and process alerts based on the argots contained in each alert, through the argotQuery element that specifies a standing query against received and persisted alerts.","In addition, new methods are provided, described below, including:\n\n","The myAlerts service controls access by using the rt0, rt3 and rt99 roleTemplates, using the following scopes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0184"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"scope allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=7215df55-e4af-449f-a8e4-72a1f7c6a987>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=t>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=a159c93d-4010-4460-bc34-5094c49c1633>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfSubscriptionElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=b7f05a6d-75cd-4958-9dfb-f532ebb17743>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlyPublicElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=da025540-a0c0-470f-adcf-9f07e5a5ec8f>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[cat\/@ref=\u2018hs:public\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The myAlerts roleTemplate rt0 role gives complete read\/write access to the information within the content document of the service being protected through this roleTemplate.

This particular service uses an XML schema to describe a typical calendar, a user's calendar store, and the methods by which calendar data is sent and received from the store.","The .NET Calendar service stores and manages the scheduling of individual and group events and appointments that are associated with an identity. This service supplies scheduling information on demand to other .NET My Services, applications, and devices. .NET Calendar can be used for regular scheduling or group collaboration. Group collaborative features include meeting delegates and role-based access to another identity's calendar.","The .NET Calendar service is designed to work with the .NET Alerts service to perform reminder alerts and meeting acceptance\/decline alerts, with .NET Contacts for service distribution lists, and with .NET Inbox to send and retrieve meeting requests. .NET Inbox will forward meeting invitations to be direct booked (tentative) on attendee calendars which have the correct permissions for this behavior and will forward meeting responses that attendees send back to the organizer to update the organizer's calendar.",".NET Calendar will support calendar publishing. This feature that allows users to open their calendars to other users such as friends, family members, and group lists. The .NET Calendar service uses .NET My Services to support a rich sharing model based upon the access control list, role map, and identity header.","The .NET Calendar schema format improves established existing calendar properties and standards. In addition, .NET Calendar establishes a platform for non-Gregorian calendars and additional features such as traveling time allowances for meetings. The schema is designed to be extensible to accommodate new calendar properties or additional recurrence patterns.","myCalendar\/Roles","The myCalendar service controls access by using the rt0, rt1, rt2, rt3 and rt99 roleTemplates, using the following scopes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0277","num":"0289"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00029","num":"00029"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"scope allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=7215df55-e4af-449f-a8e4-72a1f7c6a987>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape base=t>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=a159c93d-4010-4460-bc34-5094c49c1633>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfSubscriptionElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=b7f05a6d-75cd-4958-9dfb-f532ebb17743>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlyPublicElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=da025540-a0c0-470f-adcf-9f07e5a5ec8f>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[cat\/@ref=\u2018hs:public\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The myCalendar roleTemplate rt0 role gives complete read\/write access to the information within the content document of the service being protected through this roleTemplate.

For example, if an event crosses midnight and the startTime is 12 am, that event will be returned. In case the startDate, endDate is one day, the events are sorted in the following order: holidays, all-day events, and regular events (based on startTime).

Inviting a user to a single instance of a recurring event will cause only that instance to be sent. However, future updates to that event will overwrite the existing instance, including the case where an update is the full recurring event. Meeting requests will be sent out as attachments from an SMTP server. When inviting or uninviting, .NET Calendar searches for these existing attendees by puid first, and then by email address such that the puid receives precedence in the search predication. .NET Calendar will not allow multiple meeting requests\/cancellations to the same puid or email address within the scope of the same invite or uninvite block. However, an organizer may uninvite an attendee and then reinvite again (non-standard behavior).","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/@eventId (string minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) field contains the puid of the event which to send meeting invitations or cancellations to. This event must already exist within the .NET Calendar service. Additional server constraints are implemented which verify that potential updates to the attendee tables occur for this event only. This is a required field.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/@criticalChange (boolean minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute, when set to \u201ctrue\u201d, causes <lastUpdateTime> to be updated when invitations are sent to the attendees. If \u201cfalse\u201d, <lastUpdateTime> remains untouched.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/@recurrenceId (dateTime minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional recurrenceId allows the meeting organizer to send invitations for only a particular instance of a recurring event. If the event is not a recurring event, or if recurrenceId does not correspond to a valid instance\/exception, sendMeetingRequest will fail with an error.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/@continueOnFailure (boolean minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) field specifies to .NET Calendar to continue performing the sendMeetingRequest even on a failure. Points of failure: <uninvite> may delete attendees, and the data language delete may encounter errors <updateRequest> may encounter data language errors. The optional final delete of the event may encounter errors.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/@deleteOnCompletion (boolean minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) event will be deleted upon completion of this sendMeetingRequest. This behavior is intended for deleting a meeting and sending cancellations. If recurrenceId is present (and valid), only this particular recurring instance or exception is deleted, in which case a new <deletedExceptionDate> is added to the recurrence rule.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) includes The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/@behavior (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1), an attribute that gives the option to either choose to send cancellations to \u201call\u201d attendees in the event's attendee table, or send to \u201cnone\u201d of them. A third value of \u201cdefault\u201d would give the default behavior of sending cancellations to all attendees who are replaced in the <replaceRequest> block. When this attribute is set, .NET Calendar will ignore anything within the <uninvite> node.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/attendee (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) field contains a list of people to uninvite. Uninvited attendees must already exist in the organizer's attendee table, or else these users are ignored.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/attendee\/@deleteAttendee (boolean minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) field optionally specifies whether or not to delete this attendee from the organizer's attendee table. If the attendee is not deleted, .NET Calendar will not know the status of this attendee because the status {not-sent, sent, cancelled} is not stored per-attendee.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/attendee\/name (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional element specifies the name for the enclosing element. The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/attendee\/name\/@xml:lang (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) required attribute is used to specify an ISO 639 language code or an ISO 3166 country code as described in RFC 1766. The value of this attribute indicates the language type of the content within this element. The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/attendee\/name\/@dir (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute specifies the default layout direction for the localized string. Valid values are rtl (right to left) and ltr (left to right).","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/attendee\/puid (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional element specifies the PUID for the enclosing element. The \/sendMeetingRequest\/uninvite\/attendee\/email (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional name specifies an e-mail address for the enclosing element.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) replace request can only affect the meeting invitation in question, and is thus constrained to be only @select=\u201c\/m:myCalendar\/m:event[id=@eventId]\/ . . . \u201d. It will not be allowed to replace-on-null so that event creation cannot be a side-effect. The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/@select (string minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) attribute selects an xdb:blue or an xdb:red.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/@useClientIds (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute specifies that, if an xdb:blue item is created during an insert or replace operation, and an ID would normally be generated, the ID specified in the request content should be used instead of having .NET My Services generate an ID. Applications using this option must ensure that they are properly generating unique IDs in the form of UUIDs. They must also ensure that they do not assign the same ID to multiple xdb:blue items; this can happen if the insert select attribute selects multiple nodes.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/@minOccurs (int minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute specifies the minimum number of nodes that must be selected by the select operation in order for this operation to be successfully attempted. The default value is zero, meaning that if no nodes are selected, the operation silently succeeds as a no operation (\u201cNOP\u201d). A value of one means that a minimum of one node must be selected. In that case, if no nodes are selected, the operation fails with an error.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/@maxOccurs (int minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional attribute specifies the maximum number of nodes that may be selected by the select operation in order for this operation to be successfully attempted. The default value is unbounded. If the number of nodes selected by the select attribute is greater than this value, an error condition occurs. The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/options (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) provide for options.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/options\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) includes \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/attributes (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded). This element is used to specify a single attribute to be manipulated by the .NET My Services data-manipulation primitives. For example, when used in an insertRequest, this element specifies an attribute to be inserted at the specified node.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/attributes\/@{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) and \/sendMeetingRequest\/replaceRequest\/{any} (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) fields provide for extensibility. This element is a placeholder that indicates where the content of the item being replaced is to be specified.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/invite (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) includes the \/sendMeetingRequest\/invite\/@behavior (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute. This attribute will give the option to either choose to send invitations to \u201call\u201d attendees in the event's attendee table, or send to \u201cnone\u201d of them. A third value of \u201cdefault\u201d would give the default behavior of sending invitations to only the new attendees in the <replaceRequest> block. When this attribute is set, .NET Calendar will ignore anything within the <invite> node.","The \/sendMeetingRequest\/invite\/attendee (minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=unbounded) field contains information about this attendee to be invited. An invited attendee must already exist in the organizer's attendee table. This attendee may originally be there prior to the sendMeetingRequest method, or be the result of the update operation to this meeting. To change the attendee's inviteType, the update operation should be used.","When invitations are sent, the attendee's <responseTime> is set to the current time (now) as a side-effect. The \/sendMeetingRequest\/invite\/attendee\/name (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) optional element specifies the name for the enclosing element. The \/sendMeetingRequest\/invite\/attendee\/name\/@xml:lang (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) required attribute is used to specify an ISO 639 language code or an ISO 3166 country code as described in RFC 1766.

can be seen from the descriptions above, this user has two events in a calendar. One event is recurring every Monday at 8:00 am, and the other is an upcoming event at 1:20 pm.","myCategories","The .NET myCategories service is designed to support a classification model for data within the .NET My Services universe. The classification model is generic and makes very few assumptions about application usage. As a result, the design is minimal and open. This model of categorization will be used by a wide spectrum of applications, without burdening the developer of the service.","The .NET myCategories service manages a list of category definitions. Examples of category definitions include child, anniversary, and employee. Each category definition has a human readable name and a description which contains hints about the meaning of that category. For example, one given category may imply a more general category, while \u201cfriends\u201d implies acquaintances. A category may be classified by using other categories. For example, anniversary and birthday are categorized as specialDate.","Like other .NET My Services, the .NET Categories service exposes a global system document, and an identity centric content document. The global system document is an extension of the standard system document which contains global category definitions available to all .NET My Services applications. The identity-centric content document contains category definitions local to the identity.","Within other .NET My Services, category references are used to mark an XML element as belonging to the group represented by the category definition. The schema of each service defines which nodes (if any) can be categorized. For example, .NET Contacts\/contacts\/address can be categorized, but .NET Calendar\/event\/eventBody cannot. The roleList and system schemas also define nodes that can be categorized. For example, roleList\/role can be categorized.","Categories use a declarative syntax for encoding relationships that an application deems as important. .NET My Services neither provides nor requires any consistency checks or enforcements implied by the semantics of these relationships.","There are two primary elements used to define and reference categories. The catDef element is used to define a category, and the cat element is used to refer to a category. .NET My Services allows the catDef element to appear in the system document of the .NET Categories service, the content document of the .NET Categories service and\/or an arbitrary XML file located by a URI.","The cat element refers to a category definition by absolute or relative URI. The linkage between the two is through the catDef\/@idName attribute and the cat\/@ref attribute. The catDef\/@idName attribute specifies the local id for the category definition, and the cat\/@ref attribute is the value of that reference.","The value of the cat\/@ref attribute may take the following form:\n\nsystem#name-of-category\n","The category definition being referenced is located in the system document of the .NET Categories service, and its catDef\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-category\u201d. For example, the category reference of <cat ref=\u201csystem#public\u201d\/> is a reference to the category definition whose catDef\/@idName value is \u201cpublic\u201d, and that this category definition is located in the system document of the .NET Categories service i.e. <catDef idName=\u201cpublic\u201d\/>.","The value of the cat\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\ncontent[?puid=puid-value]#name-of-category\n","The category definition being referenced is located in the content document of the .NET Categories service, and its catDef\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-category\u201d. The instance of the .NET Categories service (i.e., the puid of the service) is implied by the context of the reference. This may be made explicit by inserting ?puid=puid-value to the URI, and when this is done, it means the content document of the .NET Categories service whose puid is \u201cpuid-value\u201d holds the category definition. For example, the category reference of <cat ref=\u201ccontent#LaQuintaHouse\u201d\/> is a reference to the category definition whose catDef\/@idName value is \u201cLaQuintaHouse\u201d, and that this category definition is located in the content document of the .NET Categories service for the current puid i.e. <catDef idName=\u201cLaQuintaHouse\u201d\/>.","The value of the cat\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\nany-uri#name-of-category\n","The category definition being referenced is located in an external (to .NET My Services) resource. The \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference refers to a resource containing the catDef element whose @idName attribute matches the \u201cname-of-category\u201d. The mapping between the \u201cany-uri\u201d portion of the reference and an XML document containing the catDef elements is a function of the \u201cany-uri\u201d. By convention, this uri is the name of an XML document containing those elements. The purpose of this reference form is to allow and support a free form set of extended categorizations that are global and available to all. For example, the category reference of <cat ref=\u201chttp:\/\/schemas.cpandl.com\/im\/globalCategories.xml#imBuddy\u201d\/> is a reference to the category definition whose catDef\/@idName value is \u201cimBuddy\u201d, and that this category definition is located in an external resource located at \u201chttp:\/\/schemas.cpandl.com\/im\/globalCategories.xml\u201d. Note that it is expected that category definitions will exist in the appropriate locations, but there is no requirement or enforcement of this.","In the various cases, the mapping between a category reference and the category definition is very simple.\n\n","The myCategories service controls access by using the rt0, rt1, rt2, rt3 and rt99 roleTemplates, using the following scopes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0617","num":"0635"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00051","num":"00051"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"scope allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=7215df55-e4af-449f-a8e4-72a1f7c6a987>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=t>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=a159c93d-4010-4460-bc34-5094c49c1633>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfSubscriptionElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=b7f05a6d-75cd-4958-9dfb-f532ebb17743>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlyPublicElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=da025540-a0c0-470f-adcf-9f07e5a5ec8f>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[cat\/@ref=\u2018hs:public\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The myCategories roleTemplate rt0 role gives complete read\/write access to the information within the content document of the service being protected through this roleTemplate.

To this end, each .NET My Services user has access to a logical contacts document which may contain multiple contact records. In general, the .NET Contacts service thus forms the foundation for an electronic address book, or a set of electronic relationships. This service contains a list of contacts, organized by category, wherein a contact is a schema element containing an identifier (id) for the contact in the .NET My Services id space. A contact has a local name for that contact, a set of categories that the contact belongs to, (distribution list's, groups, and classifications), an address, as defined by the .NET Address schema, and a set of profile information (as defined by a corresponding NET Profile schema). To this end, the .NET Contacts schema includes at least some of the .NET Profile service information including, but not limited to, name, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, as well as allowing the owner to control how the contacts are categorized.","Contact information stored within .NET Contacts can be derived from the owner's .NET Address and .NET Profile services. For example, if a user X wishes to add someone named Y as a contact in the user's .NET Contacts service, the information used to populate this contact can be queried from user Y's .NET Address and .NET Profile services. User Y's access control mechanisms determine how much information from his or her .NET Address and .NET Profile services are allowed to be seen. From the user's perspective, the user can similarly control visibility of individual contacts and grant various levels access to their list of contacts to applications and other users based on the role templates with respect to each user's relative role. Thus, for example, with the user's consent, an application could populate a selection box with the user's contacts. From this box, the user could select a contact and the application could fill out the \u201cShip To:\u201d fields (name, address, city, state and zip) for the contact automatically, such as when making a gift purchase.","The .NET Contacts service is designed to support live contacts. In this mode of operation, the queries described above that populate a contact happen automatically each time a change occurs in a subscribed-to to contact. This synchronization can be enabled or suppressed on a contact-by-contact basis. Users and applications can negotiate a subscription to another user's Profile document via the LiveContacts mechanism. When subscribed, the informational nodes become read-only for that contact and automatically update when changed by the Profile owner. The user can still control categorization, and notes for the LiveContact entry. The service-to-service communications protocol (SSCP) provides a highly efficient, robust mechanism for such automatic updates, as described below.","myContacts\/Roles","The myContacts service controls access by using the roleTemplates rt0, rt1, rt2, rt3 and rt99, using the following scopes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0656","num":"0674"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00058","num":"00058"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"scope allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=7215df55-e4af-449f-a8e4-72a1f7c6a987>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=t>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=a159c93d-4010-4460-bc34-5094c49c1633>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfSubscriptionElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=b7f05a6d-75cd-4958-9dfb-f532ebb17743>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlyPublicElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=da025540-a0c0-470f-adcf-9f07e5a5ec8f>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[cat\/@ref=\u2018hs:public\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The myContacts roleTemplate rt0 role gives complete read\/write access to the information within the content document of the service being protected through this roleTemplate.","The following table illustrates the available methods and the scope in effect when accessing the myContacts service through that method while mapped to this roleTemplate:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0659","num":"0677"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00059","num":"00059"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"myContacts roleTemplate rt0"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"method","scope\/name"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"query","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"insert","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"replace","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"delete","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"update","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"updateContactData","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"serviceOnline","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"serviceOffline","allElements"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The myContacts roleTemplate rtl role gives complete read access to all information within the content document of the service being protected through this roleTemplate.

The traditional \u201cfile name\u201d for the document is unique per reference. References can also specify a time to live. This allows other services to post data to a user's store in a temporary fashion. For example, they can use the user's store to create temp files. If all references have expired, then the document is automatically deleted. However, if any reference exists that has not expired, then all references, including ones that have expired, remain valid. When adding a reference to an existing document, the reference must refer to an existing folder ID, and the name given must be unique within that folder.

meaning of the attributes and elements shown in the table are set forth below, wherein in the syntax used in the table, boldface type corresponds to a blue node, and underlined type to a red node, as described above, and the minimum occurrence information (0, 1) indicates whether an element or attribute is required or optional, and maximum occurrence information (1, unbounded) indicates whether one or many are possible.","The \/myInbox (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) element represents the root element of myInbox. The \/myInbox\/@changeNumber (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) changeNumber attribute is designed to facilitate caching of the element and its descendants. This attribute is assigned to this element by the .NET My Services system. The attribute is read only to applications. Attempts to write this attribute are silently ignored.","The \/myInbox\/@instanceId (string minOccurs=0 maxOccurs=1) attribute is a unique identifier typically assigned to the root element of a service. It is a read-only element and assigned by the .NET My Services system when a particular service is provisioned for a user. The \/myInbox\/account (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=unbounded) element represents a provisioned user's email account. This element can optionally contain POP3 settings for myInbox services that support POP3 aggregation.","The \/myInbox\/account\/@changeNumber (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) changeNumber attribute is designed to facilitate caching of the element and its descendants. This attribute is assigned to this element by the .NET My Services system. The attribute is read only to applications. Attempts to write this attribute are silently ignored.","The \/myInbox\/account\/@id (minOccurs=1 maxOccurs=1) attribute is a globally unique ID assigned to this element by .NET My Services. Normally, .NET My Services generates and assigns this ID during an insertRequest operation or possibly during a replaceRequest.

Like other .NET My Services, the .NET Lists service allows free-form, name-space qualified extensions to be added to a list, or an item within a list. This mechanism is useful to add semi-structured information to the service with a downside that the service is unable to schema-validate these extensions.","The .NET Lists service breaks down a list into two major components which are the list defined by the list element, and an item defined by the item element.","The list element is designed to contain the definition of a list and serves as an anchor location to which items that belong to that list may refer. Lists may also refer to lists. In any event, the linkage is designed to be a soft linkage so that list definitions may be defined within the confines of the .NET Lists service as well as external to the service. This linkage pattern is that same as the linkage pattern used between element categorization and category definitions as defined in the .NET Category section, above. With this linkage model, the service is able to support personal list definitions in the per-user content document, global list definitions in the shared system document, and external list definitions stored in other addressable resources. The .NET Lists service defines a number of pre-defined lists in the system document. An xpQuery of \/\/sys:list from the .NET Lists service's system document will return these lists.","The item element is designed to represent something that belongs to one or more lists. An item may be categorized (personal, private, sports, and so on) using standard .NET My Services categorization techniques, must have a title, an optional full description, may contain external references via the URL namespace, may be associated or \u201cassigned\u201d to another user, and so on. As noted above, an item refers to a list element, and may in fact refer to multiple list elements. There are however no referential integrity checks made through these references because as will be seen, some will likely use the reference itself as an implicit definition of a list element and in some cases, that element may not exist or may be inaccessible.","An item associates itself with one or more lists by using the listRef element and specifying a relative or absolute URI in the listRef\/@ref attribute. The URI is able to refer to a list element by name where the list element is physically stored in the system document of the .NET Lists service, the content document of the .NET Lists service and\/or an arbitrary XML file located by URI containing list elements.","The listRef element refers to a list definition by absolute or relative URI. The linkage between the two is through the list\/@idName attribute and the listRef\/@ref attribute. The list\/@idName attribute specifies the local id for the list definition, and the listRef\/@ref attribute is the value of that reference.","The value of the listRef\/@ref attribute may take the form:\n\nsystem #name-of-list\n","The list definition being referenced is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201csystem#todo\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201ctodo\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the system document of the .NET Lists service i.e. <list idName=\u201ctodo\u201d\/>.","The value of the listRef\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\ncontent[?puid=puid-value] #name-of-list\n","The list definition being referenced is located in the content document of the .NET Lists service, and its list\/@idName attribute is \u201cname-of-list\u201d. The instance of the .NET Lists service (i.e., the puid of the service) is implied by the context of the reference. This may be made explicit by inserting ?puid=puid-value to the URI, and when this is done, it means the content document of the .NET Lists service whose puid is \u201cpuid-value\u201d holds the list definition. For example, the list reference of <listRef ref=\u201ccontent#bellSqaureShopping\u201d\/> is a reference to the list definition whose list\/@idName value is \u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d, and that this list definition is located in the content document of the .NET Lists service for the current puid i.e. <list idName=\u201cbellSquareShopping\u201d\/>.","The value of the listRef\/@ref attribute may also take the form:\n\nany-uri#name-of-list\n","The category list being referenced is located in an external (to .NET My Services) resource.

Note that subscriptions (described above) may be made on endpoints, which will generate a notification whenever a change occurs that satisfies the query of the notification.","An endpoint has no strict semantics within .NET Presence. It is a typology for classifying different forms of presence information, but .NET Presence is not aware of the semantics of endpoints, so any restrictions and classifications are outside the scope of the service itself. Some of the potential types of endpoints include instant messaging presence services (e.g., MSN Messenger), device-oriented presence (mobile phones, pagers), physical location presence (GPS, directory, and so on), and integrated presence (obtained by joining other endpoints). Again, no semantics are exposed for any of these endpoints at the core level of .NET Presence.","The semantics of a given endpoint are exposed through one or more argots. An argot identifies a type of domain-specific schema through which the presence of an endpoint is represented. Since the presence semantics are entirely contained within argots, consumers of presence information can only understand presence information to the extent that they understand the argots in which that information is represented. In other words, argots are tagged blobs of information that applications know how to interpret, at least in part, so as to exchange presence-related data, (although a given application may not know anything about a particular argot and will simply not interpret that argot). Note that in an alternative implementation, argots may be implemented in tagged \u201cany\u201d fields of XML blobs.","In general, argots can be application-specific. With an application-specific argot, the argot's schema is understood by a limited set of applications, containing data that is only meaningful to those applications.

The service is a place holder for personal information that is not covered by other personal .NET My Services like .NET Address. Between this service, and the .NET Address service, many of the pieces of data typically found in an address book entry, or personal profile can be found.","Each .NET My Services user has one (logical) Profile service document, and each user maintains complete control over read and write access to the information contained within that profile service document. The user can control visibility of nodes and grant various levels access to applications and other users based on the role templates. Users can consent to either a one-time or continued access, allowing applications to use data from the Profile to pre-fill a form as part of a transaction.","Users can also direct the Profile service to publish information to one or more .NET Contacts service (myContacts) users via a mechanism called LiveContacts. Subscribers view this data in the form of a Contact record. The Profile owner chooses what information is published to each subscriber role. Once a publisher\/subscriber relationship is established, the subscriber's myContact entry for the user's Profile becomes an automatically updated, read only Contact record (a \u201cLiveContact\u201d), i.e., any changes made to that Profile will automatically be reflected in all subscribers' Contact record. The decision about what information gets published to whom is controlled by the owner of the profile through the use of roles. In one implementation, the aforementioned service-to-service communications protocol (SSCP) provides a highly efficient, robust mechanism for such automatic updates, as described below.","myProfile\/Roles","The myProfile service controls access by using the rt0, rt1, rt2, rt3 and rt99 roleTemplates, using the following scopes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1279","num":"1306"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00121","num":"00121"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"scope allElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=7215df55-e4af-449f-a8e4-72a1f7c6a987>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=t>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=a159c93d-4010-4460-bc34-5094c49c1633>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlySelfSubscriptionElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=b7f05a6d-75cd-4958-9dfb-f532ebb17743>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},"scope onlyPublicElements"]},{"entry":[{},"<hs:scope id=da025540-a0c0-470f-adcf-9f07e5a5ec8f>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<hs:shape base=nil>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/*[cat\/@ref=\u2018hs:public\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<hs:include select=\/\/subscription[@creator=\u2018$callerId\u2019]\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/hs:shape>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/hs:scope>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The myProfile roleTemplate rt0 role gives complete read\/write access to the information within the content document of the service being protected through this roleTemplate.

To this end, the myWallet service uses an XML schema to describe payment instruments in a user's wallet and the methods by which a payment instrument is stored and manipulated in the store. The methods and access rights that allow for the manipulation of contents in a user's wallet by different role type.","For example, in addition to the XML schema for wallet content, the .NET Wallet service provides, under the user's control, the ability for data access by a merchant on behalf of a user. The myWallet service accomplishes this via a query only method for a merchant to view the payment instrument to which a user has granted access. As another example, access by a financial issuer on behalf of a user is allowed, whereby a financial issuer may manage the payment instruments that are issued by this issuer (e.g. the credit card issuer), provided that the user has granted the issuer such access right. For example, a financial issuer may manage certain aspects of wallet content on behalf of a user, such as to update the expiration date of a card, change the billing address when a user is moved and notified his or her bank, change the bank routing number when the bank is merged, and so forth.","To increase security and data privacy, the key elements of a wallet (e.g. credit card number) may be encrypted using a key or password that only the user knows. By doing so, even if a user's account is compromised, the key data in wallet is still protected and non-usable.","The myWallet service is thus directed to payment instrument information, which comprises a payment method that the entity will use to pay, including card based payment instruments like credit cards and debit cards, and account based payment instruments, such as traditional checking accounts and savings accounts, or any non-traditional account that allows a user to accumulate charges and be billed on a regular basis, such as a telephone bill.","In keeping with the present invention, the .NET Wallet service supplies such information on demand to appropriate .Net-based services, applications or devices. To this end, the .NET Wallet service uses .NET My Services to support a rich sharing model based on the access control list, role map, and identity header.","The .NET Wallet service exposes the changeNotify method to be used on the .NET Wallet element only.

It is thus possible for the data to be stored and managed by one service, regardless of how many services or applications make use of the data.","Generally, there are at least two ways that this data sharing can take place (assuming that appropriate security constraints are satisfied), a first of which is that one service that wants data queries another service that has the data, i.e., a pull model. Alternatively, a service that wants data can informs the service that has the data to send it the current copy of the data and places an outstanding request to send it any changes to that data. The said changes are sent asynchronously. This is a push model.","The .NET services defines verbs such as query, update, etc., which can be used as a basis for the pull data pipe between services. But for reasons of bandwidth optimization and robustness, the push model turns out to be a better choice for service to service communication. To this end, and in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a service-to-service communication protocol (SSCP) is provided that supports a push model of data sharing between .NET MyServices services.","As used herein, a \u201cpublisher\u201d refers to the .NET MyServices service which is the source of the data, while a \u201csubscriber\u201d refers to the .NET MyServices service that receives the data. In general, SSCP is a generic way for a .NET MyServices service to publish data changes to another .NET MyServices service. For example, SSCP does not make any assumptions on what data is being published, and the data may be from any source, e.g., .NET Contacts, .NET Profile, .NET Presence, .NET Inbox and so forth. SSCP also does not make any assumptions on which services can be publishers and which services can be subscribers. With SSCP, the same service can be a publisher and subscriber, publishers can publish to multiple subscribers and subscribers can subscribe to multiple publishers.","In general, a given service can publish\/subscribe to a static list of other services, e.g., .NET Contacts (alternatively referred to as myContacts) may be configured with the list of services (e.g., .NET Profile\/myProfile, .NET Inbox\/myInbox and so on) that it wants to publish to and\/or subscribe from, and this list will ordinarily not change. However, although the services are static, the instances of services are not. For example, once a service A is configured with the ability to publish or subscribe from service B, service A can do so with any instance of B For security reasons and the like, only .NET services can participate in data communication over SSCP.","For purposes of explanation, the present invention will be described with respect to a number of examples. However, while these examples correspond to likely scenarios and implementations, it is understood that the present invention is not limited to the particular examples used, but rather works with essentially any service's data communication with essentially any other service.","By way of a first example, consider a scenario of an email whitelist, which is a list of addresses that are allowed to send email to a particular recipient. Email from people belonging to the whitelist is put in the inbox; all other email is sent to a Junk Mail folder or to the deleted folder. Sometimes, the whitelist of a user is the same as her contact list\u2014this would be the case with the .NET Inbox service. Even if this is not the case, it is fairly straightforward to store a whitelist in .NET Contacts by the use of a categorization mechanism present in .NET My Services.","Using the pull model, a white list can be implemented in a brute force fashion by arranging the .NET Inbox service (e.g., directly or in conjunction with an application program) to look at the sender address whenever a message is received. The .NET Inbox service may query the user's .NET Contacts service to see if the sender is in the contact list, whereby depending on the result of the query, .NET Inbox service either puts the message in the Inbox or puts it in the Junk Mail folder. As can be understood, this approach has obvious performance and scaling problems, as it is impractical or impossible for any service that handles hundreds of millions of email messages every day to use such a model; the sheer volume of traffic between .NET Inbox and .NET Contacts would bring down both the services.","In keeping with the present invention, a superior approach is for the .NET Inbox service to maintain a local copy of the whitelist, and subscribe to the .NET Contacts data of every user that has enabled a Junk Mail filter. Whenever changes occur to the whitelist, the .NET Contacts service uses SSCP to send those changes to the .NET Inbox service. Because the .NET Inbox service has a local copy of the white list, the performance\/scaling issues are avoided, and any traffic between the .NET Inbox service and the .NET Contacts service occurs only when the whitelist changes in the .NET Contacts service, the .NET Inbox service subscribes to the .NET Contacts service document of a new user (or a user who has newly activated her junk mail filters) or the .NET Inbox service asks the .NET Contacts service to delete the subscription of a currently subscribed user.","Whitelists represent a simple publish-subscribe scenario in that user id's of the publisher and subscriber are the same. There is no requirement to take into account the role of the subscriber in the publisher's document, the assumption being that the same id plays the \u201cowner\u201d role on both sides of this communication channel. A more complex example is that of Live Contacts. Among the contacts managed by the .NET Contacts service, it is likely that many are users of .NET My Services. As a result, these contacts will have a .NET Profile service which manages data in their profile. In general, the data stored in a contact record of .NET Contacts is a subset of what is stored in that contact's profile, the boundaries of the said subset being determined by the role of the subscriber in the originating profile's role list. Thus, it is natural for .NET Contacts service to subscribe to the .NET Profile service to get the data for many of the contacts that it manages. From the other perspective, the .NET Profile service publishes its data to the .NET Contacts service.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, because, .NET Profile of this user publishes any changes to the .NET Contacts service of each appropriately authorized user (e.g., in a trusted circle of friends), whenever a user updates his profile, such as to change his or her email address, that change becomes immediately visible to the users in his or her trusted circle when they look up his email via their .NET Contacts service. Note that SSCP works across realms as well as between services in the same realm, e.g., a subscriber contacts service in a realm corresponding to MSN.com will be able to receive published changes from a publisher profile service in a realm corresponding to a provider such as XYZ.com, as well as from an MSN.com profile service.","The present invention favors the push model over the pull model. While the pull model is usually simpler, its conceivable use is limited to data pipes with low traffic and\/or few subscribers. However, the push model, while a little more involved, provides a bandwidth optimized, robust data pipe and is ideal for high-traffic and\/or large number of subscribers. To ensure robustness in such an environment of transient network and\/or service failures, the present invention establishes common message formats, and an accepted set of primitives that the parties involved understand, so that transactions among them follow predictable logical sequences. SSCP also establishes handshaking procedures with ACK to handle lost messages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1463","num":"1490"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["501","502","504","506","508","510","520","521","522","501","502","520"]},"As represented by the logical connections (shown in  as arrows) between the identity-based contacts and the identify-based profiles, the .NET Contacts service  has subscriptions in two different .NET Profile services, namely  and . Similarly, it is likely that a given publisher will publish to multiple subscribers. Note that a single service may act both as a subscriber and a publisher, e.g., in the whitelist example above, the .NET Contacts service is a publisher, while in the Live Contacts example, .NET Contacts service is a subscriber.","As represented in , when the profile information for User (maintained in .NET Profile ) changes, change information is published by the .NET Profile service  to the .NET Contacts service , as both User and User have subscribed for the service. Note that in  this is indicated by the arrow to a particular contact for each user. Note that within the context of a given topic, the data flows from the publisher to the subscriber. As also represented by the arrows in , only User has subscribed for profile changes of User. Thus, when User's profile is changed, the .NET Profile service  will publish the changes only to User's .NET Contacts , and User's .NET Contacts does not see these changes.","Returning to User, consider that User's role in User's .NET Profile is that of an associate, while the role of User is that of a friend. When .NET Profile publishes the data, it sends data visible to an associate to User, and data visible to a friend to User. To this end, SSCP sends changes only to subscribed users within a subscribing service, and determines the role of each subscribing user and filters the data based on the role. Furthermore, if User's role was also that of an associate, then only one copy of the associate data would be sent to the subscribing service, thus optimizing usage of network resources.","In order to accomplish such selecting data communication and filtering, the publisher maintains information about the identifier (ID) of the subscribing users, (e.g., User, User). Also, for each subscribing user, the publisher maintains the ID of the user's data for which they have subscribed, e.g., for User of .NET Contacts , this is User and User in .NET Profile service . The publisher also maintains information regarding the role of the subscribing user, e.g., in the context of User in .NET Profile service, this is associate for User, friend for User).","In order for the publisher to keep this information current, the subscriber notifies the publisher whenever one of its users wants to unsubscribe or add a new subscription. For example, consider that User wants to add User into his live contact list, and remove User. SSCP provides for transmission of subscription updates from subscriber to publisher using the same robust mechanism as are used for transmitting data changes.","The SSCP data pipe is robust and as such, is tolerant of transient network and\/or service failures. At a fundamental level, to provide robustness, the publisher or subscriber needs to know that their transmitted messages have reached the destination, which means that each request from a sender should have a response from the receiver. If the message fails to reach the receiver, e.g. due to transient network and\/or service failure, it is resent during the next update interval. This resend process is repeated until a response is received, with a specified number of such retries performed, after which no further attempts are made for an appropriately longer time to prevent a flood of retry messages, e.g., in the case of a catastrophic failure at the destination.","More subtle types of failures also need to be handled. For example, consider a publisher sending a request to the subscriber, informing it of the change in a stored profile. The subscriber ordinarily receives and processes the request, and sends a response to the publisher. However, if the network connection between the subscriber and the publisher has a transient failure and the response fails to reach the publisher, the publisher will re-send its request it request during the next update interval. In SSCP, the subscriber recognizes that this is a redundant request, and that it has already been processed, whereby the subscriber acknowledges the request again, but does not process it. In other words, a request is processed only once even if it is sent multiple times. Alternatively, a subscriber can process a repeat request any number of times, however the result of any subsequent processing should not change the first processing result. This property is referred to as idempotency.","For efficiency, because a typical service manages enormous amounts of data, partitioned over millions of users and the source data will be almost constantly changing, the protocol batches multiple requests and send them periodically. To this end, a protocol handler at the service periodically wakes up after a specified interval and sends the batched messages. Moreover, if a catastrophic failure (such as loss of power) occurs, this state data regarding the messages to send should not be lost, so data pertaining to protocol state should be stored in a durable manner, e.g., persisted to a hard disk.","As generally represented in , SSCP is implemented at a publisher (service)  and subscriber (service)  by respective protocol handlers , , such as daemon processes or the like running with respect to a service. The publisher  and subscriber  exchange messages, and use this as a mechanism to communicate changes.","The requirements of the protocol dictate that SSCP handlers ,  maintain several pieces of data, the sum total of which represents the state of a publisher or subscriber. As conceptually represented in , this data can be viewed as being segmented over several data structures -. Note however that the arrangements, formats and other description presented herein are only logically represent the schema; the actual storage format is not prescribed, and an implementation may store in any fashion it deems fit as long as it logically conforms to this schema.","A publisher  communicates with a subscriber  using request and response messages. For example, when data changes at the publisher , the publisher , sends a request message to the subscriber  informing the subscriber that data has changed, normally along with the new data. The subscriber  receives the message, makes the required updates, and sends back an ACK message acknowledging that the message was received and that the changes were made. A subscriber  can also send a request message, such as when the subscriber  wants to subscribe or un-subscribe to a piece of datum. When the publisher  receives this message, the publisher  updates its list of subscriptions (in a publications table ) and sends back a response acknowledging the request. Note that SSCP is agnostic to whether a response message for a given request is synchronous or asynchronous.","Thus, there are two primary parts to SSCP, a first from the publisher to the subscriber, which deals with sending changes made to the publisher's data, and a second from subscriber to the publisher, which deals with keeping the list of subscriptions synchronized. Furthermore, every service is required to provide notification to all other services that have subscriptions with it, or services with which it has subscriptions, when it is going offline or online.","The table below summarizes request messages, each of which having a corresponding response (e.g., ACK) message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1477","num":"1504"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00136","num":"00136"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"287pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"REQUEST MESSAGES"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Message","Description","Type","From\/To"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["UpdateSubscriptionData","Used by the publisher to publish","Request","Publisher"]},{"entry":[{},"changes to its data",{},"to Subscriber"]},{"entry":["updateSubscriptionDataResponse","Used by the subscriber to ACK","Response","Subscriber"]},{"entry":[{},"updateSubscriptionData",{},"to Publisher"]},{"entry":["UpdateSubscriptionMap","Used by the subscriber to inform","Request","Subscriber"]},{"entry":[{},"the publisher that subscriptions",{},"to Publisher"]},{"entry":[{},"have been added or deleted"]},{"entry":["UpdateSubscriptionMapResponse","Used by the publisher to ACK","Response","Publisher"]},{"entry":[{},"updateSubscriptionMap",{},"to Subscriber"]},{"entry":["ServiceStatus","Used by both publisher and","Request","Both"]},{"entry":[{},"subscriber to inform that they are",{},"directions"]},{"entry":[{},"going offline, or have come"]},{"entry":[{},"online"]},{"entry":["Standard .NET My Services ack","Used by both publisher and","Response","Both"]},{"entry":[{},"subscriber to ACK serviceStatus",{},"directions"]},{"entry":[{},"request"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Protocol parameters are supported by both the publisher and the subscriber and control the behavior of the protocol.","As noted above, SSCP supports the ability to batch request messages. Whenever there is a need to send a request message, such as when there are changes in publisher data or subscriptions, the service puts the corresponding request message into a publisher message queue . Periodically, the protocol handler  in the publishing service  wakes up and processes the messages in the queue . This period is called as the UpdateInterval, and is a configurable parameter.","To satisfy the robustness requirement, the publisher's protocol handler  needs to periodically resend requests until the publisher service  receives an acknowledge message (ACK). If the ACK for a message is successfully received, this message is purged from the queue . Until then, the message remains in the queue, flagged as having been sent at least once, so it will be retried at the next update interval. The number of times the publisher the publisher service  retries sending a message to the subscriber service  is configurable by the parameter RetryCount, i.e., after retrying this many times, the publisher service  assumes that the subscriber service  is dead. Then, once the maximum number of retries is over, the publisher service  waits for a relatively longer time. Once this longer time is elapsed, the publisher service  sets the RetryCount parameter to zero and begins resending the queued up requests over again. This longer time (before beginning the retry cycle), is configurable by the parameter ResetInterval.","Below is the summary of these protocol parameters:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1482","num":"1509"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00137","num":"00137"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PROTOCOL PARAMETERS"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Parameter","Use"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"UpdateInterval","The interval after which the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"protocol handler wakes up and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"processes batched requests."]},{"entry":[{},"RetryCount","The number of times we retry a"]},{"entry":[{},{},"connection before assuming the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"remote service is dead."]},{"entry":[{},"ResetInterval","The interval after which a"]},{"entry":[{},{},"service marked as dead"]},{"entry":[{},{},"is retested for aliveness."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Thus, to implement SSCP, the protocol handlers ,  at the publisher and subscriber, respectively, track of several pieces of information, such as in their respective tables -.","As with .NET in general, SSCP relies on the entities (services and users) being uniquely identifiable by the use of identifiers, e.g., every user in .NET has a unique identifier assigned by the Microsoft\u00ae Passport service.
