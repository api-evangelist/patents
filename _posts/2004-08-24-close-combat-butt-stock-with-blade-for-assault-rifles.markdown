title: Close combat butt stock with blade for assault rifles
abstract: A close quarter combat butt stock and blade apparatus for an assault weapon is provided with a slideable cover for a close quarters combat assembly having a rear bayonet. The close quarters combat assembly is connected to the concealed rear bayonet, has an interior opening that defines a close combat handle and a hand shield and is positioned behind the first pistol grip and first trigger. A second trigger is also built into the interior opening. In a closed position, the slideable cover covers the close quarters combat assembly and the rear bayonet remains concealed within the butt stock. When the slideable cover is in the open position, the rear bayonet is simultaneously extended rearward permitting the military and law enforcement user to thrust the rear bayonet at an opponent attacking from the rear or side. Maintaining the bayonet and close quarters combat position with the firing hand next to the second trigger permits the user to fire the weapon much more quickly than before, which will optimize the handling of the assault weapon during bayonet and close quarters fighting, protect the firing hand during bayonet and close quarters fighting and provide the user the means to fire the weapon during bayonet and close quarters fighting. Other embodiments include an assault weapon, an assault rifle, an assault weapon equipped with a close quarters combat assembly and a method for rapidly sliding a slideable cover of an assault weapon and extending a rear bayonet behind a user.

No. 10\/719,853 entitled \u201cClose Combat Butt Stock For Assault Weapons\u201d filed by the inventor herein on Nov. 21, 2003. A Notice Of Allowability has been filed in that case. This patent application is also related to U.S. patent application entitled \u201cClose Combat Handguard For Rifles\u201d which has been filed by the inventor herein, has not yet been assigned a Ser. No. 10\/925,296.","The invention generally relates to the field of firearms and assault weapons. In particular, the invention relates to apparatus and methods to provide assault weapons with a close combat butt stock and blade apparatus having a rear bayonet blade for increased protection and safety of military and law enforcement users during bayonet and close combat operations.","Most current assault weapons, including assault rifles, are designed for the military and law enforcement users to quickly raise the weapon from a carrying position to a shouldered firing position in a single motion. Military and law enforcement users still face a number of lethal close quarters combat situations during which the assault weapon will be held in a different position that is known as the bayonet and close quarters combat position wherein the assault weapon is held across the chest and not shouldered. The bayonet and close quarters combat position is suitable for those situations when an opponent or intruder is directly in front of the user and the conventional front bayonet points in front of the assault weapon near the target and no significant movement is needed to move the conventional front bayonet to the opponent. However, when the user is in an equally lethal close combat or ambush situation with a rear or sideways opponent, the user holding the assault weapon across the chest will be unable to use the conventional front bayonet without rapidly moving the entire assault weapon from the front to the rear or side positions. Using a conventional assault weapon will permit the user to move the assault weapon butt stock rearward or sideways in order to club or bludgeon the opponent to the rear or side, but that maneuver would only be painful but not lethal to the opponent. Thus, there has been a long-standing need for the military and law enforcement user holding a weapon in the standard bayonet and close quarters combat position to rapidly position a bayonet behind or beside the user. In these encounters, using the conventional front bayonet may be inadequate, cumbersome and time-consuming.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","11","12","13","14","12","13","15"]},"Referring now to , where the same numerals are employed for like structures, the military user is depicted holding the prior art assault weapon  in the bayonet and close quarters combat position, with a conventional front bayonet pointing directly in front of the user. If the user is initially holding the weapon  in the close quarters combat position across the user's body and must then fire the weapon  quickly because of a sudden enemy attack or ambush, the user must rapidly reposition his firing hand from the conventional butt stock  to the pistol grip  and trigger .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2","b":["10","10","12","13"]},"Thus there has been a long-felt need for an assault weapon with a butt stock allowing the user to simultaneously hold the weapon in the bayonet and close quarters combat position, keep the firing hand ready to pull the trigger and possess the capability to rapidly extend a bayonet behind the user without the cumbersome, time-consuming and dangerous movement of the upper body, legs and entire assault weapon around to point the bayonet at the opponent or intruder. The present invention fulfills this long-felt need with a close combat butt stock and blade apparatus for assault weapons that solves the long-standing problems, shortcomings and deficiencies of prior art weapons by providing a rear bayonet in the butt stock that is hidden by a slideable cover, with the rear bayonet being readily extendable by sliding the slideable cover. The present invention further comprises a close quarters combat assembly comprising a rear bayonet, a close combat carrying handle, a second trigger and a hand shield built into the assault weapon butt stock, allowing the user to much more efficiently slide the cover back and expose the rear bayonet, as well as holding the weapon's butt stock with a firing hand much closer to a second trigger allowing the user to fire the weapon much more quickly than before, without suffering from the problems, shortcomings and deficiencies of prior art assault weapons.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a close quarters combat butt stock and blade apparatus for assault weapons with a slideable cover and rear bayonet.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a close quarters combat butt stock and blade apparatus for assault weapons with a close quarters combat assembly further comprising a slideable cover, a rear bayonet, a close combat handle, a second trigger and a hand shield.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide methods for rapidly removing a slideable cover and extending a rear bayonet behind or to the side of the military or law enforcement user.","These and other objects and advantages can now be attained by this invention's close quarters combat butt stock and blade apparatus for assault weapons, comprising a slideable cover for a close quarters combat assembly further comprising a rear bayonet, a close combat carrying handle, a second trigger and hand shield. In accordance with the present invention, the military and law enforcement user can now safely and efficiently hold the assault weapon in the bayonet and close quarters combat position with the firing hand in close proximity to the slideable cover and then simultaneously and rapidly slide the slideable cover and extend the rear bayonet with a single motion of the firing hand. Maintaining the bayonet and close quarters combat position with the firing hand next to the slideable cover permits the user to rapidly slide the slideable cover back and then extend a rear bayonet behind the user toward a rear opponent much more quickly than moving the front bayonet and the entire assault weapon around from the front to the rear, without suffering from the problems, shortcomings and deficiencies of prior art assault weapons. The close quarters combat assembly of the present invention also includes a second trigger and a hand shield for added user protection and versatility. By incorporating this invention's close combat butt stock and blade apparatus into current military and law enforcement arsenals, these weapons will now optimize bayonet use and other handling of the weapon during bayonet and close quarters fighting, protect the user from an ambush or sudden attack by allowing a rearwards bayonet thrust, protect the firing hand during bayonet and close quarters fighting and provide the user the means to fire the weapon with the second trigger during bayonet and close quarters fighting, without suffering from the problems, disadvantages and shortcomings of prior art assault weapons. Other embodiments include an assault weapon, an assault rifle, an assault weapon equipped with a close combat butt stock assembly and a method for rapidly removing a slideable cover and extending a rear bayonet behind the user, which are also considered to be within the contemplation of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","14","11","12","13"]},"Referring now to , there is depicted an assault weapon  and the close combat butt stock and blade apparatus of the present invention with the close quarters combat assembly  in the covered position. Assault weapon  further comprises a first pistol grip , a first trigger  and a slideable cover  that covers the close quarters combat assembly . The close quarters combat assembly  is located in the vicinity of the first pistol grip  and first trigger . When the close quarters combat assembly  is in the covered position the assault weapon  appears quite similar to the conventional butt stock  depicted in .","Referring now to , where the same numerals are employed for like structures, assault weapon  is depicted with the slideable cover  in the open position and fully extended away from the first pistol grip , as indicated by arrow . When the firing hand is in close proximity to the slideable cover , a single motion of the firing hand can rapidly slide the slideable cover  backwards and extend the rear bayonet  behind the user toward an opponent or intruder much more quickly than moving the front bayonet and the entire assault weapon  around from the front to the rear. Sliding the slideable cover  back also exposes a close combat handle , an interior opening , a second trigger  and a hand shield . The slideable cover  and rear bayonet  are configured so that the rear bayonet  is automatically and simultaneously extended back whenever the slideable cover  is slid back. A means for locking the slideable cover, not shown, locks the slideable cover  over the close quarters combat assembly and a means for trigger control can control the first trigger  and second trigger .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["30","31","37","30","36","31","37","39","40"]},"A number of variations to the close combat butt stock and blade apparatus are within the contemplation of this invention, including positioning the close combat butt assembly in the vicinity of the first pistol grip , locating the second trigger  within the interior opening , the user rapidly engaging the second trigger  with the firing hand while holding the assault weapon  in a bayonet and close quarters combat position and having the interior opening  dimensioned sufficiently large for the firing hand to rapidly grasp the close combat handle . The slideable cover  may have a means for locking the slideable cover and, during the covered position, the slideable cover  covers the close combat butt assembly when not in use and protects the close combat butt stock assembly when the assault weapon is held in other positions. The assault weapon can also be an assault rifle. Other embodiments of the present invention include an assault weapon, an assault rifle and an assault weapon equipped with a close quarters combat assembly, along with variations thereto that are similar to the close combat butt stock and blade apparatus.","The present invention also contemplates a method for rapidly sliding a slideable cover of an assault weapon and extending a rear bayonet behind a user, comprising the steps of forming a close quarters combat assembly, forming the rear bayonet, positioning the close quarters combat assembly within a butt stock of the assault weapon, configuring the close quarters combat assembly with the slideable cover being connected to the rear bayonet and forming the slideable cover to have an open position and a closed position. In a positioning step, the close quarters combat assembly is positioned in the vicinity of a first pistol grip and in an opposite direction from a gun barrel and a first trigger of the assault weapon. During a concealing step, the rear bayonet is concealed within the butt stock when the slideable cover is in the closed position. In a sliding step, the slideable cover is rapidly slid in the opposite direction into the open position, which simultaneously extends the rear bayonet rearwards permitting the user to forcefully thrust the rear bayonet at an opponent. Many of the variations that are possible with the other embodiments of the present invention are also considered to be within the contemplation of the method of the present invention.","It is to be further understood that other features and modifications to the foregoing detailed description are encompassed by the present invention, which is not limited by this detailed description.
