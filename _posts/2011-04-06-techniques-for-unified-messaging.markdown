title: Techniques for unified messaging
abstract: Techniques involving unified messaging and other functionality are described. In one or more implementations, the techniques describe receiving a message at a web service from a messaging client and identifying a communication device that includes telephone functionality and is configured to format the message as a short messaging service (SMS) message. The SMS message may be identified by a phone number associated with the communication device. The message may then be sent to the communication device for automatic transmission of the SMS message by the communication device over a phone network.

Many of these computing devices are capable of communicating one with another. Electronic communication may be available in many different formats. One example of a popular communication format is referred to as a text message, which may be sent and\/or received via a mobile phone.","Other devices may also send and\/or receive text messages. However, many of these other devices may have limited text functionality which may negatively affect a text message being sent through one of these other devices. Consequently, users may become frustrated with the effects caused by the limited functionality of these other devices.","Techniques involving unified messaging and other functionality are described. In one or more implementations, the techniques describe receiving a message at a web service from a messaging client and identifying a communication device that includes telephone functionality and is configured to format the message as a short messaging service (SMS) message. The SMS message may be identified by a phone number associated with the communication device. The message may then be sent to the communication device for automatic transmission of the SMS message by the communication device over a phone network.","In implementations, techniques involving unified messaging involve receiving a message over a network at a communication device and configuring the message as a short messaging service (SMS) message. A phone number associated with the communication device may be assigned to the SMS message. Following this, the SMS message may be transmitted over a phone network.","In implementations, a SMS message may be received at a web service from a communication device, where the communication device is configured to forward the SMS message to the web service automatically and without user intervention. The web service may then synchronize the SMS message with multiple messaging clients associated with a user to enable the user to access the SMS message via one or more of the multiple messaging clients.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Conventional techniques that were used to send and\/or receive text messages operated via mobile phones. Other devices and applications, however, were subsequently developed to also avail themselves of text functionality. The text functionality on these other devices, however, may be limited so as to negatively affect a text message being sent from one of these other devices. For example, a recipient of the text message may receive the text message with missing or altered information such that it is difficult to identify a sender of the text. For example, a random phone number may be attached to the text message and thus the message is typically not resolved by the user's contact information to identify the sender.","Techniques involving unified messaging are described. In the following discussion, a variety of different implementations are described that involve unified messaging to send and\/or receive electronic messages over a variety of devices. In this way, a user may readily access the messaging functionality in an efficient manner without encountering the complexities involved using conventional messaging techniques.","For example, in one or more implementations, unified messaging involves receiving a message at a web service from a messaging client (e.g., that is not an SMS message) and identifying a communication device that includes telephone functionality and is configured to format the message as a short messaging service (SMS) message. The SMS message may thus be identified by a phone number associated with the communication device. Accordingly, a recipient of the SMS message may readily identify the sender of the SMS message. The message may then be sent to the communication device for automatic transmission of the SMS message over a telephone network. Further discussion of this and other implementations that involve unified messaging may be found in the following sections.","In another example, a SMS message may be received at a web service from a communication device, where the communication device is configured to forward the SMS message to the web service automatically and without user intervention. Once received, the web service may synchronize the SMS message with multiple messaging clients associated with a user to enable the user to access the SMS message via one or more of the multiple messaging clients. In this way, a unified user experience may be supported across a variety of different devices.","In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that is operable to employ the unified messaging techniques described herein. Example illustrations of systems and procedures involving unified messaging are then described, which may be employed in the example environment as well as in other environments. Accordingly, the example environment is not limited to performing the example systems and procedures. Likewise, the example procedures and systems are not limited to implementation in the example environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","100","110","112","114","114","116","118"]},"The illustrated environment  also includes an example communication device  that includes a processor , computer readable media  (e.g., memory), and a messaging module . The communication device  may be configured with functionality operable to communicate with other devices over a network provided by a base station . The base station  may provide a communication network apart from and\/or in conjunction with the cloud . For example, the base station may establish a cellular network or other phone network, a radio network, and so on.","The illustrated environment  includes an example computing device  that may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the computing device  may be configured as a traditional computer (e.g., a desktop personal computer, laptop computer, and so on), a mobile station, an entertainment appliance, tablet, a set-top box communicatively coupled to a television, a wireless phone, a netbook, a game console, and so forth. Thus, the computing device  may range from full resource devices with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and\/or processing resources (e.g., traditional set-top boxes, hand-held game consoles). The computing device  may also relate to software that causes the computing device  to perform one or more operations. Thus, the techniques described herein may be supported by these various configurations of the computing device  and are not limited to the specific examples described in the following sections.","The messaging module  is representative of functionality associated with communicating with one or more other devices over. The communication may be performed in a variety of ways. For example, the messaging module  may be configured to transmit and\/or receive one or more messages to\/from the web service , the communication device , or one or more other devices over the cloud .","The example system  illustrated in  shows the messaging module  as being implemented in an environment where multiple devices are interconnected through a central computing device. The central computing device may be local to the multiple devices or may be located remotely from the multiple devices. In the illustrated embodiment, the central computing device is implemented as part of a \u201ccloud\u201d server farm, which comprises one or more server computers that are connected to the multiple devices through a network, e.g., the Internet. This interconnection architecture may be leveraged to deliver this functionality across multiple devices, such as to provide a common and seamless experience to the user of the multiple devices. Each of the multiple devices may have different physical attributes and capabilities, and the central computing device uses a platform to enable the delivery of an experience to the device that is both tailored to the device and yet common to all devices. In one embodiment, a \u201cclass\u201d of target device is created and experiences are tailored to the generic class of devices. A class of device may be defined by physical features or usage or other common characteristics of the devices.","For example, as previously described the computing device  may assume a variety of different configurations, such as for mobile , computer , and television  uses. Each of these configurations has a generally corresponding screen size and thus the computing device  may be configured accordingly to one or more of these device classes in this example system . For instance, the computing device  may assume the mobile  class of device which includes mobile phones, portable music players, game devices, and so on. The mobile  class of device may also include other handheld devices such as personal digital assistants (PDA), mobile computers, digital cameras, and so on. The computing device  may also assume a computer  class of device that includes personal computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, netbooks, and so on. The television  configuration includes configurations of devices that involve display on a generally larger screen in a casual environment, e.g., televisions, set-top boxes, game consoles, and so on. Thus, the techniques described herein may be supported by these various configurations of the computing device  and are not limited to the specific examples described in the following sections.","The cloud  is illustrated as including a platform  for web services . The platform  abstracts underlying functionality of hardware (e.g., servers) and software resources of the cloud  and thus may act as a \u201ccloud operating system.\u201d For example, the platform  may abstract resources to connect the computing device  with other computing devices. The platform  may also serve to abstract scaling of resources to provide a corresponding level of scale to encountered demand for the web services  that are implemented via the platform . A variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as load balancing of servers in a server farm, protection against malicious parties (e.g., spam, viruses, and other malware), and so on. Thus, web services  and other functionality may be supported without the functionality \u201chaving to know\u201d the particulars of the supporting hardware, software, and network resources.","Accordingly, in an interconnected device embodiment, implementation of functionality of the messaging module  may be distributed throughout the system . For example, the messaging module  may be implemented in part on the computing device  as well as via the platform  that abstracts the functionality of the cloud .","The messaging manager module  is representative of functionality associated with managing a variety of messages transmitted to or from various computing devices . For example, the messaging manager module  may manage storage of one or more messages in a repository  or other database. Further, the messaging manager module  may identify a communication device  associated with the same user that sent the message from the computing device , and cause the communication device  to format the message as a SMS message and transmit the SMS message over the network provided by the base station .","In addition, messages sent to the computing device  over the cloud  may be routed through the platform , and the messaging manager module  may synchronize the message with multiple computing devices  that are each associated with a same recipient user. These synchronized messages may then be accessed by the recipient user at any of the multiple computing devices , further discussion of which may be found in relation to .","Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), manual processing, or a combination of these implementations. The terms \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201cfunctionality,\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation, the module, functionality, or logic represents instructions (e.g., program code) that perform specified tasks when executed on a processor (e.g., CPU or CPUs), functional blocks, and so on. The instructions can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices.","The instructions can be stored in one or more computer readable media. One such configuration of a computer-readable medium is signal bearing medium and thus is configured to transmit the instructions (e.g., as a carrier wave) to the hardware of the computing device, such as via the network . The computer-readable medium may also be configured as a computer-readable storage medium and thus is not a signal bearing medium. Examples of a computer-readable storage medium include a random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), an optical disc, flash memory, hard disk memory, and other memory devices that may use magnetic, optical, and other techniques to store instructions and other data. The features of the techniques described below are platform-independent, meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of hardware configurations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","102","202","204","206","202","204","206"]},"These messaging clients may also direct messages to a phone number, which may be associated with a mobile phone capable of receiving messages such as SMS messages. However, using traditional techniques, messages sent from these types of clients may not be associated with the sender's phone number. Thus, the recipient of the SMS message may read the message, but certain sender information helpful in identifying who sent the message may not be included in the message or may be altered in some way. For instance, traditional techniques for sending a SMS message via an email client may attach a random phone number to the SMS message when transmitting the SMS message to the recipient mobile phone. Therefore, it may become difficult for the recipient to identify the sender of the SMS message, e.g., because the phone number is not capable of being resolved using contact information of the recipient.","The message composed at one of the messaging clients may be transmitted over the cloud  to a web service . The web service  may then identify a communication device  that includes telephone functionality and is associated with the sender of the message. For example, the web service  may search the repository  for a phone number associated with the user identified by the sender information attached to the message, identify a particular computing device capable of sending the message in a desired format (e.g., SMS), and so on. The web service  may then forward the message to the communication device .","The communication device  may, automatically and without user intervention, format the message as a SMS message, attach the user's phone number to the SMS message, and send the formatted SMS message over a phone network provided by the base station  to the intended recipient. By attaching the user's phone number to the SMS message, the recipient may readily identify the sender of the message. The communication device  may also generate and\/or display a notification or confirmation that the SMS message was transmitted. Additionally, the communication device  may include the transmitted SMS message in a history of sent messages, even though the message was composed at a different messaging client.","In this way, no matter which messaging client is used to compose the SMS message, the sender's identification may remain the same to the recipient through communication through the communication device . For example, the sender may send one SMS message via the email client  and then send another SMS message via the IM client  to the same recipient. The recipient, in this example, may see the same sender information on both of the SMS messages. For example, the recipient may see the sender's phone number attached to each of the SMS messages, even though each SMS message was composed at a different messaging client.","Consider now , which is an example implementation  in which a SMS message is received at a variety of messaging clients via unified messaging techniques. An incoming SMS message is received through the base station's  phone network at a recipient's communication device . Automatically and without user intervention, the communication device  may forward a copy of the SMS message to a web service  over the cloud . This may be accomplished using the messaging module  on the communication device .","The web service  may then synchronize the SMS message with a plurality of other devices associated with the recipient. For example, the web service  may synchronize the SMS message with the recipient's email client , the recipient's web client , the recipient's IM client , and\/or any other messaging client associated with the recipient user. In implementations, the web service  may use the phone number of the recipient's communication device  to identify other contact information associated with the recipient. For example, the web service  may search the repository  to locate addresses associated with one or more messaging clients used by the recipient. In implementations, the web service  may identify a particular email address associated with the recipient, and synchronize the SMS message with the email client  for that particular email address.","Additionally, the web service  may access and search the recipient's address book associated with the email address to locate personalized contact information associated with the sender. For example, although the incoming SMS message may include the sender's phone number, the web service  may use the sender's phone number to locate other contact information, such as a name or email address, associated with the sender.","After locating this other contact information in the recipient's address book, the web service  may modify the sender's information in the SMS message to enable the recipient to readily identify the sender. For example, assume Jill sends a SMS message to Jack's phone. Jack's phone may receive and then forward the SMS message to the web service, which in turn synchronizes the SMS message with Jack's email account and modifies the sender information according to Jack's contact information, e.g., an address book. Jack may then access the SMS message via his email client and may readily see that the incoming message is sent from \u201cJill\u201d rather than from \u201c555-5455\u201d.","In addition, the web service  may store the SMS message in a database to allow the recipient to access the SMS message at a later time. In this way, the recipient may access the SMS message from one or more of a variety of different messaging clients. For example, if the recipient is at work and receives a SMS message at his mobile phone, the recipient may access the SMS message via his email client on a desktop computer, rather than checking his mobile phone. This may be beneficial if the recipient inadvertently left his mobile phone in another location, e.g., at home or in the car, or if the recipient's mobile phone's battery becomes depleted. A variety of other scenarios are also contemplated, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following example procedures.","The following discussion describes techniques for unified messaging that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of the procedure may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof The procedure is shown as a set of blocks in this example that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks.

In an embodiment, the audio system  and\/or the display system  are implemented as external components to device . Alternatively, the audio system  and\/or the display system  are implemented as integrated components of example device .","Communication Techniques","The following provides further examples of the communications techniques that may be employed to deliver a message to a communication device as well as transmit the message by the communication device.","Instant Messaging","Instant messaging is a popular text-based communication tool that enables two or more users to exchange messages via a network during an instant messaging session. When two users are online at the same time, for instance, instant messages may be exchanged in real time between the two users. Thus, the instant messages may be utilized to support a text conversation between the two users in a manner that mimics how the two users would participate in a typical spoken conversation.","Instant messaging is typically based on clients that facilitate connections between specified known users. Often, these known users can be associated with a \u201cbuddy list\u201d or \u201ccontact list.\u201d Although instant messaging is text-based, instant messaging may include additional features such as audio and\/or video. For example, during an instant messaging session, users can see each other by using webcams or other video cameras, and\/or hear each other using microphones and speakers.","In an implementation, instant messaging (IM) modules communicate with each other through use of one or more of a plurality of service providers. A service provider, for instance, may include an IM manager module, which is executable to route instant messages between the IM modules. For example, a client may cause the IM module to form an instant message for communication to a recipient. The IM module is executed to communicate the instant message to the service provider, which then executes the IM manager module to route the instant message to the recipient over the network. The recipient receives the instant message and executes the IM module to display the instant message.","Clients can also be communicatively coupled directly, one to another (e.g., via a peer-to-peer network). If so, the instant messages are communicated without utilizing the service provider.","SMS\/MMS","Short Messaging Service (SMS) is communication tool that allows an exchange of short text messages between a fixed line or mobile phone device and fixed or portable devices over a network. Unlike instant messaging, SMS messages can be transmitted without both the sender and receiver being simultaneously online. SMS messages may be sent to a Short Message Service Center (SMSC), which may provide a store and forward mechanism. The SMSC may then attempt to send the SMS messages to intended recipients. If a recipient cannot be reached, the SMSC may queue the SMS message and retry at a later time. Some SMSCs, however, may provide a forward and forget option where transmission is attempted only once. Both senders and recipients of SMS messages may be identified by a phone number associated with the device being used to send or receive the SMS message.","In addition to text, SMS techniques have been expanded to include Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) which allows the exchange of multimedia content along with the short text messages. Multimedia content may include digital photographs, videos, and the like. Similar to SMS messages, MMS messages may identify senders and recipients by their respective phone numbers.","Although MMS messages are similar to SMS messages, MMS messages are delivered in an entirely different way. For example, the multimedia content in the MMS message is first encoded in a manner similar to a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) email. The encoded MMS message is then forwarded to a Multimedia Messaging Service Carrier (MMSC), which is a carrier's MMS store and forward server. If the intended recipient is associated with a different carrier, the MMSC may forward the encoded message to the recipient's carrier using the Internet.","Once the MMSC has received the message, it may determine whether the recipient's device is configured to receive an MMS message. If the recipient's device is MMS capable, then the content is extracted and sent to a temporary storage server with a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) front-end. An SMS control message containing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the MMS content may then be sent to the recipient's device to trigger the recipient device's Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) browser to open and receive the MMS content from the URL. If, however, the recipient device does not support MMS messages, the MMSC may attempt to modify the MMS content into a format suitable for the recipient device before sending the MMS content to the recipient device.","Electronic Mail","Electronic mail, commonly referred to as email or e-mail, is a communication tool for exchanging digital messages from an author to one or more recipients over a network. A user can send an email message through his or her email program, which sends the email message to a mail server. The mail server may then forward the email message to another mail server or to a message store on the same mail server to be forwarded later. Unlike instant messages or SMS\/MMS messages, email messages may identify senders and recipients by addresses including user names and domain names.","Email messages include an envelope, a header, and a body. The header may include fields that have names and values. Some example fields include From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email message. The body may include basic content of the email message, as unstructured text, and may also include a signature block. The envelope is used to store communication parameters for delivery of the email message.","Email is one of the protocols included with the Transport Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols. An example popular protocol for sending email is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), whereas example popular protocols for receiving emails include Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) and\/or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). TCP\/IP can be used as a communication language or protocol of the Internet, an intranet, or extranet. When an email message is sent over a network, the TCP manages assembly of the message or file into smaller packets, also referred to as \u201cpacketizing\u201d the message. These packets are transmitted over the network, such as the Internet, and received by a TCP layer that reassembles the packets into the original message. The IP layer handles the address portion of each packet to ensure that each packet reaches the correct destination.","Web Service","Electronic messages may also be sent and received via a web service. A web service may include a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Implementations of web services include web-based email services and\/or web-based IM services. Web based services may include Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages that follow a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) standard. Other web services may include Web Application Programming Interfaces (Web API), which may include a set of HTTP request messages along with a definition of the structure of response messages.","Web services may be used in a number of ways. Some example uses include Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and Representational State Transfer (REST).","Interoperability of Electronic Communication","In some implementations one communication tool may be used within another. For example, email messages may be sent and\/or received from within a web service. In addition, SMS messages may be sent using an email application and\/or an IM application. When one communication tool is used within another tool, however, the one communication tool may have limited functionality which may affect the message being sent or received.","For instance, a SMS message may be sent from within an email application. However, email identifies the sender by an email address whereas SMS identifies senders and receivers by phone number. In traditional techniques, a random phone number may be attached to the SMS message before the recipient receives the SMS message. This random phone number may create a disconnect between the sender and recipient at least because the recipient may not know or recognize the sender of the SMS message, causing user confusion and frustration. Having considered traditional techniques used for electronic communication, the following describes techniques for a unified messaging service.","Although embodiments of unified messaging techniques have been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather, the specific features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the unified messaging techniques."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures.
