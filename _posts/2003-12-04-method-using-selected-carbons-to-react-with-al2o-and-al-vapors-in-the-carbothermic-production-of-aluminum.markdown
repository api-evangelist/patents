Nos. 2,974,032 (Grunert et al.) and 6,440,193 B1 (Johansen et al.). It has long been recognized that the overall reaction.\n\nAlO+3C=2Al+3CO\u2003\u2003(1) \n\ntakes place, or can be made to take place, generally in steps such as:\n\n2AlO+9C=AlC+6CO (vapor)\u2003\u2003(2) \n\nAlC+AlO=6Al+3CO (vapor)\u2003\u2003(3) \n\nAlO+2C=AlO+2CO (vapor)\u2003\u2003(4) \n\nAlO+4Al=3AlO (vapor)\u2003\u2003(5), and \n\nAl=Al (vapor)\u2003\u2003(6). \n","Reaction () takes place at temperatures below 2000\u00b0 C. and generally between 1900\u00b0 C. and 2000\u00b0 C. Reaction (), which is the aluminum producing reaction, takes place at higher temperatures of about 2050\u00b0 C. Very importantly, in addition to the species stated in reactions () and (), volatile species including gaseous Al, reaction (), and gaseous aluminum suboxide that is AlO, are formed in reaction () or () and are carried away with the off gas. Unless recovered, these volatile species will represent a loss in the yield of aluminum and the large amount of energy associated with the reduction and vaporization steps.","In the overall carbothermic reduction process, the AlO and Al gases are recovered by reacting them with carbon in a separate reactor usually called the vapor recovery unit or vapor recovery reactor, as taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,970 B2 (Lindstad). There, a carbon-hydrogen gas, such as methane, butane, acetylene or the like was cracked to provide a finely dispersed carbon which could be deposited on carbon seed particles. This required an extra cracking step. Depending on the gas composition and reaction temperature, the reaction product with carbon may be AlC, an (AlC\u2014AlO) liquid slag or the gases may simply condense as AlO. It is desirable to form AlCbecause it is required in the smelting furnace and the energy associated with the Al and AlO is recovered as valuable chemical energy and can be returned to the smelter. If the AlOand carbon form by condensation the energy is released as heat in the vapor recovery reactor and very little is returned to the process. If an AlC\u2014AlOslag forms, all of the Al and some of the energy are recovered. However, the liquid product may cause bridging of the particles in the reactor making it difficult to operate the vapor recovery reactor.","Other patents relating to carbothermic reduction to produce aluminum include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,486,229 and 4,491,472 (Troup et al. and Stevenson et al.) Dual reaction zones are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,099,959 (Dewing et al.), where off gases are passed through granular carbon material and countercurrent to fresh coal or \u201cgreen\u201d coke in a gas scrubber. In Dewing et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,261,736, the off-gas, containing Al vapor and AlO is contacted with particulate carbon in a fluidized bed maintained at a temperature above the temperature at which sticky aluminum oxycarbide forms and where heated carbon enriched with AlCis removed from the fluidized bed. When using carbon particles as taught in this patent the surface area of each carbon particle may eventually become covered by reaction products and the reaction rate will thus be reduced as the gas must penetrate the reaction product layer on each carbon particle in order to continue the reaction. Only a part of the carbon in the carbon particles will thus be reacted to AlC. Consequently, the efficiency of the reaction is low. Also Al and AlO vapors flow higher up the reactor forming slag or condensing, and unreacted carbon enters the main smelter, which is undesirable.","In Canadian Patent No. 1,15,435 (Sood et al.) a packed carbon bed consisting of \u201cactive\u201d carbon in whole or in part converts Al and AlO fume gas directly into AlC. There \u201cactive\u201d carbon is considered to be any form of carbon possessing a large specific surface area and consequently a relatively low strength, so that the resulting AlCreaction product does not adhere strongly to the carbon particles and\/or is very porous and open, so that the deposition of the reaction product does not result in cementing of the carbon particles to one another.","The variety of wood species that can be used to make charcoal is widely varied, as described in FAO FORESTRY PAPER 41 (1987) \u201cSimple Technologies for Charcoal Making\u201d http:\/\/www.fao.org\/docre\/x5328e\/x5328e00.htm, Aug. 19, 2002, and includes: Dakama, Wallaba, Kautaballi, Tropical hardwood, Oak, Coconut, and Eucalyptus Saligna. U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,028 (Nagle) also discuss activated carbons and charcoal and carbonized\/carbon-polymer wood products, mentioning use of Lignum, Maple, Oak, Basswood, Pine, Redwood, Balsa, and Poplar. The wood products are described as useful for furniture, brake shoes, sports equipment, tubing, brake rotors and the like.","In the carbothermic process, the type carbon used will be important to improve AlCformation and decrease AlOformation in the vapor recovery reactor. Reaction rates and thermodynamic considerations are important. What is needed is an efficient method for recovering the volatile Al species, and to reduce the 25% energy loss and the 25% aluminum lost leaving as a gas. Therefore, it is one of the main objects of this invention to provide a more cost and energy effective improved aluminum production process by use of new or vastly improved material in the off-gas reactor.","The above needs are met and the above problems solved by providing a method for recovering Al containing vapor species (Al and AlO) from an off-gas produced in at least one smelter during carbothermic reduction of alumina to form aluminum, where the off-gas comprises CO, Al (vapor) and AlO (vapor) that is aluminum suboxide, comprising: (a) directing the said off-gas to an enclosed reactor at an elevated temperature; (b) supplying-wood charcoal having a porosity of from about 50 vol. % to 85 vol. %, and a bulk density of from about 0.4 g\/cmto 0.7 g\/cm, to the enclosed reactor; and (c) contacting the wood charcoal with the off-gas to produce a product comprising AlC. Preferably, the wood charcoal has an average pore diameter of from about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 2.00 \u03bcm. The term \u201caluminum suboxide\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass AlO and compounds having aluminum to oxygen ratios other than 2:1. One wood charcoal that is particularly useful as the catalyst bed in the reactor is an eucalyptus wood charcoal. The term \u201celevated temperature\u201d means from about 1550\u00b0 C. to about 2050\u00b0 C.","The porosity should be at least about 50 vol. % to accommodate the volume change when carbon is converted to AlC. If the porosity is too low the AlCcrystals will fill or block the pores inhibiting the reacting gas from contacting the unreacted carbon. For example, when a low porosity carbon is used AlCforms on the outer surface of the carbon but not in the interior. The porosity should be relatively uniform with most of the average pore diameter between about 0.05 \u03bcm and about 2.00 \u03bcm. For example, metallurgical coke has a relatively high porosity, greater than 50 vol. %, but the pores can be as large as 200 \u03bcm or larger and others less than 0.1 \u03bcm. Therefore the porosity is primarily associated with a relatively small number of large pores. In this case the surfaces of these large pores react but the majority of the carbon does not react because the pores become blocked. On the other hand if the porosity is greater than about 85 vol. % the catalyst bed will lack sufficient strength to be used in a counter current reactor.","One type of wood charcoal stands above the variety of carbon products used in metallurgical processes including carbothermic vapor recovery in carbothermic reduction of alumina in terms of the porosity and uniform pore diameter to allow the AlCto form deep into the carbon particle rather than clogging the pores. In this form of carbon wood charcoal, the reactions continue because the Al containing vapors (Al and AlO) can diffuse through the pores and react to form aluminum carbide rather than forming a material which fills the pores causing the reaction to stop. The charcoal is preferably made from Eucalyptus wood, most preferably from the variety Brazilian Eucalyptus Camaldulensis. This material has a uniform pore size as seen in FIG. . This material has a porosity of between about 55% and 65% and has relatively uniform pore distribution\/diameter as indicated in area A of FIG. . It also has a low ash content of from about 2% to 4%.","The use of eucalyptus as described above increases the rate of AlCformation by over 100% as compared to other forms of carbon. It allows for the possible complete or near complete (at least 85%) conversion of carbon to carbide as compared to less than 30% for other forms of carbon. Furthermore if the Al and AlO vapors do not form carbide they will simply condense so that much of the energy is lost, or form a slag which will hinder the gas flow through the counter-current reactor, thereby impairing its performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"sub":["2","4","3","4","3 "]},"In , the off-gas from a carbothermic smelting furnace comprising a first stage  and possibly a second stage  is forwarded via conduits  and  to an enclosed off-gas reactor  operating at a temperature of about 2000\u00b0 C. This reactor  can be a counter-current moving bed reactor, which would operate at a top temperature of from about 1600\u00b0 C. to about 1800\u00b0 C. There could be more than one such reactor, for example, one for stage one smelter  and one for stage two smelter . The reactor , could also be a fluid bed or a series of fluid beds. The Al-components of the off-gas entering the reactor  react with the carbon  to form AlC. The AlCis removed from the reactor and forwarded to stage  of the carbothermic furnace through a conduit .","The gas from reactor  contains primarily CO, possibly some Hfrom the volatile part of the charcoal and little or no Al or AlO. The off gas from reactor  has a high energy value as hot CO and could be used to produce electrical energy in a gas turbine or conventional boiler. The aluminum vapor species will have reacted to carbide or condensed to AlOand C. The AlCand unreacted carbon is fed into the second stage of the carbothermic smelter via conduit . An Al\u2014C liquid alloy exits smelter stage  as shown in , where (s) means solid, (v) means vapor and (liq) means liquid.","In any carbothermic reduction process for aluminum extremely high temperatures (>2000\u00b0 C.) are required. At these temperatures a large quantity of Al and AlO gases species are associated with the CO off gas. Depending on the temperature and melt (AlO\u2014AlC) composition, the pressures of AlO\u2014Al can be 0.2 atm or higher. This could represent over 25% of the aluminum metal produced leaving the furnace as a gas. In order for the process to be economical the aluminum in the gas and the energy consumed in producing the Al vapor species must be captured in the process. The potential mass loss of Al is obvious, but equally important is that a large portion of the energy supplied to the process is consumed producing these vapor species. Depending on the operating conditions, the energy lost could be 25% or higher.","In order to investigate the rate of reaction of AlO and Al vapors with carbon it is necessary to produce these species and have knowledge of their pressures. One way to achieve this is to react AlOwith carbon to form aluminum carbide as is done in the actual carbothermic reduction process. As the AlOslag melt is heated in the presence of carbon the first step, or stage, the AlOis reduced to form AlCat about 2000\u00b0 C.\n\nAlO+6C=AlC+3CO \n\nDuring this process Al and AlO vapors are formed. If equilibrium is assumed the vapor pressure can be calculated from any relevant reaction. For example for AlO:\n\nAlO+2C=AlO ()+2CO \n\nAs the temperature is increased above about 2050\u00b0 C. to 2080\u00b0 C., Al metal is produced containing carbon in solution by the following reaction:\n\nAlC+AlO=6Al+3CO \n\nand Al and AlO gases are produced at higher partial pressures. The Al and AlO vapors then react with carbon in the vapor recovery unit forming AlC, a AlC\u2014AlOslag, or condense as C and AlO. Calculating the vapor pressures of AlO and Al produced as well as their subsequent reaction product with carbon requires knowledge of the free (D energies of formation and the activities of the relevant species. The Al and AlO react with carbon in the vapor recovery reactor by the following reactions:\n\n2AlO+5C=AlC+2CO \n\n4Al+3C=AlC\n","Various forms of carbon, however, have very different properties which were found to help or hinder the formation of AlC. It was found that, with carbon such as graphite, low porosity metallurgical coke, petroleum coke and high overall but not uniform porosity metallurgical coke, the AlCdoes not form to any great extent. Once the carbide begins to form it fills the pores on the surface, hindering further reaction if the porosity is less than about 50 vol. %. High porosity metallurgical coke, about 51 vol. % porous can consist of a very few very large pores and numerous smaller pores. Again, the reaction stops once these small pores are filled. So, in addition to high porosity, the pores must be uniform in size.","Very importantly, it was found that certain types of wood charcoal with over about 50 vol. % porosity reacted extensively forming AlCwhen exposed to CO\u2014Al\u2014AlO gas generated from reduction of AlOby carbon. The high porosity is essential since the rate of reaction is controlled by the diffusion of the reaction gas through the pores of the product layer AlC. If the pores are filled or nearly filled the reaction stops. There is a significant volume change going from carbon to the carbide pores existing in the original carbon as the pores become filled with carbide crystals, as confirmed by SEM analysis. To accommodate this increase in volume and maintain reasonable porosity in the carbide layer the porosity of the original carbon must be very high. In addition, the porosity must be uniform. One of the metallurgical cokes tested had a high porosity but did not react extensively. The coke had a few large pores but the majority of the coke was not very porous. The area associated with the large pores was small as compared to the wood charcoal.","It is also very important to note that another major requirement for the carbon used in carbothermic reduction is the amount of ash. The ash normally consists of SiO, iron oxides, other oxides and iron sulfide. These oxides and sulfides will be reduced in the process, and the silicon, iron, etc. will be in the final aluminum and will be difficult to remove. Again, selected wood charcoal best fulfills this requirement; it contains the lowest amount of ash of any of the carbons tested except graphite which does not react and is not a practical carbon source.","As shown in  selected, low ash, high porosity wood charcoal, preferably eucalyptus wood charcoal , shown in magnified idealized form, having a porous matrix with a large number of interconnected, relatively uniform pores , allows the off-gases to collect and form AlCcrystals , not only at the surface  of the wood charcoal particle but deep within the interior pore structure, as shown at points , up to an interface zone  shown by the dotted line.","It has been found that Eucalyptus wood charcoal, preferably Brazilian Eucalyptus Camaldulensis charcoal has the right properties for use in the off-gas reactor. Table 1 shows the properties of such Brazilian Eucalyptus charcoal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e2173","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Determinations - Moist Basis (as received)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"% Moisture:","10.5","% Fix.

To do so, temperatures in excess of 2000\u00b0 C. are required. A schematic diagram of the specially designed experimental equipment is shown in FIG. . The melts used to generate the vapors were heated in a graphite crucible  (17.5 cm ID) in a 65 kw induction furnace . The reactor , having an optical sight tube , was fitted with a tight lid  and a chimney  also with cap . About 5 kg to 7 kg of a (AlO-AlC) slag  was used as the melt to generate the vapors. The temperature of the melt and at the sample  location were measured with a tungsten-rhenium (5% W\u2014Re)-(26% W\u2014Re) thermocouple which is capable of measuring temperatures up to 2200\u00b0 C. A two color optical pyrometer was also used to measure the temperature. The two temperature measurement techniques agreed within 10\u00b0 C. The furnace was continuously flushed with argon to avoid excessive oxidation. The off gas composition, provided through off gas sample tube , was measured by an inline mass spectrometer. The primary species were CO, Ar and N; all of the Al containing species either reacted or condensed before entering the mass spectrometer.","Several different types of carbon were used including wood charcoal, coke, petroleum (\u201cpet\u201d) coke and graphite as the sample . Prior to reaction, the carbons used were examined in an SEM (scanning electron microscope). In addition, the bulk density, porosity and average pore size was measured. The carbon samples were in the form of cylinders, about 25 mm diameter by 25 mm high. The carbon sample was attached to a graphite rod  by drilling a hole through the carbon sample  through which the rod was placed and secured with a graphite nut .","The slag contained about 4 mass percent carbon. This slag was not saturated with AlCat 2000\u00b0 C. so that the AlOreacted with carbon producing AlC, CO, Al(g) and AlO(g). Once the desired temperature was achieved, and the vapors were being generated, the carbon samples were lowered into the chimney and reacted for a specified period of time and then withdrawn. The samples were rapidly transferred to a cooling chamber at room temperature which was continuously flushed with argon to avoid excessive oxidation of the reaction products or carbon. The samples were generally mounted and examined in an SEM and the phases analyzed. In a few cases the samples were analyzed chemically.","In a few experiments the carbon samples were initially held higher up in the chimney where the temperature was about 1930\u00b0 C. As discussed in the next section, at this temperature, a (AlO\u2014AlC) slag should form. In several experiments the sample was held at about 1930\u00b0 C. for 10 to 20 minutes and then withdrawn to confirm that the slag formed on the carbon sample. In three subsequent experiments after holding the sample at about 1930\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, it was lowered to where the temperature was 1950\u00b0 C. and the carbide should form. These experiments were conducted to determine if the slag formed would inhibit diffusion of the AlO and Al into the carbon and therefore impede the formation of the carbide.","In the present experiments, a (AlC\u2014AlO) slag is heated to about 2000-2020\u00b0 C. which is not saturated with carbide. Therefore a reduction reaction takes place. To avoid oxidation and to estimate the rate of CO generation flowing Ar was also used in the experiments. The presence of Ar affects the reactions, AlO and Al pressures and their subsequent reaction with carbon. The resulting gas as measured by the mass spectrometer was 50-55% CO and 45-50% Ar. At 2000\u00b0 C. with the Ar and CO at this ratio the vapor pressure of AlO and Al are 0.12 and 0.042 atmospheres respectively. If this CO\u2014Ar\u2014AlO\u2014Al gas mixture is then reacted with carbon, AlCwill form in a AlO\u2014AlCslag at 1930\u00b0 C. and pure carbide forms at 1950\u00b0 C. The equilibrium pressures of AlO and Al are 0.047 and 0.020 respectively with the carbide at 1950\u00b0 C. There are uncertainties in the thermodynamics with respect to equilibrium pressures and the temperatures at which phases form. The information given above are the best estimates available at this time.","The bulk density, porosity and average pore size of several types of carbons used in the experiments are listed below in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e2853","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Open","Total"]},{"entry":[{},"Bulk Density","Average Pore","Porosity","Porosity"]},{"entry":[{},"g\/cm(cu. cm)","Diameter, \u03bcm","%","%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Met.

As mentioned, with the denser carbons such as graphite, only condensation of AlOand C formed presumably by the following reactions:\n\nAlO()+2CO=AlO+2C \n\n2Al()+3CO=AlO+3C \n\nIt should be noted that even with the Eucalyptus wood charcoal if the samples were not preheated effectively only condensation of AlOand C on the surfaces occurred. With the Eucalyptus wood charcoal and a lesser degree with pet coke, AlCor a AlC\u2014AlOslag formed depending on the sample temperature. In general, if the sample temperature exceeded 1950\u00b0 C. little or no reaction occurred, between 1940\u00b0 C. to 1960\u00b0 C. AlCformed, at 1910\u00b0 C.-1930\u00b0 C. a slag formed while below 1910\u00b0 C. only condensation occurred. These results are in reasonable agreement with thermodynamic predictions.\n","SEM pictures of the carbide-carbon interface, of the carbide forming in the pores and of slag formation showed that the interface between the unreacted carbon and carbide phase was fairly distinct and easy to identify. There was a small region of partially reacted carbon. Carbide crystals begin to grow into the porosity of the carbon, and when there is primarily AlCthe porosity is greatly reduced. The liquid slag is dense and most likely slows any further reaction. Of importance is the rate and rate controlling mechanism for the formation of AlC. The SEM observation indicated that there was a shrinking unreacted core of carbon suggesting the rate is controlled by diffusion of Al(g) and AlO(g) through the AlCproduct layer.","Using graphite, metallurgical coke, petroleum coke and metallurgical coke (B), AlCdid not form to any great extent. Once the carbide begins to form it fills the pores on the surface and hinders further reaction if the porosity is low, less than about 50 vol. %. Metallurgical coke (B) did have a high porosity. However, it consisted of a very few large pores and numerous small pores. Again the reaction stops once these small pores are filled. So, in addition to high porosity the pores must be uniform in size as is the case for the Eucalyptus wood charcoal.","Several types of carbon which could be used in the process could not be made into single particles. Therefore, the carbon pieces were simply placed into a canister. The information obtained from these experiments was limited. The results did confirm that the charcoal reacted to give carbide and at lower temperatures slag or simple condensation of AlOoccurred. The pet and metallurgical coke did not react to form AlCand mostly only AlOcondensate formed.","The experimental results indicated what type of carbon should be used in the vapor recovery reactor used in carbothermic reduction. Wood charcoal, preferably Eucalyptus wood charcoal with over 60 vol. % porosity' reacted extensively forming AlCwhen exposed to CO\u2014Al\u2014AlOgas generated from reduction of AlO. The high porosity is essential since the rate of reaction is controlled by the diffusion of the reaction gas through the pores of the product layer (AlC). Since there is a significant volume change going from carbon to the carbide the pores existing in the original carbon became filled with carbide crystals. This was confirmed by SEM analysis. To accommodate this increase in volume and maintain reasonable porosity in the carbide layer the porosity of the original carbon must be very high, greater than 50 vol. % or 60 vol. %.","In addition, the porosity should be relatively uniform. One of the metallurgical cokes tested had a high porosity but did not react extensively. The coke had a few large pores but the majority of the coke was not very porous. The area associated with the large pores was small as compared to the wood charcoal.","Another requirement for the carbon used in carbothermic reduction is the amount of ash. The ash normally consists of SiO, iron oxides, other oxides and iron sulfide. These oxides and sulfides will be reduced in the process, producing iron that is difficult to remove from the product. Again, the wood charcoal best fulfills this requirement; it contains the lowest amount of ash of any of the carbons tested except graphite which does not react and is not a practical carbon source. The ash content should be about 6 wt % or less, preferably about 2 wt % to 4 wt %, based on the weight of fixed carbon in the wood charcoal.","Having described the presently preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention may be otherwise embodied within the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is further described with reference to the accompanying non-limiting drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":["4","3 ","4","3 ","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","110","120","130","100","110"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
