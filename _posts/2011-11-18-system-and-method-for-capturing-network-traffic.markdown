{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to capturing and examining network traffic.","Communications networks often carry various types of traffic from many different sources. For example, an Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, often carries both encrypted and unencrypted IP traffic. In some situations, it may be desirable to capture and examine traffic flowing through a network. For example, demands from law enforcement agencies, regulatory policies, court orders, and the like may require the capture and examination of a traffic flow from a particular person or entity.","In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated with capturing network traffic have been substantially reduced or eliminated.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method includes receiving, by a capture device, traffic flows transmitted by a plurality of client devices, each of the traffic flows being associated with one of the plurality of client devices and comprising encrypted data. The method further includes receiving, by the capture device, flow information communicated from a proxy server communicatively coupled to the capture device, the flow information comprising an identification of a particular traffic flow and a session key associated with the particular traffic flow. The method further includes storing, by the capture device, encrypted data of the particular traffic flow identified by the flow information supplied by the proxy server; storing, by the capture device, the session key associated with the particular traffic flow; and discarding, by the capture device, any of the plurality of received traffic flows not identified in the flow information received from the proxy server.","Certain embodiments of the disclosure may provide one or more advantages. An advantage of one embodiment may be that full encrypted or unencrypted traffic flows may be captured and securely stored by one or more capture devices. Another advantage of certain embodiments may be that a proxy server coupled to one or more capture devices instructs the one or more capture devices to capture certain traffic flows and discard others. Another advantage of certain embodiments may be that captured encrypted traffic flows may be unencrypted and exported to a network analyzer for analysis.","Certain embodiments of the disclosure may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.","This disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. However, this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure this disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","Communications networks often carry large volumes of different types of traffic from many different sources. For example, a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, often carries both encrypted and unencrypted IP traffic. As another example, an organization such as a government entity or a financial institution may employ a communications network that allows its employees to communicate in the normal course of business. In many situations, communications networks carry network traffic at high bitrates such as gigabit and beyond.","In some situations, it may be desirable to capture and examine the network traffic flowing through a network. For example, demands from law enforcement agencies, regulatory policies, court orders, and the like may require the capture and examination of a traffic flow from a particular person or entity. However, capturing entire traffic flows at or near wire speed, such as gigabit, and performing corresponding traffic decryption and analysis, is not possible with previous implementations due to the lack of the ability to negotiate session keys with the sources of traffic flows, and due to the storage demands and computing power needed to perform the decryption tasks.","The teachings of the disclosure recognize that it would be desirable to provide a system and method for capturing and storing both encrypted and unencrypted traffic flows of specific flow properties from a network at high bitrates.  below illustrate a system and method for capturing network traffic according to the teachings of the disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","120","130","110","115","120","110","130","110","130"]},"In general, client devices  attempt to communicate with server . In certain embodiments, for example, client devices  may be any type of computing or network devices that attempt to communicate with server  across the Internet using a secure communications session such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and the like. Proxy server  functions as a \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d device by terminating the communications session between client devices  and server  and then masquerading as server  to client devices  and as client devices  to server . To do this, proxy server  establishes communications sessions with client devices  and consequently receives a session key  from each client device .","Client devices  transmit traffic flows  that are ultimately received by at least one capture device . Traffic flows  may include any type of data such as encrypted or unencrypted data, and each traffic flow  may be associated with a particular client device . Proxy server  selects a particular traffic flow  that is associated with a particular client device  to store on one or more capture devices . Proxy server  then communicates flow information  to at least one capture device  across a secure communications channel. In some embodiments, flow information  includes session key  received from the particular client device  and an identification of the selected traffic flow  from the particular client device .

In particular embodiments, proxy server  provides functionality described or illustrated herein. In particular embodiments, software running on proxy server  performs one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein or provides functionality described or illustrated herein.","Proxy server  may be in any suitable physical form. As example and not by way of limitation, proxy server  may be a virtual machine (VM), an embedded computer system, a system-on-chip (SOC), a single-board computer system (SBC) (e.g., a computer-on-module (COM) or system-on-module (SOM)), a desktop computer system, a laptop or notebook computer system, an interactive kiosk, a mainframe, a mesh of computer systems, a server, an application server, or a combination of two or more of these. Where appropriate, proxy server  may include one or more computing systems; be unitary or distributed; span multiple locations; span multiple machines; or reside in a cloud, which may include one or more cloud components in one or more networks. Where appropriate, proxy server  may perform without substantial spatial or temporal limitation one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.

Proxy server  may perform at different times or at different locations one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein, where appropriate. In some embodiments, proxy server  may execute any suitable operating system such as IBM's zSeries\/Operating System (z\/OS), MS-DOS, PC-DOS, MAC-OS, WINDOWS, UNIX, OpenVMS, an operating system based on LINUX, or any other appropriate operating system, including future operating systems.","In certain embodiments, client device  may refer to any device that is capable of transmitting a traffic flow . In some embodiments, client device  may include a computer, workstation, telephone, Internet browser, electronic notebook, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), pager, or any other suitable device (wireless, wireline, or otherwise), component, or element capable of receiving, processing, storing, and\/or communicating information with other components of system . Client device  may also include any suitable user interface, display, microphone, keyboard, or any other appropriate terminal equipment usable by a user. It will be understood that system  may include any number and combination of client devices .","In certain embodiments, capture device  is any device that is capable of receiving and storing data (i.e., traffic flows ) from client devices . In certain embodiments, each capture device  receives and is capable of storing entire traffic flows (i.e., traffic flows A and B) from a span port of a network switch such as switch A. For example, each capture device  may receive and log an entire traffic flow  from the beginning of the flow (i.e., TCP connection negotiation) to the end of the flow (i.e., the end of TCP connection tear down). In certain embodiments, capture devices are configured to log traffic flows  at gigabit data rates and higher.","In certain embodiments, capture device  includes a storage device . As an example and not by way of limitation, storage device  may include a hard disk drive (HDD), a floppy disk drive, flash memory, an optical disc, a magneto-optical disc, magnetic tape, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive, a combination of two or more of these, and the like. In certain embodiments, storage device  may include any suitable database such as MySQL, commercially available databases from Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and the like, an Apache Solr database, a Java Content Repository (JCR), or any other appropriate database or repository. Storage device  may include removable or non-removable (or fixed) media, where appropriate. Storage device  may be internal or external to capture device , where appropriate. In particular embodiments, storage device  is non-volatile, solid-state memory. In particular embodiments, storage device  includes ROM. Where appropriate, this ROM may be mask-programmed ROM, programmable ROM (PROM), erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), electrically alterable ROM (EAROM), or flash memory or a combination of two or more of these. This disclosure contemplates storage device  taking any suitable physical form. In addition, storage device  may include one or more storage control units facilitating communication between capture device  and storage device , where appropriate. Where appropriate, storage device  may include one or storage device . Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular storage, this disclosure contemplates any suitable storage.","In certain embodiments, network  may refer to any interconnecting system capable of transmitting audio, video, signals, data, messages, or any combination of the preceding. Network  may include all or a portion of a public switched telephone network, a public or private data network, a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a local, regional, or global communication or computer network such as the Internet, a wireline or wireless network, an enterprise intranet, or any other suitable communication link, including combinations thereof.","In certain embodiments, switch  is any network device that receives and transmits traffic flows  in a network. In certain embodiments, switch  is a multi-port network device that processes and routes traffic flows . In some embodiments, switch  may be a router or any other suitable network routing device. In certain embodiments, switch  includes a span port that is capable of transmitting a copy of traffic flows  observed on one or all switch ports of switch .","In certain embodiments, traffic flow  is any data that is communicated from client device . In certain embodiments, traffic flow is any packetized data such as IP data packets. Traffic flow  may be encrypted data, unencrypted data, or a mixture of both encrypted and unencrypted data. In certain embodiments, traffic flow  may refer to IPSec encrypted traffic, SSL encrypted traffic, or any other suitable encrypted traffic.","Session key  may refer to any appropriate security key that is communicated from client device  to proxy server  for the purpose of encrypting messages in a communication session between client device  and proxy server . In certain embodiments, session key  may be utilized to decrypt traffic flow  after it is received from client device . In certain embodiments, session key  may be generated according to SSL, TLS, or any other appropriate cryptography standard.","Flow information  is any appropriate data communicated from proxy server  to capture device  in order to instruct capture device  regarding which traffic flows  to capture and store. In certain embodiments, flow information  includes one or more of the following: a session key  received from a particular client device, an identification of a selected traffic flow , a security certificate (i.e., an X.509 certificate) associated with a particular client device  and\/or server , a security certificate of proxy server  such as a certificate generated by proxy server  during the handshake with client device  for the purpose of intercepting the connection between client device  and server , and\/or a lifetime of the session key . In certain embodiments, the identification of the selected traffic flow  may include an IP address of a particular client device , a port of switch  associated with a particular client device  or server , an IP address of server , a particular user associated with the selected traffic flow , a group that the particular user belongs to, an application being used by the particular user, operations being performed by the particular user, or any other information associated with traffic flow .","In certain embodiments, flow information  is communicated to capture device  across a secure communications channel. For example, a secure communications channel may be established between proxy server  and capture device  after proxy server  and capture device  have been authenticated to each other. For example, a security certificate associated with capture device  may be installed on proxy server  that enables capture device  to authenticate itself to proxy server . Likewise, a security certificate associated with proxy server  may be installed on capture device  that enables proxy server  to authenticate itself to capture device . In certain embodiments, capture device  may be additionally required to successfully register with proxy server  before flow information  may be communicated to capture device . In some embodiments, the identities of capture device  and proxy server  may be verified by a third party device (i.e., a server storing a database of past sales of capture devices  and proxy servers ) before flow information  is communicated from proxy server  to capture device .","In operation of an example embodiment, client devices A and B attempt to communicate with server  across network . For example, client devices A and B may attempt to communicate with server  across the Internet using a secure communications session such as SSL, IPSec, and the like. Proxy server  masquerades as server  to client devices  and as client devices  to server  by intercepting the attempted communications sessions and establishing new communications sessions with client devices A and B. If secure communications sessions are established with client devices A and B, proxy server  receives a session key A from client device A and a session key B from client device B. As previously discussed, session keys A and B may be used to decrypt any encrypted data communicated from client devices A and B, respectively (i.e., traffic flows A and B). In general, encrypted traffic flows require specific session keys for the decryption of the traffic flows during or after the traffic exchanges have occurred.","Client device A transmits traffic flow A through network  where it is received by switch A and ultimately proxy server . Likewise, client device B transmits traffic flow B through network  where it is received by switch A and ultimately proxy server . In addition, because capture devices A and B are both communicatively coupled to a span port of switch A via switch B, both capture devices A and B each receive both traffic flows A and B from client devices A and B.","At any appropriate time, proxy server  selects a particular traffic flow  to store on a particular capture device . For example, proxy server  may select to store traffic flow A on either or both of capture devices A or B. As another example, proxy server  may select to store traffic flow B on either or both of capture devices A or B. To select which traffic flow  to capture and store on capture devices , proxy server may access one or more policies  stored on proxy server . For example, an administrator may interact with proxy server  and create a policy  that indicates to capture all traffic flows  from a particular IP address, entity, or switch port. As another example, a policy  may be created that instructs how to process particular traffic flows  (i.e., discard or save all traffic flows  from a particular IP range), or how to log particular traffic flows  (i.e., log a particular traffic flow for a certain amount of time and\/or for a specific time of day). Proxy server  may access policies  and analyze any received traffic flows  against policies  in order to determine one or more traffic flows  to capture and store on one or more capture devices .","After selecting a particular traffic flow , proxy server  communicates flow information  to at least one capture device . For example, if proxy server  accesses policies  and determines that all traffic flows A from client device A should be logged, proxy server  communicates flow information A to capture device A and\/or flow information B to capture device B in order to instruct one or both of these devices to capture and store traffic flow A. As another example, if proxy server  accesses policies  and determines that all traffic flows B from client device B should be logged, proxy server  communicates flow information A to capture device A and\/or flow information B to capture device B in order to instruct one or both of these devices to capture and store traffic flow B. As described above, flow information  may in some embodiments include session key  and\/or an identification of the selected traffic flow .","In certain embodiments, flow information , which may include a session key  for decrypting any encrypted traffic flows , is communicated from proxy server  to capture devices  via a secure communications channel. As described above, a secure communications channel may be established between proxy server  and capture device  after proxy server  and capture devices  have been mutually authenticated to each other. In some embodiments, proxy server  and\/or capture devices  may be additionally verified against a database of known devices in order to verify their identity. By communicating flow information  (and in turn session key ) between proxy server  and capture devices  across a secure communications channel, the security of any encrypted traffic flows  being stored by capture devices  remains intact.","Capture devices  store selected traffic flows  based on flow information  received from proxy server  across secure communications channels. For example, if flow information A indicates to capture traffic flow A, capture device A will capture and store traffic flow A in storage device A. As another example, if flow information B indicates to capture traffic flow B, capture device B will capture and store traffic flow B in storage device B. In certain embodiments, capture devices  discard any traffic flows  that were not identified in flow information . In the examples provided here, capture device A discards traffic flow B because flow information A only indicated to capture and store traffic flow A. Likewise, capture device B discards traffic flow A because flow information B only indicated to capture and store traffic flow B. Herein \u201cdiscard\u201d may refer to erasing any stored traffic flows  that were not identified in flow information , marking any stored traffic flows  that were not identified in flow information  as being eligible for being over-written, ignoring any incoming traffic flows  that were not identified in flow information , and the like.","For increased security, capture devices  may store session keys  separate from the data of the selected traffic flow . For example, capture device  may store traffic flow  in storage device  in the same format as it is when it is taken off the wire (i.e., encrypted). Then, capture device  may utilize an encrypted traffic flow tracking database (ETFTD)  to store information such as session key  received from proxy server . In certain embodiments, ETFTD  may be stored in a separate storage device , in a separate database, or any other location that is separate from where traffic flow  is stored. In some embodiments, ETFTD  may be encrypted and may store one or more attributes such as a time stamp, a user ID (i.e., a user name, IP addresses or port number), flow information , session key , a security certificate associated with client device  and\/or server , and\/or a storage location on disk that indicates where on storage device  that traffic flow  is stored in its original format. In other embodiments, ETFTD  may include any other appropriate attributes associated with traffic flows .","In certain embodiments, ETFTD  may be a searchable database, and capture device  may provide a user and\/or an administrator the ability to query its ETFTD  for specific traffic flows  using any available attributes of ETFTD . For example, a user may interact with capture device A to query ETFTD A for traffic flows  from a specific IP address. As another example, a user may interact with capture device A to query ETFTD A for traffic flows  from a specific time of day. In certain embodiments, capture device  may export either decrypted or unencrypted traffic flows  to a network analyzer for further analysis. For example, capture device  may access a traffic flow  stored in storage device , access an associated session key  stored in ETFTD , decrypt the accessed traffic flow  using the associated session key , and then export the decrypted traffic flow  to a network analysis tool such as Wireshark for further analysis.","In certain embodiments, proxy server  may perform load balancing and\/or fault tolerance of traffic capturing using two or more capture devices . For example, proxy server  may perform load balancing by instructing each capture device  to capture and store a different traffic flow . In the illustrated embodiment of , for example, proxy server  may perform load balancing by instructing capture device A to capture and store traffic flow A, while capture device B is instructed to capture and store traffic flow B. To perform fault tolerance of traffic capture (e.g., a backup), proxy server  may instruct two or more (or all) capture devices  to all capture the same traffic flows . In the illustrated embodiment of , for example, proxy server  may perform fault tolerance by instructing both capture devices A and B to capture and store both traffic flows A and B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["300","300"]},"At step , a communications session is established between each of a plurality of client devices and a proxy server.
