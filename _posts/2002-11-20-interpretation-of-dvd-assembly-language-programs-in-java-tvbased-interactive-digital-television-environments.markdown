title: Interpretation of DVD assembly language programs in Java TV-based interactive digital television environments
abstract: Techniques for interpretation of DVD assembly language programs for television (TV) receivers operating in Java TV environments are provided. The techniques can be used to implement a Java-based command/control enabling system. The Java-based command/control enabling system can be implemented as a Java-based DVD assembly language interpreter which interacts with various modules including video, audio, graphics overlay, and remote control modules. As such, the Java-based command/control enabling systems can provide similar command/control functions as those provided by DVD systems.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to Java computing environments and, more particularly, to techniques for providing command control capabilities for receivers operating in Java TV environments.","Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals using digital rather than conventional analog methods. Analog transmission is in the form of a variable wave. Digital transmission consists of an electrical pulse which has two possibilities: on and off (or positive and negative), which are represented by a one and a zero (this is binary data, the same type of information that a computer understands). Because a digital signal does not fluctuate, but is either perfectly intact or totally absent, a digital transmission is more precise than an analog transmission. Although both signals are transmitted in the same basic way and have the same range, they behave differently at the limits of their ranges. An analog signal degrades over distance and may be barely detectable at the further reaches of the broadcast area\u2014this is why the signal from a distant radio station fades in and out. As the signal reaches the farthest limits of its range, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases and the quality of the broadcast suffers, although the range remains the same. In comparison, when the SNR decreases in a digital signal, the quality of the broadcast does not degrade, but the range shrinks (this is called the cliff effect). Accordingly, the advantages of DTV over analog TV include: superior image resolution (detail) for a given bandwidth, smaller bandwidth for a given image resolution, compatibility with computers and the Internet, interactivity, superior audio quality, consistency of reception over varying distances, and capacity for multicasting.","Conventional standards, NTSC, PAL, and SECAM, specify analog transmission. However, both the audio and video components of a television signal can be transmitted in digital form. Because much more data can be sent digitally, a digital transmission will allow, depending on the display format chosen, either a dramatically improved resolution and sound quality in the case of high definition television (HDTV), or simultaneous broadcasts (multicasting) of up to five programs in the case of standard definition television (SDTV). Another SDTV option, known as datacasting, is the transmission of data such as games, still pictures, and other material while the viewer is watching a program. Datacasting might allow, for example, someone watching a baseball game to choose a different camera angle or to select a display of player or team statistics.","The attraction of DTV is not only the clearer picture and higher quality sound, but the ability to interact with the television program that is being broadcast. Interaction could include a viewer playing a game while watching an educational program, downloading a recipe from a favorite cooking show, or choosing a program to watch from an electronic program guide (EPG). An EPG is an onscreen television guide that displays channel and program information at no extra cost to the viewer. In DTV, the EPG is sent as a separate data packet in the MPEG-2 transport stream.","There are two types of EPGs: text-based and multimedia. A text-based EPG is similar to a printed television guide. A multimedia EPG allows the viewer to choose and record a program once, daily or weekly at the touch of a button on the remote, sort through movies by theme, review top national and world news stories, and access comprehensive coverage of news, weather, sports, and entertainment stories. A typical multimedia EPG includes channel grids that contain present and future television programs along with a video window that displays a current broadcast from a selected channel and a brief description of the program.","Another recent development is the production of Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) for general use. DVD is an optical disc technology that is expected to rapidly replace the disc (as well as the audio compact disc). The DVD holds 4.7 gigabytes of information on one of its two sides, or enough for a 133-minute movie. With two layers on each of its two sides, it will hold up to 17 gigabytes of video, audio, or other information. (Compare this to the current CD-ROM disc of the same physical size, holding 600 megabytes). The DVD can hold more than 28 times as much information.","DVD-Video is the usual name for the DVD format designed for full-length movies and is a box that will work with your television set. DVD-ROM is the name of the player that will (sooner or later) replace your computer's CD-ROM. It will play regular CD-ROM discs as well as DVD-ROM discs. DVD-RAM is the writable version of DVD-ROM. DVD-Audio is a player designed to replace the compact disc player. DVD uses the MPEG-2 file and compression standard. MPEG-2 images have four times the resolution of MPEG-1 images and can be delivered at 60 interlaced fields per second where two fields constitute one image frame (MPEG-1 can deliver 30 noninterlaced frames per second). Audio quality on DVD is comparable to that of current audio compact discs.","DVD-Video Discs usually contain an application that presents menus to the viewer, and allows him to control aspects of the video presentation. For example, the applications allow the viewer to jump to a specific scene, control subtitling, select camera angles, select audio tracks, etc. These applications also display graphic images on the screen, and allow highlighting of choices and navigation using the remote control. DVD control applications are written in DVD Assembly Language.","The conventional Java-based interactive Digital TV environment can provide the user with the same command control capabilities as provided in the DVD environment. However, the conventional Java-based interactive Digital TV environment does not recognize DVD assembly language. As a result, conventional environments suffer many drawbacks. By way of example, users of Video on Demand (VOD) do not have the capability to pause, rewind, fast forward, etc. It should be noted that the consumers accessing Video on Demand movie sites usually are doing so over high-speed or broadband connections, such as through cable modem services, or Digital Subscriber Loops (DSL), which are becoming more popular.","Accordingly, an improved digital TV environment is needed.","Broadly speaking, the present invention relates to techniques for providing interpretation of DVD assembly language programs for television (TV) receivers operating in a digital TV environment. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a Java TV environment including a Java-based command\/control enabling system is shown. The Java-based command\/control enabling system can be implemented as a Java-based DVD assembly language interpreter which interacts with various modules including video, audio, graphics overlay, and remote control modules. As such, the Java-based command\/control enabling systems can provide similar command\/control functions to those provided by DVD systems.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a method, an apparatus, a computer readable medium. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.","One embodiment of the invention can be implemented as a Java-based command\/control enabling system operating in a Java TV environment. The Java-based command\/control enabling system is capable of interacting with a Java TV Application Programming Interface (API). Furthermore, the Java-based command\/control enabling system is capable of operating to: read a DVD assembly language instruction corresponding to a command for performing an operation associated with a television receiver operating in the Java TV environment; decode the DVD assembly language instruction in order to determine a DVD assembly language op-code; and execute the DVD assembly language op-code.","As a method of providing remote control capabilities in a Java TV environment, one embodiment of the invention includes the acts of: providing a Java TV Application Programming Interface; receiving a remote control key code corresponding to a command for performing an operation associated with a television receiver operating in the Java TV environment; translating the remote control key code to a DVD assembly language key code; and storing the DVD assembly language key code in memory where it can be accessed by a DVD assembly language program.","As a computer readable medium including computer program code for a Java-based command\/control enabling system capable of interacting with a Java TV Application Programming Interface, one embodiment of the invention includes: computer program code for reading a DVD assembly language instruction corresponding to a command for performing an operation associated with a television receiver operating in a Java TV environment; computer program code for decoding the DVD assembly language instruction in order to determine a DVD assembly language op-code; and computer program code for executing said DVD assembly language op-code.","These and other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent when the detailed description below is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","As noted in the background, digital television and DVD are becoming more popular. DVD users can select various options, including special features, by interacting with a menu. Typically, a remote control device can be used to enter commands. This can be done by pressing one or more input keys of the remote control device. In this way, the DVD users can control presentation of video, audio, text, special features, etc. These capabilities are provided using DVD assembly language programs. Conventional digital television (TV) environments provide similar capabilities, but do not allow execution of DVD assembly language programs.","Accordingly, the invention pertains to for providing interpretation of DVD assembly language programs for television (TV) receivers operating in a digital TV environment. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a Java TV environment including a Java-based command\/control enabling system is shown. The Java-based command\/control enabling system can be implemented as a Java-based DVD assembly language interpreter which interacts with various modules including video, audio, graphics overlay, and remote control modules. As such, the Java-based command\/control enabling systems can provide similar command\/control functions to those provided by DVD systems.","Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference to . However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes only as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","102","104","106","104","106","104"]},"As shown in , the Java TV environment  includes a television receiver . Typically, the television receiver  is a digital receiver. However, it should be noted that the television receiver  may be able to process analog and\/or digital signals. The signals, for example, can be broadcast to receivers over terrestrial cable or satellite networks. By way of example, these signals can be used to provide users with Video on Demand (VOD). It should be noted that the consumers accessing Video on Demand movie sites usually are doing so over high-speed or broadband connections, such as through cable modem services or Digital Subscriber Loops (DSL), which are becoming more popular.","It should also be noted that the Java TV environment  includes a Real Time Operating System (RTOS)  which supports device drivers  for the television receiver . However, the Java-based command\/control enabling system  can be implemented as an application using the Java TV Application Programming Interface (API) . This provides a layer of abstraction. As such, the command\/control enabling system  can be implemented irrespective of the operating system and\/or hardware details.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","201","200","202","204","206","208","202","202","201","201","202"]},"As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the video control module  and an audio control module  can be implemented to respectively control video and audio functions. These functions can be implemented similarly to functions provided by DVD units (i.e., similar to the functionality provided by DVD assembly language for controlling audio and video). Similarly, the graphics overlay module can be implemented to provide graphics overlay functions (e.g., highlighting the screen). It should be noted that each of the remote control input module , video control module , graphics overlay module , and audio control module  can include one or more subcomponents. For example, audio control module  includes a subtitle control component  and an audio track component .","It should be noted that the remote control input module  and graphics overlay module  can be implemented using a Java-based Abstract Windowing Tools (AWT) interface. Furthermore, in environments that support the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) or Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) standard, appropriate standard interfaces can be used. For example, for the subtitle control module, DAVIC standard can be used. Alternatively, a Networking API can be used to interact with the server (e.g., a Video on Demand server).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","200","302","302","300","302","300","303","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","400","201","402","402","400","404","400","404","402","400","406","406","400","408","400","408","406","400","410","410","410","412","400","412"]},"However, if it is determined at operation  that a highlight screen op-code has been not received, the method  proceeds to operation  where it is determined whether a subtitle control op-code has been received. If it is determined at operation  that a subtitle control op-code has been received, the method  proceeds to operation  where subtitle is controlled. In an embodiment of this invention which is implemented in an environment where the DAVIC subtitle control API is available, such as an environment based on the MHP standard, the DAVIC subtitle control is used to control subtitling. In another embodiment that is running in an environment where the DAVIC subtitle control API is not available, subtitles are controlled through another means. For example, a networking API could be used to send a control message to the server providing the video stream in a VOD service, requesting that the subtitles be changed as indicated by the user. In any case, the method  ends following either operation .","On the other hand, if it is determined at operation  that a subtitle control op-code has not been received, the method  proceeds to operation  where it is determined whether an audio track control op-code has been received. If it is determined at operation  that an audio track control op-code has not been received, the method  ends. However, if it is determined at operation  that an audio track control op-code has been received, the method  proceeds to operation  where Java Media Framework (JMF) control is used to process the audio track control op-code. The method  ends following operation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","500","402","502","504"]},"Accordingly, if it is determined at operation  that a call back has been received, the method  proceeds to operation  where a AWT key code is mapped to an appropriate DVD assembly language key code. Next, at operation , a key-press lock is acquired. Thereafter, at operation , the DVD assembly key code is written to a key-press register. After the DVD assembly key code is written, a key-press flag is set at operation  to indicate that the key-press register has been set. Finally, at operation , the key-press lock is released.
