title: Method for file transfer restarts using standard internet protocol
abstract: A method of downloading a file from a Internet server to an Internet client, preferably without action by the Internet client. The method begins by associating the file into a set of components at the server. A profile of the file is then generated. This profile includes identifying information for the file as well as for each component thereof. Such information preferably includes an identifier, a size value, and a code uniquely identifying the component. The file is transferred by initiating a download sequence by which each component is transferred, one-by-one, from the server to the client using an Internet protocol. When the download sequence is complete, the individual components are reassembled into the file using the profile without action by the Internet client. If the transmission is interrupted for any reason, the download sequence is restarted with the component affected by the interruption. This avoids the need to retransfer the entire file.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to computer networks and more particularly to the efficient transfer of relatively large computer files over the Internet using standard Internet protocols.","The Internet offers a suite well-known services including one-to-one messaging (e-mail), one-to-many messaging (bulletin board), on-line chat, file transfer and browsing. Various known Internet protocols are used for these services. Thus, for example, browsing is effected using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which provides users access to multimedia files using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The collection of servers that use HTTP comprise the World Wide Web, which is the Internet's multimedia information retrieval system. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a mechanism for transferring files from a server to a client. Typically, the client includes an FTP interface and appropriate software to control transfer and decompression of the received file.","There has been great interest in providing Internet access at minimal economic cost. While most computers now are pre-configured for Internet access, a significant percentage of households still do not have a personal computer. Thus, it has now been proposed to provide a data processing system that, much like a VCR, may be connected to a television set and used in lieu of a personal computer to provide Web access through a conventional remote control device associated with the system unit. Such a system enables the television to become, in effect, a \u201cWeb\u201d appliance. The viewer can rapidly switch between conventional television and Internet access using the remote control unit. All of the conventional \u201cInternet\u201d access tools and navigational functions are preferably \u201cbuilt-in\u201d to the system and thus hidden to the user.","It would also be desirable to update software running on the Web appliance without interaction or even the knowledge of the user. This goal, however, cannot be achieved reliably and cheaply because FTP and other Internet protocols do not allow file transfer restarts. A file transfer \u201crestart\u201d means that the transfer is re-initiated at a point of interruption. Thus, in the event that a conventional FTP file transmission were interrupted, e.g., due to a power outage or other such event, it is necessary to retransfer the entire file. This is highly impractical with very large files across a typical 28.8 Kbs modem, especially without user interaction.","The present invention addresses and solves this problem.","It is thus a primary goal of the present invention to provide a file transfer mechanism that uses conventional FTP but that allows for file transfer restarts.","It is a further object of the invention to update software running on a Web appliance transparently to the user by downloading a file from an Internet server to the appliance.","It is yet another object of the invention to provide a checkpointable method for downloading files across the Internet.","It is still another object of the invention to implement a file transfer download over the Internet by repeatedly transferring a discrete piece of a file as an atomic operation and then reassembling the discrete pieces at the client, preferably without direct user intervention.","It is still another object of the invention to provide a method of downloading a file over the Internet without a proprietary protocol but which still allows for file transfer restarts in the event of transmission interruption.","It is a more general object of the invention to enhance the ease with which software is downloaded over the Internet.","These and other objects of the invention are provided in a method of downloading a file from a Internet server to an Internet client, preferably without interaction by a user of the Internet client. The method begins by breaking the file into a set of components. Then, a profile is generated for the file that includes identifying information for the file and for each component thereof. The identifying information may include an identifier, a size value, and a code uniquely identifying the file and\/or component thereof. To transfer the file, a download sequence is initiated by which each component is transferred, one-by-one, from the server to the client. Preferably, the transfer of each component is achieved using conventional Internet FTP. When the download sequence is complete, the components are reassembled. If the download sequence were interrupted for any reason, it is restarted at the point of interruption, as opposed to requiring retransmission of previously-delivered components. Preferably, the components of the file are transferred in a sequential order as determined by the profile.","Preferably, the file profile is transmitted from the server to the client prior to initiation and, if necessary, any restart(s) of the download sequence. The profile is then used to verify whether components received at the client are \u201ccomplete.\u201d Thus, for example, upon receipt at the client of a component, the identifying information is used to verify whether a complete version of the component has been transferred from the server. Typically, this is accomplished by comparing the size of the component with the expected size (as determined by the size value in the profile) and by calculating the code and comparing it to the code in the profile. If the complete version of the component has not been transferred (as determined by one or both of these tests), the profile is resent and the download sequence is restarted, beginning with the component whose transmission was incomplete. When the server completes the download, the client-resident code verifies whether a complete version of the file has been transferred using the identifying information for the file. If the complete version of the file has been transferred, the components thereof are then reassembled into the file.","In the preferred embodiment, the Internet client is a Web appliance and the file is a updated version of a program (e.g., a browser) running on the Web appliance.","The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent objects and features of the present invention. These objects should be construed to be merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of the invention. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed invention in a different manner or modifying the invention as will be described. Accordingly, other objects and a fuller understanding of the invention may be had by referring to the following Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment.","A representative system in which the present invention is implemented is illustrated in . An Internet client machine  is connected to a server platform  via a communication channel . For illustrative purposes, channel  is the Internet, an Intranet or other known connection. In the case of the Internet, server platform  is one of a plurality of servers which are accessible by clients, one of which is illustrated by machine . A client machine typically includes a suite of known Internet tools  access the servers of the network and thus obtain certain services. These services include one-to-one messaging (e-mail), one-to-many messaging (bulletin board), on-line chat, file transfer and browsing. Various known Internet protocols are used for these services. Thus, for example, browsing is effected using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which provides users access to multimedia files using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The collection of servers that use HTTP comprise the World Wide Web, which is the Internet's multimedia information retrieval system. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a mechanism for transferring files from a server to a client. Typically, the client includes an FTP interface and associated code to facilitate the transfer and, if needed, decompression of the received file. Appropriate code is also resident on the server side of a particular connection (at a so-called \u201cFTP site\u201d).","By way of example only, a client machine is a personal computer such as a desktop of notebook computer, e.g., an IBM\u00ae or IBM-compatible machine running under the OS\/2\u00ae operating system, an IBM ThinkPad\u00ae machine, or some other Intel x86 or Pentium\u00ae-based computer running Windows 3.1 or greater operating system. A representative server platform  comprises an IBM RISC System\/6000 computer  (a reduced instruction set of so-called RISC-based workstation) running the AIX (Advanced Interactive Executive Version 4.1 and above) Operating System  and a server program . For the purposes of the present invention, the server program  supports FTP in a known manner, using FTP mechanism  and thus the server platform is an FTP site. FTP is a TCP\/IP protocol for file transfers. Information about the FTP protocol may be obtained from Request For Comment (RFC) 765 (October 1985), which is incorporated herein by reference. The platform  also includes a graphical user interface (GUI)  for management and administration. It may also include an application programming interface (API). The various models of the RISC-based computers are described in many publications of the IBM Corporation, for example, 6000, 7013 7016 , Order No. SA23-2644-00. AIX OS is described in , published by IBM Corporation, First Edition (November 1985), and other publications. While the above platform is useful, any other suitable hardware\/operating system\/server combinations may be used.","Alternatively, the Internet client may be a data processing system or a so-called \u201cWeb appliance\u201d such as illustrated in  and .  is a pictorial representation of the data processing system as a whole. Data processing system  in the depicted example provides, with minimal economic costs for hardware to the user, access to the Internet. Data processing system  includes a data processing unit . Data processing unit  is preferably sized to fit in typical entertainment centers and provides all required functionality, which is conventionally found in personal computers, to enable a user to \u201cbrowse\u201d the Internet. Additionally, data processing unit  may provide other common functions such as serving as an answering machine or receiving facsimile transmissions.","Data processing unit  is connected to television  for display of graphical information. Television  may be any suitable television, although color televisions with an S-Video input will provide better presentations of the graphical information. Data processing unit  may be connected to television  through a standard coaxial cable connection. A remote control unit  allows a user to interact with and control data processing unit . Remote control unit  allows a user to interact with and control data processing unit . Remote control unit  emits infrared (IR) signals, preferably modulated at a different frequency than the normal television, stereo, and VCR infrared remote control frequencies in order to avoid interference. Remote control unit  provides the functionality of a pointing device (such as a mouse, glidepoint, trackball or the like) in conventional personal computers, including the ability to move a cursor on a display and select items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["102","108","106","102","102","104","110","102","104","112","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["102","114","116","118","120","122","124","126","128","102","130","132","134","102"]},"Video connection , a standard coaxial cable connector, connects to the video-in terminal of television  or a video cassette recorder (not shown). Left and right audio jacks  connect to the corresponding audio-in connectors on television  or to a stereo (not shown). If the user has S-Video input, then S-Video connection  may be used to connect to television  to provide a better picture than the composite signal. If television  has no video inputs, an external channel \/ modulator (not shown) may be connected in-line with the antenna connection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["106","106","142","144","146","146","102"]},"A pointing device , which is preferably a trackpoint or \u201cbutton\u201d pointing device, is included on remote control unit  and allows a user to manipulate a cursor on the display of television . \u201cGo\u201d and \u201cBack\u201d buttons  and , respectively, allow a user to select an option or return to a previous selection. \u201cHelp\u201d button  causes context-sensitive help to be displayed or otherwise provided. \u201cMenu\u201d button  causes a context-sensitive menu of options to be displayed, and \u201cUpdate\u201d button  will update the options displayed based on the user's input, while home button  allows the user to return to a default display of options. \u201cPgUp\u201d and \u201cPgDn\u201d buttons  and  allows the user to change the context of the display in display-sized blocks rather than by scrolling. The message button  allows the user to retrieve messages.","In addition to, or in lieu of, remote control unit , an infrared keyboard (not shown) with an integral pointing device may be used to control data processing unit . The integral pointing device is preferably a trackpoint or button type of pointing device. A wired keyboard (also not shown) may also be used through keyboard connection , and a wired pointing device such as a mouse or trackball may be used through mouse port . When a user has one or more of the remote control unit , infrared keyboard, wired keyboard and\/or wired pointing device operable, the active device locks out all others until a prescribed period of inactivity has passed.","Referring now to , a block diagram for the major components of data processing unit  is portrayed. As with conventional personal computers, data processing unit  includes a motherboard  containing a processor  and memory  connected to system bus . Processor  is preferably at least a 486 class processor operating at or above 100 MHz. Memory  may include cache memory and\/or video RAM. Processor , memory , and system bus  operate in the same manner as corresponding components in a conventional data processing system.","Video\/TV converter , located on motherboard  and connected to system bus , generates computer video signals for computer monitors, a composite television signal, and an S-Video signal. The functionality of Video\/TV converter  may be achieved through a Trident TVG9685 video chip in conjunction with an Analog Devices AD722 converter chip. Video\/TV converter  may require loading of special operating system device drivers.","Keyboard\/remote control interface unit  on motherboard  receives keyboard codes through controller , regardless of whether a wired keyboard\/pointing device or an infrared keyboard\/remote control is being employed. Infrared remote control unit  transmits signals which are ultimately sent to the serial port as control signals generated by conventional mouse or pointing device movements. Two buttons on remote control unit  are interpreted identically to the two buttons on a conventional mouse, while the remainder of the buttons transmit signals corresponding to keystrokes on an infrared keyboard. Thus, remote control unit  has a subset of the function provided by an infrared keyboard.","Connectors\/indicators  on motherboard  provide some of the connections and indicators on data processing unit  described above. Other connections are associated with and found on other components. For example, telephone jacks  and  are located on modem . The power indicator within connectors\/indicators  is controlled by controller .","External to motherboard  in the depicted example are power supply , hard drive , modem  and speaker . Power supply  is a conventional power supply except that it receives a control signal from controller  which effects shut down of all power to motherboard , hard drive  and modem . In some recovery situations, removing power and rebooting is the only guaranteed method of resetting all of these devices to a known state. Thus, power supply , in response to a signal from controller , is capable of powering down and restarting data processing unit .","Controller  is preferably one or more of the 805x family controllers. Controller  receives and processes input from infrared remote control , infrared keyboard, wired keyboard, or wired mouse. When one keyboard or pointing device is used, all others are locked out (ignored) until none have been active for a prescribed period. Then the first keyboard or pointing device to generate activity locks out all others. Controller  also directly controls all LED indicators except that indicating modem use. As part of the failure recovery system, controller  specifies the boot sector selection during any power off-on cycle.","Hard drive  contains operating system and applications software for data processing unit , which preferably includes IBM DOS 7.0, a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y.; an operating system such as Windows 3.1 (or higher), a product of Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash.; and Netscape Navigator (Version 1.0 or higher), a product of Netscape Communications Corporation in Mountain View, Calif. Hard drive  also supports a conventional FTP mechanism to facilitate file transfers from Internet FTP sites, all in a known manner. Other conventional Internet tools, including e-mail, bulletin board, and on-line chat capability, may also be provided. Of course, the software identified above is merely representative, as other known programs may be used in the alternative or by way of addition. Also, minor modifications of these software packages may be desirable to optimize performance of data processing unit .","Modem  may be any suitable modem used in conventional data processing systems, but is preferably a 33.6 kbps modem supporting the V.42bis, V.34, V.17 Fax, MNP 1-5, and AT command sets. TO maintain the slim height of data processing system , modem  is preferably inserted into a slot mounted sideways on motherboard . Modem  is connected to a physical communication link , which, in turn, in connected or connectable to the Internet (not shown).","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the components depicted in  and  and described above may be varied for specific applications or embodiments. Such variations in which the present invention may be implemented are considered to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.","According to the invention, a file transfer program  run by the processor is used to administer and manage \u201cupdating\u201d of the various application programs, preferably without interaction or intervention by a user of the appliance. This piece of code cooperates with program located at a server to facilitate the file transfer download method of the present invention, and it is preferably designed to lay \u201con top\u201d of a conventional FTP mechanism. According to the invention, an Internet client runs the client component of the download routine while an Internet server runs the server component of the program, and both of these components overlay the FTP mechanism such that the present invention is backwards compatible to existing approaches.","The preferred protocol implemented by the client and server components is illustrated in the process flow diagram of . Before discussing this operation in detail, reference should also be made to , which illustrates a representative file \u201cprofile\u201d according to the invention. Although not meant to be limiting, each file desired to be transmitted is identified in a master list of files to be downloaded. Preferably, this master list is stored at the Internet server, and it may be accessible by the client. For each file to be downloaded, there is an associated \u201cprofile\u201d that is generated. A representative profile  for the file titled CONFIG.SYS.PRO is illustrated. The profile includes two primary sections, a header section  and a body section . Each section includes so-called identifying information useful in deconstructing and constructing the file. Header section  includes an identifier CONFIG.SYS for the file and various attributes: a {date\/time} attribute identifying a date and time when the profile was created, a {size} attribute indicating the size of the overall file (preferably in bytes), and a cyclic redundancy code {CRC} which acts as a checksum uniquely identifying the file. The {size} is preferably a 32-bit size of the file (unsigned long), and the CRC is a 32-bit CRC. As is known in the art, a CRC may be generated for a particular file (or component thereof) by generating a running count from the hexadecimal or other character strings that comprise the file. The CRC for the overall file is calculated and stored in the profile header section . Other checksum approaches may be used in the alternative.","The profile body section  includes identifying information for a set of one or more components of the file that (in the preferred embodiment) must be combined or \u201creassembled\u201d in order to make a working file. In this example, CONFIG.SYS.PRO is made up of three components: CONFIG.SYS, CONFIG.SYS and CONFIG.SYS. In a representative embodiment, a component is of a fixed size (e.g., up to and including 75K bytes). Of course, this size designation is merely exemplary. Each component includes an identifier and a pair of attributes: {size} and associated {CRC}. These attributes are merely representative as other functional characteristics may be used as well. Thus, for example, a security attribute may be included so that the client does not download a non-usable or bogus file. As noted above, the {size} attribute is preferably a 32-bit size of the file component (unsigned long), and the CRC is a 32-bit CRC calculated for each particular component. This identifying information is used by the client component to verify completeness of the transmission of any component. Preferably, all numeric fields are stored as hexadecimal character strings.","In the preferred embodiment, the profile is generated for each file to be downloaded. This process is preferably done \u201coff-line\u201d (i.e. not during a download session) to save time. The client and server, in effect, \u201cagree\u201d on the naming conventions for the profile by having the server download the profile to the client that is expected to receive the file download. Although not illustrated in detail, it should be appreciated that the server includes an appropriate management and administrative interface (e.g., a DOS-based interface or a Windows-based graphical user interface with control menus and the like) for formatting each file into its components parts. Preferably, a user (which may be a system designer, an administrator, a person familar with protocols or some other third party) merely enters the size and naming conventions into appropriate dialog boxes and the profile (with the {CRC} and other header block information) is generated automatically. The server code also breaks the file into its component parts, and these parts are preferably stored in addressable locations.","Assume now that CONFIG.SYS.PRO file is to be downloaded from the server (at which it is resident) to an Internet client and that the profile  is represented by x.pro. The file, for example, may be a new version of an application running on the Web appliance, and it is preferred that this download process by effected without the user's actual knowledge or interaction. The three pieces of CONFIG.SYS.PRO are identified as x., x. and x. in the process flow diagram of  and each of these file components preferably includes its own header in which the associated identifying information is included.","The protocol begins with the client machine connecting to the Internet, and it is preferred that this protocol overlay a conventional FTP mechanism such that file components are transferred between server and client using FTP. A flow diagram showing the following process steps is illustrated in . The process begins at step  in response to some control command(s) from the server indicating that a download session involving the file is about to be initiated. In response, the client initiates a request for the profile (x.pro) and transmits this request to the server. This is step  in . The server then sends back the profile x.pro, which is step  in . As used herein, \u201cinitiating\u201d a request preferably (but not by way of limitation) means an action by the client component of the download routine, not the user of the client machine. Upon receipt of the profile, the client performs a test or check at step  in the flowchart to determine whether or not the existing parts or components of the file (as identified in the profile) are present at the client. Although not meant to be limiting, preferably a \u201cchecklist\u201d or the like is set up by the client component and evaluated for this purpose. Alternatively, the client component may set up some type of data structure (or other list) to keep track of the profile components. If the outcome of this evaluation is negative, the routine continues at step . At this point, the client requests a first component x. of the file (as identified by the profile) and transmits this request to the server. At step  in the flowchart, the server responds by sending component x..","Upon receipt of code purporting to be the first component x., the client component preferably compares the {size} and {CRC} information with the identifying information in the profile and records whether the component has downloaded completely. This is step . The size and\/or CRC comparison may be deferred until all of the pieces are received. The {size} is determined by counting the bytes and the {CRC} is calculated in the known manner. A test is then run at step  to determine if the first component x. has been received in its entirety (as indicated by the comparison with the profile). If the result of the test at step  is positive, the download sequence continues. In particular, a test is performed at step  to determine if all of the components have been received. If not, the routine cycles back and repeats for each of the remaining components.","Preferably, the components are transferred from server to client in sequential order but this is not required. The download sequence continues in this fashion (with each received component being checked against the profile identifying information), until all components have been requested by the client and transferred by the server.","When all components have been received, as indicated by a positive result of the test at step , the client component reassembles the components at step  and then calculates the {size} and {CRC} for the overall file at step . A test is then made at step  to determine whether the entire file is now present in the client. This is achieved by comparing the calculated information with the identifying information in the profile header block. If the outcome of the test at step  is positive, the routine is complete. If the outcome is negative, the routine returns to step  to obtain the missing component(s).","Assume now that the file transfer has been interrupted after the client requested component x.. This is illustrated in the process flow diagram of . A transmission interruption may be caused by any number of factors such as a power outage or the user inadvertently or intentionally turning off the power to the Web appliance. In this circumstance, however, the client again connects to the Internet and requests transfer of the profile x.pro. The server responds by re-sending the profile, which is advantageous because the file may have changed while the client was disconnected. Resending the profile is not always required, however, because there may be situations where the file state is persistent. In the preferred embodiment, however, the profile is retransmitted. The client then checks for the existing parts as previously described. At this point in the example, component x. is found, but component x. is not found (or its size or CRC does not match the profile identifying information). Thus, the client requests component x., and the server responds by sending this component. After validation, the download sequence then continues with the client requesting the next component, x. and transmitting this request to the server. The server responds in due course by transferring component x.. When all pieces of the file have been transferred (and this is determined by analyzing the profile), the client reassembles the pieces, checks the CRC and the date\/time stamp if needed, and the process ends.","As can be seen, the present invention is highly advantageous because it obviates retransmission of the entire file if any portion of the transmission is interrupted. Although the process flow of  shows a single transmission interruption, the inventive technique is useful regardless of the frequency of interruptions or the delay associated with any of them. Preferably, file transfer using the inventive scheme takes place \u201ctransparently\u201d to the user of the Web appliance, and thus software resident in the appliance can be periodically updated. This makes the appliance easy to use and maintain. Moreover, by overlaying the routine over a conventional FTP mechanism, the individual components of the file are transferred using the existing FTP, and thus the present invention is backwards compatible with existing applications.","Another advantage of the present invention is that the file is broken into a number of components, which enables the transfer of multiple components simultaneously. This can be achieved by opening multiple sockets between the client and the server during a session. Moreover, it should be appreciated that the technique of the present invention is most useful for files greater than about 50 Kbytes in size, and most preferably files greater than 100 Kbytes.","Other modifications and variations are also within the scope of this invention. Thus, for example, a server may be provided with a mechanism that is responsive to a client request for breaking up a composite file into components, creating a profile for the file, and then returning the profile to the client. The remainder of the file transfer would then proceed as described above. This can be accomplished with a new server daemon or by modifying an existing FTP daemon to accept a new FTP site command. A suitable application programming interface (API) may then be provided to facilitate third party use of the server mechanism.","One of the preferred implementations of the file transfer scheme of the invention is as a set of instructions (program code) in a code module resident in the random access memory of the computer. Until required by the computer, the set of instructions may be stored in another computer memory, for example, in a hard disk drive, or in a removable memory such as an optical disk (for eventual use in a CD ROM) or floppy disk (for eventual use in a floppy disk drive), or downloaded via the Internet or other computer network. In addition, although the various methods described are conveniently implemented in a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by software, one of ordinary skill in the art would also recognize that such methods may be carried out in hardware, in firmware, or in more specialized apparatus constructed to perform the required method steps.","As used herein, \u201cInternet client\u201d should be broadly construed to mean any computer or component thereof directly or indirectly connected or connectable in any known or later-developed manner to a computer network, such as the Internet. The term \u201cInternet server\u201d should also be broadly construed to mean a computer, computer platform, an adjunct to a computer or platform, or any component thereof. Of course, a \u201cclient\u201d should be broadly construed to mean one who requests or gets the file, and \u201cserver\u201d is the entity which downloads the file. It should also be appreciated that the present invention could be used to cache data and programs at a local server serving a set of Internet clients from a master server to conserve network resources.","Having thus described our invention, what we claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent is set forth in the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the present invention and the advantages thereof, reference should be made to the following Detailed Description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
