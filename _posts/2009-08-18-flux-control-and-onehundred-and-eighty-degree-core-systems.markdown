The United States Government has certain rights in these inventions.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to systems that convert electric energy into mechanical energy or vice versa and, more particularly to an arrangement of coils and\/or magnets that covert electric current into mechanical power or vice versa.","2. Related Art","Some motors and generators generate many current components and fluxes including certain third harmonic currents and fluxes (e.g., the alternating cycle is three times the fundamentals). Under certain conditions such as when the power density of an electric machine is very high, the magnetic saturation in the electric machine may become very high. A third-harmonic flux within the air gap of the machine may be a by product of this saturation.","Unfortunately, in some electric machines third harmonic currents render zero-sequence currents that do not generate torque. Zero-sequence third-harmonic ampere-turns in a three phase machine, for example, may buck each other in the air gap. The counter balance of such forces may produce no torque since torque is produced by the stator ampere-turns interacting with the rotor flux.","A two-phase or four-phase electric machine includes a first stator part and a second stator part disposed about ninety electrical degrees apart. Stator pole parts are positioned near the first stator part and the second stator part. An injector injects a third-harmonic frequency current that is separate from and not produced by the fundamental current driving the first stator part and the second stator part. The electric angular speed of the third-harmonic rotating field comprises",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["p","\u03b8"],"mo":"\u00b7"},"mi":"t"},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"A second two-phase or four-phase electric machine includes a first stator part having a plurality of inner bobbin wound cores and a second stator part having a plurality of outer bobbin wound cores. Each of the outer bobbin wound cores are mechanically biased against at least one of the plurality inner bobbin wound cores. A substantially cylindrical support biases an outer diameter of the outer bobbin wound core against an outer surface of the inner bobbin wound core. A first-phase and a second-phase of the electric machine enables about a one-hundred and eighty-electric degree phase span.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the invention will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.","A system may modify the flux that flows through an air gap in two-phase or four phase machines. A received or injected third harmonic current may produce a harmonic flux that is synchronous with a fundamental frequency current. As a rotating air gap flux is cut by stator windings, an additional third harmonic torque in synchronization with a fundamental frequency torque is produced. A third-harmonic current magnitude and phase shift may be adjusted or controlled by controlling the waveform and phase current (e.g., total phase current.) The additional (e.g., third harmonic magnitude) torque may be controlled by controlling the third-harmonic current magnitude and its phase shift. The system may interface or may be a unitary part of a voltage source inverter fed machine, current source inverter fed machine, or machines that are not fed by or interface one or more inverters (such as a machine connected directly to a utility supply source). Because the power of the third harmonic is normally small when compared to the full rating of a non-inverter-fed machine, such arrangement may benefit from the additional torque without the high cost of some alternatives.","The systems may be part of or interface permanent magnet (PM) machines (e.g., surface mount PM, interior PM mounts), induction machines, motors, generators, and\/or PM-less synchronous machines, such as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12\/274,895 entitled \u201cPermanent-Magnet-Less Synchronous Reluctance System,\u201d 12\/466,212 entitled \u201cPermanent-Magnet-Less Machine Having an Enclosed Air Gap,\u201d and 12\/466,169 entitled \u201cSubstantially Parallel Flux Uncluttered Rotor Machines,\u201d which are incorporated herein by reference. In some two-phase or four-phase stator winding machines, the windings may be distributed, substantially or nearly concentric (or concentrated), or may comprise bobbins (or individual wound core) windings, for example.","In a two-phase or a four-phase machine, stator third-harmonic currents may produce an air-gap third-harmonic rotating ampere-turns of the same rotating speed as the rotating field produced by the stator fundamental currents. By changing the shape of the air gap flux, the system produces additional torque (e.g., a smooth third-harmonic torque) without the need for additional phases such as a five-phase machine (that may require additional stator slots), additional electronic power switching components, or additional connection cables and connectors. The third-harmonic rotating ampere-turns interact with the rotor harmonic flux to produce the additional torque.","In operation, a fundamental frequency current flowing through the system's stator coils (or stator parts) may produce a fundamental flux distribution and a third-harmonic space waveform. While the fundamental flux distribution is useful (e.g., in an energy conversion: such as an electrical conversion into mechanical energy\u2014motor or a mechanical conversion into electrical energy\u2014generator), the third-harmonic space waveform produced from the fundamental current may be of little use. When a third-harmonic frequency current (that is not the fundamental frequency current) is received or injected into the stator windings (e.g., it may be synthetically produced by a third harmonic flux or naturally produced due to magnetic saturation), a third-harmonic fundamental current and a third-harmonic frequency component is generated. The third harmonic frequency current will be in synchronization (or substantially in sync) with the fundamental frequency current. The shape of the winding back electromotive force (emf) may be modified by injecting the third (3) harmonic currents into two or four-phase stator windings. When the rotating air gap flux cuts the stator winding conductors the voltage of the back emf is produced.","In a two-phase or a four-phase machine, stator third-harmonic currents may produce an air-gap third-harmonic rotating ampere-turns of the same rotating speed as the rotating field produced by the stator fundamental currents. By changing the shape of the air gap flux, the shape of the induced electromotive force (EMF) in the stator winding may become more trapezoidal; consequently, the peak voltage of this trapezoidal waveform contains a higher fundamental peak voltage than the trapezoidal waveform's peak voltage. This may help to gain higher fundamental voltage when the permissible peak voltage is limited to a given value.","An exemplary four-pole machine is shown in . Because two-phase and four-phase windings may have substantially the same substantially 90 electric phase shift between phases, the same number of switching devices that control the fields may be used for the two or four phases that drive these systems. In some applications, a four-phase inverter may include four half-bridge legs (or full bridges or two H-bridge) for the two phases. Some four-phase half-bridge connections may provide a neutral connection; although, third-harmonic currents may flow without it. Some four-phase circuits provide a hop-along benefit when one or two phases are not in order.","In , the four-pole machine includes a set of two-phase windings. In other four-pole machines distributed windings, concentrated pole windings, etc., are used. In , the electrical angular location in the air gap may be tracked by the angle p*\u03b8 that is the product of the pole-pair, p, and the mechanical angle \u03b8. The phase-1 coils may provide an angular reference for the two-phase machine with the phase-2 coil starts at about 90 electrical degrees from this reference. The exemplary orientation may be maintained for other two-phase machine with any number of poles such as the system shown in  illustrating a four pole machine that has four-phase windings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"sup":"rd "},"The total phase current may be controlled locally or remotely. A local or remote controller (or injector) may adjust the magnitude and phase shift angle, \u03b1, of its third-harmonic component. Adding the desirable fundamental and third harmonic currents may render different current waveforms. The control may adjust the shape and phase as shown by the exemplary currents in the time domain of .","A two-phase (or four-phase) model may mathematically represent how a third-harmonic injected into the stator winding changes the shape of an air-gap flux distribution.
