{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to printing and distributed environments, and more particularly to pre-defined print option configurations for printing in a distributed environment.","As computer technology has advanced, the role of computers in our daily lives has expanded, as has the need for various peripheral or supporting devices. One typical peripheral device used with computers is a printer, which generates a hard copy of data that is used by the computer. The types and capabilities of printers available has similarly been expanding, resulting in a wide variety of printers with a range of printing capabilities, performance, and price.","One significant expansion in the use of computer technology is the networking of computers together. Networking computers together allows the computers to communicate with one another as well as with other devices, such as printers. Currently, in order for a user of a computing device to print to printers on a network, the user is required to configure the printers individually. For example, each printer that the user desires to print to in draft quality mode typically must be configured individually to be in draft quality mode. Such requirements on configuring printers are tedious for users, resulting in a user-unfriendly experience. It would thus be beneficial to provide a way to improve the user's ability to configure printers in a user-friendly manner. The importance of such an improvement increases as the use and capabilities of networks continues to expand.","Pre-defined print option configurations for printing in a distributed environment are described herein.","According to one aspect, a user selection is received of one or more print options via a network service (e.g., an Internet imaging home page). The one or more print options are identified (e.g., stored as a particular named configuration) for subsequent resolution (e.g., by a printer or print service during subsequent printing of a document). The one or more print options can be applied to one or more other network services (e.g., one or more printers or print services).","Pre-defined option configurations for printing in a distributed environment are described herein. Various print options can be selected as a set or configuration and assigned a name by a user via one service in the distributed environment. The print options in a particular set or configuration can then be identified, by name, for subsequent resolution and applied to one or more other services in the distributed environment.","Print options serve to configure a printer in a particular manner for printing. Each print option used to configure a printer affects how the printer will print documents it receives, and\/or how it will pre-process (or post-process) the document to be printed (or already printed). These print options are typically applied regardless of the underlying data in the document being printed and the format of such data (e.g., its font, color, etc.). A wide variety of print options are commonly known, and include, for example, duplex or single-sided printing, automatic conversion of document to the size of paper in the printer (or a particular tray of the printer), automatic stapling of the printed document, the type of stapling (e.g., saddle staple), collation of the printed document, a number of copies of the document to print, a print quality of the document, a particular print media source (e.g., a manual input tray on the printer), selection of a watermark, binding options, cutting options, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","102","104","108","104","104"]},"Repository  represents image storage facilities personalized to the individual user, although alternatively multiple users may have access to the same repository . Repository  is maintained on one or more computers, such as network client , an imaging source(s) , an imaging destination(s) , another computer (not shown), or combinations thereof. The \u201cimages\u201d or \u201cgraphics\u201d in repository  can be any type of printable data, such as text, drawings, frames of video or animations, pictures, combinations thereof, and so forth.","The user, via network client , can select images from imaging repository  to be communicated to imaging destination(s)  for printing in accordance with pre-defined print option configurations identified by the user. Imaging destination  represents any of a wide variety of devices that are capable of processing images in some manner. Examples of imaging destinations  include printers, plotters, services managing printing devices, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["150","150","152","154","156","158","152","154","156"]},"Network  represents one or more conventional data distribution networks that can be used to communicate data and other information (e.g., control information) between or among various computing devices. Examples of network  include the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a public or private wide area network (WAN), combinations thereof, and so on. Network  can include multiple different types of networks, including wired and\/or wireless portions, employing any of a wide variety of different communications protocols, including public and\/or proprietary communications protocols.","During operation, a network browser  executing on imaging client  allows a user of client  to interact with network servers  and , as well as network services executing on such servers. Network browser  includes a network imaging extension  that allows network content  executing in browser  to communicate with the user's personal imaging repository , which may include communication with services via network . As used herein, services refer to software components that can execute on one or more computing devices and are accessible to provide functionality to imaging client , such as imaging sources, imaging destinations, printer configuration components, and so forth. Network imaging extension  can be implemented in any of a wide variety of manners, such as an application programming interface (API) providing methods that can be called by content  and used to interact with servers  and  (e.g., to load, save, modify, delete, etc. documents).","Network server  executes a network-based imaging service  that allows a user of browser  to interact with his or her personal imaging repository (e.g., add, remove, and\/or modify graphics in the repository) and identify an image for printing. Images identified or selected for including in the user's personal imaging repository can be indicated by value (e.g., the actual image data) or by reference (e.g., a pointer to or identifier of the image stored elsewhere). The network-based imaging service  also allows a user to identify configurations (of pre-defined print options) for the printer(s) on which the image will be printed. The image to be printed can be made up of graphics from one or more different graphic sources, and include any type of printable data (e.g., text, graphics, and so forth).","Network-based imaging service  represents one or more services accessible to imaging client . Each service can execute on the same server or alternatively on multiple different servers. These different services can provide different functionality (e.g., one service may be responsible for graphic storage and retrieval functionality, while another service is responsible for merge functionality allowing graphics to be merged together). Additionally, some services may be fully or partially overlapping in functionality provided by other services, allowing a degree of fault-tolerance to be built into system  (e.g., one service can take over the responsibilities of another if the other fails).","The graphic for an image is received from a graphic store  and\/or a composition store . Graphic store  stores individual graphics (also referred to as documents or more generally data capable of being represented as a two dimensional graphic), such as individual files. These individual graphics in store  can be used as individual printable images via imaging service . Each individual graphic can be any of one or more types of printable data (e.g., text, pictures, etc.), and may result in multiple hard copy pages when printed. Additionally, a user of browser  may identify multiple individual graphics from graphic store  that are to be compiled together as a single image for printing. In this situation, network-based imaging service  provides an interface that allows the user of browser  to select different individual images and store the compilation of individual images as a single composition document (also referred to as a composition image) in composition store . The composition document may include the actual data from the individual images, or alternatively identifiers (e.g., file name and path, or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)) of where the individual images can be retrieved for printing or displaying to the user.","Graphic store  and composition store  are illustrated in system  as two separate stores. Alternatively, multiple such stores may exist in system , and one or more graphic stores may be combined with one or more composition stores. Additionally, one or more of these stores  or  may be implemented on one of servers  or , and\/or imaging client .","Network-based imaging service  also provides an interface via which a user of browser  can pre-define print option configurations and subsequently select those pre-defined configurations. These configurations defined by a user are stored at server , or alternatively elsewhere in system  as user profile . Any number of configurations can be defined by the user. Each configuration (also referred to as a \u201cset\u201d) is a grouping of one or more print options that are selected by the user. Each print option also has an associated setting, which may be explicitly or implicitly supplied by the user. For example, if the user selects the \u201cduplex\u201d option then the user has implicitly assigned a setting of \u201con\u201d to duplex printing (and also possibly \u201coff\u201d to single-sided or simplex printing). However, if the user desires to select the number of copies to be printed, then the user explicitly supplies the setting (that is, explicitly identifies the number of copies to be printed). The user is able to pre-define printer configurations at any time prior to printing. The print options, however, are not resolved for printing until later. In other words, the print options are not used to configure a printer in accordance with the print options until a later time when an image is being printed with the print options. The pre-definition and subsequent selection of printer configurations is discussed in more detail below.","In order to print an image, the user identifies the image (optionally selecting graphics that are to be part of the image) and any pre-defined printer configurations he or she desires via network-based imaging service . If the optional selecting of graphics is performed, it may be performed by the same network service as performs the pre-defined printer configuration identification, or alternatively a different service. A print request, including the image data and user-selected pre-defined printer configurations, are then communicated to network-based print server  executing on network server . Upon receipt of the print request, network-based printer server  interacts with a printer  coupled thereto to produce a hard copy of the image in accordance with the received pre-defined printer configurations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","200"]},"In architecture , an imaging client  (e.g., imaging client  of ) includes a web browser  including a web imaging extension . Browser  is able to load and execute web content  (e.g., JavaScripts, Java applets or other web programs) from various sources. In the illustrated example, web browser  establishes a communication channel or connection with web server , causing web imaging home content  to be copied to imaging client  as at least part of web content . Although illustrated as being copied from web server , it is to be appreciated that web imaging home content  could alternatively be loaded from a local or intermediary source, such as a cache (not shown) implemented on imaging client . Additionally, any inputs by the user to web content  are typically handled by web content  rather than being returned to web imaging home content .","Once loaded in web browser , web content  can communicate, via web imaging extension , with other components in architecture , allowing access to a personal imaging repository as well as imaging sources and imaging destinations. In the illustrated example, the personal imaging repository includes composition store  and graphic store , the imaging sources include web application  and service , and the imaging destinations include proxy server  and printer . Web application  includes a web server  that maintains (or obtains\/creates) content  accessible to web content . Similarly, service  maintains a web server  that maintains (or obtains\/creates) content  accessible to web content . The content  and , when generated (e.g., from a file or dynamically) and executed on imaging client  (e.g., as part of web content ), can make various functionality available to web content , such as image sources, combine multiple graphics into a composition document, etc.","Printer  and proxy server  each optionally include a print server for queuing and managing received print requests, and a web server  and  storing or dynamically generating device content  and , respectively. Device content  represents content (which may be generated dynamically) that is provided to the web browser  by the web server . Device content  is a web service available to imaging client  (e.g., displayed as a web page) that represents printer  and that can access the user's personal imaging repository. The device content , when downloaded and executed on client  (e.g., as part of web content ), can access the stores  and  via web imaging extension  to obtain graphics and upload the graphics to printer  for printing. The upload to printer  is accomplished using existing conventional mechanisms (e.g., TCP\/IP sockets and\/or HTTP POST command(s)) that allow content executing within the browser to communicate with the server from which that content came. In the illustrated example, imaging extension  is only used to obtain graphics from the personal imaging repository, not to upload the graphics to the printer.","Proxy server  allows a printer(s) that does not host a web server to be represented by a web service. Proxy server  includes device content  and web server , which operate analogous to device content  and web server , respectively. The printer  is represented by device content  and graphics obtained by the device content  (presented in the context of the device). This device content, when downloaded and executed on client  (e.g., as part of web content ), can upload graphics accessed through the imaging extension to proxy server , which in turn forwards these graphics to printer .","Web application  and service  may each be accessible by imaging client  via the Internet or via a local network (e.g., an Intranet). Each of the stores  and , as well as user profile store , web server , and proxy server , may be accessible via a network (e.g., an Intranet or the Internet) and\/or located on imaging client .","During operation, web content  generates and renders, via web browser , one or more user interfaces (e.g., graphical user interfaces (GUIs)) that allows the user to interact with his or her personal imaging repository. This interaction includes allowing the user to select images or documents for printing, to identify pre-defined printer configurations to be used in printing selected documents, and to define printer configurations. Example user interfaces rendered by web content  are discussed below with reference to , , and . The various interfaces can be separate web pages, or alternatively portions of another (or the same) web page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["204","240","204","212","240","242","244","246","248","240","244","250","260"]},"The length of the user-selected document (e.g., in pages) is illustrated in a length field . Document preview window  provides a location via which a small preview image of the document selected for printing (or other processing) is displayed to the user. A current page section  identifies the current page(s) being displayed in document preview window , and page manipulation buttons , , , and  allow the user to easily advance to the next page in the document, the previous page in the document, the last page of the document, or the first page of the document, respectively.","Favorite printers portion  identifies one or more printers that are selectable by the user for printing, and can include, for example, the user's preferred printers, suggested printers to be used by the user, default printers, and so forth. In the illustrated example, each printer identified in favorites portion  is identified by a hyperlink (illustrated as being underlined). The user can select one of the printers that the identified document is to be printed on by activating the hyperlink (e.g., by using a pointer control device to situate a pointer over the hyperlink on screen and click a button of the control device). Services and options portion  allows the user to identify or request options or services, such as to add a printer to favorites portion , clear favorites portion , print the document, and so forth.","One option that can be selected by the user via portion  is the define printer configuration option . Selection of the define printer configuration option  allows the user to define printer configurations and assign names to those configurations, thereby allowing the user to establish desired printer configurations and subsequently identify them by name (or other identifier). When the user subsequently requests to print a document, he or she can identify one of the printer configurations to apply for the printing, causing the options identified in that configuration to be used in printing the document. Each predefined configuration includes a setting of one or more print options.","It should be noted that the print options for a particular configuration are the user's desired options for that configuration. The print options are not printer-specific options, so situations can arise where options set in a particular configuration are not carried out because the printer on which the document is being printed does not support the option. Thus, the printer configurations can be viewed as requests or user desires when printing, with no guarantee to the user that they will actually be used when printing. By way of example, the user may define a configuration named \u201cbooklet\u201d and identify that the printed document for the booklet configuration should be stapled. However, when the user prints the document, whether the document is stapled depends on the particular printer on which the document is printed. If that printer supports stapling, then it will staple the document; however, if that printer does not support stapling, then it will not staple the document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["300","300","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","302","304","306","310","312","314","302","304","302","304","302","302","304"]},"User interface  also allows the user to assign a name or other identifier to the selected options by typing in a name in data-entry field . Data-entry field  is a conventional data input mechanism, allowing user-input of one or more alphanumeric characters. Once the user has entered the name and his or her desired print options, these can be saved as a particular configuration by user-selection of a define button  (e.g., a conventional onscreen button). These saved configurations can be stored in a variety of different locations, such as user profile store  of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","248","402","400","242","404","406","408"]},"In an alternate embodiment, feedback regarding the printer(s) is returned to the user via interface . In this alternate embodiment, the web imaging home page (e.g., content  or ) communicates with the appropriate printer (or corresponding proxy server) to identify the print options that it supports. An identification of the supported configuration options is then provided to the user via interface . This identification can be negative (e.g., identify, for the selected printer configuration, each printer configuration option that the printer does not support) or alternatively positive (e.g., identify, for the selected printer configuration, each print option that the printer does support).","The determination of which print options are supported by a particular printer can be made by the printer or alternatively the web imaging home page. For example, the web imaging home page may communicate, to the printer, all of the print options that are requested in a particular printer configuration. The printer then checks which options it supports (and\/or is currently able to carry out (e.g., the printer is loaded with staples)) and returns an indication of those to the web imaging home page. Alternatively, the web imaging home page may communicate, to the printer, a request for all possible print options that are supported (and\/or currently provided by) the printer. Upon receiving all of the possible print options, the web imaging home page compares those options to the print options in the configurations to determine which print options within the configurations are supported by the printer.","Returning to , the process of printing a document in system  can be seen from the following example. Via the interface provided by web browser  and content , the user is able to access images from different imaging sources, such as web application , service , graphic store , or composition store . The user can also select one of the pre-defined configurations stored in user profile store . Additionally, the user can select a printer on which to print the selected document, such as printer  coupled to proxy server , or printer . When the user selects the print option (e.g., print button  of ), an identification of the document as well as an identification of the configuration is communicated to the appropriate printer. Upon receipt of the print request, the printer prints the requested document, applying all of the requested print options in the configuration that it supports (e.g., functions that the printer offers (such as stapling) and that the printer is equipped to perform (such as being loaded with staples)).","The print request communicated to the printer includes an identifier of the document that is to be printed. Any of a wide variety of identifiers can be used, such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). This may be an identifier of a single document (e.g., a document in graphic store ), or an identifier of a composition document (e.g., a document in composition store ) that itself includes identifiers of one or more other documents. Alternatively, the data of the document to be printed may be communicated to the printer from the client , such as by the device content  of  (when downloaded and executed on the client ). The data of the document may be communicated with the print request, or alternatively subsequent to the print request.","The print options of a configuration can be communicated to the printer in a variety of different manners. In one implementation, the options are encoded in the URL for the printer. For example, selection of a print document option causes the content  to generate a URL that identifies the printer, the document to be printed, and the print options that are in the user-selected predefined configuration, such as:","host.net\/myprinter?document=memo.txt&staple=true&duplex=off&quality=draft","which indicates the printer identified by \u201chost.net\/myprinter\u201d is requested to print the document \u201cmemo.txt\u201d with the staple option turned on, duplex turned off, and the print quality to be draft.","In another implementation, the options are added by a web server rather than imaging client . For example, selection of a print document option can cause the print request to be communicated to web server  hosting web imaging home client . The print options can then be encoded in a URL by imaging home client , which redirects web browser  to the URL of the requested printer.","In yet another implementation, the options are encoded in the URL by an identifier or pointer (e.g., a location where the user-selected configuration is stored). The requested printer (or print service) then uses this identifier or pointer to access the configuration and retrieve the print options stored therein.","In still another implementation, the user profile contains information indicating the desired options. These options can be pointed to or identified (e.g., by a portion of the URL) either directly or alternatively indirectly (e.g., a pointer to or identifier of the user profile, from which the \u201ccurrent\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d print options can be obtained). After being used by a print service, the indication of desired options may optionally be reset to indicate no particular preference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":"500"},"Initially, a printer configuration setup interface (e.g., a web page) is presented for display to the user (act ). The user selection of one or more of the print options is then received (act ), as is (optionally) a user-selected name for the configuration (act ). If the user does not select a name for the configuration then a default name may be applied (alternatively, the user may be required to select a name for the configuration). The user-selected print options are then saved (at a local and\/or remote location) along with the user-selected name (act ), allowing the user-defined configuration to be subsequently selected (by name) by the user when printing a document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":"530"},"Initially, a list of printer configuration names is presented to the user (act ).

Printers used by the user are then identified (act ). These can be identified in any of a wide variety of manners, such as a set of default printers based on the user's location, a set of printers the user has previously printed to, a set of printers that the user has identified (e.g., the \u201cfavorite\u201d printers in portion  of ), and so forth. A comparison is then made between the print options included in the configuration selected by the user and the print options that are supported by each of the identified printers (act ). This comparison may be made based on information already known to the imaging host (e.g., it may maintain a record of the print options supported by different printers) or alternatively based on information obtained by the imaging host from the different printers.","A determination is then made as to how many print options in the selected configuration are supported by each of the identified printers (act ). The number of print options supported by each of the identified printers is then communicated to the user's client computer for presentation to the user (act ). By presenting this number of print options supported by each of the printers to the user, the user is presented with additional information that may affect his or her decision of which printer he or she should select for printing of a particular document. Alternatively, rather than identifying a number of print options supported by each of the printers to the user, an indication of the printer(s) with the highest number of print options may be communicated to the client for presentation of a \u201csuggested\u201d printer to the user. Optionally, the specific print options from the selected configuration that are supported by each printer may also be communicated to the user's client computer for presentation to the user, thereby allowing the user to make decisions based on the specific print options supported by the printers.","Various acts are illustrated in the processes of , , and  above.

Bus  represents one or more buses in computer system , such as a system bus, processor bus, accelerated graphics port (AGP), peripheral component interconnect (PCI), and so forth. The bus architecture can vary by computing device as well as by manufacturer. I\/O interface  is a conventional interface allowing components of system  (e.g., processor ) to communicate with other computing devices via a network, such as network  of . I\/O interface  may be, for example, a modem, a network interface card (NIC), and so forth.","Memory  represents volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory used to store instructions and data for use by processor .
