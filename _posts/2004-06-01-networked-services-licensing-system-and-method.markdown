No. 60\/261,753, filed on Jan. 17, 2001, the entire disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to networked communications systems, and more particularly to a system and method for licensing of networked services, such as Web services, and the like.","2. Description of Related Art","Recently, networked services technologies, such as Web services technologies, are introducing at a rapid pace the capability to access various services over the Internet in an interoperable and automated manner. As enterprises make their content (such as software) and services available as networked services, there exists a need to control their indiscriminate access and use. The typical method of access control has been one where an identity or credentials about an identity are matched against a set of policies that are managed locally by the provider of the service. One example is when a user enters a user name and password to access some resource in a Web service. This method of access control is widely used in computer systems and is primarily about protecting \u201cmy\u201d services against unauthorized use. In other words, access to a service typically is solely based on an identity of a user requesting access to the service.","With a desire to manage or restrict access, proliferate and commercialize services, there exist scenarios where computational environments are merely intermediaries and typically cannot decide on their own security policies. An example of such intermediaries includes hosting and replicating devices used in outsourcing and bandwidth management scenarios. However, in such environments, it is difficult to propagate and manage central security policies. Accordingly, there is still a need for systems and methods for licensing of networked services, such as Web services.","The above and other needs are addressed by exemplary embodiments of the present invention, which provide an improved system and method for licensing of networked services, such as Web services, and the like.","Accordingly, in an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a computer-implemented method for exercising rights based on determining trust in an issuance of a rights expression, including issuing rights expressions by a chain of servers, forming a chain of rights expressions issued from server to server and finally from the last server to a client, such that each of the rights expressions except the last includes a specification of rights for the next server to issue the rights in the next rights expression; determining whether or not each of the servers has a right to issue the respective rights expression; exercising by the client the rights expressed in the last rights expression as being trusted, if it is determined that each of the servers had a right to issue the respective rights expression; and not exercising by the client the rights expressed in the last rights expression as not being trusted, if it is determined that at least one of the servers did not have the right to issue the respective rights expression.","According to another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a system for exercising rights based on determining trust in an issuance of a rights expression, including a client; a chain of servers configured to issue rights expressions, forming a chain of rights expressions issued from server to server and finally from the last server to the client, such that each of the rights expressions except the last includes a specification of rights for the next server to issue the rights in the next rights expression; and means for determining whether or not each of the servers has a right to issue the respective rights expression. The client is configured to exercise the rights expressed in the last rights expression as being trusted, if each of the servers had a right to issue the respective rights expression, and not exercise the rights expressed in the last rights expression as not being trusted, if at least one of the servers did not have the right to issue the respective rights expression.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of exemplary embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The present invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A system and method for licensing of networked services, such as Web services, and the like, are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that the present invention can be practiced without these specific details or with equivalent arrangements. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Generally, a more flexible method for access control can be developed through technologies, referred to as Digital Rights Management (DRM) herein, wherein access to a resource is controlled by a license, wherein the license can be encoded in a rights language. The exemplary embodiments described herein, advantageously, leverage DRM system components to address issues related to the licensing of networked services, such as Web services. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments can employ authentication, authorization, accounting, payment and financial clearing, rights specification, rights verification, rights enforcement, document protection components, and the like, of a Digital Rights Management system, for example, as further described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,530,235, 5,629,980, 5,634,012, 5,638,443, 5,715,403, 6,233,684, and 6,236,971, the entire disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","The use of a rights expression, for example, in the form of a license used to define usage rights for specifying a permitted manner of use, such as consumption, and the like, of a service, advantageously, switches the control, the responsibility for control, and the like, from the computing environment to the rightful owner of the service. Such usage rights can be associated with one or more conditions, such as payment, and the like, that can be a prerequisite for exercising the specified manner of use of the service. A rights expression language, such as extensible Rights Markup Language (XrML), and the like, for example, including predefined syntax and semantics, can be employed to express the usage rights. Consume, consuming, consumption, and the like, of the service, for example, can include access to or use of the service, access to or use of parts or devices of the service, access to or use of results of the service, receiving or rendering content of the service, executing software of the service, and the like.","In the above model, according to the exemplary embodiments, access control typically is about deploying \u201cmy\u201d services \u201cout-there,\u201d while at the same time issuing rights to users of such services to control access to the services. By contrast, other methods and systems for access control primarily are focused on protecting \u201cmy\u201d services against use by others.","According to the exemplary embodiments, DRM is employed in a networked services environment, such as a Web services environment, for example, by leveraging components of the DRM system, such as license generation, license interpretation, and the like. In addition, the exemplary embodiments provide a system and method for authorization for networked services, for example, through a license expressed in a rights language. Further, the exemplary embodiments are directed how a license can be generated, used, processed, and the like, by the various entities of the networked services ecosystem to reach an authorization decision that allows access by a client, devices, services, and the like, to the networked services. In general, a requester of for a service presents a license in order to get access to the service.","Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments, advantageously, enable more flexible business models. For example, a service can be deployed \u201canywhere,\u201d and the control to access the service can be centralized and determined by the owner of the service. The points of deployment typically do not have to worry about establishing local security policies, as this becomes unnecessary. In addition, the model of \u201cdistributed access management\u201d of the exemplary embodiments, advantageously, can be applied in the syndication of networked services, such as Web services, for example, including multiple layers of participants.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to  thereof, there is illustrated an exemplary Networked Services Licensing System  that can be used in connection with the described exemplary embodiments for licensing of networked services, such as Web services, and the like. In , the Networked Services Licensing System , for example, includes a Web Services Provider , a Web Services Client , a License Generation and Issuing Service  and that can interface with one or more Business Networks , a License Generation, Validation and\/or Interpretation Service  for relaying a license , a State Tracking Service  for relaying state information , and a Trust Authority Service  for relaying keys and\/or certificates . The services -, advantageously, can be configured as a middle-tier or layer that can be plugged-in between the Trust Authority Service , and the Web Services Provider  and the Web Services Client . Advantageously, existing Web services systems can be modified to practice the exemplary embodiments based on such middle layer configuration.","A rights language, such as eXtensible Rights Markup Language (XrML), eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML), Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), and the like, can be used to specify a rights expression, rights expression information, and the like, for example, in the form of the license . However, the license  can be specified in any suitable manner. In addition, the license  can be based on a pre-defined specification, template, prototype, and the like, that can be associated with the Web service, according to further exemplary embodiments. Accordingly, the process of specifying the license  can include any suitable process for associating rights, conditions, and the like, with access to services, such as Web services.","An exemplary workflow for the Networked Services Licensing System  can include a user operating within the Web Services Client  environment being issued the license  by the License Issuing Service  for accessing a service of the Web Services Provider . When the user wishes to use a service  provided by the Web Services Provider , the user can make a request  for the service  from the Web Services Provider  along with the issued license . When associated conditions (for example, obligations ), such as the collection of a fee, the authentication of the user, and the like, are satisfied based on a license interpretation request , as verified, for example, by the License Interpretation Service , and the State Tracking Service , the user can be allowed access to the service  of the Web Services Provider  in accordance with a manner of use specified in the license .","Advantageously, the license  can specify any suitable usage rights associated with the service . The interpretation and enforcement of the usage rights are further described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,235, No. 5,629,980, No. 5,634,012, No. 5,638,443, No. 5,715,403, No. 6,233,684, and No. 6,236,971, for example. The steps above can take place sequentially or approximately simultaneously or in various orders.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The top and bottom layers of  can be used to contrast a typical model for providing Web services, wherein the Web Services Provider  controls access through simple processes, such as user-name and password, and local policy evaluation. By contrast, according to the exemplary embodiments, the middle layer is involved in defining processes and\/or determining authorization for access the service  provided by the Web Services Provider . This middle layer can be referred to as a \u201crights layer.\u201d","Advantageously, tasks related to determining authorization to the service , authentication, accounting, and the like, can be managed, outsourced, handled, and the like, by the specialized services provided by the middle layer. In this way, the Web Services Provider  can enjoy the luxury of focusing solely on the business logic of the service , while outsourcing other activities, such as the processing of payments, the maintaining of customer databases, and the like, that typically would be employed in a more monolithic e-commerce model. Accordingly, the Web Services Provider  processes the rights expression in the form of the license  that is presented by the Web Services Client  in order to determine what services to provide and how to provide such services. According to an exemplary embodiment, the license interpretation, the state information tracking, for example, such as how many times the service  has been rendered, which can be the accounting part, and the like, can be outsourced to third party providers.","The exemplary embodiments, thus, provide the authorizing of the access to the service , for example, via the generation of the license . By contrast, other Web services systems and methods typically control access by remembering a client's identity and by requesting a credential, such as user-name and password. In the exemplary embodiments, however, such credentials are augmented in the form of the license . The issuing of the license  can be accomplished by the rights layer, but can include processes performed by the Web Services Provider . The rights layer can include the Business Network(s) , such as a partner that bought the service  and is now allowing its customer base access to the service . Thus, anyone with a business arrangement with the Web Services Provider  can be capable of issuing the license , according to further exemplary embodiments.","The interaction of the Web Service Client  with the Web Services Provider  can involve various mechanisms and transactions, such as a request for service, a financial transaction, a rendering of the service , and the like. For example, of the Web Service Client  can contact the Web Services Provider  and request some type of service . The access to the service  also can include various transactions, such as access, rendering, execution of code, send-back of data, collecting payment, and the like. Accordingly, the access to the service  can include any suitable interactions and\/or results between the Web Service Client  and the Web Services Provider .","The Networked Services Licensing System  is of an exemplary nature and can be implemented in numerous other arrangements. For example, a clearinghouse (not shown) can be used to process payment transactions and verify payment prior to the Issuing Service  issuing the license . Moreover, the various processes and transactions can be performed, for example, via online and\/or offline environments and\/or combinations thereof, according to further exemplary embodiments. Accordingly, the various devices and\/or components of the Networked Services Licensing System  can, but need not, communicate directly with one another and information can be exchanged in any suitable manner, such as by physically moving media between the devices the various devices and\/or components of the Networked Services Licensing System .","The devices and subsystems of the Networked Services Licensing System  of  can communicate, for example, over one or more communications networks (not shown), and can include, for example, any suitable servers, workstations, personal computers (PCs), laptop computers, PDAs, Internet appliances, set top boxes, modems, handheld devices, telephones, cellular telephones, wireless devices, other devices, and the like, capable of performing the processes of the exemplary embodiments. The devices and subsystems can communicate with each other using any suitable protocol and can be implemented using a general-purpose computer system, for example. One or more interface mechanisms can be used in the Networked Services Licensing System , for example, including Internet access, telecommunications in any suitable form, such as voice, modem, and the like, wireless communications media, and the like. Accordingly, such communications network(s) can include, for example, wireless communications networks, cellular communications networks, satellite communications networks, Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs), Packet Data Networks (PDNs), the Internet, intranets, and the like. In addition, such communications network(s) can be the same or different networks.","As noted above, it is to be understood that the Networked Services Licensing System  of  is for exemplary purposes, as many variations of the specific hardware used to implement the exemplary embodiments are possible. For example, the functionality of the devices and the subsystems of the Networked Services Licensing System  can be implemented via one or more programmed computer systems or devices. To implement such variations as well as other variations, a single computer system can be programmed to perform the special purpose functions of one or more of the devices and subsystems of the Networked Services Licensing System . On the other hand, two or more programmed computer systems or devices can be substituted for any one of the devices and subsystems of the Networked Services Licensing System . Accordingly, principles and advantages of distributed processing, such as redundancy, replication, and the like, also can be implemented, as desired, to increase the robustness and performance of the Networked Services Licensing System , for example.","The components of the Networked Services Licensing System , for example, including the license , the Web Services Provider , the Web Services Client , the License Generation and\/or Issuing Service , the License Validation and\/or Interpretation Service , the State Tracking Service , and the Trust Authority Service , according to various embodiments, will now be further described.","The license , for example, can be based on rights language-based functions, such as XrML functions, and the like, in the exemplary embodiments. The Web Services Client  can present the license  to the Web Services Provider , when the Web Services Client  requests the service . The license , for example, can convey the rights and conditions governing the rendering of services, such the service , the manner of use of the services, and the like. In addition, the license , for example, can convey the context in which transactions between the Services Client  and the Web Services Provider  can take place, and the like.","Accordingly, the license  can convey information, for example, including the service , parts of the service , a principal to whom the license  has been granted, the rights that are granted, the conditions under which the service  can be accessed, obligations that the Web Services Provider  and\/or the Web Services Client  may have to perform while allowing access to a protected resource of the service , trust domains, for example, including the issuer of the license  and\/or the authority under which the license  has been issued, information to leverage or utilize security mechanisms, such as signatures and\/or encryption mechanisms, any other suitable information, which can be mandatory and\/or optionally employed by the Networked Services Licensing System , and the like.","An exemplary license , for example, written in XrML, is shown below that conveys, for example, a right to access the service  offered by the Web Services Provider , \u201cwww.foo.com\/quoteService,\u201d and that has been granted to a holder of a specific cryptographic key, such as the principal, and the like, by the issuer, represented by another key value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<license>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<grant>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<keyholder>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003..."]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/keyhoder>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<ws:execute\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<serviceReference>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<foo: location uri= www.foo.com\/quoteService\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/serviceReference>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/grant>"]},{"entry":[{},"<issuer>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<dsig:keyValue>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003..."]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/dsig:keyValue>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/license>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The identification of the service  can be encoded in the license . Such encoding can be used to indicate that the license  refers to the service  in question. Additionally, any suitable granular identification of the service  in question can be specified. For example, the license  can describe that the license  pertains to a portion of the service , a certain Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) exposed by the service , and the like. Alternatively, the license  also can identify the service  including a set of services. For example, the service  can be described as \u201cany service that originates from www.foo.com.\u201d Further, the service  identified can include any suitable combination of the models described above.","The principal specified in the license  can be used to verify the identity of the requester of the service , for example, a user of the service , such as the Web Services Client . The principal, thus, can be used to authenticate the requester of the service . Typically, the requester may have to present some form of credential at the time of the request , and such credential can verified against the identity of, for example, the principal specified in the license . The credential presented can employ various mechanisms, such as digital certificates, including a key, a security token, and the like.","The principal also can be specified, identified, and the like, in various ways. For example, the principal can be a specific principal, such as the holder of a cryptographic key, and the like. The principal also can specified as \u201canyone,\u201d such as \u201canyone in the universe,\u201d and the like. The principal also can be specified as a member of a set of principals, such as \u201cany client that is a member of company ABC,\u201d and the like. Thus, depending on how the principal is specified, one or more credentials may be employed to fully resolve, match, and the like, the identity of the principal. The process to match credentials can include, for example, any suitable technology, traditional, proprietary or new, that can be used to authenticate a principal specified in a license.","The rights specified in the license  can be the granted or allowed \u201coperations,\u201d that is, the manner of use, that the recipient of the grant, such as a principal, and the like, can exercise on the service , such as a Web service, and the like. Such operations can take various forms, such as \u201caccessing the information on a Web service,\u201d \u201cexecuting the software residing in a Web service,\u201d \u201cretrieving some data that has been generated by a Web service,\u201d and the like.","The license  can include one or more conditions associated with a right to access the service . The conditions that can be specified in the license  and that may have to be satisfied in order to exercise the manner of use. For example, the conditions can include temporal conditions, such as a validity period, quantity conditions, such as the number of times the service can be accessed, payment conditions, accounting conditions, such as having the transaction tracked and recorded, and the like. Thus, conditions can include any suitable restrictions, parameters, obligations, states, and the like, that may have to be to be met before, during, after, in order to exercise the right.","The trust domain that can be specified in the license  can relate to the identity of the issuer of the license . For example, when the Web Services Provider  accepts the license  from the Web Services Client , the Web Services Provider  may have to determine if the Web Services Provider  can trust the information included in the license . In an exemplary embodiment, the entity that issued the license  can be identified by the issuer of the license .","The license  can employ, for example, security technologies in order to safeguard the information included in the license . For example, the Web Services Provider  can employ mechanisms to determine if the issuer of the license can be trusted, to determine if the license has not been tampered with, and the like. Thus, digital signatures technologies, and the like, can be employed to ensure the integrity of the license , and encryption technologies, and the like, can be used to keep certain information in the license  confidential.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["101","103","100","127","103","101","121","119","101","119","127","103","101","127","121","127"]},"According to the exemplary embodiments, the Web Services Provider  typically focuses on providing the service . In addition, since authorization and\/or commerce-related tasks can be managed elsewhere, as proposed in the exemplary embodiments, then tasks, such as the managing payments, the maintaining customers databases, and the like, can be eliminated. Advantageously, this allows the Web Services Provider  to more efficiently focus on providing the service .","The Web Services Provider  also can handle the service requests . Mechanisms to handle the service requests  can include, for example, proprietary mechanisms, standard mechanisms, such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Service Description Language (WSDL), other messaging protocols, and the like. However, any suitable mechanisms that can handle and\/or process a service request can be employed.","In addition, the Web Services Provider  can employ a license protocol. Such protocol can include, for example, any suitable open or proprietary licensing mechanisms, a prior agreement to embed the license  in the request , a protocol that determines the need for the license , sending the requester to a site to obtain the license , and the like.","The Web Services Provider , thus, consumes and\/or accepts the license  that has been conveyed by the Web Services Client  for gaining access to the service . After determining that the license  can be trusted, the Web Services Provider  can render the service , for example, based on rights and\/or conditions specified in the license . If the license  is deemed invalid or untrustworthy, the Web Services Provider , for example, may not provide and\/or render the service , and can generate an error message, for example, indicating that access to the service  is denied. Further, the Web Services Provider  may have to satisfy, as a condition of the license , obligations that result from the rendering the service , such as tracking of a state, and the like, and that can be specified in the license .","According to the exemplary embodiments, the Web Services Client  typically is the consumer device of the service , that is, the user device. The Web Services Client  can determine how to access the service , for example, via manual processes, through various technologies, such as Universal Description Discovery and Integration Standard (UDDI) registries, WSDL definitions, and the like. The Web Services Client  can present, convey, transmit, and the like, the license  to the Web Services Provider , for example, at the time of service request  or at a different time, in order to access the service .","In addition, the Web Services Client  can be aware that the license  can be employed in order to access the service . In other words, the Web Services Client  understands that access to the service  can entail the possession of the license , knows where to obtain the license , and the like. Such processes can be accomplished by a license protocol, wherein the request  for service  is followed by a response indicating that certain credentials, for example, such as the license , are employed for gaining access to the service . Such processing can be accomplished, for example, by manual processes, such as via agreements, for example, wherein the Web Services Provider  informs the Web Services Client  that a license is employed for accessing the service , and the like. Thus, Web Services Client  consumes the service , for example, executes code, renders content, and the like, after the Web Services Provider  has accepted the license .","In an exemplary embodiment, the Web Services Provider  also can be a Web Services Client, such as when the Web Services Provider  is a client of another Web service, and the like. Thus, the modes of operation of the exemplary embodiments are not so limited, but rather include other possible permutations of the exemplary. In a further exemplary embodiment, for example, the Web Services Client  might use a third party to present the license  and the presenter of the license  need not be the consumer of the service . In this exemplary embodiment, the Web Services Client  can provide, for example, additional information indicating that the license  can be presented by a third party.","The exemplary embodiments can include a lifecycle for rights, referred to as the \u201crights lifecycle.\u201d For example, the rights lifecycle can begin with the creation of the license , which can be used to associate some rights and\/or conditions with some resource, such as the service . The license  then can be issued to the Web Services Client  who would then use the license  to obtain the service . Eventually, the license  is consumed by the Web Services Provider , for example, during the rendering of the service , completing the rights lifecycle.","In a typical DRM system, the issuing of a licenses typically is controlled by a single and\/or centralized entity. Such entity typically is responsible for the computational tasks of issuing the license, which can include creating the license, validating the license, signing the license, and license recovery. Similarly, in a typical access control system, the authorization assertions are generated by a centralized entity, where security policies are defined and managed. By contrast, in an exemplary embodiment, the generation of the license  can be logically separated from the issuing of the license . Typically, the license  generation includes the computational functions to create the license , such as creating an XrML file, and the like, constructing the elements, storing the license in a database, and the like. The license issuing can be the actual authorization of the rights that are granted in the license , for example, including digitally signing the license  and\/or attesting that the rights conveyed in the license  are authorized by the issuer, and the like.","According to the exemplary embodiments, the License Generation Service , a task, and the like, can provide additional services, such as data backup, license version control, upgrades, license revocation, and the like. Advantageously, such services can add further value, to the valued added by the process of generating the license .","The tasks of generating and issuing the license  can be performed by a single application, and\/or system. However, the separation of authority between license  generation and the license  issuing, advantageously, supports various exemplary business embodiments. For example, this approach allows a business entity the option to outsource the data intensive part of generating the license , and to focus on the authority part of signing and issuing the license . This approach, advantageously, enables a single service that can generate and issue licenses  on behalf of different business entities, as will now be discussed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["107","105","100","127","305","127","305","127","305","127","105","305","127","127","305"]},"In other words, the presence of distribution licenses  establishes a trust model, wherein signatures in the licenses  can be checked, for example, during license  interpretation, up the chain of distribution until a signature, signatures, and the like, are recognized, trusted, and the like. Such a model fits well in the exemplary embodiments, where an owner of a service can grant the right, in the form of a license, to issue licenses to business partners, for example, after some contract or business arrangements.","For example, an exemplary workflow for license generation and issuing, can include business partner  (Business Entity A), and business partner  (Business entity B). In this example, the Business Entity A owns and operates a Web service, and Business Entity B wishes to bundle the Web service as part of a product line of Business Entity B. Accordingly, the Business Entity A issues the distribution license  to the Business Entity B granting the Business Entity B the right to issue the licenses  to the customers, for example, the Web Services Client , of the Business Entity B, for example, to access the Web service provided by the Business Entity A. The Business Entity B issues the licenses  to the customers, for example, by utilizing the License Issuing Service  to generate the license . When the Web Services Client  accesses the Web service provided by the Business Entity A, the license  is presented and the Web service can check the authority of the license  by recognizing that the Business Entity B was granted the right to issue such licenses .","Accordingly, the License Generation Service , for example, can perform the computational process of generating an unsigned license , the distribution license , and\/or the license  based on a request , and including schema validation, and the like. In addition, the License Generation Service  can provide a generalized interface to handle the service requests , for example, requests for licenses ,  and\/or . The License Generation Service  typically does not sign the license , but, according to a further exemplary embodiment, the License Generation Service  can sign the licenses  on behalf of a license  issuer, such as the Business Entity B. Further, the License Generation Service  can provide, for example, data management functions, such as the back-up issued licenses, the re-issue of licenses, reporting functions, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["101","109","100","119","101","101","127","125","123","127","101","101","109"]},"Thus, according to an exemplary embodiment, the license  is validated and then interpreted by the License Interpretation Service . However, according to a further exemplary embodiment, this process can be performed in reverse order, and in which case the interpretation can be performed subject to a later validation step.","The License Interpretation Service  can be employed for the task of interpreting licenses , which is a counterpart of the license generation model of the License Interpretation Service , whereby the Web Services Provider  can offload computational tasks not directly associated with providing the service . The Web Services Provider  operating as such can offload the task of interpreting the license  to the License Interpretation Service , and, advantageously, focus in building the service . During license  interpretation, potentially other services  can be employed, as shown in . For example, the service  can be contacted to authenticate the principal, to retrieve information stored in a remote service, such as a trusted time clock, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["101","109","111","100","111","127","501","503"]},"The interpretation of the license  and\/or the exercise of a right, can involve information that is stored outside of the license . For example, a condition of the license  can be that there is a limit to the number of times a resource provided by the Web Services Provider  can be accessed. Accordingly, during the interpretation of the license , including of such condition, the information regarding the number of times the resource has already been accessed may have to be retrieved in order to accurately and truthfully interpret whether a further access right can be granted.","Such information can be referred to as the state information , and the tracking of the state information  can be referred to as \u201cstate tracking.\u201d The state information  can include various types of information, such as information regarding the status of the license , the amount of time a resource has been used, information regarding payment for the service , information regarding the time of the day the service , the license , and\/or the conditions, were issued, accessed, consumed, presented, and the like. Accordingly, the state information  can include any suitable information regarding the Networked Services Licensing System , and the like.","The state information  can reside and\/or be recorded in persistent storage, such as a database, a memory, a service, and the like, of the Networked Services Licensing System . For example, the state information , such as the number of times the service  has been accessed by the Web Services Client , and the like, can be recorded in some persistent storage of the Networked Services Licensing System . Additionally, as previously described, the interpretation of the license  can result in the obligations  that may have to be fulfilled while allowing the exercise of the rights.","Although the tracking of the state information  can be implemented locally, for example, by the Web Services Provider , this can create an additional burden for the Web Services Provider . In addition, local tracking by the Web Services Provider  may be difficult to implement, because the Web Services Provider  may not be able to accommodate the local storage of the state information . Advantageously, the State Tracking Service  addresses the noted and other problems associated with the tracking of state information by the Web Services Provider . A rights language, as previously described, can be used to specify, for example, where the Tracking Service  is referenced, where the state information  related to the conditions of the rights can be managed, and the like. Thus, the State Tracking Service  can be used for tracking, providing, and the like, the state information  that can be specified in the license .","The Trust Authority Service  can include elements and\/or services that, for example, establish, manage, and the like, trust relations for the various entities of the exemplary embodiments. For example, the Trust Authority Service  can include a Certificate Authority (CA) function for issuing the digital certificates, digital credentials and\/or encryption keys  that can be employed to sign the licenses . Accordingly, the Trust Authority Service , for example, can include a corporation's Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), a service provided by a PKI and\/or security provider, a separate service employed to establish a trust relation between business partners, and the like.","Therefore, according to an exemplary embodiment, the Trust Authority Service  can include the function issuing of digital credentials , for example, used to identify the principals. Exemplary digital credentials  can include, for example, an X509 digital certificate, a Microsoft Passport, a Kerberos authentication token, and the like. The credentials  of the type described above can be used to specify and\/or certify the identity of the holder, but typically convey little additional information about the holder, as most of such additional information typically is provided in a fixed format and\/or is implied. For example, a passport holder typically is simply someone that has been authenticated with the Microsoft passport service.","Accordingly, a need exists to attach additional information about identities, for example, of the principals, in a more expressive and\/or robust manner, for example, to express the role of the principal, a membership association for the principal, and the like. A rights language, as previously described, and according to a further exemplary embodiment, advantageously, can be used define a certificate  that can be used to convey credentials in a more expressive manner, for example, to express the role of the principal, a membership association for a principal, and the like. The credentials  then can be used to associate the holder with additional properties, such as a membership in a business circle, a relationship in a business environment, and the like.","Typically, a Certificate Authority can attest to the authenticity of the information included in a digital certificate. If the information in the digital certificate can be limited in scope, for example, such as a company name, the functions of the Certificate Authority can be well defined. For example, a Certificate Authority may have an established process to check a company's name before issuing a digital certificate. However, when the credentials become more expressive, as described above, it becomes more difficult for a Certificate Authority to attest to the authenticity of the credential information. For example, if a credential includes some membership information, the Certificate Authority would have to establish some additional process to validate such membership.","Accordingly, a generic Certificate Authority typically cannot verify such additional information. Typically, the Certificate Authority, a signer, and the like, of the credential can become the system where the credential is to be used. In this exemplary embodiment, the trust model becomes less open and more monolithic, for example, since the system typically can trust the system. To use credentials with more expressive information in a more open system, for example, within a business network of affiliated services, the Trust Authority Service , advantageously, can be employed to attest to additional information that can be included in the certificates . According to an exemplary embodiment, a Certificate Authority can be configured to fulfill the above-note needs. However, a \u201ctrust broker,\u201d such as the Trust Authority Service  of the exemplary embodiments, advantageously, can be employed to address the noted and other problems with a Certificate Authority being employed to verify the above-noted additional information.","Just like the certificates , the licenses can be signed and\/or verified, for example, through cryptographic techniques. The verification of the license  signature can be used, for example, to attest to the integrity of the license , the authenticity of the signer, such as the license  issuer, and the like. Typically, however, such verification does not establish a \u201crights trust,\u201d for example, to trust that the license  was issued with proper authorization, unless the verifier authorized the issuing of the license . This is a difference between the license  validation, and the license  interpretation, as previously discussed.","For example, Company B issues a license B\u2032 to Company A granting Company A the right to issue licenses A\u2032 on behalf of Company B. Then, Company A issues a license A\u2032 to user X, and user X presents the license A\u2032 to Company B to access a protected resource of Company B. In this exemplary embodiment, since company B issued the license B\u2032, the trust of license A\u2032 can be traced back to license B\u2032, which is trusted by default by company B.","Now, consider the case where Company C also accepts licenses A\u2032 for access to a protected resource of Company C. In order to trust the license A\u2032, Company C may have to either decide to trust licenses from Company A or issue a license C\u2032 to Company A with the right to issue licenses A\u2032 on behalf of Company C. As the network becomes large, every license A\u2032 would have to be accompanied with each of the authorizing licenses B\u2032, C\u2032, and so on.","In the above case, processing of such licenses A\u2032 quickly can become cumbersome and\/or impractical. According to an exemplary embodiment, however, a \u201ctrust broker,\u201d such as the Trust Authority Service  of the exemplary embodiments, advantageously, can as the \u201ctrust broker,\u201d for example, to broker deals between companies, issues licenses under its own signature, and the like. In this exemplary embodiment, during the license  interpretation process, the signature of the Trust Authority Service  can be trusted.","When the Web Services Client  initiates, requests, and the like, the service , the Web Services Client  can transmit the license , for example, as part of a messaging protocol.

However, such a service can create barriers for the service and its customers. For example, the login process, the handling forgotten passwords, the processing of payments, the determining of how much to charge, the determining of what methods to employ, and the like, could become cumbersome.","Therefore, according to a further exemplary embodiment, the user  can configure the License Issuing and Interpretation Service , for example, such that access is granted based on a presentation of a license, for example, manually, automatically, and the like. Conceptually, such a system can include, for example, submitting a license during the initial communication protocol with the License Issuing and Interpretation Service . In an exemplary embodiment, a client of the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  and the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  can follow any suitable license protocol, such as the exemplary license protocol described herein. In this exemplary embodiment, a license, such as an XrML license, and the like, can be presented, for example, when an application communicates with the License Issuing and Interpretation Service . If the license validates, the services of the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  can be rendered.","In the examples of , the authoring application can be configured to include the capability to present a license, for example, when the application requests services from License Issuing and Interpretation Service .  illustrates an exemplary workflow for controlling consumption of a service that can be used in the Networked Services Licensing System  of .

At step , for example, the user  can make a business deal with the Company ABC , for example, based on granting the Company ABC  the right to issue licenses for access to the License Issuing and Interpretation Service , and the like, at step . Then, at step , for example, the licenses for accessing the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  can be issued on-demand, bundled with the authoring applications , and the like, by the Company ABC . Advantageously, in this exemplary embodiment, the user  can bundle access to the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  with a third party application, such as the authoring applications , and the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, the user  and\/or the Company ABC can use a third party service, such the License Generation and Issuing Service , and the like, to generate the licenses of the exemplary embodiments. In addition, signature keys can to be obtained to sign the licenses, for example, through security services, such as the Trust Authority Service , and the like.","According to the exemplary embodiments, the user  can commercialize the Web-based License Issuing and Interpretation Service , advantageously, without adding the resources employed to run and manage an e-commerce system. The user  can determine the conditions for access to the License Issuing and Interpretation Service , for example, by employing the licenses of the exemplary embodiments, such as XrML licenses, and the like. Advantageously, according to the exemplary embodiments, the user  does not have to deal, for example, with managing of the customer base, and the like. The improved License Issuing and Interpretation Service , for example, can entail some improvement to the Web services software, such as the capability to process licenses, but the such changes can be negligible in comparison with the deployment of a full-fledge e-commerce setup.","According to exemplary embodiments, the user  can employ various compensation methods that, advantageously, can be described in a rights language, such as XrML, and the like. For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, a non-tracked, not encoded in a license, out of band, and the like, compensation method can be employed. In this exemplary compensation method, the user  can arrange a flat-fee, per-use, and the like, deal, whereby the user  can issue a distribution license, for example, granting the Company ABC  an unlimited right to issues licenses for accessing the License Issuing and Interpretation Service . The Company ABC  can compensate the user , for example, based on the number of licenses for accessing the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  the Company ABC  bundles with its software, such as the authoring applications , based on a one-time payment, and the like. In this embodiment, the user  would have to trust the data that the Company ABC  collects, for example, with respect to software sales, and the like.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a tracked, encoded in a license, per distributor use, and the like, compensation method can be employed. In this exemplary compensation method, the user  can employ, for example, compensation rules, and the like, that can be encoded in the distribution license the user  issues to the Company ABC . For example, the distribution license can be configured to specify that every time the right to issue a license for accessing the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  is exercised by the Company ABC , conditions may have to be met, such as the making of a payment of a certain amount to an account of the user , that each use of the distribution license is tracked and settled through other means, and the like. Advantageously, with this exemplary embodiment, accurate, trustworthy, and the like, sales information can be made possible, because accurate tracking can be enabled.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a tracked, encoded in a license, per end-user use, and the like, compensation method can be employed. In this exemplary compensation method, the distribution license that the user  issues to the Company ABC  can also specify, for example, that when an end-user license is issued, for example, by the Company ABC , certain rights, conditions, and the like, may have to be specified in the end-user licenses that the Company ABC  issues. For example, the user  can specify in the distribution license that the end-user usage of the licenses issued by the Company ABC  for accessing the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  be tracked, and the like. Accordingly, when the License Issuing and Interpretation Service  of the user  receives, processes, and the like, a license from the user , the license can specify the parameters to track the usage of the license. Advantageously, with this exemplary embodiment, at the end of an accounting period, such data can be gathered, processed, and the like, for payment.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Company ABC  may realize that by bundling additional services, the Company ABC  can increase its competitive advantage in the marketplace. In this exemplary embodiment, for example, the Company ABC  can reach out to other companies, Web services, and the like, such as document translator services, multilingual spell checker services, editorial tool services, and the like. Then, the Company ABC  can make business deals with such other companies and include licenses that can be used to access such additional services.
