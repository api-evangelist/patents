title: Fluid-isolating, self-aligning make-break electrical connection
abstract: An electrical make-break connection for an apparatus having a recoiling portion and a non-recoiling portion may include a non-recoiling assembly fixed to the non-recoiling portion and a recoiling assembly fixed to the recoiling portion. Each of the non-recoiling and recoiling assemblies may include a mounting bracket and an electrical contact assembly disposed in the mounting bracket. Each contact assembly may include one or more electrical conductors. The non-recoiling contact assembly may float in its mounting bracket. Part of the mating surface of the recoiling contact assembly may be more elastic than part of the mating surface of the non-recoiling contact assembly. Elastic deformation of the recoiling mating surface by the non-recoiling mating surface may provide a fluid seal for the make-break connection.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to make-break electrical connections and in particular to make-break electrical connections that may be suitable for recoiling systems.","The problem of electrical system integration on recoiling systems has existed at least since laser ignition for cannons was shown to be a viable alternative to percussion primer caps. Previous means of electrical power and\/or electrical signal transfer have not been satisfactory. In past experiments for the integration of laser ignition systems, a continuous cable design was utilized to transfer electrical power and\/or electrical signals across recoiling and non-recoiling portions of cannons. Standard electro-mechanical make-break connections, such as pin and socket designs, have also been used in the past on weapons systems.","The known electro-mechanical make-break connections were not able to meet all necessary design conditions for fire on non-contained cannons. Some self-aligning designs were unacceptable for use on cannons because the self-aligning pin and socket proved to be flawed under heavy firing conditions. For example, during the recoil alignment, pin vibrations were transferred to the non-recoiling components via the sockets and subsequently damaged the make-break connection. Such damage demonstrated the need for a new way to successfully align the mating halves.","Additionally, the prior art make-break connections were not viable for exterior use because they were not able to be isolated from fluid penetration. Furthermore, make-break connections such as the pin and socket contact design were prone to particle\/fluid collection in exterior settings.","The continuous cable temporary concept used in preliminary testing of breech-mounted laser ignition systems also proved to be unsatisfactory. The cable could not perform over the threshold life-cycle requirements set for the make-break connection and was prone to entanglements on the weapon during fire.","A need exists for a fluid-isolating electrical power\/signal make-break connection for recoil systems.","It is an object of the invention to provide a fluid-isolating electrical power\/signal make-break connection for a recoil system.","One aspect of the invention is an electrical make-break connection for an apparatus having a recoiling portion and a non-recoiling portion. The connection may include a non-recoiling assembly fixed to the non-recoiling portion and a recoiling assembly fixed to the recoiling portion.","The non-recoiling assembly may include a mounting bracket and a contact assembly removably disposed in the mounting bracket. The contact assembly may include a housing with a generally conically-shaped female portion on a mating side thereof, a radially extending flange on an outer surface of the housing, and a tapered slot formed in the generally conically-shaped female portion. The contact assembly may further include at least one wave spring disposed between the mounting bracket and the radially extending flange, and at least one electrical contact pin disposed in the housing and biased outwardly by a spring. The non-recoiling assembly may further include a pair of circumferentially spaced-apart pins fixed to the radially extending flange and partially disposed in the mounting bracket. The pair of pins may have radial and axial clearance in the mounting bracket such that the contact assembly is radially and axially movable with respect to the mounting bracket.","The recoiling assembly may include a mounting bracket and a contact assembly removably disposed in the mounting bracket. The contact assembly may include a housing with a generally conically-shaped male portion on a mating side thereof for engaging and disengaging with the generally conically-shaped female portion of the housing of the non-recoiling assembly, and a boss formed on the generally conically-shaped male portion for mating with the tapered slot. The contact assembly may further include at least one electrical contact disposed in the housing and operable to mate with the at least one electrical contact pin of the non-recoiling assembly.","The contact assembly of the recoiling portion may include a face seal disposed on the mating side thereof. The at least one electrical contact may extend through the face seal. The face seal may be made of an electrically insulating material and the non-recoiling contact assembly housing may be made of an electrically conductive material. The material of the face seal may be more compliant than the material of the non-recoiling contact assembly housing.","The non-recoiling contact assembly housing may include a raised ridge disposed radially inward of the generally conically-shaped female portion. The raised ridge may surround the at least one electrical contact pin. The raised ridge may elastically deform the face seal when the non-recoiling assembly and the recoiling assembly are in a connected state.","The non-recoiling contact assembly may include an electrically insulating pin housing disposed around the at least one electrical contact pin. The pin housing may include a ridge portion that surrounds the at least one electrical contact pin and protrudes outwardly with respect to an adjacent surface of the non-recoiling contact assembly housing. The ridge portion may elastically deform the face seal when the non-recoiling assembly and the recoiling assembly are in a connected state.","The at least one wave spring may bias the non-recoiling contact assembly housing toward the recoiling contact assembly. The mounting bracket of the non-recoiling assembly may be rotatably fixed to the non-recoiling portion of the apparatus. The non-recoiling portion may include a hinge for rotatably mounting the non-recoiling mounting bracket. The non-recoiling assembly may include a spring-loaded plunger for preventing rotation of the non-recoiling mounting bracket.","When the non-recoiling assembly and the recoiling assembly are in a connected state, rotation of the non-recoiling mounting bracket may cause the non-recoiling contact assembly to move away from the recoiling contact assembly. The contact assembly of the recoiling portion may include a contact module adjacent the face seal, a cup adjacent the contact module, and a retaining pin that extends through the cup, the contact module and the face seal.","The non-recoiling assembly may include an electrical contact switch and the recoiling assembly may include a corresponding contact switch surface. The contact switch may close when the non-recoiling assembly and the recoiling assembly are in a connected state.","The non-recoiling portion of the apparatus may include a first isolator bracket having the hinge fixed thereto, a second isolator bracket rigidly fixed to the non-recoiling portion of the apparatus, at least one adjustor in threaded engagement with the first isolator bracket, and at least one fastener that rigidly fixes the first isolator bracket to the second isolator bracket.","A gap between the first isolator bracket and the second isolator bracket, along a recoil axis of the apparatus, may be adjustable by threading the at least one adjustor. Ends of the at least one adjustor may include generally convex spherical surfaces. The connection may further include washers disposed at the ends of the at least one adjustor. The washers may have concave spherical surfaces for mating with the convex spherical surfaces of the at least one adjustor. The at least one adjustor and the washers may include central bores for receiving the at least one fastener that rigidly fixes the first isolator bracket to the second isolator bracket.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["10","12","14","10","10","12","18","14","16","20","18","16"]},"Recoiling portion  is shown in  as spring-supported, however, other means may be used to support recoiling portion . For example, apparatus  may be a cannon and recoiling portion  may be a recoiling portion of the cannon, which may be supported by known methods (other than springs) that are used to support the recoiling portion of a cannon.","A fluid-isolating make-break connection  may allow apparatus  to repeatedly form and reform an electrical circuit. In one embodiment, apparatus  may be a cannon and connection  may allow the cannon to form and reform an electrical circuit as the cannon recoils and then returns to battery. Make-break connection  may allow electrical signal and power transfer between recoiling and non-recoiling portions ,  used in outdoor environments. Make-break connection  may function effectively even though the recoiling and non-recoiling portions ,  may be misaligned. For example, if apparatus  is a cannon, the recoiling and non-recoiling portions ,  may be misaligned when the cannon returns to battery.","Make-break connection  may withstand high-G (acceleration) and high-shock loading. Make-break connection  may not allow fluid penetration into connection . Make-break connection  may be maintained and\/or cleaned while apparatus  is in a non-recoil state (). Make-break connection  may be more reliable than the current primer feed mechanism that may be used with a cannon.","Make-break connection  may enable electrical power and electrical signal transmission across a gun that produces significant recoil (both force and displacement) in a non-compartmentalized environment. So, make-break connection  may enable the operation of cannon systems (particularly those that are not insulated from the elements) having laser ignition. Make-break connection  may enable other recoiling devices (not limited to laser-ignition systems) to operate and\/or communicate.","Several aspects of make-break connection  may be advantageous, compared to prior art make-break connections. One advantageous aspect may be a unique self-alignment mechanism. The self-alignment component of prior make-break connections was based upon a pin and socket design. Known make-break connections could realign upon returning to battery, within a certain amount of bi-axial displacement. The sockets in the known connections were countersunk to allow for the bi-axial displacement and to guide the pins back to their mated position. Testing of the pin and socket design showed that recoil vibrations during firing caused the pins to damage the known make-break connection.","Make-break connection  may be self-aligning and may use a \u201cfloating\u201d housing design. In some embodiments of make-break connection , a non-recoiling housing may be nested within a non-recoiling bracket to allow for bi-axial displacement, for example, about 1\/16 inch bi-axial displacement. A recoiling housing and a non-recoiling housing may include male and female mating conical sections. The male and female conical sections may guide connection  back to its connected position. Connection  may not be susceptible to recoiling forces while firing, in contrast to known connections.","Additionally, connection  may form a fluid barrier. The fluid barrier may isolate make-break connection  from fluid penetration, unlike known connections. Fluid isolation may enable use of make-break connection  in settings such as exterior settings (open to the elements) and for deep-water fording. Make-break connection  may include numerous and redundant seals to provide such a fluid barrier. The seals may include a face seal, O-rings fitted to housing covers and contact modules, and cap seals within the contact modules themselves. The combination of the seals may effectively fluidly isolate the electrical system of make-break connection .","Make-break connection  may prevent fluid\/particle collection. Contact pins of make-break connection  may protrude from the non-recoiling surface. The contact pins may be spring-loaded and may depress back into their cavities upon mating. The protruding and depressible nature of the contact pins may not allow a surface for any fluid and\/or particle(s) to collect while make-break connection  is separated. Unlike current pin and socket designs, electrical contacts of make-break connection  may be spaced apart and\/or encapsulated by an insulator to mitigate cross-short circuits.","Another advantage of make-break connection  may be the ability to be cleaned and maintenanced while the apparatus  is in the non-recoil state (). A pivot-hinge component may be included in make-break connection  to allow non-recoiling assembly  to open, thereby permitting access to the contact modules and any other mating surfaces. Known make-break connections may have to be uninstalled from their mounts to gain such access for maintenance and\/or cleaning.","Make-break connection  may include a modular design so that damage\/wear may be compartmentalized and may not compromise the entire system. Contact assemblies of make-break connection  may be replaced without having to uninstall and\/or replace the entire system. Recoiling and non-recoiling mounting brackets may house the contact assemblies that experience the wear and degradation that come with repeated use. The contact assemblies may be replaced in the event of damage and\/or excessive wear. The contact assemblies may be easily removed from each respective mounting bracket by removing the contact assembly cover. The ease of replacement of the contact assemblies may reduce logistical burden and cost(s) over the life of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIGS. 2D","FIGS. 3A-G","FIGS. 2A-G"],"b":["2","2","2","2","2","20","20"]},"Make-break connection  may include a non-recoiling assembly  fixed to non-recoiling portion  and a recoiling assembly  fixed to recoiling portion  ().
