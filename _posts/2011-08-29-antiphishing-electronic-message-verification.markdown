{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Illustrative System and Data Relationship Implementation","Exemplary Methods of Allowing Verification of an Electronic Message","Exemplary User Interfaces","General"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Ser. No. 61\/424,397, titled \u201cSureForm: Anti-Phishing Email Verification\u201d and filed Dec. 17, 2010, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This disclosure relates generally to computer technology, including hardware and software, that is usable to allow an electronic message to be verified.","Electronic message phishing is a problem. \u201cPhishing\u201d includes unscrupulous individuals or entities attempting to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. For example, electronic messages, such as email or instant messages, purporting to be from known entities are used to lure an unsuspecting recipient into providing sensitive information to what the recipient thinks is a website of a trustworthy organization, but instead is fake website controlled by a corrupt individual that is ready to exploit the sensitive information fraudulently. Phishing has cost individuals and organizations billions of dollars in fraudulent charges and lost business.","Websites, such as \u201cismycreditstolen.com,\u201d controlled by concerned individuals seek to educate the public on this problem. Government agencies are engaged in identifying phishing websites to eradicate using the criminal legal system. Software, such as spam filters and security applications, attempt to identify and\/or block electronic messages having phishing-related content. Websites use verification images and icons to reduce phishing.","Although each of these tools is important and effective in their own way in reducing phishing, more tools are needed. For example, recipients using any or all of these do not have a method by which the recipients can verify that a received electronic message is legitimate. Accordingly, systems and methods are desirable that are usable to verify electronic messages received by recipients.","One aspect is a storage device that includes modules executable by a processor to perform actions. The modules include a code module, a message module, and a verification module. The code module can generate a code for an electronic message. The electronic message includes an instruction for a recipient of the electronic message to navigate independently of the electronic message to a website of an organization to verify the electronic message. The message module can transmit the electronic message that includes the code to the recipient. The verification module can receive the code through a web page, identify an attribute of the electronic message using the code, and provide the attribute that is usable by the recipient to verify the electronic message.","Another aspect is a storage device that includes program code that is executable by a processor to perform actions. The program code can provide content and a verification token for an electronic message, and provide an identification of a recipient to which to transmit the electronic message. The program code can provide a web page that includes a verification form through which a code from the electronic message is receivable. The program code can provide the code to a computing device in response to receiving the code through the verification form. The program code can receive an attribute of the electronic message from the computing device. The program code can provide a second web page that has the attribute displayed on it. The attribute is usable by the recipient to verify the electronic message.","Another aspect is a method in which an electronic message is received that includes (i) content from an organization and (ii) a code. A web browser that is executing on a recipient device is accessed. The web browser is used to navigate to a website of the organization independently of the electronic message. The code is entered into a form displayed on a page of the website. An attribute displayed on the website is received. The attribute is about the electronic message and is usable to verify the electronic message.","These illustrative aspects are mentioned not to limit or define the disclosure, but to provide examples to aid understanding thereof. Additional aspects and embodiments are discussed in the Detailed Description, and further description is provided there. Advantages offered by one or more of the various aspects and embodiments may be further understood by examining this specification or by practicing one or more aspects and embodiments presented.","Certain features of the present disclosure include systems and methods for allowing a recipient of an electronic message to verify the authenticity of the electronic message. A code can be included in the electronic message. The code can represent, or be associated with, an attribute of the electronic message. In some embodiments, the electronic message also includes an instruction for the recipient to navigate independently of the electronic message to a website familiar to the recipient. Navigating independently of the electronic message can include a recipient accessing a website of an organization without selecting a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other similar link in the electronic message. For example, the recipient can open a web browser application, enter a URL known to the recipient and associated with the website of the organization. The website can provide a form or other environment through which the website can receive the code from the recipient.","The website can provide the code to a verification module that can identify the attribute of the electronic message using the code. In some embodiments, the code may be an encrypted code that the verification module decrypts. The attribute can be returned to the recipient by a web page or other suitable mechanism. The attribute is usable by the recipient to verify that the electronic message is legitimate, i.e. that the electronic message is validly associated with the organization and can be trusted by the recipient as an electronic message that does not include phishing mechanisms.","Any type of attribute with which the recipient can verify the electronic message can be used. Examples of attributes include the identity of the organization that sent the electronic message or otherwise was the source of the content included in the electronic message, the address or other contact information of the recipient, the date and\/or time that the electronic message was sent to the recipient, the subject of the electronic message, and the content of the electronic message.","The code may be a randomly generated code that is associated by a stored relationship with one or more attributes of the electronic message. In other embodiments, the code is an encrypted or decrypted code that represents one or more attributes of the electronic message. For example, the code may represent a mailing identifier, a job identifier, and a recipient identifier. The mailing identifier can identify content of the electronic message. The job identifier can identify the batch of electronic mailings or the time and date of electronic mailings that included the electronic message. The recipient identifier can identify the recipient of the electronic message or contact information, such as email address, of the recipient.","Certain embodiments provide a simple, effective way for electronic message recipients to verify the authenticity of received messages. The code can be dynamically generated and included anywhere in an electronic message using personalization fields. Organizations, such as marketers, can educate recipients to look for the code and provide information on the process of using the code to verify the authenticity of a given electronic message. Website links or URLs, a common way phishing is implemented, to access a web page in which to verify the code can be avoided by instructing recipients to independently navigate to the website of the organization. The code may be uniquely generated and encrypted to prevent those that seek to \u201cphish\u201d from duplicating the code. The process can be structured to not impact electronic message delivery and can be accessed on demand by the recipient.","These illustrative examples are given to introduce the reader to the general subject matter discussed here and are not intended to limit the scope of any claim. The following sections describe various additional embodiments and examples with reference to the drawings in which like numerals indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},"The system includes a computing device , a recipient device , and an organization device  that communicate over a network .

The verification interface  is executable by the processor  to cause the organization device  to provide content for an electronic message to the computing device , provide the code from the recipient to the computing device , and receive one or more attributes for the electronic message from the computing device .","In some embodiments, the computing device  also includes the website server application  and the verification interface , and the organization device  is not needed or used. In other embodiments, the organization device  includes the code module , message module , and verification module , and the computing device  is not used or needed.","Data relationships can be used to allow one or more attributes of an electronic message to be identified using the code.  depicts examples of data relationships that can be stored in storage device  or in a separate storage device, such as a database, that is communicatively coupled to the computing device . The data relationships include three tables of data that can be associated with each other through a mailing identifier (shown in the tables as \u201cMailing_id\u201d). The mailing identifier can be decrypted from a code or can be associated with a randomly generated code. The tables include a mailing table, a mailing send history table, and a deliverability table. The mailing table includes the mailing identifier (Mailing_id), a mailing name (Mailing_name), a list identifier (List_id), and a code indicator (Has_sure_from).","A mailing name may be a name associated with a particular mailing and is usable to identify the source of the content of messages in the mailing. The list identifier may be usable to identify content for the messages or to identify a list of recipients to which to send the content. The code indicator can indicate whether messages in the mailing included a code that is useable to verify the message. For example, a \u201c1\u201d in the code indicator field can indicate that a code was present in the messages, while a \u201c0\u201d in the code indicator field can indicate that a code was not present in the messages. The mailing name, the list identifier, and the code indicator can be associated with the mailing identifier in the mailing table.","The mailing send history table can include the mailing identifier (Mailing_id) and a report identifier (Report_id), a send date (Sent_ts), and a number of messages sent (Num_sent), all associated with the mailing identifier. The report identifier can be associated with reporting date for the mailing, which is usable to run audit reports and reports on whether one or more codes were used to verify messages, including the number of times codes were used successfully and\/or unsuccessfully to verify messages. The send date identifies the date on which a mailing was transmitted.","In addition to the mailing identifier, the mailing send history table and the deliverability table can be associated with the report identifier. The deliverability table includes the mailing identifier (Mailing_id), the report identifier (Report_id), a job identifier (Job_id), the send date (Sent_ts), a recipient identifier (Recipient_id), and emails of the recipients.

Other configurations and embodiments may of course be utilized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},"In block , the code module  generates a code and includes the code in an electronic message. A different code can be generated for each recipient. In some embodiments, the computing device  can receive message content in a template or other suitable format that the computing device  can use to implement an electronic message distribution program by which electronic messages with similar content (e.g. an advertisement or an offer) are personalized by recipient and transmitted. The template can include tokens, fields, or other indicators at which the computing device  includes personalized information for the recipient. The template can include a token indicating that a code for the recipient is to be included in the electronic message. In response, the code module  can generate the code and include in the electronic message at the location specified by the token.","The code can be generated based on a job identifier, mailing identifier, and\/or recipient identifier that is associated with the message. In other embodiments, the code is randomly generated and is associated with attributes for the message. The relationship between the attributes of the message and the code can be stored. In either case, the code can be encrypted by the code module . The code can be encrypted using any suitable encryption process. An example of a suitable encryption process is a process conforming to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).","In block , the message module  transmits the electronic message with the code and an instruction to the recipient. The electronic message may be transmitted as an email, an instant message, a social media message, or via other type of electronic communication method. The instruction may be for the recipient to navigate independently of the electronic message to a website associated with the organization that provided the content in the electronic message and use the code included in the electronic message to verify the electronic message. Although the electronic message may include a URL or link to part of the website of the organization, the instruction can encourage the recipient to verify the electronic message without using the URL or link included in the electronic message.","In block , the verification module  receives the code and identifies one or more attributes of the electronic message using the code. In some embodiments, the verification module  receives the code from the verification interface  of the organization device  after the recipient navigates to the website for the organization and provides the code to the website. In other embodiments, the verification module  receives the code from the recipient through a web page hosted by the computing device . The verification module  can identify an attribute of the electronic message by comparing the code to a stored relationship between the code and the attribute(s) or by decrypting the code to identify the job identifier, mailing identifier, and\/or recipient identifier and determine the attribute(s) based on those identifiers.","In block , the verification module  can respond to receiving the code by providing the attribute(s) that is usable by the recipient to verify the electronic message.
