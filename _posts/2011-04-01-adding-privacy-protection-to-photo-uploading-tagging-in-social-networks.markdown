{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","Embodiments of the invention relate generally to online photograph sharing, and more specifically, privacy options for photograph uploads and tagging of an individual.","2. Prior Art","The rise of social networks has led to more and more personal information being published online. In one case, photographs are uploaded by users for sharing with friends within the social network. The photograph can be tagged with a friend's name, and, in turn, viewed by other users of the social network.","Unfortunately, a photograph can be uploaded and tagged without authorization from subjects of the photograph. This can cause embarrassing or otherwise inappropriate pictures to be displayed. For example, a picture of a business executive in a swimming suit may not be appropriate for friends of the executive that are clients. In some cases, the tagged photograph is tagged and viewed by friends before the subject has time to request that it be removed. Sometimes, the photograph cannot be removed.","In the light of the foregoing discussion, there is a need for a consent-based technique for ensuring privacy for online photographs.","The above-mentioned needs are met by a method, computer program product and system for consent-based sharing of online photographs.","In one embodiment, an individual is identified in a photograph. A portion of the photograph is temporarily blurred to prevent the individual from being recognized. Once consent is received for the tag, the blur is removed. However, if consent is not received, the blur remains.","In another embodiment, a facial detection technique automatically identifies and blurs faces of, for example, friends in a social network until consent is received. Optionally, training photographs can be uploaded.","Advantageously, a user's privacy can be maintained until, and only if, consent is given.","The features and advantages described in this summary and in the following detailed description are not all-inclusive, and particularly, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter, resort to the claims being necessary to determine such inventive subject matter.","The above-mentioned needs are met by a method, computer program product and system for consent-based sharing of online photographs. For example, individuals tagged in online photographs can be blurred until permission is obtained for publication. The following detailed description is intended to provide example implementations to one of ordinary skill in the art, and is not intended to limit the invention to the explicit disclosure, as one or ordinary skill in the art will understand that variations can be substituted that are within the scope of the invention as described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"At step , a photograph is uploaded to an online community. The online community can be of any type. Social networks such as Facebook, Yahoo! Pulse, Twitter or LinkedIn connect friends or contacts online for sharing personal and business information. For example, an individual can become friends with high school classmates and follow daily occurrences through status posts. In other embodiments, photographs are uploaded via other online or sharing such as instant messenger, e-mail, blogs, web pages, or the like.","The photograph comprises a portrait of individuals recognizable by face or otherwise. In some embodiments, the photograph can also be a cartoon character, a pet, a building or any other type of identifiable object. Various formats can be used such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, or other compressed or uncompressed formats, or any other suitable format. Many different types of photographs are uploaded. A classmate may upload a picture from 10 years ago at a pep rally, or a picture from yesterday at a 10-year class reunion.","The photograph can be uploaded using various techniques. For example, a web interface can allow a user to identify locally-stored or online photographs. A user may be asked whether they have permission to upload and publish.","At step , the privacy of individuals in the online photographs is protected, as described below with respect to . In one embodiment, individuals in the photograph are blurred until permission is obtained. The individuals can be explicitly identified by tagging or implicitly identified by facial detection techniques.","At step , an online photograph is published in accordance with permissions granted. In one embodiment, if permissions have yet to be obtained, or if permission has been denied, the photograph is published with one or more individuals blurred. If all permissions have been obtained, the photograph appears without blurring. In one embodiment, the photograph is published, for example, in a news feed, gallery, or a profile page, so that other friends or the public can view or download. The photograph may be listed in search engines such as Yahoo! Image Search of Google Images. As a result, when an individual's name is queried, the photograph may be listed in the search results. Within a social network, the photograph can have permissions allowing various levels of access (e.g., friends, friends of friends, all members, etc.). In some embodiments, are automatically displayed in a news feed of friends.","In an alternative embodiment, individuals in an online video are identified and blurred. When permission is received, the individuals are unblurred.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"120"},"At step  tags identifying individuals in online photographs are received. Generally, a tag identifies an individual or object in a photograph. A user can be queried about tagging when uploading a picture, or a user can select a tag function for an existing one. When tagging, a user uses a cursor or other selector to select a portion of a picture (e.g., an individual pixel or a boxed area) and associates a friend, contact, or name with the selection. Subsequently, when the picture is viewed, a text box showing a name is displayed near the tag location.","At step , portions of the photograph corresponding to tagged individuals are blurred. The portion can be, for example, a single pixel, a square, a rectangle, an elliptical or any other selected area. In one embodiment, the selected portion is blurred. In another embodiment, an entire face or body associated with a tag are blurred.","Blurring, in general, is an image processing technique that reduces sharpness of an image. A blurred image can be similar to viewing the image through a translucent screen. In one example, a Guassian blur function is used. Other image distortion techniques that prevent an individual from being identified, such as occlusions, can be used as well.","In step , if permission to publish is received, a blurred portion of the photograph is unblurred in step . Permission can be obtained, for example, by sending a message to a tagged individual. The message can include a copy of the picture along with a YES button and a NO button to input a decision. The message can be sent to an inbox of a social network or to an associated e-mail account.","If permission is not received, the blurred portion remains blurred in one embodiment. In another embodiment, the blur expires if an express decision is not received. Many other variations can be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"120"},"The method B can be similar to the method A, except that individuals in a photograph are not explicitly tagged. Instead, in step , faces are implicitly identified using facial recognition. In one embodiment, landmarks or nodal points common to human faces are detected (e.g., eye pupils). Using this technique, individuals can be automatically blurred in photographs, even if they are not tagged, as described above.","In one embodiment, photographs of individuals can be uploaded to a training database for facial recognition. In another embodiment, training photographs can be taken from profile pictures of friends or other tags.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"The system  includes a computing device  and a social network server , coupled in communication through a network  (e.g., the Internet, a LAN, a WAN, a cellular network or any combination).","The computing device  can be, for example, a PC, a stationary computing device, a laptop or notebook computer, a tablet computer, a smart phone or PDA, a smart appliance, a video gaming console, an Internet television, a set-top box, or any other suitable processor-based device that can send view advertisements.
