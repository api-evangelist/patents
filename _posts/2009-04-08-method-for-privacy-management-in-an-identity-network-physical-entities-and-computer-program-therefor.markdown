title: Method for privacy management in an identity network, physical entities and computer program therefor
abstract: A controller () is used for privacy management in an identity network () for a principal (). An identity network () is a computer network including at least an identity provider (), a discovery service provider (), and a service provider () with which the principal () can make transactions. A principal () is a system entity whose identity can be authenticated. An identity resource () is either data related to an identity or group of identities, or a service associated with an identity or group of identities. The controller () queries a discovery service provider to obtain information regarding available identity resources (), it receives back addressing information for addressing attributes of the identity resources (), and it then interacts, based on the addressing information, with a service provider () to create, read, modify or delete a privacy attribute governing the use of an identity resource ().

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to privacy management in an identity network. In particular, the invention relates to methods for carrying out privacy management in an identity network, to physical entities configured therefor, and to computer programs comprising instructions configured, when executed on a computer, to cause the computer to carry out the above-mentioned method. The invention may notably be used for managing the identity, and properties associated therewith, of users or systems using services offered in a computer network.","In telecommunications and computer networks, an identity network includes a plurality of service providers and an identity provider, forming what is sometimes called a circle of trust. A principal, which is a more generic term for a user, is a system entity whose identity can be authenticated. A principal may for instance be an individual user, a group of individuals, an organisational entity such as a corporation, or a network component. The identity provider is a system entity configured to manage the identity information on behalf of the principals. The identity provider can provide assertions of principal authentication to the service providers. Thus, when a principal wishes for instance to access the services offered by a service provider, the service provider can refer to the identity provider of the identity network for authentication of the principal prior to enabling the service offered by the service provider to be used by said principal.","For instance, the Liberty Alliance (http:\/\/www.projectliberty.org\/ or Liberty Alliance Project c\/o IEEE-ISTD, Piscataway, N.J., United States) has released a set of specifications disclosing frameworks for providing services in telecommunications and computer networks based on identity management. One of these specifications is the Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF) which defines methods for single sign-on authentication for a principal across a plurality of service providers. In other words, such framework enables the access by users to services provided across a computer network, such as the Internet, by authenticating once before accessing the services provided on multiple web sites.","A further specification or framework released by the Liberty Alliance is the Liberty Identity Web-Services Framework specification set or ID-WSF for short. In addition to the single sign-on services of the ID-FF, the ID-WSF enables some service providers to store attributes of a principal, wherein the attributes relate to the identity of the principal, and further enables retrieving some of these attributes by other service providers, also called consumers or web-service consumers (WSC).","In an identity network complying with the ID-WSF specification, when a service provider has some information or resources associated with a principal, the information or resources can potentially be shared with other service providers, subject to the principal's consent. In this exemplary identity network implementation, a discovery service may be used by service providers to register the identity resources associated with a principal so that other service providers, or WSCs, can discover and use them.","In this context, a principal should be able to control which resource stored on or provided by a service provider and associated with the principal can or cannot be shared or used by other service providers. Such control task is generally referred to, from a principal's perspective, as privacy management. In other words, the privacy is the proper handling of principal's information, consistent with the preference of the principal. Service providers are responsible for meeting the principal's privacy settings and preferences.","It is desirable to provide methods, physical entities and computer programs to enable users, or principals, to conveniently manage their privacy settings within an identity network, with in mind the need to reduce the operational burden on the principals.","To meet or to at least partially meet these objectives, controllers, methods and computer programs are defined in the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.","In one embodiment, a controller is used for privacy management in an identity network for at least one principal. In this context, an identity network is a computer network including at least an identity provider, a discovery service provider, and a service provider with which the principal can make transactions. A principal is a system entity whose identity can be authenticated. An identity resource is either data related to an identity or group of identities, or a service associated with an identity or group of identities. The controller is configured for querying a discovery service provider of the identity network to obtain information regarding the identity resources available in the identity network and associated with the principal's identity. The controller is further configured for receiving, from the discovery service provider, information, here referred to as addressing information, usable for addressing attributes of the identity resources available in the identity network and associated with the principal's identity. Yet further, the controller is configured for interacting, based on the addressing information, with a service provider to create, read, modify or delete an attribute governing the use of an identity resource available in the identity network and associated with the principal's identity. The attribute is here referred to as privacy attribute.","In this context, the controller may be a server computer or may be hosted on a server computer. An identity provider is a role assigned to a system entity within the identity network. The identity provider stores and manages identity information on behalf of principals and provides assertions to authenticate principals when requested to do so by other providers, such as service providers. A system entity is an element of a computer system or network system, which can be active in the sense that computer-implemented processes (such as the processes proper to a role) can be operated on the element. An identity, and more specifically a principal's identity, is one of the characteristics of the principal which identifies it or which is mapped in some way to the principal to identify it.","A discovery service provider is a role assigned to a system entity within an identity network. The discovery service provider has capabilities to identify, i.e. discover, services, or more generally identity resources, available on or from service providers in the identity network. A service may for instance be discoverable because it has been assigned a service type uniform resource identifier (URI). The discovery service provider is used to identify resources, including both services and data associated with the principal's identity.","A service provider is a role assigned to a system entity which typically involves providing services in relation to or for a principal. The provision of a service is a technical and economical activity which may for instance result in the ownership of physical goods through a sale, modification of the technical characteristics of a computer configuration, etc. The service may be a web service.","To authenticate is the process of confirming the asserted identity of a system entity, such as a principal, with a specified, or understood, level of confidence. An attribute governing the use of an identity resource is an attribute specifying the permission(s) associated with the identity resource, i.e. the privilege(s) granted to system entities with respect to operations that may be performed on, or in relation to, the identity resource.","The controller provides a point of control to centrally manage the privacy settings associated with the identity resources available in the identity network and associated with a principal. Therefore, users, or more general principals, wanting to know which information is stored on which system entity of the identity network need not go through every single system entity or service provider within the identity network. Instead, a view of their identity resources can be obtained, i.e. retrieved or read, and controlled thanks to the controller. Namely, the controller is configured to query a discovery service provider of the identity network to collect addressing information usable for addressing the identity resources associated with the principals. Thereafter, interactions can take place, based on the addressing information, i.e. using the addressing information, in order to manage the privacy attributes or settings of the identity resources associated with the principal within the identity network.","The following may assist in fully understanding the problems addressed and solved by the invention. Based, for instance, on the Liberty Identity Governance Framework (IGF) (see Liberty Alliance Project, , Version 1.0, 2007, available from http:\/\/www.projectliberty.org, under the Filename: overview-id-governance-framework-v1.0.pdf), a solution to manage privacy policies in relation to identity resources associated with a principal could be to provide a custodian of certain attributes in order to offer a web portal allowing users of the attributes to establish some privacy preferences and thus allowing the development of the privacy policies. However, this would require the users to visit each of the service providers to enter their privacy preferences associated with the identity resources hosted on the service providers. This would also require the user to adapt to each of these distinct web portals to manage the attributes scattered within the network. Moreover, no guarantee could be offered that some attributes that are associated with some identity resources and that a user is not aware of could be successfully identified and controlled.","In the invention, the controller provides a centralized point of control to obtain a consistent view of the identity resources available in an identity network and associated with a principal. A control point for distributed privacy management in an identity network is thus provided to the users or, more generally, principals.","The invention is not limited to its application to a Liberty Alliance framework. It may be used and applied in other identity networks such as computer-implemented social networks, or identity networks based on other identity frameworks such as, but not limited to, the so-called OpenID or OpenSocial frameworks. OpenID is a framework for user-centric identity on the Internet and is maintained by the Openld Foundation, based in San Ramon, United States (see also http:\/\/openid.net\/). OpenSocial provides a set of application programming interfaces (API) to help web-based social networking applications to share their social data and is maintained by the OpenSocial Foundation based in San Francisco, U.S. (see also http:\/\/www.opensocial.org\/).","In one embodiment, the controller is configured to query the discovery service provider, to receive the addressing information and to interact with the service provider to manage the privacy attributes associated with a principal, without receiving a specific request from the principal instructing it to do so. The rules for privacy management are in this embodiment stored on the controller either as a result of a previous communication with the principal for defining these criteria based on its preferences, or as a result of a default configuration in the controller. This enables privacy management to be carried out without intervention or with less intervention of the principal.","In one embodiment, the controller is further configured for, before querying, receiving, from the principal, a request to retrieve information regarding the identity resources available in the identity network and associated with the principal's identity. This enables the controller, in response to an express request of the principal, to collect the addressing information and manage the privacy attributes at the request of and on behalf of the principal.","In one embodiment, the controller is further configured for obtaining, from at least one service provider of the identity network, information, here referred to as usage information, regarding the usage of the identity resources associated with the principal's identity in at least one service provider.","This embodiment enables principals to obtain a dynamic view of the identity resources associated with their identity. The obtainable view is dynamic in the sense that the principals can obtain information on how and when, that is when during at least a period of time, the identity resources have been used by which service providers. The principals can thus collect information about the usage of the identity resources as far as the usage concerns them. The principals may then decide whether to take action to modify their privacy settings as a result of and\/or based on this knowledge. The usage history retrieval may be performed upon receiving by the controller an express request from a principal. Alternatively, the controller may be configured in advance, either based on an initial interaction with a principal or based on default settings, to retrieve the usage history of the identity resources that are within the identity network and that are associated with the principal.","The usage information may notably include information about one or more of the type of an identity resource, the attribute values of an identity resource, timestamps of access to the identity resources, and identifiers of service providers which access, have accessed, use, or have used the identity resource, or subscribe or have subscribed to the identity resource.","The invention also relates to a method carried out by a controller for privacy management in an identity network for at least one principal. The method includes the step of querying a discovery service provider of the identity network to obtain information regarding the identity resources available in the identity network and associated with the principal's identity. The method further includes the step of receiving, from the discovery service provider, information, here referred to as addressing information, usable for addressing attributes of the identity resources available in the identity network and associated with the principal's identity. The method further includes the step of interacting, based on the addressing information, with a service provider to create, read, modify or delete an attribute governing the use of an identity resource available in the identity network and associated with the principal's identity, the attribute being here referred to as privacy attribute.","The invention also relates to a computer program including instructions configured, when executed on a computer or the above-described controller, to cause the computer or the controller respectively to carry out the above-described method. The invention also relates to a computer program product or computer-readable medium including such a computer program.","The present invention shall now be described in conjunction with specific embodiments. It may be noted that these specific embodiments serve to provide the skilled person with a better understanding, but are not intended to in any way restrict the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","12","12"]},"An identity network , or circle of trust, includes a controller , an identity provider , a discovery service (DS) provider , and a service provider . Each element of the identity network  may form a network node in the form of a server computer. As mentioned above, the identity provider  is configured to store and manage identity information on behalf of principals  and provides assertions to authenticate principals  when requested to do so by other providers, such as service providers . The DS provider  is capable of identifying, i.e. discovering, the identity resources available on or from service providers  in the identity network . The service provider  is in charge of providing services in relation to or for a principal . The double-headed arrow between the principal  and the service provider  illustrates that transactions can be made between the principal  and the service provider .","Although only one service provider  is shown in , more than one service provider  may be provided in the identity network . The service providers  may for instance be web service providers. Likewise, although only one principal  is illustrated as interacting with a service provider  of the identity network , more than one principal  may interact with the service provider  of the identity network .","The DS provider  may for instance be hosted in a network node managed by a telecom operator. In one embodiment, the DS provider  is collocated with the identity provider .","The controller  is configured for querying s the DS provider  to obtain information on the identity resources available in the identity network  and associated with the principal's identity. In response, the DS provider  sends s, to the controller , addressing information usable for addressing attributes of the identity resources available in the identity network  and associated with the principal's identity. Then, the controller  can interact s, using the addressing information, with a service provider  to create, read, modify or delete a privacy attribute governing the use of an identity resource available in the identity network  and associated with the principal's identity.","Although not shown in , the following exchanges or interactions (i) to (iv) may also take place in the identity network :\n\n","In one embodiment, the controller  acts as a Liberty-compliant service provider , such as a web service provider (WSP) within the identity network , or circle of trust (CoT) . Thus, the controller  needs to be authenticated, on behalf of the principal , against the CoT  in order to gain access to the CoT entities. The authentication may be carried out for instance following any one of the methods described in Liberty ID-FF (Web redirection, SOAP profile, etc) or Liberty ID-WSF (Authentication Service or Single Sign On service). Other authentication methods may also be used. As a result, the controller  obtains an endpoint reference (EPR) to the DS provider  and credentials to access it. This process is sometimes referred to as DS bootstrap.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","12","2","16","10","10","4","16","10","6","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","12","12","12","12","2","4","6","12","12","2","16","12","12","4","16","12","12","12","6","18","12"],"i":["a","b ","c ","a ","a ","b ","b ","b ","c ","c ","c.

The information may then be made available, presented or sent by the controller  for use by the principal .","This provides the end users with a user-friendly solution for managing privacy aspects of their identity-related information scattered along a plurality of network entities, and, at the same time, it minimizes implementation impacts.

Then, the controller  queries s the DS provider  for all the identity resources associated with the principal  in the CoT  (1 disco:Query\u201d). This may notably be achieved using an empty query request message. As stated in Hodges, J. and Cahill, C. (Eds.), -, Version 2.0, Liberty Alliance Project, July 2006, filename: liberty-idwsf-disco-svc-v2.0.pdf, available through the URL http:\/\/www.projectliberty.org\/, here referred to as [LibertyDisco], \u201c-.\u201d (page 32, section \u201c3.3.2\u201d).","After receiving the request, the DS provider  looks up internally for the location of identity resources associated with the principal's identity (2 Lookup resources\u201d). As a result, the DS provider  sends back s to the controller  working as WSP a response that includes the location (this is a specific embodiment of the addressing information) of the attributes of the identity resource available (EPR) and the credentials to access it (3 disco:QueryResponse\u201d). The controller  makes this information available s(or presents the information, or in one embodiment sends the information) to the principal (4 Available identity information\u201d). Steps \u201c1 disco:Query\u201d, \u201c2 Lookup resources\u201d and \u201c3 disco:QueryResponse\u201d may therefore be built upon the mechanisms described in [LibertyDisco].","Then, the principal  may request further information, such as the current value of a specific attribute of an identity resource. Therefore, the principal  specifies that identity resource and instructs sthe controller  to retrieve the value associated with this identity resource (5 Get details on identity resource\u201d). The controller , working as a WSC, queries s the WSP that stores the selected identity resource using the EPR and the credentials retrieved in the previous step (6 dst:Query\u201d). To do so, the Query operation of the Liberty Data Service Template (DST) protocol described in Kellom\u00e4ki, S. and Kainulainen, J, (Eds.), Liberty ID-WSF Data Services Template, Version 2.1, Liberty Alliance Project, July 2006, filename: liberty-idwsf-dst-v2.1.pdf, available through the URL http:\/\/www.projectliberty.org\/, here referred to as [LibertyDST], may be used. [LibertyDST] is the Liberty protocol that allows WSCs to access WSPs in order to query, update or cancel principal's data on behalf of a principal .","The WSP enforces privacy policies when the request arrives and, if permitted by the policies, releases the requested information. In other words, the WSP enforces privacy policies before they release any identity resource (7 Privacy enforcement & resource value release\u201d). The response is sent back to the controller  following DST protocols (\u201c8 dst:QueryResponse\u201d). Finally, the controller  makes the information available (or presents the information, or in one embodiment sends the information) to the principal  (\u201c9 Details on identity resource\u201d).","The principal  may then carry out further management operations (\u201c10 Management on identity resource\u201d) on the identity resource such as updating (\u201c11a dst:Update\u201d) or cancelling (\u201c11b dst:Delete\u201d) the information. These operations may therefore be built upon the mechanisms described in [LibertyDST].","Since the above operations may be based on the mechanisms described in [LibertyDisco] and [LibertyDST], some embodiments of the invention may be implemented based on existing protocols and are therefore simple to carry out.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"],"b":["7","6","7","18","10","18","18","18","20","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3","FIG. 8"],"b":["12","12","12","7"],"i":"g "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIGS. 8 and 9"],"b":"20"},"It is assumed here that the controller  has obtained addressing information usable for addressing attributes of the identity resources associated with a principal  in an identity network , or CoT . Now, the principal  wants to know the usage history of one of the identity resources associated with said principal  and, for that purpose, it specifies the identity resource and sends this information to the controller  (, \u201c0 Get history of use\u201d). The controller  then retrieves s the requested information (\u201c1 Retrieve history of use\u201d), which is then made available, or presented or in one embodiment sent, to the principal  (\u201c2 Details on history of use\u201d). The information made available, presented or sent, may include details about the identity resource type and value, timestamps of access and WSCs that have used the identity resource in the past. Further information may be presented if available such as the principal  on behalf of which the WSC  has used the identity resource (if any), the privacy promises made by the WSC  or conditions imposed by the WSP  when releasing said information.","The controller  may retrieve the usage history (, step ) by different means (which will also be referred as approaches later on), for instance:\n\n","The approaches (A), (B) and (C) may be further discussed as follows.","Approach (C) is advantageous in that it may be initiated by the controller  (pull mode). This means that the information is retrieved whenever the controller  wants to, and is limited to what the controller  asks for. Thus, no scalability or performance problems arise. However, this approach requires, when applied to the Liberty Alliance framework, adaption of said framework.","Approach (B) is advantageous in that, when applied to the Liberty Alliance framework, it does not require adaption of the framework, In other words, it is already Liberty compliant. Regarding scalability and performance, this approach needs one notification to be sent per identity resource and per principal  every time a WSP  is accessed.","Approach (A) has the same advantages as approach (B) regarding application to the Liberty Alliance framework and compliance therewith. In addition, it also improves performance, because it allows reducing the amount of messages generated by setting thresholds. For example, notifications may be sent in a per access rule i.e. WSP sends one single account with information about all the identity information accessed, thus reducing the amount of messages. On the controller side, no scalability or performance problems arise, since the controller  may just receive messages related to the principal  on the behalf of which it works.","From a functional point of view, approach (C) is advantageous over the other two approaches since approach (C) is capable of providing a pull mode. As described above, approach (C) needs however, when applied to the Liberty Alliance framework, adaptation, adaptation of said framework. Approach (C) is therefore here further described.","Approach (C) consists in using Liberty DST Extension, disclosed in [LibertyDST], to retrieve identity resources usage history, as explained above.","It is here assumed that, whenever some attributes of an identity resource associated with a principal  is accessed by a WSC , the WSP  that stores, or provides access to, the identity resource logs the transaction. This log information may be used, for example, for future audits.  illustrates a WSC  requesting to use an identity resource to a WSP . The log operation (, \u201c2b Log transaction\u201d) is also illustrated. During the log operation or log transaction, the WSP  logs the transaction, including which information regarding the identity resource has been released, to which principal  this information relates, which is the requested party (both the WSC  and the principal  on behalf of which the WSC  is working), and any other relevant information for future audit.","The information to be logged may notably include:","(i) a UserID, in order to know to which principal  the information which is used relates. This is the identifier or alias of the principal  in the WSP .","(ii) an Information_type, in order to know which identity information has been accessed, i.e. which attributes of the identity resource has been used.","(iii) a WSC, in order to know which WSC has requested the information.","(iv) other information, such as, for example, the time of access. Other pieces of information that may be useful to log include the intended use of the information retrieved, whether the WSC  intends to share the information with third parties, and the promises that the WSC  makes about the future use of the requested information. In addition, the WSP  may also log the principal  on behalf of which (if any) the WSC  is requesting the identity information. This information is particularly relevant in the context of computer-implemented social network applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"18"},"As illustrated in , the logged information is an extension of the information that a Liberty profile contains, which logs add relevant information about the information consumption. Therefore, the same mechanism may be used to access both of them, namely the mechanism described in [LibertyDST]. This mechanism allows for creating, querying, modifying and deleting principals' identity information from a WSP . [LibertyDST] may be extended with a new operation: trace. This operation allows a WSC  (the controller  working as a WSC in our case) to retrieve usage information about some principal's identity resources, as will be explained with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"The impact on existing Liberty entities may be explained as follows. It depends on the selected approach:\n\n","Further embodiments of the step of interacting s, based on the addressing information, with a service provider  to create, read, modify or delete a privacy attribute will now be described in more details. This step s relates the management of the privacy settings.","It is assumed at this point that the controller  has retrieved addressing information for addressing attributes of the identity resources associated with a principal  in an identity network  or CoT . Now the principal  wants to set privacy preferences to govern the use and release of the identity resources associated with said principal  and stored in a WSP . The controller  shows different options to the principal  and allows the principal  to configure different parameters such as under which conditions the identity information can be released. When done, the controller  sets the resulting privacy policy in the appropriate WSP  that will enforce it.  illustrates an overview of the flows involved, in one embodiment. In other words,  illustrates how the principal  sets privacy preferences to govern the use and release of his identity information.","Principals  should be able to set their preferences regarding the use of the identity resources associated with them and distributed in a CoT .","The variables that participate in the privacy preference setting may include the requestor, the resource, the operation, the permission and the principal.","The principal  need not be explicitly stated since it is the user of the controller . The requestor may be any WSC  from the CoT . This information may be extended to the principal  on behalf of which the WSC  is requesting the identity information.","The resource is the identifier of the identity resource's attribute to be protected. The operation's values may be the ones that any WSC can request. For example, in the case of the Liberty Alliance framework, the operation's values may be the ones defined in DST protocol i.e. query, create, delete, modify and subscribe. If the approach to gather principals' identity information history based on extending the DST protocol with a trace operation (see above-discussed approach (C)) is used, the privacy policy may include the trace value for the operation variable. The solution may be extended to new operations as needed.","The permission may be set to grant, deny or askMe. The so-called askMe permission may be used when the user prefers to decide on a per invocation basis. This may be implemented by means of Liberty Interaction Service, described in Aarts, R. and Madsen, P. (Eds.), -, Version 2.0-04, Liberty Alliance Project, September 2005, (here referred to as [LibertyInteract]. In order to improve the usability of the solution, some options (wildcards) may be introduced: all possible values, none or a specific user-selected subset.","These values are set by the principal  and then sent back to the controller  (, step ) and, as a result, a new privacy policy referring to a principal  and one of his identity resources is created in the controller . This basic privacy policy may be enhanced with the specification of further conditions upon which the information can be released.","The privacy policies and their association to identity resources in one embodiment are now described in more details.","Once the principal  has set the privacy preferences regarding an identity resource, the resulting privacy policy may be sent to the WSP  that stores that identity resource. To do so, the WSP  may declare in its interface that it manages information regarding privacy preferences and thus an extension to the target identity profile may be needed. This approach allows keeping together the identity resource and the policy that governs its use and release (sticky policies). Besides, it is built upon the existing feature in the Liberty specifications. The extension may be defined once and it may then be added to any identity profile. This extension introduces a modification on the standard LAP ID-SIS identity services. This extension is the same no matter the specific ID-SIS WSP.","Once the WSP  allows operations on the privacy preferences, the controller  may take advantage of the mechanisms of the DST protocol to query, create, update or delete privacy policies in a WSP . Therefore, the controller  sends the principal-created privacy policy to the WSP  following the Liberty DST protocol (for a detailed description, see the description below with reference to ).","How principals  may express their privacy preferences will now be described in more details.","Principals  may express their privacy preferences using different means. First, they can choose one out of several pre-defined privacy policies and associate it to an identity resource. These pre-defined privacy policies may be described in natural language so that non-technically skilled users can understand them. This natural language description is mapped to a specific policy implementation described in a privacy policy expression language. These policies are hierarchical so that it is easier for users to compare among them and choose the one that better suits their needs. The approach benefits from its simplicity and usability because users do not have to deal with the policy details.","Principals  may also be allowed to define each detail of the privacy policy. This approach provides great flexibility in the description of preferences and may be offered as an advanced option.","How the controller  sets privacy preferences in a WSP  in one embodiment will now be described in more details. This corresponds to step  in , i.e. how the controller  may associate and send a privacy policy to the WSP  that stores the identity resource it governs. The controller  receives the principal preferences and translates them into a suitable privacy policy. The new privacy policy is sent to the WSP that stores the resource by means of a DST Create\/Modify message.","Privacy policies may be associated to identity resources using an extension of the Liberty identity profile. [LibertyDST] provides mechanisms to create or update identity resources stored in a WSP . Therefore, building upon the [LibertyDST] may be used to allow the controller  to set privacy policies associated to an identity resource.","To implement this mechanism, the controller  may play the role of a Liberty WSC  and may include the privacy policy as part of the Create or Modify element that is sent to the WSP  as part of [LibertyDST]. This mechanism is built upon the [LibertyDST], since the policy may be carried as any other information in the body part of the message. On arrival of the policy, i.e. upon reception of the Create\/Modify message (modify message illustrated in , \u201c1 dst:Modify\u201d), the WSP  retrieves, i.e. extracts, the policy information and stores it.","How the controller  retrieves privacy preferences from a service provider  in one embodiment will now be described in more details, with reference to .","The controller  may retrieve privacy policies associated to an identity resource using the same mechanism as the one that was used to set them namely using DST protocol. In this case, however, the controller  may use the Query operation. Once the policy has been retrieved, the controller  translates it to privacy preferences so that the principal can understand it.  illustrates the controller  querying privacy policies associated to an identity resource. The controller  queries the privacy policies associated to a particular identity resource.","Eventually, regarding privacy policy enforcement, a WSC  requests an identity resource that is governed by a privacy policy set by the principal . The WSP  offering that identity resource enforces the policy thus deciding whether the identity resource may be released or not, and imposing certain conditions to the requester once the information is released. General guidelines on the steps to follow to enforce privacy policies may be found in Yavatkar, R. et al., -, IETF RFC 2753, January 2000. In other words, WSP looks up the privacy policy associated to the identity resource and sends it back, if it can be released.","In one embodiment, WSPs  stores and retrieves privacy policies. The means to carry out these operations are dependent on the WSP implementation. However, WSPs  may receive this information as a DST Create\/Modify messages and they may release it as DST QueryResponse messages. Therefore, WSPs should be able to retrieve\/include this information from\/into DST messages.","In one embodiment, WSPs  implements a Policy Enforcement Point for privacy policy enforcement. This policy enforcement point intercepts requests to identity resources and decides on the appliance of privacy policies. The processing rules as defined in section 4.4.5 of [LibertyDST] may be followed in one embodiment.","In one embodiment, the controller  is able to use [LibertyDST] to Create\/Modify\/Query privacy policies in WSPs. Although the [LibertyDST] need not necessarily be modified, the controller  should be able to add privacy policies to a Create\/Modify message and to retrieve privacy policies from a QueryResponse message.","In one embodiment, an extension to identity data services, as defined by Liberty ID-SIS specifications, is provided. This extension defines a container for privacy policies governing the use and release of the information contained within the profile. The extension is included in any data service supporting privacy policy management.","The physical entities according to the invention, including the controllers, identity providers, discovery service providers and service providers may comprise or store computer programs including instructions such that, when the computer programs are executed on the physical entities, steps and procedures according to embodiments of the invention are carried out. The invention also relates to such computer programs for carrying out methods according to the invention, and to any computer-readable medium storing the computer programs for carrying out methods according to the invention.","Where the terms \u201cquerier\u201d, \u201creceiver\u201d, \u201cinteracter\u201d, \u201cfirst receiver\u201d, \u201csecond receiver\u201d, \u201cpublisher\u201d, \u201cthird receiver\u201d and \u201cobtainer\u201d are used herewith, no restriction is made regarding how distributed these elements may be and regarding how gathered elements may be.
