{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Electronically stored documents may be stored in a database or collection of databases. The documents may contain hyperlinks to other electronically stored documents. The hyperlinks may form an electronic link from one electronic document to another electronic database. When the link is accessed, or otherwise triggered by a user, the linked-to document may be retrieved from the database by a server. Typically, if the linked-to document is updated, such as when a new version of the document is created and stored in the database, any hyperlinks that link to that modified document are also updated to provide the proper path to the updated document. When the hyperlink is updated, a new version of the document with the updated hyperlink is typically stored in the database. Accordingly, when one document is revised, all documents that point to that document are usually also revised.","Additionally, for some contexts, such as financial models that comprise a collection of linked documents, the collection of interconnected documents can grow in the tens of thousands within a relatively short period of time. Some compliance and audit requirements require that past versions of documents need to be accessible. As part of compliance and\/or audit requirements, previous versions of a certain documents may be retrieved from a server. This historical document, however, may contain hyperlinks to other documents. When retrieving this historical document, these links may not function as needed for the compliance and audit requirements. For example, the links may be inactive or may link to an undesired version of the linked-to document.","According to various embodiments, a computer-implemented method for browsing electronic documents comprises storing a plurality of electronic documents in a computer database, where the computer database is in electronic communication with a host server, where the plurality of documents comprises a first document and a second document, where the first document comprises a hyperlink to the second document, and where the second document comprises a first version and a second version. The method further comprises displaying the first document on a client computing device comprising a rich internet application, where the client computing device is in communication with the host server, where the client computing device comprises a processor circuit and a memory circuit, and where the host server comprises a processor circuit and a memory circuit. The method further comprises receiving by the rich internet application of the client computing device a client side navigation parameter, receiving by the rich internet application of the client computing device a client side request to access the second document using the hyperlink, determining with the rich internet application of the client computing device a requested version of the second document based on the client side navigation parameter, determining with the rich internet application of the client computing device a dynamic path for the requested version of the second document, where the requested version is one of the first version and the second version, retrieving by the host server the requested version of the second document based on the dynamic path, and displaying the requested version of the second document on the client computing device.","In one embodiment, the navigation parameter is a version request. In one embodiment, the navigation parameter is a timestamp request. In one embodiment, the first version is created at a first timestamp and the second version is created at a second timestamp that is later in time than the first timestamp. In one embodiment, the method further comprises comparing with the rich internet application the timestamp request to the first timestamp and the second timestamp, retrieving the first version is retrieved when the timestamp request is only subsequent to the first timestamp, and retrieving the second version when the timestamp request is subsequent to the first timestamp and the second timestamp. In one embodiment, content of the first document is updated based on the navigation parameter. In one embodiment, the navigation parameter is selected using a graphical input provided by the client computing device. In one embodiment, the graphical input is selected from a group consisting of a slider and a plurality of radio buttons.","According to various embodiments, a computer-implemented method for browsing electronic documents comprises storing a plurality of electronic documents in a computer database, where the plurality of documents comprises a first document and a second document, where the computer database is in electronic communication with a host server, where the second document comprises a first version and a second version, displaying the first document on a client computing device that is in communication with the host server, where the client computing device comprises a processor circuit and a memory circuit, and where the host server comprises a processor circuit and a memory circuit, receiving by the host server a client side navigation parameter from the client computing device, populating by the host server a hyperlink on the first document to the second document, where a dynamic path is associated with the hyperlink, where the dynamic path is at least partially based on the client side navigation parameter, where the dynamic path is associated with a requested version of the second document, receiving by the host server from the client computing device a request to access the second document using the hyperlink, retrieving by the host server the requested version of the second document based on the dynamic path, and displaying the requested version of the second document on the client computing device.","In one embodiment, the navigation parameter is a version request. In one embodiment, the navigation parameter is a timestamp request. In one embodiment, the first version is created at a first timestamp and the second version is created at a second timestamp. In one embodiment, the timestamp request is compared to the first timestamp and the second timestamp, and the first version is retrieved when the timestamp request is only subsequent to the first timestamp and the second version is retrieved with the timestamp request is subsequent to the first timestamp and the second timestamp.

Also, as is to be appreciated, the data associated with the database  may be stored on a remote electronic computer system (not shown), for example. In some embodiments, the host server  and the database  may be grouped or combined into a single unit . Also, as may be appreciated, the historical browsing system  may comprise a plurality of computer servers  and a plurality of databases , which may or may not be grouped into various combinations. The host server  may be in communication with an electronic data communication network . The network  may comprise any suitable data communication network, such as one or a number of LANs and\/or WANs, for example.","A client computer device  also may be in communication with the network . The client computer device  may be any suitable computer device, such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a network-enabled telephone, a minicomputer, a microcomputer, a mobile device, a personal data assistant, or a smartphone for example.

In various embodiments the application  may be a rich internet application (\u201cRIA\u201d) , such as ADOBE\u00ae AIR\u2122. In some embodiments, the application  may be a document browser, such as a web browser, for example. As is to be appreciated, if a RIA is implemented, the RIA may comprise a web browser, for example. The application  may be in communication with the host server  and the database  through the network , for example.","The database  may store information that is accessible with the client computer device . For example, the database may store a number of electronic documents, such as a first document  and a second document . The second document  may be comprised of a plurality of versions , ,  that were created at different times. The content of the second document  may vary in each version. As is to be appreciated, \u201cdocument\u201d may include any type of electronically stored information, such web pages, word processor documents, spreadsheet documents, HTML documents, XHTML documents, mathematical documents, graphical documents, or other types of electronic documents, for example. The first document may include a link , such as a hyperlink, that electronically links the first document  to the second document . Additionally, the second document  may contain a link or a plurality of links to other electronically stored documents, including the first document , for example.

When a user of the client computer device  activates the link  in the first document , such as through the input device , a version of the second document  may be retrieved by the host server  from the database , served to the client computer device  via the network , and displayed on the display . The process for determining which version , ,  to display once the link  is activated is described in more detail below.","In one embodiment, referring to , along with displaying the first document  on the display , the client computer device  also may display a navigation parameter . While the navigation parameter  is illustrated as being displayed on the display , it is to be appreciated that navigation parameter  may be displayed using a variety of suitable techniques. In some embodiments, the navigation parameter  may be displayed in a separate window, a pop-up window, a separate display, or a drop-down menu, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["3","3","60","60","62","64","66","68","70","64","22","70","64"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["60","74","60","22","76","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["60","80","60","80","82","84","80","86","88","86","88","80","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","102","104","100","101","102","102","103","104","100","102","104","12","106","100","102","104","106","108","110","102","112","114","116","104","118","120","122"]},"In accordance with various embodiments, a user may navigate and display the documents on the client computer device . The links within each document, however, do not contain a path to an individual version of a document, but rather link to a document in general. When an individual document is accessed via a link, the system  determines the most recently created version of the document relative to the navigation parameter  inputted by the user. For example, a user may also browse the documents in \u201creal-time\u201d (e.g., not using historical browsing functionality), which will result in viewing the most recent version of documents. If the \u201creal-time\u201d for example is time t4, the user will be accessing or viewing the A1 version  of the A document . If the user activates a link on the A1 version to the B document , the system  will determine that the B2 version  of the document  is the most recent version relative to the \u201creal-time\u201d, time t4. The host server  () will retrieve the B2 version  of the document  and then serve it to the client computer device . If the user then activates a link on the B2 version of the document to the C document , the system  will determine that the C5 version  is the most recent version and will then retrieve the C5 version .","While the system  may be used for \u201creal-time\u201d access to the documents, it may also be used for historical browsing. Thus, in accordance with various embodiments, the navigation experience at a historical point in time may be replicated or otherwise reproduced. In other words, the exact interconnection of documents at a historical point in time and the content of those documents at that point in time may be viewed and\/or documented. As described above, the entry point for the historical navigation may be a timestamp, or a version number, for example, as established by the navigation parameter . As may be appreciated, other entry points may be used, such as an event-based entry point. Assuming the \u201creal-time\u201d is time t8, a user may use the navigation parameter  to choose a historical entry point equivalent to time t2, for example, or any other time prior to time t8. At that point, the A1 version  would be displayed to the user. In order to replicate the navigation experience at time t2, the system  would need to determine the appropriate version of the B document  to retrieve when the user accesses the link to the B document . In this example, to replicate at time t8 the browsing experience at time t2, it would be determined by the system  that the B1 version  should be displayed when the link  in the A document  is activated. Furthermore, were the user to access the link to the C document , the system  would determine that the C4 version  of the C document  would need to be displayed to the user to replicate the browsing experience at the historical time t2. Accordingly, based on any suitable historical timestamp, the system can replicate the browsing experience based on that timestamp and serve the appropriate versions of the documents to the user.","As shown in , a user may also use a version number of a document as an entry point for a historical browsing experience. As shown in , a particular version of a document may exist for an extended period of time. The B2 version , for example, was created at time t3 and existed until time t6, when the content of the document was altered to create the B3 version . Therefore, the system  may determine at which time along that period of existence will serve as the entry point. In one embodiment, the system  determines the timestamp when the requested document was incremented to one version higher than the requested version (e.g. the \u201cdetermined timestamp\u2019). The requested version of the document at a timestamp immediately proceeded the determined timestamp may then be retrieved from the database  and served to the user.","For example, if the B2 version  of the B document  is selected as the entry point for a historical browsing experience, the system  would determine when the B2 version  was changed to the B3 version . Based on the example illustrated in , the B2 version  was changed to the B3 version  at time t6. In this example, time t6 is the \u201cdetermined timestamp.\u201d The host server  would then deliver to the user the version of the B document  at time t5. Further, in order to provide a browsing experience based on the B2 version entry point, the C6 version  would be displayed if the link  to the C document  was accessed by the user.","In some embodiments, the content of the document on the display may change as the user selects different entry points using the navigation parameter. For example, with reference to the B document , if the user is viewing the document on the display  in real-time (e.g., time t8), the B3 version  will be displayed. If the user, through the navigation parameter  selects a historical entry point, the content of the B document  presented on the display  will adjust accordingly. If the user selects version one through a navigation parameter  similar to that of , for example, the B1 version  may be automatically displayed on display . Similarly, if the user selects a timestamp associated with time t4 through a navigation parameter  similar to that of , for example, the B2 version  may automatically be displayed on the display . As may be appreciated upon consideration of this disclosure, in some embodiments, a user may adjust the entry point for a particular document using the navigation parameter  and observe content change of the document over time. For example, a user may step through and view all of the available versions of a document by sliding a slider or sequentially selecting the appropriate radio buttons, for example. As the versions of the document are displayed, the content of the document will also change. In some embodiments, the changes in content may be highlighted or otherwise identified.","In various embodiments, referring to , the system  may implement a client-side interception technique using a RIA. A browser  may reside on the client computer device . As may be appreciated, the browser  may be a component of a RIA. When the user accesses a link to a document, an interceptor module  may intercept the navigation call . The interceptor module  may also be a software component of the RIA that is executed by the processor  of the device . The interceptor module  may parse the navigation call to identify the target document. For example, the target document may be the B document  (see ). As is to be appreciated, the navigation call  need not request any particular version of the B document . The interceptor module  may use the navigation parameter  to dynamically determine which version of the target document should be retrieved for the user. In one embodiment, the interceptor module  queries the host server , by sending an electronic query message via the network , to determine the appropriate version based on the navigation parameter. Based on the response from the server that is sent in an electronic message via the network , the interceptor module  may then dynamically set a calculated path with a given version number for the target document link. An electronic request  may be sent to the host server  via the network  by the client computer device  that contains the calculated path. The host server  queries the database  and delivers the target document via a delivery  (via the network ) to the client computer device .","In other embodiments, referring to , the system  may implement a server-side interception. A browser , or other type of document viewer, may reside on the client computer device . A document may be displayed on the display of the client computer device  that contains dynamic hyperlinks. The client-side may relay a navigation parameter, such as a timestamp, to the host server  via a parameter transmission  sent via the network . The parameter transmission  may be relayed to the host server  via any suitable technique, such as AJAX. Using the information from the parameter transmission , the host server  may send data  to the client computer device  that populates the dynamic hyperlinks of the document displayed by the browser . The populated links point to appropriate target documents based on the navigation parameter sent to the host server  in the parameter transmission . An AJAX push, for example, may be used to dynamically populate the links as the navigation parameter changes. In various embodiments, the population and\/or modification of the links is transparent to the user of the browser . When the user activates a dynamic link on the browser , a request  containing the path to the target document is sent to the host server  via the network . Upon retrieving the target document from the database , the host server  delivers the target document to the client computer device  via delivery  (sent via the network ).","In some embodiments, the links in the documents to be displayed on the browser  are augmented using a JAVA script bridge. Therefore, instead of functioning as a static link to a particular document, the link is dynamic and waits to receive information about the target document from the host server . Accordingly, as the navigation parameter is changed by the user, the host server  may automatically and dynamically change the path of the links in the documents so that they point to the appropriate documents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["200","18","202","18","204","142","18","142","206","60","208","210","12","14","16","18","212","20","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["214","18","216","60","18","218","14","60","220","14","222","12","14","14","16","18","224","18"]},"The examples presented herein are intended to illustrate potential and specific implementations of the present invention.

Such computer networks can be classified according to the hardware and software technology that is used to interconnect the devices in the network, such as optical fiber, Ethernet, wireless LAN, HomePNA, power line communication or G.hn. The computer networks may also be embodied as one or more of the following types of networks: local area network (LAN); metropolitan area network (MAN); wide area network (WAN); virtual private network (VPN); storage area network (SAN); or global area network (GAN), among other network varieties.","For example, a WAN computer network may cover a broad area by linking communications across metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries. The network may use routers and\/or public communication links. One type of data communication network may cover a relatively broad geographic area (e.g., city-to-city or country-to-country) which uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone service providers. In another example, a GAN computer network may support mobile communications across multiple wireless LANs or satellite networks. In another example, a VPN computer network may include links between nodes carried by open connections or virtual circuits in another network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The link-layer protocols of the VPN can be tunneled through the other network. One VPN application can promote secure communications through the Internet. The VPN can also be used to separately and securely conduct the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network. The VPN may provide users with the virtual experience of accessing the network through an IP address location other than the actual IP address which connects the access device to the network.","The computer network may be characterized based on functional relationships among the elements or components of the network, such as active networking, client-server, or peer-to-peer functional architecture. The computer network may be classified according to network topology, such as bus network, star network, ring network, mesh network, star-bus network, or hierarchical topology network, for example.

Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet, the intranet or extranet may be protected with appropriate authentication technology or other security measures. As applied herein, an intranet can be a group of networks which employ Internet Protocol, web browsers and\/or file transfer applications, under common control by an administrative entity. Such an administrative entity could restrict access to the intranet to only authorized users, for example, or another internal network of an organization or commercial entity. As applied herein, an extranet may include a network or internetwork generally limited to a primary organization or entity, but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other trusted organizations or entities (e.g., customers of an entity may be given access an intranet of the entity thereby creating an extranet).","Computer networks may include hardware elements to interconnect network nodes, such as network interface cards (NICs) or Ethernet cards, repeaters, bridges, hubs, switches, routers, and other like components. Such elements may be physically wired for communication and\/or data connections may be provided with microwave links (e.g., IEEE 802.12) or fiber optics, for example. A network card, network adapter or NIC can be designed to allow computers to communicate over the computer network by providing physical access to a network and an addressing system through the use of MAC addresses, for example. A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network, the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments, local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks (LANs); remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs; and\/or, wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and\/or to connect remote stations to LANs.","In various embodiments, a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example, when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub, the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer  datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports, such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch, or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term \u201cswitch\u201d can also include routers and bridges, as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content (e.g., a Web URL identifier). Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers, including physical, data link, network, or transport (i.e., end-to-end). A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments, routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.","As employed herein, an application server may be a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by other applications. Examples of application servers include J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers including WebSphere Application Server. Other examples include WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (IBM), Sybase Enterprise Application Server (Sybase Inc), WebLogic Server (BEA), JBoss (Red Hat), JRun (Adobe Systems), Apache Geronimo (Apache Software Foundation), Oracle OC4J (Oracle Corporation), Sun Java System Application Server (Sun Microsystems), and SAP Netweaver AS (ABAP\/Java). Also, application servers may be provided in accordance with the .NET framework, including the Windows Communication Foundation, .NET Remoting, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET among several other components. For example, a Java Server Page (JSP) is a servlet that executes in a web container which is functionally equivalent to CGI scripts. JSPs can be used to create HTML pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page. The application servers may mainly serve web-based applications, while other servers can perform as session initiation protocol servers, for instance, or work with telephony networks. Specifications for enterprise application integration and service-oriented architecture can be designed to connect many different computer network elements. Such specifications include Business Application Programming Interface, Web Services Interoperability, and Java EE Connector Architecture.","In various embodiments, computers and computer systems described herein may have the following main components: arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, memory, and input and output devices (I\/O devices). These components can be interconnected by busses, often comprising groups of wires or cables. The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I\/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these sections) can be collectively considered a central processing unit (CPU) for the computer system. The CPU may be constructed on a single integrated circuit or microprocessor.","The control unit (control system or central controller) directs the various components of a computer system. The control system decodes each instruction in a computer program and turns it into a series of control signals that operate other components of the computer system. To enhance performance or efficiency of operation, the control system may alter the order of instructions. One component of the control unit is the program counter, a memory register that tracks the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read.","The ALU is capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations. The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing, trigonometry functions (sine, cosine, etc.) and square roots. Some may be programmed to operate on whole numbers (integers), while others use floating point to represent real numbers, for example. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values (e.g., true or false). Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs to facilitate processing multiple instructions at the same time. For example, graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often possess ALUs that can perform arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices. Certain computer systems may include one or more RAM cache memories configured to move more frequently needed data into the cache automatically.","Examples of peripherals that may be used in connection with certain embodiments of the invention include input\/output devices such as keyboards, mice, screen displays, monitors, printers, hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, joysticks, and image scanners.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may divide functions between separate CPUs, creating a multiprocessing configuration. For example, multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) computer systems with co-processing capabilities may be employed. Also, multitasking may be employed as a computer processing technique to handle simultaneous execution of multiple computer programs.","In various embodiments, the systems and methods described herein may be configured and\/or programmed to include one or more of the above-described electronic, computer-based elements and components. In addition, these elements and components may be particularly configured to execute the various rules, algorithms, programs, processes, and method steps described herein.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described herein, it should be apparent, however, that various modifications, alterations and adaptations to those embodiments may occur to persons skilled in the art with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the present invention. The disclosed embodiments are therefore intended to include all such modifications, alterations and adaptations without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"FIGURES","p":["Various embodiments of the present invention are described herein by way of example in conjunction with the following figures wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A","b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
