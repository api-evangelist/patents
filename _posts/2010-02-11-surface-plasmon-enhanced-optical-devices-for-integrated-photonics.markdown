The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to optical devices suitable for integrated photonic applications, and more particularly to surface plasmon enhanced optical devices.","Integrated photonics offer the promise of combining many optical devices on a substrate, leading to miniaturization and increased functionality on a chip. Optical devices include but are not limited to optical isolators, frequency converters, amplitude or frequency modulators, couplers, splitters, and combiners. Integrated photonics can be formed from optical devices compatible with commonly used semiconductor fabrication techniques and materials and of a size scale suitable for dense integration.","An optical isolator is a nonreciprocal device that allows transmission of an optical wave in one direction but blocks it in the reverse direction. An optical isolator is analogous to a diode having a low electrical resistance between its input pod and output pod and a very high resistance between its output pod and its input pod, thereby permitting electrical current flow predominantly in one direction. Similarly, a light wave fed into the input pod of an optical isolator is guided with low loss to its output pod and any counter propagating light wave is attenuated so that only a minimal amount of power leaves the optical isolator via the input pod. A reciprocal device is symmetric upon interchange of the input and the output. In a nonreciprocal device, this interchange symmetry does not exist. Optical isolators can be used in optical systems since backscattered light creates noise and instability in laser sources, particularly in integrated platforms where the potential for backscattering increases with device density.","For bulk optical devices, a free-space optical isolator, also known as a bulk isolator, makes use of the Faraday effect, where a magneto-optic material produces a nonreciprocal polarization rotation to achieve isolation. An input field is transmitted through an input polarizer followed by a Faraday rotator, which provides a 45\u00b0 polarization rotation to the incident beam, and finally an output polarizer oriented at 45\u00b0 with respect to the input polarizer. In the forward the direction, the field is completely transmitted as it is always polarized along the polarizer axes. In the reverse direction, the beam undergoes an additional 45\u00b0 polarization rotation that is blocked by the input polarizer.","A dielectric waveguide incorporating the Faraday concept suitable for fabrication using semiconductor industry process steps can be made of a magnetically active material to achieve an integrated waveguide Faraday rotator.","A nonreciprocal phase shift isolator can make use of an interferometer arrangement. Both arms of the interferometer can contain a magneto-optic material with a magnetic field applied in a direction transverse to the propagation direction. In the forward direction, fields in both arms of the interferometer add constructively in phase. In the reverse direction, a nonreciprocal phase shift in one or both arms produces destructive interference and therefore isolation.","In a nonreciprocal loss isolator, a magneto-optic metal produces nonreciprocal loss in the optical wave. An active amplifying medium compensates for the loss in the forward direction. In the reverse direction, the nonreciprocity results in a larger loss resulting in isolation.","Surface plasmon waveguides have been suggested for use in a non-reciprocal phase shift interferometer arrangement. The magneto-optic metals (such as Co) and magneto-optic dielectrics (such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and bismuth iron garnet (BIG)), are not compatible with III-V optoelectronic devices and the processes for fabricating them.","An optical waveguide isolator based on a Y-shaped branching waveguide coupler is formed in one layer of a device made from III-V materials (such as GaAs or InP) with one isolating branch integrated with a III-V light emitting diode. With a 2\u00b0 branching angle, a transmission in the forward direction of 41%, which corresponds to an insertion loss of approximately 3.8 dB, and a transmission in the backward or reverse direction of 0.16%, which corresponds to an isolation of approximately 28 dB, can be achieved. The isolator strength, defined as the ratio of insertion loss to isolation, can be 256. With a 3\u00b0 branching angle and a cascade of four optical waveguide isolators, an isolator strength of 625 can result. Insertion loss is the loss experienced by an optical wave propagating through an optical isolator in forward direction.","A planar waveguide optical isolator comprising a Y-shaped combiner\/splitter can include a planar waveguide N-way splitter\/combiner. The forward directed signal is coupled into one of N\u22121 input waveguides, propagates through a coupling region, and is then coupled into the output waveguide. Reflected signals coupled into the output waveguide propagate through the coupling region and are split between each of the N\u22121 input waveguides. Except for the input waveguide, each of the N\u22121 branches is terminated with an isolating element to prevent further propagation of the reflected signal. The cascade arrangement of the waveguide branches is calculated to achieve the desired isolation. For a single stage isolator capable of achieving 3 dB isolation presuming a 50:50 split between the input port and a single reflecting port, a cascaded arrangement of ten such isolators is required to provide approximately 30 dB of isolation.","A single Y-shaped isolator structure can have a length on the order of 2.5 mm. As noted above, the Y-shaped approach can require a cascade of approximately ten isolators to achieve 30 dB isolation and can consequently require a much greater length.","An optical frequency converter is a device that takes an input field at one frequency and produces one or more output fields at one or more different frequencies. This process is therefore nonlinear, as new frequency components not present in the input field are created in the frequency converter. The efficiency of a nonlinear process requires phase matching between the interacting fields. Traditional methods for phase-matching include exploiting crystal birefringence by propagating waves along different axes of anisotropic crystals, periodically inverting crystal orientation to discretely reset the relative phase (so-called quasi-phase-matching (QPM)), or propagating waves in different waveguide modes to exploit waveguide dispersion. The birefringence method is limited to materials and wavelengths with specific properties, and not generally applicable to integrated photonic devices. QPM can be used in non-birefringent materials and, in waveguide geometries, permits conversion over indefinite propagation distances. QPM can equalize the phase velocity of waves of different frequencies propagating in a crystal by discretely inverting the crystal orientation along its length. Fabrication methods for QPM devices, however, require periodic patterning of crystal structures and have only been demonstrated for a small class of ferroelectric materials and semiconductors such as GaAs and ZnSe.","Amplitude modulation is a third important function in optical communications, where one signal (containing information) is transmitted by varying the strength of a second (carrier) signal. One example of a magneto-optic technique for achieving amplitude modulation uses the Faraday effect. An optical field is transmitted through an input polarizer then coupled to a magneto-optic waveguide followed by an output polarizer oriented at an angle with respect to the input polarizer. When a magnetic field is applied to the magneto-optic waveguide in a direction parallel to the propagation direction, the polarization of the optical field rotates. The output beam is therefore attenuated as it passes through the output polarizer. A similar approach for polarization rotation followed by polarization filtering can be accomplished using an electro-optic birefringent material (such as LiNbO, GaAs).","Interferometric modulators use an electro-optic material in the waveguide, where an electric field induces birefringence that produces a relative change in phase between the arms of the interferometer. When the optical fields in the interferometer arms are recombined, destructive interference occurs as a result of the induced phase shift.","Surface plasmon based modulators have been developed using interferometric configurations. In some cases, the dielectric material can include a thermo-optic polymer whose temperature rises when an electric signal is applied to the surface plasmon metal, resulting in a phase shift in the interferometer arm. The bandwidth in thermo-optic based devices can be low as a result of the slow heating process.","An electro-optic modulator can use a surface plasmon metal placed directly on top of a dielectric waveguide core material. The upper cladding of the surface plasmon waveguide can include an electro-optic material. An electric field causes the dielectric waveguide mode to be reflected or absorbed in the surface plasmon mode resulting in an amplitude modulation.","A magneto-optic surface plasmon modulator has been developed which works by applying a transverse magnetic field to a magneto-optic material bounded by a surface plasmon guiding metal. A free-space optical beam couples into the surface plasmon metal when the phase-matching condition is satisfied.","As the complexity of optical system increases, multiple optical functions, including but not limited to optical isolation, frequency conversion, and amplitude modulation, can be monolithically integrated onto a single material substrate to reduce the size and cost of the optical system. Lattice mismatch between semiconductors (such as InP and GaAs used in photonic chips) and magneto-optic materials (such as BIG and YIG) used in optical isolators and nonlinear materials (such as lithium niobate) used in frequency converters and amplitude modulators can be overcome.","Surface plasmon integrated circuits and devices offer several attractive features such as strong confinement of optical fields, the ability to simultaneously transport photonic and electronic signals, tolerance for sharp bending, and compatibility with existing semiconductor materials and manufacturing processes. Magneto-optic surface plasmon devices can exploit the ability to use the surface plasmon guiding metal as a current-carrying wire to generate magnetic fields that interact with the surface plasmon propagation characteristics. This current-induced localized magnetic field is well suited for optical devices such as high-bandwidth amplitude modulators and other optical devices such as optical isolators, frequency modulators, couplers, splitters, combiners and the like.","In some embodiments, the invention features an optical isolator device including a dielectric waveguide and a surface plasmon waveguide suitable for integrated photonic applications. The physics of the dielectric waveguide and the surface plasmon waveguide in proximity enables several optical device applications suitable for integrated photonics. A dielectric waveguide (for example, InP lower cladding, InGaAs core, and InP upper cladding) and a magneto-optic surface plasmon waveguide (for example, InP lower cladding, Fe core, and air upper cladding) can be separated by a common cladding material in an optical device. A common cladding can be a material layer serving as both the upper cladding of the dielectric waveguide and the lower cladding of the surface plasmon waveguide.

For low loss surface-plasmon waveguides, the equivalent lossless surface plasmon structure may be used which includes an idealized core material that results in the same real effective index as the low-loss surface plasmon structure for the same cladding and common cladding. This approximate technique is valid for the small loss.

These figures were generated by solving for the supermodes of an equivalent lossless surface plasmon waveguide having the same real-index as the lossy surface plasmon mode separated from a dielectric waveguide by a common cladding.

The optical isolator is fabricated using commonly available semiconductor fabrication techniques. An input guided mode at 1550 nm propagates through a dielectric waveguide in the forward direction. The dielectric waveguide  can include an InP dielectric waveguide cladding , an InGaAsP dielectric waveguide core , and an InP common cladding  with an effective index n. The surface plasmon waveguide  can include an InP common cladding , a thin film magnetic metal (iron) surface plasmon waveguide core  and an air effective surface plasmon waveguide cladding  such that an applied external magnetic field produces a nonreciprocal effective index (n, n) in the forward and reverse directions, respectively.

The role of the surface plasmon waveguide  length in determining the isolation and insertion loss is described herein.","If the surface plasmon length is smaller than the coupling length L, incomplete coupling from the dielectric waveguide mode into the surface plasmon mode occurs in the reverse direction. This effect is illustrated in  where the normalized power in the forward and reverse directions are plotted for the lossless surface plasmon case and where \u03b2and \u03b2are the propagation constants of the surface plasmon waveguide  and dielectric waveguide , respectively. In the reverse direction, \u03b2=\u03b2, and strong coupling into the surface plasmon waveguide  occurs resulting in large isolation.

Simulation results for the lossless surface plasmon waveguide  case are presented in  and results for the lossy surface plasmon waveguide  case are presented in .","The coupling length (L=50 \u03bcm) remains fixed as the loss is increased while the number of oscillations of power transfer decreases as the surface plasmon waveguide  absorbs the power. The simulations suggest that the design is robust to fabrication errors in the exact device length, because lengths of the surface plasmon waveguide core  metal film that are larger than the coupling length can still achieve the target isolation. Furthermore, in the forward direction the insertion loss is not highly sensitive to the device length since the dielectric mode has a small evanescent tail extending into the surface plasmon waveguide core  metal and a large phase mismatch prevents coupling. The large phase mismatch in the forward direction is a result of the detuning created by the externally applied magnetic field.","The surface plasmon waveguide  length can be varied in the mask designs in order to optimize the coupling from the dielectric mode into the surface plasmon mode in the reverse propagation direction. A nominal coupling length of 50 \u03bcm is expected from the simulation results.

The 3 dB insertion loss occurs at the half power point where the detuning parameter \u03b4\u03b2=2\u03ba. A plot showing the insertion loss in decibels as a function of the detuning parameter is shown in . The source of the detuning is the nonreciprocal change in the propagation constant of the magneto-optic surface plasmon waveguide  with an externally applied magnetic field. By increasing the separation between the dielectric waveguide  and surface plasmon waveguide , the coupling strength \u03ba decreases and the ratio of \u03b4\u03b2\/\u03ba increases.

Specifically, the effective index of the surface plasmon waveguide  equals that of the dielectric waveguide  for a saturated magnetic field strength B=0.17 Tesla for iron. In the forward direction, the saturated magnetic field can produce the largest phase mismatch through the relationship n\u2212n=\u03b4\u03b2\/k.","For a sub-optimal optical isolator design with the characteristic shown in , the surface plasmon effective index matches the effective index of the dielectric waveguide for an applied magnetic field strength less than B. In the forward direction the phase-mismatch for a saturated magnetic field n\u2212n=\u03b4\u03b2\/k\u2212\u0394n is reduced by the phase-mismatch in the reverse direction \u0394n=n\u2212n. To correct for the suboptimal device performance, the effective index of the dielectric waveguide  can be reduced or the effective index of the surface plasmon waveguide  mode can be increased.","The design procedure described in detail above produces an isolator with insertion loss less than 3 dB and isolation greater than 30 dB, resulting in isolator strength of approximately 500. The nominal dimensions of the various optical isolator components are as follows. The nominal device length can be about 50 \u03bcm and the nominal device width can be about 1.4 \u03bcm. The dielectric waveguide cladding  has a nominal thickness of approximately 1 \u03bcm, the dielectric waveguide core  has a nominal thickness of approximately 0.5 \u03bcm, the common cladding  has a nominal thickness of 0.9 \u03bcm, and the surface plasmon waveguide core  has a nominal thickness of 0.1 \u03bcm.

A surface plasmon waveguide input grating  precedes the surface plasmon waveguide core  and a surface plasmon output grating  follows the surface plasmon waveguide core . As an example of frequency conversion, an optical wave at a fundamental input frequency \u03c9 is coupled into the surface plasmon waveguide  from an input dielectric waveguide  by the use of the surface plasmon input grating . In the surface plasmon mode, the phase velocities of the waves at the fundamental (\u03c9) and second harmonic (2\u03c9) frequencies are matched, so that efficient second harmonic generation occurs. By tailoring the height and width of the surface plasmon waveguide core ridge  on the surface plasmon waveguide core , the effective index of the surface plasmon waveguide  is designed to compensate for the material dispersion, thus achieving phase matching for the desired NLO process while suppressing parasitic NLO processes. The converted second harmonic is coupled back into the dielectric waveguide  using the surface plasmon waveguide output grating . A metal-ridge  formed on or from the surface plasmon waveguide core  results in the phase-matching geometry. The optical field intensities in the surface plasmon modes are much higher than those in traditional bulk and waveguide nonlinear optical devices, resulting in much higher conversion efficiencies and extremely short device lengths. The higher second harmonic frequency 2\u03c9 (having the shorter wavelength) is confined to the ridge  while the lower fundamental frequency \u03c9 (having the longer wavelength) is guided by the waveguide core. This configuration allows the waveguide designer to adjust the waveguide core  and waveguide ridge  dimensions independently to match the nonlinear process. Coupling into and out of the surface plasmon waveguide from a dielectric waveguide can be accomplished using the grating techniques described here, or by other methods such as evanescent coupling. In addition, free space coupling can also be used to couple into and out of the surface plasmon waveguide using prisms (e.g., the Otto or Kretschmann configuration) or through the grating technique outlined here.","Different wavelengths can be generated in this way (including the important optical telecommunications wavelengths near 1550 nm) using different second-order nonlinear frequency conversion processes (including difference frequency generation, sum-frequency generation, and second harmonic generation).
