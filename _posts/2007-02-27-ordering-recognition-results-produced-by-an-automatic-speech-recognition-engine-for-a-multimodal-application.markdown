{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, apparatus, and products for ordering recognition results produced by an automatic speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine for a multimodal application.","2. Description of Related Art","User interaction with applications running on small devices through a keyboard or stylus has become increasingly limited and cumbersome as those devices have become increasingly smaller. In particular, small handheld devices like mobile phones and PDAs serve many functions and contain sufficient processing power to support user interaction through multimodal access, that is, by interaction in non-voice modes as well as voice mode. Devices which support multimodal access combine multiple user input modes or channels in the same interaction allowing a user to interact with the applications on the device simultaneously through multiple input modes or channels. The methods of input include speech recognition, keyboard, touch screen, stylus, mouse, handwriting, and others. Multimodal input often makes using a small device easier.","Multimodal applications are often formed by sets of markup documents served up by web servers for display on multimodal browsers. A \u2018multimodal browser,\u2019 as the term is used in this specification, generally means a web browser capable of receiving multimodal input and interacting with users with multimodal output, where modes of the multimodal input and output include at least a speech mode. Multimodal browsers typically render web pages written in XHTML+Voice (\u2018X+V\u2019). X+V provides a markup language that enables users to interact with an multimodal application often running on a server through spoken dialog in addition to traditional means of input such as keyboard strokes and mouse pointer action. Visual markup tells a multimodal browser what the user interface is look like and how it is to behave when the user types, points, or clicks. Similarly, voice markup tells a multimodal browser what to do when the user speaks to it. For visual markup, the multimodal browser uses a graphics engine; for voice markup, the multimodal browser uses a speech engine. X+V adds spoken interaction to standard web content by integrating XHTML (eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language) and speech recognition vocabularies supported by VoiceXML. For visual markup, X+V includes the XHTML standard. For voice markup, X+V includes a subset of VoiceXML. For synchronizing the VoiceXML elements with corresponding visual interface elements, X+V uses events. XHTML includes voice modules that support speech synthesis, speech dialogs, command and control, and speech grammars. Voice handlers can be attached to XHTML elements and respond to specific events. Voice interaction features are integrated with XHTML and can consequently be used directly within XHTML content.","In addition to X+V, multimodal applications also may be implemented with Speech Application Tags (\u2018SALT\u2019). SALT is a markup language developed by the Salt Forum. Both X+V and SALT are markup languages for creating applications that use voice input\/speech recognition and voice output\/speech synthesis. Both SALT applications and X+V applications use underlying speech recognition and synthesis technologies or \u2018speech engines\u2019 to do the work of recognizing and generating human speech. As markup languages, both X+V and SALT provide markup-based programming environments for using speech engines in an application's user interface. Both languages have language elements, markup tags, that specify what the speech-recognition engine should listen for and what the synthesis engine should \u2018say.\u2019 Whereas X+V combines XHTML, VoiceXML, and the XML Events standard to create multimodal applications, SALT does not provide a standard visual markup language or eventing model. Rather, it is a low-level set of tags for specifying voice interaction that can be embedded into other environments. In addition to X+V and SALT, multimodal applications may be implemented in Java with a Java speech framework, in C++, for example, and with other technologies and in other environments as well.","Currently, a multimodal application performs speech recognition by submitting digitized speech to an automatic speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine. The ASR engine receives digitized speech from the multimodal application and matches the digitized speech with a set of recognized words or phrases. The matched set of word or phrases are then returned to the multimodal application. Often the ASR engine returns more than one word or phrase for each clip of digital speech submitted by the multimodal application for recognition because the audible characteristics of the results are similar. Consider, for example, that a multimodal application provided an ASR engine with digitized speech for the song title \u201cThat Girl.\u201d The ASR engine may return the following matched phrases:\n\n","The order in which the ASR engine returns each of the matched results is typically based on the confidence level that the ASR engine calculates for each result, which specifies how confident the ASR engine is that each result matches the digitized speech. The result with the highest confidence level is first in order, the result with the second highest confidence level is second in order, the result with the third highest confidence level is third in order, and so on. The drawback to this current method of ordering recognition results is that the current method does not take into account other available information that might be used to order the recognition results in a manner that more accurately reflects the probability that each recognition result matches the digitized speech. As such, readers will appreciate that room for improvement exists in ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application.","Ordering recognition results produced by an automatic speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine for a multimodal application implemented with a grammar of the multimodal application in the ASR engine, with the multimodal application operating in a multimodal browser on a multimodal device supporting multiple modes of interaction including a voice mode and one or more non-voice modes, the multimodal application operatively coupled to the ASR engine through a VoiceXML interpreter, includes: receiving, in the VoiceXML interpreter from the multimodal application, a voice utterance; determining, by the VoiceXML interpreter using the ASR engine, a plurality of recognition results in dependence upon the voice utterance and the grammar; determining, by the VoiceXML interpreter according to semantic interpretation scripts of the grammar, a weight for each recognition result; and sorting, by the VoiceXML interpreter, the plurality of recognition results in dependence upon the weight for each recognition result.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Exemplary methods, apparatus, and products for ordering recognition results produced by an automatic speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine for a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with .  sets forth a network diagram illustrating an exemplary system for ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. Ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application in this example is implemented with a multimodal application () operating in a multimodal browser () on a multimodal device (). The multimodal application () is composed of one or more X+V pages (). The multimodal device () supports multiple modes of interaction including a voice mode and one or more non-voice modes of user interaction with the multimodal application (). The voice mode is represented here with audio output of voice prompts and responses () from the multimodal devices and audio input of speech for recognition () from a user (). Non-voice modes are represented by input\/output devices such as keyboards and display screens on the multimodal devices (). The multimodal application is operatively coupled () to an automatic speed recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine () through a VoiceXML interpreter (). The operative coupling may be implemented with an application programming interface (\u2018API\u2019), a voice service module, or a VOIP connection as explained more detail below.","Ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application () is implemented with a grammar () of the multimodal application () in the ASR engine (). The grammar () of  communicates to the ASR engine () the words and sequences of words that currently may be recognized. In the example of , the grammar () includes grammar rules that advise an ASR engine or a voice interpreter which words and word sequences presently can be recognized. Grammars for use according to embodiments of the present invention may be expressed in any format supported by an ASR engine, including, for example, the Java Speech Grammar Format (\u2018JSGF\u2019), the format of the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (\u2018SRGS\u2019), the Augmented Backus-Naur Format (\u2018ABNF\u2019) from the IETF's RFC2234, in the form of a stochastic grammar as described in the W3C's Stochastic Language Models (N-Gram) Specification, and in other grammar formats as may occur to those of skill in the art. Grammars typically operate as elements of dialogs, such as, for example, a VoiceXML <menu> or an X+V<form>. A grammar's definition may be expressed in-line in a dialog. Or the grammar may be implemented externally in a separate grammar document and referenced from with a dialog with a URI. Here is an example of a grammar expressed in JSFG:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0022"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<grammar scope=\u201cdialog\u201d><![CDATA["]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003#JSGF V1.0;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003grammar command;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<command> = [remind me to] call | phone | telephone <name>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<when>;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<name> = bob | martha | joe | pete | chris | john | artoush | tom;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<when> = today | this afternoon | tomorrow | next week;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003]]>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/grammar>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In this example, the elements named <command>, <name>, and <when> are rules of the grammar. Rules are a combination of a rulename and an expansion of a rule that advises an ASR engine or a VoiceXML interpreter which words presently can be recognized. In the example above, rule expansions includes conjunction and disjunction, and the vertical bars \u2018|\u2019 mean \u2018or.\u2019 An ASR engine or a VoiceXML interpreter processes the rules in sequence, first <command>, then <name>, then <when>. The <command> rule accepts for recognition \u2018call\u2019 or \u2018phone\u2019 or \u2018telephone\u2019 plus, that is, in conjunction with, whatever is returned from the <name> rule and the <when> rule.

To support the multimodal browser () in processing the multimodal application (), the system of  includes a VoiceXML interpreter (). The VoiceXML interpreter () is a software module of computer program instructions that accepts voice dialog instructions from a multimodal application, typically in the form of a VoiceXML <form> element. The voice dialog instructions include one or more grammars, data input elements, event handlers, and so on, that advise the VoiceXML interpreter () how to administer voice input from a user and voice prompts and responses to be presented to a user. The VoiceXML interpreter () administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019).","The VoiceXML interpreter () of  is improved for ordering recognition results produced by the ASR engine () for the multimodal application () according to embodiments of the present invention. The VoiceXML interpreter () may operate generally for ordering recognition results produced by the ASR engine () for the multimodal application () according to embodiments of the present invention by: receiving, in the VoiceXML interpreter () from the multimodal application (), a voice utterance; determining, by the VoiceXML interpreter () using the ASR engine, a plurality of recognition results in dependence upon the voice utterance and the grammar (); determining, by the VoiceXML interpreter () according to semantic interpretation scripts of the grammar (), a weight for each recognition result; and sorting, by the VoiceXML interpreter (), the plurality of recognition results in dependence upon the weight for each recognition result.","A multimodal device on which a multimodal application operates is an automated device, that is, automated computing machinery or a computer program running on an automated device, that is capable of accepting from users more than one mode of input, keyboard, mouse, stylus, and so on, including speech input\u2014and also providing more than one mode of output such as, graphic, speech, and so on. A multimodal device is generally capable of accepting speech input from a user, digitizing the speech, and providing digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. A multimodal device may be implemented, for example, as a voice-enabled browser on a laptop, a voice browser on a telephone handset, an online game implemented with Java on a personal computer, and with other combinations of hardware and software as may occur to those of skill in the art. Because multimodal applications may be implemented in markup languages (X+V, SALT), object-oriented languages (Java, C++), procedural languages (the C programming language), and in other kinds of computer languages as may occur to those of skill in the art, a multimodal application may refer to any software application, server-oriented or client-oriented, thin client or thick client, that administers more than one mode of input and more than one mode of output, typically including visual and speech modes.","The system of  includes several example multimodal devices:\n\n","Each of the example multimodal devices () in the system of  includes a microphone, an audio amplifier, a digital-to-analog converter, and a multimodal application capable of accepting from a user () speech for recognition (), digitizing the speech, and providing the digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. The speech may be digitized according to industry standard codecs, including but not limited to those used for Distributed Speech Recognition as such. Methods for \u2018COding\/DECoding\u2019 speech are referred to as \u2018codecs.\u2019 The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (\u2018ETSI\u2019) provides several codecs for encoding speech for use in DSR, including, for example, the ETSI ES 201 108 DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 050 Advanced DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 211 Extended DSR Front-end Codec, and the ETSI ES 202 212 Extended Advanced DSR Front-end Codec. In standards such as RFC3557 entitled\n\n","As mentioned, a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention is capable of providing speech to a speech engine for recognition. The speech engine () of  is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating or \u2018synthesizing\u2019 human speech. The speech engine () implements speech recognition by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a ASR engine (), and the speech engine carries out speech synthesis by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine (not shown). As shown in , a speech engine () may be installed locally in the multimodal device () itself, or a speech engine () may be installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice server (). A multimodal device that itself contains its own speech engine is said to implement a \u2018thick multimodal client\u2019 or \u2018thick client,\u2019 because the thick multimodal client device itself contains all the functionality needed to carry out speech recognition and speech synthesis\u2014through API calls to speech recognition and speech synthesis modules in the multimodal device itself with no need to send requests for speech recognition across a network and no need to receive synthesized speech across a network from a remote voice server. A multimodal device that does not contain its own speech engine is said to implement a \u2018thin multimodal client\u2019 or simply a \u2018thin client,\u2019 because the thin multimodal client itself contains only a relatively thin layer of multimodal application software that obtains speech recognition and speech synthesis services from a voice server located remotely across a network from the thin client. For ease of explanation, only one () of the multimodal devices () in the system of  is shown with a speech engine (), but readers will recognize that any multimodal device may have a speech engine according to embodiments of the present invention.","A multimodal application () in this example provides speech for recognition and text for speech synthesis to a speech engine through the VoiceXML interpreter (). As shown in , the VoiceXML interpreter () may be installed locally in the multimodal device () itself, or the VoiceXML interpreter () may be installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice server (). In a thick client architecture, a multimodal device () includes both its own speech engine () and its own VoiceXML interpreter (). The VoiceXML interpreter () exposes an API to the multimodal application () for use in providing speech recognition and speech synthesis for the multimodal application. The multimodal application () provides dialog instructions, VoiceXML <form> elements, grammars, input elements, event handlers, and so on, through the API to the VoiceXML interpreter, and the VoiceXML interpreter administers the speech engine on behalf of the multimodal application. In the thick client architecture, VoiceXML dialogs are interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter on the multimodal device. In the thin client architecture, VoiceXML dialogs are interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter on a voice server () located remotely across a data communications network () from the multimodal device running the multimodal application ().","The VoiceXML interpreter () provides grammars, speech for recognition, and text prompts for speech synthesis to the speech engine (), and the VoiceXML interpreter () returns to the multimodal application speech engine () output in the form of recognized speech, semantic interpretation results, and digitized speech for voice prompts. In a thin client architecture, the VoiceXML interpreter () is located remotely from the multimodal client device in a voice server (), the API for the VoiceXML interpreter is still implemented in the multimodal device (), with the API modified to communicate voice dialog instructions, speech for recognition, and text and voice prompts to and from the VoiceXML interpreter on the voice server (). For ease of explanation, only one () of the multimodal devices () in the system of  is shown with a VoiceXML interpreter (), but readers will recognize that any multimodal device may have a VoiceXML interpreter according to embodiments of the present invention. Each of the example multimodal devices () in the system of  may be configured to order recognition results produced by an automatic speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine for a multimodal application by installing and running on the multimodal device a VoiceXML interpreter that orders recognition results produced by an automatic speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine according to embodiments of the present invention.","The use of these four example multimodal devices () is for explanation only, not for limitation of the invention. Any automated computing machinery capable of accepting speech from a user, providing the speech digitized to an ASR engine through a VoiceXML interpreter, and receiving and playing speech prompts and responses from the VoiceXML interpreter may be improved to function as a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention.","The system of  also includes a voice server (), which is connected to data communications network () through wireline connection (). The voice server () is a computer that runs a speech engine () that provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning text representing recognized speech.

A data communications network for ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention is a data communications data communications network composed of a plurality of computers that function as data communications routers connected for data communications with packet switching protocols. Such a data communications network may be implemented with optical connections, wireline connections, or with wireless connections. Such a data communications network may include intranets, internets, local area data communications networks (\u2018LANs\u2019), and wide area data communications networks (\u2018WANs\u2019). Such a data communications network may implement, for example:\n\n","The system of  also includes a web server () connected for data communications through wireline connection () to network () and therefore to the multimodal devices (). The web server () may be any server that provides to client devices X+V markup documents () that compose multimodal applications. The web server () typically provides such markup documents via a data communications protocol, HTTP, HDTP, WAP, or the like. That is, although the term \u2018web\u2019 is used to described the web server generally in this specification, there is no limitation of data communications between multimodal devices and the web server to HTTP alone. A multimodal application in a multimodal device then, upon receiving from the web sever () an X+V markup document as part of a multimodal application, may execute speech elements by use of a VoiceXML interpreter () and speech engine () in the multimodal device itself or by use of a VoiceXML interpreter () and speech engine () located remotely from the multimodal device in a voice server ().","The arrangement of the multimodal devices (), the web server (), the voice server (), and the data communications network () making up the exemplary system illustrated in  are for explanation, not for limitation. Data processing systems useful for ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application according to various embodiments of the present invention may include additional servers, routers, other devices, and peer-to-peer architectures, not shown in , as will occur to those of skill in the art. Data communications networks in such data processing systems may support many data communications protocols in addition to those noted above. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms in addition to those illustrated in .","Ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention in a thin client architecture may be implemented with one or more voice servers, computers, that is, automated computing machinery, that provide speech recognition and speech synthesis. For further explanation, therefore,  sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a voice server () in ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. The voice server () of  includes at least one computer processor () or \u2018CPU\u2019 as well as random access memory () (\u2018RAM\u2019) which is connected through a high speed memory bus () and bus adapter () to processor () and to other components of the voice server ().","Stored in RAM () is a voice server application (), a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a voice server in a system that is configured to order recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention.

In carrying out ordering recognition results produced by an ASR engine for a multimodal application, the ASR engine () receives speech for recognition in the form of at least one digitized word and uses frequency components of the digitized word to derive a Speech Feature Vector (\u2018SFV\u2019). An SFV may be defined, for example, by the first twelve or thirteen Fourier or frequency domain components of a sample of digitized speech.
