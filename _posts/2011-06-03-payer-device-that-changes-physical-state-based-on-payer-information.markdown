{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to online and\/or mobile payments and more particularly to a payer device that changes its physical state based on payer information retrieved from a payer account.","2. Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as, for example, the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or on-line merchant or retailer and the consumer, and payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an on-line or mobile payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on-line and mobile purchases are growing very quickly.","In order to make online and\/or mobile payments, payers typically use a payer account provided by a payment service provider, an account provider, and\/or a variety of other entities known in the art, and the payer account typically includes funds that allow the payer to make payments. However, conventional access to the payer account requires that a payer key-in a username and password on a payer device, and retrieval of payer information from the payer account (e.g., available funds, payment status, etc.) requires that the payer navigate through and\/or view a plurality of web pages or application screens in order to find that payer information. The need to key in access credentials and\/or navigate to a payer account using the payer device is time consuming for a payer.","Thus, there is a need for an improved system to access payer information using a payer device.","According to one embodiment, a method for providing payer information on a payer device is performed on a payer device including at least one physical state change component moveably coupled to the payer device. Payer information is received over a network and determined to be associated with a physical state change instruction, and the at least one physical state change component is then actuated according to the physical state change instruction to change the physical state of the payer device.","In an embodiment, the physical state change of the payer device may include an increase in a perimeter surface of the payer device and\/or the movement of a weight housed in the payer device in response to the payer information indicating that a funding amount of a payer account has changed. In another embodiment, the physical state change of the payer device may include a repeated pulse vibration that changes frequency in response to the payer information indicating that the status of a payment being made from a payer account is changing.","As a result, a payer may be provided payer information by the changing physical state of the payer device, which frees the payer from needing to look at the payer device to receive the payer information.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","The present disclosure provides a payer device and method of using the payer device to provide payer information from a payer account to a payer. The payer device includes at least one physical state change component moveably coupled to the payer device. Payer information from the payer account is retrieved over a network and determined to be associated with a physical state change instruction that is stored in the payer device, and the at least one physical state change component is then actuated according to the physical state change instruction to change the physical state of the payer device such that the payer information is provided to the payer.","In an embodiment, as discussed in further detail below, in response to a change of a funding amount of the payer account, the perimeter surface of the payer device may be changed. For example, an increase in the funding amount of the payer account may result in an increase in the perimeter surface of the payer device which results in the feeling of a relatively larger volume payer device to the payer that indicates a relatively higher funding amount in the payer account. In another example, a decrease in the funding amount of the payer account may result in an decrease in the perimeter surface of the payer device which results in the feeling of a relatively smaller volume payer device to the payer that indicates a relatively lower funding amount in the payer account.","In an embodiment, as discussed in further detail below, in response to a change of a funding amount of the payer account, the position of a weight in the payer device may be changed. For example, an increase in the funding amount of the payer account may result in the movement of the weight from a bottom of the payer device to a top of the payer device, which results in the feeling of a \u201cfull\u201d payer device to the payer that indicates a relatively higher funding amount in the payer account. In another example, a decrease in the funding amount of the payer account may result in the movement of the weight from the top of the payer device to the bottom of the payer device which results in the feeling of an \u201cempty\u201d payer device to the payer that indicates a relatively lower funding amount in the payer account.","In an embodiment, as discussed in further detail below, in response to a change in status of a payment being made using the payer account, the frequency of a repeated pulse vibration in the payer device may be changed. For example, as a payment being made using the payer account is initiated, the frequency of the repeated pulse vibration in the payer device may be relatively slow. As the payment being made using the payer account moves closer to completion, the frequency of the repeated pulse vibration in the payer device may be increased until the payment is completed, which provides a \u201cheartbeat\u201d that is felt by payer and indicates the status of the payment being made from the payer account.","Physical state changes of the payer device may also be used to provide information to the payer device, as discussed in further detail below. For example, the payer may manipulate the at least one physical state change component on the payer device into a predetermined configuration or sequence of configurations to provide a \u201cpasscode\u201d to access the payer account.","Referring now to , , , , and , an embodiment of a payer device  is illustrated. The payer device  includes a payer device chassis  including a front surface , a rear surface located opposite the payer device chassis  from the front surface , a top surface extending between the front surface and the rear surface , a bottom surface located opposite the payer device chassis  from the top surface , and a pair of opposing side surfaces and extending between the front surface , the rear surface , the top surface , and the bottom surface . A display  is included on the payer device chassis  and extends between the side surfaces and immediately adjacent the front surface .

However, a variety of other portable\/mobile user devices and\/or desktop user devices may be used in the method  without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","The payer device chassis  defines a payer device housing  between the front surface , the rear surface , the top surface , the bottom surface and the side surfaces and . A plurality of computing and\/or other components may be housed in the payer device housing , discussed in further detail below. A plurality of physical state change components are also coupled to the payer device chassis  and at least partially housed in the payer device housing .","In the embodiment illustrated in and , the payer device  includes a front physical state change component housed in the payer device housing  and located adjacent the front surface of the payer device chassis . In an embodiment, the front physical state change component may include at least a portion of the display . The front physical state change component is moveably coupled to a plurality of actuators and that are housed in the payer device housing . The payer device  also includes a rear physical state change component housed in the payer device housing  and located adjacent the rear surface of the payer device chassis . The rear physical state change component is moveably coupled to a plurality of actuators and that are housed in the payer device housing .","The payer device  also includes a top physical state change component housed in the payer device housing  and located adjacent the top surface of the payer device chassis . The top physical state change component is moveably coupled to an actuator that is housed in the payer device housing . The payer device  also includes a bottom physical state change component housed in the payer device housing  and located adjacent the bottom surface of the payer device chassis . The bottom physical state change component is moveably coupled to an actuator that is housed in the payer device housing . The payer device  also includes a first side physical state change component housed in the payer device housing  and located adjacent the side surface of the payer device chassis . The first side physical state change component is moveably coupled to an actuator that is housed in the payer device housing . The payer device  also includes a second side physical state change component housed in the payer device housing  and located adjacent the side surface of the payer device chassis . The second side physical state change component is moveably coupled to an actuator that is housed in the payer device housing . While a plurality of physical state change components and actuators have been illustrated and described, one of skill in the art will recognize that physical state change components may be added or removed from the payer device  and actuators may be added or removed from the physical state change components while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.","In the embodiment illustrated in and , the payer device  includes a weight physical state change component  housed in the payer device housing  and located adjacent the rear surface of the payer device chassis . The weight physical state change component  is moveably coupled to an actuator track that is housed in the payer device housing  and is positioned along the length of the payer device chassis .","While a plurality of physical state change components have been illustrated, they are meant to be merely exemplary and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of other physical state change components and component configurations may be included in the payer device  without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore, the physical state change components of and have been illustrated separately from the physical state change components of and for clarity of discussion, and those and other physical state change components may be combined into a single payer device  while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , a method  for providing payer information on a payer device is illustrated. The method  begins at block  where a payer device is provided that includes at least one physical state change component moveably coupled to a payer device. In an embodiment, the payer device , discussed above with reference to , , , , and , is provided that includes the physical state change components , , , , , , and\/or . The payer device  may also include a processor, a non-transitory machine-readable medium, a network interface, and\/or a variety of other components known in the art and discussed in further detail below. In an embodiment, the payer device  is associated with a payer account that may be provided by a payment service provider, a payee, an account provider, and\/or a variety of other entities known in the art. The payer account may be funded by one or more funding sources such that a funding amount is associated with the payer account, and a payer may use the payer device  to may payments to payees with funds included in the payer account.","The method  then proceeds to block  where the payer device receives payer information. The payer device  is operable, e.g., using the processor and the network interface, to receive payer information over a network (e.g., the Internet.) In an embodiment, the payer device  may receive payer information associated with the payer account over the network from a payment service provider device, a payee device, an account provider device, and\/or from a variety of other devices known in the art. The payer device  may receive the payer information in response to an action detected from the payer device , the payment service provider device, the payee device, the account provider device, and\/or from a variety of other devices known in the art. For example, the payer information may include a change in the funding amount (an addition of funds, a subtraction of funds, etc.) associated with the payer account. The payer information may be sent by the payment service provider device, payee device, and\/or account provider device and received by the payer device  in response to detecting the change in the funding amount associated with the payer account by the payment service provider device, payee device, and\/or account provider device. In another example, the payer information may be retrieved by the payer device from the payment service provider device, payee device, and\/or account provider device in response to detecting an action on the payer device  (e.g., an instruction to periodically check the funding amount of the payer account, an action that may change in the funding amount associated with the payer account, etc.)","In another embodiment, the payer device  may receive payer information associated with a payment being made over the network from a payment service provider device, an account provider device, a payee device, combinations thereof, and\/or a variety of other device known in the art. The payer device may receive the payer information in response to an action detected from the payer device, the payment service provider device, the payee device, the account provider device, and\/or from a variety of other devices known in the art. For example, the payer information may include a status of a payment being made using the payer account. The payer information may be sent by the payment service provider device, payee device, and\/or account provider device and received by the payer device  in response to detecting a change in the status of the payment being made using the payer account by the payment service provider device, payee device, and\/or account provider device. In another example, the payer information may be retrieved by the payer device  from the payment service provider device, payee device, and\/or account provider device in response to detecting an action on the payer device (e.g., an instruction to make a payment.)","The method  then proceeds to block  where the payer device determines that the payer information is associated with a physical state change instruction. As discussed above, the payer device  includes a machine-readable medium. In an embodiment, the machine-readable medium (e.g., a database in a memory or other information storage device) includes one or more physical state change instructions that are associated with payer information, and the payer device  (e.g., using the processor) may determine that the payer information received in block  of the method  is associated with physical state change instructions in the machine-readable medium. In an embodiment, one or more physical state change instructions may be specified by the payer to produce desired and\/or predetermined physical state changes of the payer device  in response to particular payment information, and those physical state change instructions may be stored in the machine-readable medium of the payer device .","The method  then proceeds to block  where at least one physical state change component in the payer device  is actuated according to the physical state change instruction. While a variety of examples of physical state changes of the payer device  are described below, they are meant to be exemplary, and one of skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of different physical state change components may be utilized to provide a variety of different physical state changes of the payer device that convey payer information to a payer without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , , , , and , an embodiment of a physical state change of the payer device  at block  of the method  is described and illustrated. In this embodiment, the payer information received by the payer device  at block  of the method  may have included an increase in the funding amount associated with the payer account, and the physical state change instruction determined to be associated with that payer information may have included an instruction to increase the perimeter surface of the payer device . At block  of the method , in response to the physical state change instruction, the payer device  (e.g., using the processor) actuates: the actuators and to move the front physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis and out of the payer device housing , the actuators and to move the rear physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis and out of the payer device housing , the actuator to move the top physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis and out of the payer device housing , the actuator to move the bottom physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis and out of the payer device housing , the actuator to move the first side physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis and out of the payer device housing , and the actuator to move the second side physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis and out of the payer device housing , as illustrated in , , and ","As can been seen in , , , and , in response to the increase in the funding amount associated with the payer account, the perimeter surface (i.e., the outer surface) of the payer device  has been increased. In an embodiment, as the funding amount in the payer account decreases, a payment instruction may include decreasing the perimeter surface of the payer device  by actuating the actuators to move the physical state change components at least partially back into the payer device housing . Thus, a payer may be provided payer information (e.g., a changing funding amount associated with a payer account) by changing the payers perceived volume of the payer device  (i.e., the \u2018thicker\u2019 the payer device , the higher the funding amount associated with the payer account). In an embodiment, the payer device  may include a preset or default perimeter surface area. Furthermore, the physical state change instructions may include instructions to proportionally adjust the perimeter surface of the payer device  with respect the funding amount associated with the payer account (e.g., the \u2018thickness\u2019 of the phone would range from the \u2018thickest\u2019 at the maximum funding amount to the \u2018thinnest\u2019 when the account is no longer funded.)","In an embodiment, physical state change components may be added to the embodiment illustrated in and to result in a continuous perimeter surface of the payer device  after the physical state change has been performed. Furthermore, alternative physical state change components may be used to change the perimeter surface of the payer device  such as, for example, physical state change components that expand due to the introduction of fluid, in response to an electrical current, etc.","One of skill in the art will recognize that the actuators may be actuated separately or in different combinations to change the physical state of the payer device  differently than is illustrated in , , and . For example, as illustrated in , the actuator may be actuated to move a portion of the rear physical state change component (e.g., the portion adjacent the bottom surface of the payee device ) further relative to the payee device chassis  than the actuator is actuated to move another portion of the rear physical state change component (e.g., the portion adjacent the top surface of the payee device .) While examples have been provided, a wide variety of physical state changes of the payer device  that provide a variety of physical shapes, volumes, etc. of the payer device  are envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to and , another embodiment of a physical state change of the payer device  at block  of the method  is described and illustrated. In this embodiment, the payer information received by the payer device  at block  of the method  may have included an increase in the funding amount associated with the payer account, and the physical state change instruction determined to be associated with that payer information may have included an instruction to shift the weight of the payer device  (e.g., to shift a center of gravity of the payer device .) At block  of the method , in response to the physical state change instruction, the payer device  (e.g., using the processor) actuates the actuator track to move the weight physical state change component  relative to the payer device  from the position illustrated in to the position illustrated in and , adjacent the top surface of the payee device .","As can been seen in and , in response to the increase in the funding amount associated with the payer account, the weight of the payer device  has been shifted. In an embodiment, as the funding amount in the payer account decreases, a payment instruction may include shifting the weight of the payer device  by actuating the actuator track to move the weight physical state change component  to the position illustrated in and , adjacent the bottom surface of the payer device . Thus, a payer may be provided payer information (e.g., a changing funding amount associated with a payer account, a number of transactions being processed through the payer account, etc.) by shifting the weight of the payer device  (i.e., a \u2018top heavy\u2019 or \u2018full feeling\u2019 payer device  may indicate a higher funding amount associated with the payer account, while a \u2018bottom heavy\u2019 or \u2018empty feeling\u2019 payer device  may indicate a lower funding amount associated with the payer account.) Furthermore, the physical state change instructions may include instructions to proportionally shift the weight of the payer device  with respect the funding amount associated with the payer account. In another embodiment, a payer instruction may include instructions to shift of the weight of the payer device  in response to a proposed purchase. For example, a payer may be browsing for items on the payer device , and in response to proposing a purchase on the payer device  (e.g., by adding an item to an electronic shopping cart before confirming payment) the weight of the payer device  may be shifted to make the payer device  \u2018bottom heavy\u2019 to indicate that the payer account has low or insufficient funds to cover the proposed payment.","In an embodiment, different or additional weight physical state change components and actuator trackers may be added to the payer device  that allow the weight of the payer device  to be shifted differently than described above (e.g., between the side surfaces and , between corners of the payer device , etc.)","In another embodiment, the payer information received by the payer device  at block  of the method  may include a status of a payment made using the payer account, and the physical state change instruction determined to be associated with that payer information may have included an instruction to provide a repeated pulse vibration of the payer device  that changes in response to the changing status of the payment. At block  of the method , in response to the physical state change instruction, the payer device  (e.g., using the processor) may actuate a pulse device housed in the payer device  to create a repeated pulse vibration of the payer device . For example, payer device  may actuate the actuator track to move the weight physical state change component  back and forth relative to the payer device  in order to create a repeated pulse vibration, or \u2018heartbeat\u2019, in the payer device . While the weight physical state change component  and actuator track have been described as providing a pulse device, an variety of other pulse devices known in the art may be employed to provide the \u2018heartbeat\u2019 by vibration in the payee device .","As the status of the payment changes and is received by the payer device , the frequency of the repeated pulse vibration of the payer device  may be changed according to the physical state change instructions. Thus, a payer may be provided payer information (e.g., a status of a payment made using the payer account) by changing a repeated pulse vibration induced in the payer device  (i.e., a relatively slow repeated pulse vibration in the payer device  may indicate that a status of a payment is beginning, while a relatively fast repeated pulse vibration in the payer device  may indicate that a status of a payment is nearing completion.) Furthermore, the physical state change instructions may include instructions to proportionally change the frequency of the repeated pulse vibration of the payer device  with respect the current status of the payment.","Thus, a variety of physical state changes of a payer device may be performed to provide payer information to a payer. Those physical state changes free the payer from having to manipulate or even look at the payer device to receive the payer information. Although specific examples of payer information have been provided herein, it is contemplated that payer information triggering a physical change in a user or payer device may include any suitable information, including non-financial or payment related information. Examples include, but are not limited to, an approved transaction or payment, a denied transaction or payment, a notification or message sent to the user, where the physical change may vary depending on the content or sender of the message, an unauthorized use of the payer's account, any change in status or information of the payer's account, when a new app is added, when an app has an update, notification of events, such as from the user's calendar, and changes to the device location.","Referring now to , , and , the physical state change components on the payer device  may also be used to provide information to the payer device . For example, the physical state change components of the payee device  may be actuated as illustrated in and . A payer may then provide a force A on the first side physical state change component to move the first side physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis  and partially into the payer device housing , and a force B on the bottom physical state change component to move the portion of the bottom physical state change component adjacent the side surface of the payer device  relative to the payer device  and partially into the payer device housing , as illustrated in . The payer device  (e.g., using the processor) may detect the movement of the first side physical state change component and bottom physical state change component relative to the payer device chassis  and, in response, determine that the detected movements correspond to a pre-defined movement or sequence of movements of the physical state change components that is stored in the machine-readable medium. In an embodiment, determination that a pre-defined movement of sequence of movements has occurred may provide credentials for the accessing of the payer account over the network by the payer device , accessing the payer device  itself, or providing a variety of other instructions know in the art.","Thus, the payer device  may allow the payer to provide instructions, commands, and\/or other signals to the payer device  by changing the physical state of the payer device  according to pre-defined movements or sequences of movements of the physical state change components. In an embodiment, the predefined movement or sequence of movements may result in a specific shape of the payer device  that the payer device  recognizes as providing a predefined instruction. Furthermore, the physical state change components may be operable to be manipulated differently than illustrated and described above. For example, the physical state change components may be operable to be removed from the payer device , rotated, pivoted, and\/or move in a variety of other manners known in the art.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a networked system  used in the system described above is illustrated. The networked system  includes a plurality of payer devices , a plurality of payee devices , a payment service provider device , and a plurality of account provider devices  in communication over a network . Any of the payer devices  may be the payer device , discussed above. The payee devices  may be the payee devices discussed above and may be operated by the payees discussed above. The payment service provider device  may be the payment service provider devices discussed above and may be operated by a payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal Inc. of San Jose, Calif. The account provider devices  may be the account provider devices discussed above and may be operated by the account providers discussed above such as, for example, credit card account providers, bank account providers, savings account providers, and a variety of other account providers known in the art.","The payer devices , payee devices , payment service provider device , and account provider devices  may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein. For example, such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable mediums such as memories or data storage devices internal and\/or external to various components of the system , and\/or accessible over the network .","The network  may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, the network  may include the Internet and\/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of networks.","The payer device  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over network . For example, in one embodiment, the payer device  may be implemented as a personal computer of a user in communication with the Internet.

For example, in one embodiment, the browser application may be implemented as a web browser configured to view information available over the Internet.","The payer device  may also include one or more toolbar applications which may be used, for example, to provide user-side processing for performing desired tasks in response to operations selected by the payer. In one embodiment, the toolbar application may display a user interface in connection with the browser application.","The payer device  may further include other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide desired features to the payer device . In particular, the other applications may include a payment application for payments assisted by a payment service provider through the payment service provider device . The other applications may also include security applications for implementing user-side security features, programmatic user applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over the network , or other types of applications. Email and\/or text applications may also be included, which allow the payer to send and receive emails and\/or text messages through the network . The payer device  includes one or more user and\/or device identifiers which may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with the browser application, identifiers associated with hardware of the payer device , or other appropriate identifiers, such as a phone number. In one embodiment, the user identifier may be used by the payment service provider device  and\/or account provider device  to associate the user with a particular account as further described herein.","The payee device  may be maintained, for example, by a conventional or on-line merchant, conventional or digital goods seller, individual seller, and\/or application developer offering various products and\/or services in exchange for payment to be received conventionally or over the network . In this regard, the payee device  may include a database identifying available products and\/or services (e.g., collectively referred to as items) which may be made available for viewing and purchase by the payer.","The payee device  also includes a checkout application which may be configured to facilitate the purchase by the payer of items. The checkout application may be configured to accept payment information from the payer through the payer device , the account provider through the account provider device , and\/or from the payment service provider through the payment service provider device  over the network .","Referring now to , an embodiment of a computer system  suitable for implementing, for example, the payer device , the payer device , the payees device , the payment service provider device , and\/or the account provider device , is illustrated. It should be appreciated that other devices utilized by payer, payees, payment service providers, and account providers in the payment system discussed above may be implemented as the computer system  in a manner as follows.","In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, computer system , such as a computer and\/or a network server, includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, which interconnects subsystems and components, such as a processing component  (e.g., processor, micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc.), a system memory component  (e.g., RAM), a static storage component  (e.g., ROM), a disk drive component  (e.g., magnetic or optical), a network interface component  (e.g., modem or Ethernet card), a display component  (e.g., CRT or LCD), an input component  (e.g., keyboard, keypad, or virtual keyboard), a cursor control component  (e.g., mouse, pointer, or trackball), and\/or a location sensor  (e.g., a Global Positioning System (GPS) device, a cell tower triangulation device, and\/or a variety of other location determination devices known in the art.)
