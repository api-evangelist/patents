title: Automatic handling of incoming communications at a wireless device
abstract: A wireless computer device, such as a mobile telephone, that receives attempted communication connections, such as phone calls, across a wireless network and can respond thereto without the user directly entering the communication. The wireless device classifies the attempted communication connection, such as through receipt of Caller ID, and performs a predetermined response to a communication connection attempt based upon the classification, such as blocking the call, answering with a prerecorded message, or sending data to the calling device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to communication between computer devices across wireless computer networks. More particularly, the invention relates to wireless devices having the ability to classify an incoming communication attempt, such as a phone call, and perform a predetermined action based upon the identification.","2. Description of the Related Art","In communication exchanges, such as voice and data telephone calls, it is desirous to know the identity of an incoming communication attempt for several reasons. Firstly, where the bridging of the communication connection, such as a connected telephone call, costs the device owner or subscriber money, the owner may not want to get charged for a specific incoming call. Secondly, the device owner may not want to waist time talking to the caller or receiving data from the caller because the caller is a solicitor, marketer, or some other person or entity the device owner does not wish to communicate with. Thus, several technologies have developed for land-line based telephone and telecommunication systems for a person to screen the incoming phone call.","In particular regard to telephone calling, it is known to transmit identifying data at the beginning a communication connection attempt so that the called device can identify the caller. One specific version of this identification is called \u201cCaller ID\u201d (CID), or Calling Number Delivery (CND). This system was created as an extension of Automatic Number Identification (ANI) which is used by telephone companies to identify the billing account for a toll call.","The CID information is transmitted on the telephone service subscriber loop using modem tones that transmit the identification display message in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character code form to the device receiving the phone call. The transmission of the display message typically takes place between the first and second \u201crings.\u201d The message consists of a channel seizure string followed by a mark string and then the caller information. The information is sent in one of two formats: \u201cSingle Data Message Format\u201d (SDMF) which contains the date, time, and calling number; and the \u201cMultiple Data Message Format\u201d (MDMF) contains the date, time, calling number, and the name associated with that number. Optionally, the number and name fields may contain data indicating that the information has been blocked by the caller or is unavailable. Since the time CID was first made available, it has been expanded to offer CID on \u201ccall waiting,\u201d or where the call waiting tone is heard during an ongoing telephone conversation and the identification of the second incoming call is seen.","The need to identify incoming communication attempts is greater among wireless computer devices that have the ability to communicate voice and data to each other, such as cellular telephones. The subscriber or owner of the telephone is charged for all airtime used by the device so any incoming call answered costs the user.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system for a wireless computer device, such as a cellular telephone, PDA, or other telecommunication device, to have a means to identify and\/or classify an incoming communication attempt so that an undesired connection can be avoided with a predetermined response from the wireless device. Such system should be able to selectively handle the incoming communication without the need for user interaction to affect the response. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method that the present invention is primarily directed.","The present invention is a system and method at computer device having a wireless communication capability that receives attempted communication connections across a wireless network for classifying the attempted communication connections before they are necessarily answered, and performing a predetermined response to a communication connection attempt based upon the classification of the attempted communication connection. The predetermined response can be blocking the specific call, returning an audio or data response thereto, or requesting user input before allowing the communication attempt to connect to the device.","The method of responding to incoming communication connection attempts at the computer device include the steps of receiving an attempted communication connection across a wireless network, classifying the attempted communication connection; and performing a predetermined response to the attempted communication connection based upon the classification. The method can include the steps of blocking that specific communication, or all communications from that device or entity, or requesting user input prior to allowing the communication to connect.","It is therefore an object of the system and method provide a system in a wireless computer device, such as a cellular telephone, PDA, or other telecommunication device, to classify any incoming communication attempt so that an undesired connection is avoidable or otherwise handled with a predetermined response. The device can handle the incoming communication without the need for user interaction to affect the response, or can ask the user to determine the appropriate response when the connection attempt is received. Further, the wireless device can respond with either a voice response to a telephone caller, or a data response to either a caller or an incoming communication from a device.","Other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and the Claims.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates block diagram of a computer architecture on a wireless device including, such as cellular telephone , having wireless communication capability through a wireless communication interface . The wireless device  selectively receives attempted communication connections across a wireless network  (), such as a phone call, data call, SMS, or other communication attempt. The wireless device attempts to classify the attempted communication connections and perform a predetermined response to a communication connection attempt based upon the classification of the attempted communication connection.","More particularly, the wireless device  has a computer platform  that can receive and handle data sent from other computer telecommunication devices across the wireless network. The computer platform  includes, among other components, an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, programmable gate array, or other data processing device. The ASIC  is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless device and is not normally upgradeable. The ASIC  or other processor executes an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer , which includes the resident application environment, and can include the operating system loaded on the ASIC . The resident application environment interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. An example of a resident application environment is the \u201cBinary Runtime Environment for Wireless\u201d (BREW\u2122) software developed by Qualcomm\u00ae for wireless device platforms.","As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , with a graphics display, but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform as known in the art, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager with a graphics display, or even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local database  for storage of software applications not actively used in memory , such as the software applications downloaded from a third party application download server. The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , has wireless communication capability through a wireless communication portal or communication interface  that selectively sends and receives data across a wireless network . The computer platform  resident application environment can communicate data to the platform  through the portal (interface ), and can interact with any incoming communication stream and screen same for a predetermined response thereto. The predetermined response can be to block the incoming communication connection attempt so that a full communication is never bridged, such as a telephone call being unanswered. Alternately, the predetermined response can include an audio response to the incoming communication connection attempt, such as responding with a quick message like: \u201cThis number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers.\u201d And in one embodiment, the predetermined response can to request user input as to whether to accept the incoming communication or respond with a specific predetermined response. And in the case of a data call to the device, such as an SMS or e-mail, the predetermined response can be to return a data response to the incoming communication attempt, such as a responsive SMS or e-mail.","The classification of the incoming communication attempt is preferably by identifying the telephone number of a calling telephone making incoming communication attempt to the device, such as through the receipt of Caller ID for the incoming telephone call. And for a data communication, the classification occurs through the receipt of identity data within the incoming communication attempt, such as tag data received in initial frames of information.","Cellular telephones and telecommunication devices, such as cellular telephone , are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d). These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor, such as ASIC , of the cellular device . The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , can download and execute many types of applications, such as web pages, applets, MIDlets, games and stock monitors, or simply data such as news and sports-related data. The downloaded data or executable applications can be immediately displayed on a display of the device  or stored in the local database  when not in use. The software applications can be treated as a regular software application resident on the wireless device , and the user can selectively upload stored resident applications from the local database  to memory  for execution on the API , i.e. within the resident application environment. Accordingly, a program to screen in the incoming communication connections can be loaded on the platform  at the time of manufacture of the device, or the program can be downloaded to the platform  across the wireless network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["25","10","25","25","30","32","30","32","30","32","32","34","32","34","34","10"]},"Thus, on the wireless network , one wireless device  can place a voice or data communication attempt to another device, such as wireless device . Because the subscriber for the wireless service of device  can be charged for all airtime usage or messages sent, the subscriber may not want to receive telephone calls or messages from wireless device . The wireless device  can therefore have set as a predetermined response a block of any communication from device , or the subscriber can specify the predetermined response on the first receipt of the communication connection, as is shown below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","40","42","42","50"]},"Otherwise, if the incoming communication attempt cannot be classified at decision , a determination is then made as to whether the user needs to classify the incoming communication, as shown at decision . In other words, the device may allow a certain type of call to pass to a default response, such as returning an audio message to the caller that the device does not accept unidentified callers. If the user does need to classify the incoming connection attempt as decision , the user is then requested to classify the incoming connection attempt, as shown at step , and then determination is made as to whether the user has classified the incoming attempt, as shown at decision . If the user classifies the incoming caller at decision , or if the user does not need to classify the incoming connection attempt at decision , a determination is then made as to whether there is a predetermined response for the incoming communication connection attempt, as shown at decision . Otherwise, if the user has not classified the incoming communication connection attempt at decision , then process then allows the communication to connection at shown at step  and then the process ends.","At decision , if there is a predetermined response to the incoming communication attempt, then the predetermined response is executed, as shown at predefined process , and then the process ends. Thus, it can be seen that the default condition is preferably to allow the communication to connect so that the user does not miss the communication. However, the default value can ultimately be set to refuse all unidentified or unclassified incoming communication connection attempts. If there is not a predetermined response specified for the incoming communication connection attempt at decision , then a determination is made as to whether the user needs to determine a response, as shown at decision . If the user does not need to determine a response at decision , then the incoming communication connection attempt is allowed, as shown at step , and then the process ends. If the user does need to determine a response to the incoming communication connection attempt at decision , then a determination is made as to whether the user has determined a response, as shown at decision .","If the user has not determined a response at decision , then the incoming communication connection attempt is allowed (or blocked depending upon the default) as shown at step , and then the process ends. Otherwise, if the user has determined a response to the incoming communication attempt at decision , then the chosen predetermined response is executed, as shown at predetermined process , and then the process ends. The predetermined response for that particular communication connection identity can be stored and reused for any future connection attempt to the device, or the response can be simply the response by the user for the call at that time, such as an audio response: \u201cI'm unable to answer right now. Call back later.\u201d","It can thus be seen that as shown in , the wireless device  therefore provides a method of responding to incoming communication connection attempts at a computer device  having wireless communication capability including the steps of receiving an attempted communication connection across a wireless network , classifying the attempted communication connection (decision ), and performing a predetermined response to the attempted communication connection based upon the classification (step ). The step of performing a predetermined response can be to block the incoming communication connection attempt, generating an audio response to the incoming communication connection attempt, requesting user input as to whether to accept the incoming communication, or returning a data response to the incoming communication attempt.","The step of classifying the attempted communication connection can be through identifying the telephone number of a calling telephone making incoming communication attempt to the device, such as through the receipt of Caller ID from the attempted communication connection. Alternately, the step of classification can occur through the receipt of identity data within the incoming communication attempt, such as data in a frame. And if the incoming communication connection attempt is a data call, the step of performing a predetermined response can be sending data, such as an SMS message, to the device making the incoming communication attempt.","The method accordingly can be implemented by the execution of a program held computer readable medium, such as the memory  of the computer platform . The instructions can reside in various types of signal-bearing or data storage primary, secondary, or tertiary media. The media may comprise, for example, RAM (not shown) accessible by, or residing within, the wireless device. Whether contained in RAM, a diskette, or other secondary storage media, the instructions may be stored on a variety of machine-readable data storage media, such as DASD storage (e.g., a conventional \u201chard drive\u201d or a RAID array), magnetic tape, electronic read-only memory (e.g., ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM), flash memory cards, an optical storage device (e.g. CD-ROM, WORM, DVD, digital optical tape), paper \u201cpunch\u201d cards, or other suitable data storage media including digital and analog transmission media.","While the foregoing disclosure shows illustrative embodiments of the invention, it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, although elements of the invention may be described or claimed in the singular, the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
