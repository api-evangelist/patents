{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/507,472, filed Jul. 13, 2011, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/493,219, filed Jun. 3, 2011, the entireties of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses for dynamically and simultaneously recording, editing and combining multiple live video clips and still photographs with filters, transitions, music, titles and credits into a finished composition.","The proliferation of cameras and camcorders, especially within smart phones, has resulted in many people having a camera on them at all times. In many instances, a user will sporadically capture videos and still photographs with their camera at various times during one event (e.g. a birthday party, a tourist attraction, a sporting event, etc.). All of the video clips and still photographs typically stay on the user's camera as separate individual files until, at some later time, the user downloads the video clips and still photographs to a personal computer or loads them into a mobile video editing application one at a time. Even after downloading the video clips and still photographs to a personal computer, the video clips and still photographs are still saved as separate, individual files.","If the user would like to collectively view all of the video clips and still photographs from one event, the user is required to install and learn how to use a picture\/video compilation program in order to combine the pictures and videos into one seamless, edited presentation. Further, some users prefer to include titles, credits, music backgrounds, video filters and transitions within their video\/photographs compilations. This requires the user to further learn and edit the individual files on their personal computer or mobile device consuming both the user's time and effort. Since for many users there is no easy way to combine all of the pictures and videos captured from one event, the video clips and still photographs will usually remain separate files, never to be easily viewed as one presentation.","With camcorders and mobile cameras, a user may record and save multiple, usually limited-length, video clips and still photographs. The videos clips and photographs are usually saved directly to memory within the camcorder or mobile camera and comprise associated metadata specifying the length, time and date the video clip or photograph was recorded. With camcorders, a user may record and save multiple video clips. Further, a user may record, pause and resume recording at a later time.","Referring to , a representation of a video clip from a current mobile video camera\/camcorder according to the prior art is illustrated. The video clip of  illustrates how prior art mobile video camera\/camcorders store and present multiple video clips. As shown in , the multiple video clips are saved and stored as separate files in memory of the prior art mobile video camera\/camcorders. Therefore, if a user would like to create a composition of an event, they would be required to download and edit the various video clips on a personal computer.","Referring to , a representation of a video clip from a current video camcorder according to the prior art is illustrated. The video clip of  illustrates how prior art video camcorders store and present multiple video clips. As shown in , the multiple video clips are saved and stored as a continuous video file with basic jump cuts automatically inserted in between the separate files. Therefore, as noted above, in order for the user of an existing prior art camera\/camcorder to create a finalized composition of video clips and\/or photographs with transitions, music backgrounds, filter, etc., the user is required to download all the files to a personal computer and use video\/photograph editing software to create a finalized composition.","Prior art cameras and camcorders do not allow for a user to insert a title, credits, volume-mixed music backgrounds, or transitions before between or after their pictures and video clips as they are being recorded. Therefore, in order for the user to combine all the pictures and video clips from a specific event (e.g. a birthday, a holiday, a vacation) and to include a title, credits, music and\/or transitions, the user must download all the pictures and video clips to a personal computer installed with a picture\/video compilation program, and manually edit the selected pictures and video clips on the personal computer to create a finished video. This requires the user to own and learn how to use the video compilation program in order to create one extended video summarizing an event. Thus, there is a need for a method and apparatus that can automatically combine multiple pictures and videos clips together with transitions, filters, music backgrounds, titles, and credits, using a camera\/camcorder as the pictures and videos are being recorded.","Further, there exists prior art applications, such as iMovie\u00ae for the iPhone\u00ae, that enable a user to edit their individual video clips and still photographs into a final composition on a mobile device. However, prior art applications require that the user exit the editing timeline and enter a separate camera mode in order to record a single video clip or still photograph. Without a constant live preview of the event, users often miss an important moment they would like to record while they are switching back and forth between the camera mode and editing timeline mode. Therefore, there exists a need for an application that allows the user to create a final composition of multiple video clips and still photographs without having to exit the camera\/camcorder function of the application, and thus allows the user to capture any moment that may arise while they are also simultaneously creating a composition with seamlessly added transitions, filters, music, titles and credits.","In one embodiment, the present invention relates to methods and apparatuses for recording, editing, and combining multiple video clips and still photographs with transitions, filters, music, titles and credits into a finished composition.","In another embodiment, the present invention allows for the user to preview live video action while simultaneously maintaining the instant ability to add video clips and still photographs captured from the live action at any moment or delete the last video clip captured and to combine those video clips and still photographs with transitions, filters, credits, titles, music and other effects into a finished composition.","In yet another embodiment, the present invention is an application that allows the user to create a composition without having to exit the camera\/camcorder application or camera\/camcorder portion of the application, and thus allows the user to capture any moment that may arise and add a video clip of that moment to their composition while they are also simultaneously creating a composition with seamlessly added transitions, filters, credits, titles, music and other effects.","In yet another embodiment, the present invention is a method of dynamically creating a video composition comprising: a) recording a first real-world event as a first video clip using a video composition creation program residing on a portable device in response to a first user user record input, the portable device comprising a camera lens, a processor, a memory device, and a display device that displays an image of the first real-world event perceived by the camera lens during the recording of the first real-world event;

Information acquired via the voice detection system or service API may be used to automatically add captions, bubbles or applicable information on video clips, photographs, the title screen, the credits screen or any other portion of the finalized composition.","The Speech-To-Text system or service API can be used to convert the spoken word portions of a recorded audio track of a video clip or the audio track of an audio recording into written text where possible for the purposes of automatically adding subtitles, closed-captioning or meta-data to a video clip or the final composition.","The Text-To-Speech system or service API can be used to convert textual data either gathered automatically, such as current time, weather, date and location, or inputted by the user, such as titles and credits, into spoken voice audio for the purposes of automatically adding this audio to a recorded video clip or the final composition. This may be used to assist the visually impaired or in combination with the Translation Service API to convert the text gathered from the Speech-To-Text service into spoken audio track in an alternate language.","The translation system or service API can be used for the purposes of automatically converting textual data either gathered automatically, such as current time, weather, date and location, or input by the user, such as titles and credits, into another language for localization or versioning when sharing over worldwide social networks or in combination with Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech to provide visual or audible translations of content.","A Pixel-Motion Detection system or service API can be used to determine the speed of movement either of the camera or the recording subject for the purposes of smoothing out camera motion for an individual recorded video clip or the final composition. Further, the Pixel-Motion Detection system or service API may also be used to automatically select a music background or sound FX audio based on the measured movement for an individual recorded video clip or the final composition. In one embodiment of the present invention, the Pixel-Motion Detection system of service API uses the beats per minute of a song to determine whether it matches the measured movement for a recorded video clip or final composition. In alternate embodiments, the determination of whether a song is \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cslow\u201d may be determined by the user.","A music database system or service API can be a locally or publicly accessible database of songs or tracks with information such as appropriate locations, seasons, times of day, genres and styles for the purposes of using known information about the video composition, and automatically selecting and incorporating a particular music track into a finalized composition based on the known information. For example, such a database might suggest a Holiday song on a snowy day in December in Colorado, USA or a Beach Boys song on a Sunny Day at the beach in San Diego USA. In one embodiment, the song would be automatically added to the composition to simplify user input. In alternate embodiments, the user has the ability to selectively choose the variables that determine which songs are to be incorporated into the finalized composition.","An NFC chip could be used to display on a media segment the information communicated by nearby NFC or RFID chips in products, signs or etc. An ambient light sensor could be used to adjust exposure or to add ambient light data to meta data for later color correction assistance in editing. A proximity sensor could be set somewhere on the face of the mobile device and is intended to detect when the phone is near a user's ear. This may be used to help control the present invention, for example, such as by allowing a user to put their finger over the sensor to zoom in instead of using touch screen or other user interface.","A Wi-Fi chip may be used for higher performance mobile devices and for live connection to the Internet for city lookups from GPS data and other information that may be desired in credits or as captions. The Wi-Fi chip could also be used for remote video or audio phone call and for those calls to be recorded live with permission as a part of the composition.","An audio recording microphone may be used to record audio, but could also be used to control the present invention. For example, the microphone could be used for certain functions, such as pause, resume and zoom via voice commands or to auto-trigger recording of next live clip in surveillance situations. If two microphones are used, they could be used to detect compass direction of a sound being recorded out of the camera lens's view.","A motion sensor could be used to actively control the application without human intervention and to auto-trigger the recording of a next live dip in surveillance situations. Further, a motion sensor could be used to change, the shutter speed in real-time to reduce motion blur on a recorded media segment.","In other alternate embodients, the portable device  may comprise a three-dimensional (3D) dual-lens camera. In such embodiments, the present invention is further configured to record 3D video clips and photographs, and include metadata that comprises depth information obtained from one of the above mentioned advacned features into a finalized composition.","Various screen shots of the display device  will now be described in reference to . It should be understood the description of the display device  in  is just one example of a display that may be used in accordance with the present invention.","The first step of creating a composition  is to begin a recording session, in one embodiment, a recording session begins when the user initiates the present invention, the present invention being an application or program residing on the memory of the portable device . The initiation of the present invention may be starting the present invention and choosing an option to initiate a recording session, or simply powering the portable device  that comprises the present invention. After the user begins a recording session, the display device  of the portable device displays an image of a real-world event perceived by the lens  of the portable device , thereby enabling the user to see what the video clip or photograph will look like if and when recorded.","Referring to , a perspective view of the display device  according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The display device  of  comprises a main display , an action button , zoom bar , a switch lens button , a flash button , a preference button , a library button , and a white balance toggle .","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the user is creating a composition , for example recording video clips and\/or photographs and adding effects such as transitions in-between media segments as noted above, the main display  is be configured to always display an image of a real-world even perceived by the lens , thereby enabling the user to record a video clip or photograph while simultaneously creating the composition . Therefore, the user does not potentially miss a moment they would like to capture with a video clip or photograph while they are adding transitions or other effects to the composition .","Referring to , the action button  is configured to allow the user to switch between multiple states of the portable device , such as, for example \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cpause\u201d and \u201cadd video.\u201d  illustrates the display device  at the beginning a recoding session. As shown, the action button  is in a \u201crecord\u201d state where the user may begin the process of recording video clips and still photographs so to dynamically create a composition. If a user operates the action button  when it is in the \u201crecord\u201d state, the portable device  begins recording a video clip, to thereby delimit the beginning of the video clip. The video clip is a recording of a first real-world event perceived by the lens  of the portable device .","After the user initiates the \u201crecord\u201d state, the action button  switches to the \u201cpause\u201d state (as shown in ). If the user is currently recording a video clip and operates the action button  when it is in the \u201cpause\u201d state, the video clip is paused and that particular video clip is saved in memory . Therefore, operating the action button  when it is in the \u201cpause\u201d state, delimits the ending of the video clip w\/o concluding the recording session. Once the user operates the action button  when it is in the \u201cpause\u201d state, the recording of the video clip is concluded, the recorded video clip is added to the composition , and the action button  switches to the \u201cadd video\u201d state. Further, as discussed in more detail below, a transition toolbar  may be overlaid over the main display  of the display device  (as shown in ).","Thereafter, if the user operates, the action button  when it is in the \u201cadd video\u201d state, the recording of a second real-world event by the lens  of the portable device  commences (as shown in ), and the action button  switches back to the \u201cpause\u201d state. Subsequently, if the user continues to record additional video clips, the action button  will continue to switch between the \u201cpause\u201d state and the \u201cadd media\u201d state until the user decides to conclude the recording session and save the composition. Similar to operating the action button  when it is in the \u201crecord\u201d state, operating the action button  when it is in the \u201cadd media\u201d state delimits the beginning of a video clip to enable additional video clips to be recorded and included into the composition during the single recording session. The additional video clip is a recording of a second real-world event perceived by the lens  of the portable device . It should be noted that the second real-world event can be a subsequent temporal portion of the first real-world event, or it can be another different real-world event. Further, as discussed in more detail below, both the first and second real-world events may be perceived by one single lens of the portable device , multiple different lenses of the portable device , or by lenses of a secondary device.","The above mentioned process may be repeated to record any number of real-world events during a single recording session. As discussed in more detail below, a recording session may be concluded when the user operates the save button . The invention however is not so limited and in alternate embodiments, the action button  may be configured to allow the user to switch between other states, such as, for example, rewind and slow motion.","In embodiments where the portable device  comprises more than one lens , the switch lens button  is configured to enable the user to switch between lenses prior to taking a photograph or recording a video clip. When the switch lens button  is operated, the main display  is switched between images of real-world events perceived by the each lens  of the portable device . Therefore, the switch lens button  is configured to change the image displayed on the main display  from an image perceived by one lens to an image perceived by another lens. It should be noted that in alternate embodiments of the present invention, the lens button  may be used while recording a video clip and may provide the user with a mechanism to record successively or simultaneously from more than one lens  without having to end or pause the recording of a single video clip. It should be noted that there is no limit to the number of lenses that may be configured for use with the present invention. Further, as discussed in detail below with reference to , the lenses configured for use with the present invention do not have to reside on the same portable device .","The zoom bar  is configured to allow the user to zoom the lens  away from or towards a real-world event. If the user taps the \u201c+\u201d sign at the top of the zoom bar , the camera lens  will zoom towards the real-world event being recorded, thereby enabling the user to get a closer perspective of the real-world event being recorded. If the user taps the \u201c\u2212\u201d sign at the bottom of the zoom bar , the camera lens  is configured to zoom away from the real-world event being recorded, thereby enabling the user to record a larger portion of the real-world event being recorded.","The flash button  is configured to allow the user to turn the flash  on or off while either taking a photograph or recording a video clip. Further, the flash button  may also be configured to allow the user to switch the flash into a strobe mode. A strobe mode is where the flash is alternating between an \u201con\u201d state and an \u201coff\u201d state to create the effect of a strobe light.","As discussed in more detail below, the library button  is configured to allow the user to view their library of video clips, photographs, and compositions. The white balance toggle  is configured to allow the user to switch between white balance lock and white balance unlock. Although white balance is shown herein, the invention is not so limited and alternate embodiments, the balance toggle  may be configured to allow the user to switch between any color balance adjustments.","The preference button  is configured to provide the user with a variety of settings and user preferences.

For example, the user may choose a recording mode that has a preset transition to be inserted between each recorded video clip of a composition, thereby allowing for the dynamic creation of a composition.","For further example, one recording mode may be a \u201cprofessional\u201d recording mode, whereby a specific transition is automatically inserted between video clips, a title and credits are inserted upon user input, but music or audio is not included. For further example, the default recording mode may be a \u201cuser custom\u201d recording mode, whereby the user is prompted to select and configure all the available options and effects, including transition types, title, credits and music prior to beginning a single recording session. Thereafter, if the user begins a recording session and selects the \u201cuser custom\u201d recording mode, when the user has recording multiple video clips and\/or photographs and completed the recording session, the preconfigured options and effects of the \u201cuser custom\u201d recording session will be automatically incorporated into the composition. It should be noted that the invention is not limited in the number or type of recording modes having any combination of options and\/or effects may be included.","Further, in an alternate embodiment, a recording-mode may be pre-set such that any combination of various effects (audio, music, transitions, filters, titles, captions, or credits) and\/or data recorded or obtained from the advanced features (e.g., GPS chip, compass, accelerometer chip, gyroscope chip, thermometer chip, temperature sensor, facial detection API, pixel motion detection API, voice detection API, Speech-To-Text API, Text-To-Speech API, music database API, translation API, heart rate sensor, NFC chip, RFID chip, ambient light sensor, motion sensor, audio recording microphone, altimeter chip, Wi-Fi chip and\/or cellular chip) may be automatically incorporated into the composition either at random or in response to computer detectable information. Computer detectable information may include the current date, time, or location of the portable device  or the facial detection, voice detection, etc. of an individual that is captured in a recorded media segment (video clip or photograph) of the composition.","For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the date may be automatically set as the title of a composition upon its creation without any additional user input required. For further example, in another embodiment of the present invention, music can be incorporated into a composition based on the time of year or the user's location without requiring user input. Moreover, in yet another embodiment, the voice of a specific individual recorded in a video clip may be automatically translated to a different language and subtitles may be incorporated into the composition during the play-back of that particular video clip. It should be understood that the preceding examples are for explanation purposes only and in no way limited the scope of the present invention. The pre-set recording modes of the present invention may be configured such that any particular combination of effects or data may be automatically incorporated into a composition without the requirement of additional user input. In the pre-set recording modes, the user simply records a video clip or photograph and the present invention automatically incorporates the content or data into a final composition without the requirement of additional user input.","In another embodiment, the preference button  is configured to allow the user to edit the composition. Referring to , one example of an edit screen of the present invention.

If the user chooses to delete the just recorded media segment forever, the just recorded video clip or photograph is not included in the composition and not save in the memory  of the portable device . If the user chooses to save the just recorded media segment to the camera roll, then the just recorded video clip or photograph is not included in the composition being created; but the recorded video clip or photograph is saved to the memory  of the portable device . Therefore, at any later time, the user may include the video clip or photograph in this composition or another using the add media button , described in more detail below. After the user chooses an option from the delete options menu , the display device  returns to a display similar to that shown in , whereby the creation of the composition is still in progress.","Referring to , a perspective view of the display device  after the add media button  is operated according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The add media button  is configured to allow a user to add additional previously recorded media segments (video clips and photographs) to their composition as the composition is being recorded. If the add media button  is operated, an add media clip selection toolbar  is overlaid over the main display  of the display device . The clip selection toolbar  is configured to allow the user to select previously recorded media segments (video clips and photographs) saved in their clip library (shown in ). Further, since the add media button  and the clip selection toolbar  are operable while still viewing live events through the main display , the user does not have to miss a potential recording moment while attempting to add additional previously recorded media segments to their composition.","In one embodiment, the previously recorded media segments are be video clips and photographs recorded by the portable device  during the creation of the current composition or current recording session. Further, in other embodiments, the previously recorded media segments may be video clips and photographs that have been recorded by another application or another device, but which are saved in the memory  of the portable device . Moreover, the previously recorded media segments may have additional effects already included therein. For example, a user may choose to add a previously recorded video clip that has special effects already added thereto into the composition.","In an alternate embodiment, the add media button  is configured to add a content file. The content file may be a video clip previously recorded by the portable device , a photograph previously recorded by the portable device , a video clip previously recorded by a second device, a photograph previously recorded by the second device, a video clip comprising pre-added effects, a photograph comprising pre-added effects, a transition, a music background, or any other effect or data file.","Referring to , a perspective view of the display, device  after a user selects a previously recorded media segment (video clips and photographs) from the clip selection toolbar  according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. After the user selects to add a media segment using the add media button  and the user selects a media segment from the clip selection toolbar , a clip insertion toolbar  is overlaid over the main display  of the display device . The clip insertion toolbar  presents the composition being created in a timeline format, displaying the individual media segments and transitions as tiles on the toolbar . Further the clip insertion toolbar  is configured to allow a user to select where in the composition they would like to include the selected media segment. In the embodiment exemplified in , the user chooses the location by selecting one of the radio buttons  located on the clip insertion toolbar . Upon selecting a radio button  and thus a location in the composition to insert the selected media segment, the media segment is inserted into the composition.","The clip insertion toolbar  is further configured to allow a user to edit their composition using the edit toolbar . It should be noted that the edit toolbar  is substantially similar in presentation and operation as the edit toolbar  illustrated in  above. Therefore, the user may edit each video clip, photograph, transition and other segment (title, credits, music, etc.) of the composition using the edit toolbar  while still viewing live events through the main display  of the displace device .","Further, in an alternate embodiment, the user may operate the; add media button  and decide not to include anew video clip, but rather just re-order to edit the existing media segments in their composition. In such a case, the user would selection an option on the clip selection toolbar  to not include a new clip, whereby the clip insertion toolbar  would be presented on the main display  to allow the user to edit their composition while maintaining a live view in the main display .","It should be noted that in any of the described or exemplified embodiments discussed above if the user operates the action button  while the transitional selection toolbar \/, a clip selection toolbar , the clip insertion toolbar , or any other toolbar or menu is overlaid over the main display , a default selection is automatically made for the user, the toolbar or menu is removed from the main display  and the recording of a new video clip begins. For example, if the user has just recorded a video clip and is in the process of selecting a transition to include after the video clip, and a transition toolbar \/ is overlaid on the main display , the user may operate the action button  to record an additional clip, whereby the present invention will automatically select a default transition in lieu of receiving a user selected transition using the transition toolbar \/. Therefore, the user can record an additional video clip at any time during the creation of the composition, regardless of what step Or what toolbar\/menu is overlaid over the main display . Essentially, as long as the action button  remains on the main display , the user may almost instantaneously record an addition video clip to be added to their composition.","Referring to , a perspective view of the display device  allowing the user to select a transition according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. After the user selects the position to insert the selected media segment using the clip insertion toolbar  and makes any other edits to their composition using the clip insertion toolbar  and the edit toolbar , the display device  allows the user to select an additional transition to insert using the transition toolbar . It should be noted that the transition toolbar  is substantially similar is presentation and operation as the transition toolbar  described above with respect to . After the user selects a transition, the display device  returns to a screen similar to that shown in , whereby the user may continue to record additional media segments to be dynamically incorporated into their composition. However, it should be noted that in alternate embodiments the transition toolbar may be omitted after inserting a previously recorded media segment.","Still referring to , an add music button  and an add title\/caption button  according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. It should be noted that although the add music button  and the add title\/caption button  are not illustrated in other embodiments exemplified herein, the present invention is not so limited and in alternate embodiments the add music button  and the add title\/caption button  may be incorporated into the composition creation process at any point during a recording session, including prior to the user recording a first media segment.","Referring to , a perspective view of the display device  after the add music button  is operated according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. After the user operates the add music button , a music selection toolbar  is overlaid over the main display  of the display device . The music selection toolbar  is configured to allow the user to select a music background from their music library (shown in ) to be incorporated with the most recently recorded or selected media segment of the composition currently being created. Although the music selection toolbar  exemplified in  separates music by genre, the invention is no so limited and any other, display or categorization of available music may be used. After the user selects a music background segment, the music segment is incorporated into the composition to be played only during the particular media segment, preferably video clip, it is associated with. However, it should be noted that the invention is not so limited and in alternate embodiments the selected music background segment may be played during the entire composition or during multiple media segments of the composition. After the user selects a music segment, the display device  returns to a screen similar to that shown in , whereby the user may continue to record additional media segments to be dynamically incorporated into their composition.","Referring to , a perspective view of the display device  after the add title\/caption button  is operated according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. After the user operates; the add title\/caption button , a title\/caption toolbar  is overlaid over the main display  of the display device . The title\/caption toolbar  is configured to allow the user to enter a caption to the just recorded or just added media segment. For example, the user may add a note to title to a recorded video clip or photograph. After the user selects a title\/caption, the display device  returns to a screen similar to that shown in , whereby the user may continue to record additional media segments to be dynamically incorporated into their composition.","In an alternate embodiment, the present invention further comprises an Easy Recording Mode. In the Easy mode, the user will hot have the ability to insert pre-recorded media segments (but can record media segments), to insert custom transitions between media segments, or customize their composition during the creation thereof. Therefore, in Easy mode, default transitions, music backgrounds and other effects will be auto-selected and the title and credits will be auto-build from date and location information.","In another alternate embodiment, the present invention is further configured so that if a user exits the present invention on their portable device , perhaps to answer a phone call, take a picture or video clip with a secondary program, or simply save battery, the state of the present invention is maintained so that a user may return and continue to create their composition without having to start over or manually load their composition. For example, if the user is recording a composition and is currently in the pause state (between the recordings of media segments) and the user exits the present invention, the next time the user re-enters the present invention the user is returned to the same composition they were previously recoding still in the pause state. Therefore, the present invention allows a user to begin a recording session, and without ever ending or concluding the recording session, exit the present invention, record a media segment with a secondary program, and return to the recording session to include the media segment recorded with the secondary program.","Therefore, the above described non-linear composition creation method allows a user to dynamically create a composition in a non-linear format. Stated simply, the media segments (video clips and photographs) comprising the composition do not have to be presented in the order they are recorded, allowing for a more personalized and more flexible composition creation method.","While the foregoing description and drawings represent the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that various additions, modifications and substitutions may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the accompanying claims.
