{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is related to systems and methods for optimizing retrieval and review of Broadcast News via a computer network.","2. Background Art","Broadcast news sources and newspapers provide society with the vast majority of real-time information. Unfortunately, cost efficiencies and real-time pressures demand that producers, editors, and writers select and organize content for stereotypical audiences.","Therefore, what is needed is content understanding, user modeling, and tailored presentation that generates personalcasts through tracking and\/or inferring user content interests and display preferences.","An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for dynamically customizing search results (e.g., differences in display and\/or content profiles) comprising (a) accessing a display profile corresponding to a user, (b) using a content profile to search a database of information extracted from broadcast news sources to generate the search results, (c) using the display profile to display the search results, (d) determining relevance of the search results, (e) refining, based on the determined relevance, at least one of the display profile and the content profile, and (f) repeating steps (b) through (e) to provide refined search results.","Another embodiment of the present invention provides a system for dynamically customizing a display profile and a content profile used to identify and control display of search results to a user, comprising an authenticator device for authenticating the user, an accessing device for accessing the display profile corresponding to the user, a searching device for searching that uses the content profile to search a database of information extracted from broadcast news sources to generate the search results, a display device for displaying the search results using the display profile, a determining device for determining relevance of the search results, and a refining device for refining at least one of the display profile and the content profile based on the determined relevance.","In a further embodiment, the present invention provides a computer program product comprising a computer useable medium having a computer program logic recorded thereon for controlling at least one processor, the computer program logic comprising computer program code devices that perform operations similar to the devices in the above embodiment.","Further embodiments, features, and advantages of the present inventions, as well as the structure and operation of the various embodiments of the present invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Overview","While specific configurations and arrangements are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustrative purposes only. A person skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the pertinent art that this invention can also be employed in a variety of other applications.","In one embodiment, a system and method are provided that use local context analysis to expand a user's original query to most related terms in a corpus and\/or to allow the user to provide interactive feedback to enhance the relevance of selected news stories and the display of search results. By personalizing both the selection of stories and the form in which they are delivered or displayed, users are provided with tailored broadcast news. This individual news personalization provides more fine-grained content tailoring than conventional systems and does not rely on externally provided program metadata.","Overview of Personalcasting","People are offered vast quantities of news in the form of multiple media (text, audio, video, etc). News-on-demand algorithms and technologies provide more convenient access to broadcast news. Applications are being developed to provide on-demand access to multimedia information, such as radio and broadcast news, on a broad range of computing platforms (e.g., kiosk, mobile phone, PDA). Recent systems have been developed that automatically index, cluster\/organize, and extract information from news. Synergistic processing of speech, language and image\/gesture allow for enhanced interaction at the user interface and enhanced understanding of electronic media, such as web, radio, and television sources.","According to the following description, \u201cpersonalcast\u201d is being used to mean, for example, a custom created, interactive sequence of stories that are selected based upon specific, individual user interests from a variety of sources and presented in a form tailored to user preferences. An example personalcasting system and method is described in Maybury et al., \u201cPersonalcasting: Tailored Broadcast News,\u201d Special Issue on User Modeling and Personalization for TV, -, Vol. 14(1), Kluwer Academic, February 2004, pages 119-144, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The integration of methods from user modeling and user-adapted interaction, together with news understanding technologies, allows for new services, such as the delivery of story alerts to interested users as well as interactive, individual news programs that are referred to herein as personalcasts. Peronalcasting is distinct from personalized electronic programming guides (EPGs) in several primary ways: (1) metadata about content (e.g., programs and stories therein) is unavailable in personalcasting, so metadata must be automatically extracted from video sources via speech, text, and image processing; (2) user queries are analyzed linguistically, considering the available large broadcast news corpus; (3) tailoring is performed at a story level, and not a program level; and (4) user tasks are primarily focused on information analysis, and not on entertainment or enjoyment. In personalcasting, interactive search and query refinement improves searching through the use of automated relevance feedback.","Exemplary System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","104","1","104","106","106","108","110","112","112","114","114","116","114","106","114"],"i":"n"},"Network  can be a wired or wireless communications system that allows computers  to access information in storage devices , , and\/or  via controller . As examples, network  is an internet, intranet, or the like. In one example, each computer  functions as a conventional computer, allowing input (e.g., via keyboard or touch screen) and output (e.g., display, printing, audio, graphical, text, etc.) of data.","In one example, controller  stores a main program used by computers  to perform personalcasting. In other examples, each individual computer  stores a program to perform personalcasting.","Although shown as separate storage devices, in one example storage devices , , and\/or  are combined into one storage device.","In one example, display profile storage device  stores indexed display profiles indexed by user for one or more users. This information contains, but is not limited to, parts of normal display options a user desires to see when results are retrieved after a user query. Other terms that can be used for display profiles are media profiles, display preference profiles, media presentation profile, preference model, or the like.","As described in more detail below, content profile storage  stores indexed content profiles indexed by user or by user\/topic for one or more users. Content profiles relate to previous searches or search strings for one or more topics that a specific user or set of users has performed. Storing content profiles can allow for saving time during subsequent searches so that searches producing desired results can be used to retrieve new news stories or be used as starting points for additional searching. Another term for content profile is interest model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["220","114","116","112","220","222","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 3"]},"With reference to , , , and , BNE\/BNN device  uses video, audio, and closed-caption text information sources to automatically segment, extract, and summarize news programs. For each story matching a query  (), controller  presents a key frame, the three most frequent named entities within the story, and the source and date of the story. This screen is called a \u201cStory Skim\u201d  (). This, in essence, provides the user with a specific topic channel of information, tailoring the channel to their information interests. Moreover, the user can create arbitrarily complex queries combining key words, named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations), sources (e.g., CNN, MS-NBC, ABC), programs (e.g., CNN Prime News vs. CNN Headline New vs. CNN Moneyline, etc.), and time intervals (e.g., specific days, weeks, or years). These queries result in selected video stories specific to their interests.","In step  (), the user can then select any of the key frames to get access to a \u201cStory Details\u201d screen  (). In one example, \u201cStory Details\u201d screen  gives the user access to all people, organizations, and locations mentioned in the story, an automatically extracted one-line summary of the news (e.g., a sentence with the most frequently named entities), a key frame extracted from the story segment, and a pointer to the full closed-caption text and video source for review. In one example, BNE\/BNN device  provides navigation support, so that the user can select named entities and find stories including them. Further, by employing a clustering algorithm, controller  enables the user to select stories similar to the current story. Users perform both standing queries and ad-hoc searches. A user can subscribe to be alerted (e.g., via email) when a story containing a keyword or named entity is found. As we discuss in the subsequent sections, system  uses BNE\/BNN , controller , and storage devices , , and  to allow for personalization, as well as query expansion using Local Context Analysis (LCA).","Exemplary Personalcasting Operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","108","110","600","106","104"]},"In step , a display profile of a current user is accessed. In one example, this step is proceeded by an authentication step. Also, if this is a first time user, a display profile option screen will appear so that a user can set an initial display profile or possibly choose from optional preset display profiles.","In step , a content profile is used to search a database of information extracted from broadcast news sources to generate a search result. For example, storage  can be searched using a previously stored content profiled from storage . In another example, freehand text is input by the use at computer  instead of using a previously stored content profile. In another example, various terms are chosen from a screen. In another example, a combination of these methods are used.","In step , a display profile is used to display results. In one example, the display profile is accessed from storage  as being linked to the used. In another example, a default display profile can be used if a user is new or does not access their previously saved display profile, as is discussed above.","In step , system  determines relevance of the search results. In this embodiment, relevance is determined using explicit or implicit click stream analysis for content profile and\/or display profile. It is to be appreciated that collaborative filtering could also be used to determine relevance, in which saved searches of other users in a group can be analyzed to determine a most optimal search string for the current user.","In one example, relevance of content in the search results can be determined either explicitly or implicitly, as described in more detail below. When done explicitly, system  uses search results chosen by the user as being relevant. When done implicitly, in one example, system  analyses search results accessed by the user to determine most used common terms in the viewed search results.","In another example, relevance of parts of the display can be determined explicitly or implicitly, as described in more detail below. When done explicitly, a user is prompted to check which portions of the display they wish to view during subsequent searches. When done implicitly, in one example, system  analyses which portions of the display a user most often chosen, does not choose a lot, or does not choose at all.","In step , at least one of a display profile or a content profile is refined based on the determined relevance. In one example, refining can be to update the stored display profile or content profile based on the implicit and\/or explicit relevance. Updating the content profile, in one example, generates an expanded word list of more relevant terms that are common and\/or most used in the result(s) chosen.","In step , steps - are repeated to provide refined search results unless or until the user ends the session.","In one example, an additional step is provided where content and\/or display profiles are updated.","In one example, this is done automatically during or after a session using the implicit and explicit choices of a user during that session.","In another example, a user is prompted during or after the session to see if they would like to update either or both of the content and display profiles. In regards to display profiles, the prompt may appear after a user has chosen only certain display fields a predetermined number of times or after each refinement step before additional searching is performed based on the user's interaction with the search results. In terms of content profiles, the prompt may appear after a search topic changes during a search session or at the end of the entire search session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"600"},"In method , as shown in , users can explicitly define user profiles, which as discussed above include at least interest and display profiles.","Interest profiles indicate a user's interests by specifying simple keywords or named entities, such as individuals, locations, or organizations. They can also specify preferred broadcast sources to search (e.g., CNN, ABC News). The user's interest profiles can be run periodically and the retrieval results sent to the requester as an alert. This alert can be pointers to a story, story skim  () or story details  ().","Display profiles capture preferences for controlling the display of various media elements by manipulating media properties, such as the source, date, time, length, and preference type for media presentation (e.g., key frame only, story details, full video, text summary).","Because the original broadcast news source is segmented into its component parts, key elements can be extracted and others elements can be summarized. This enables a system not only to select stories based on a user's content interest, but also to assemble them in the manner for display as user preferences. For example, the user can be presented with only a key frame, with summary sentences, with people or place names, or with the entire source.","In one example, as discussed above, a feedback and collaborative filtering mechanism is also used. An individual user's model could then be modified with each search or within or across sessions, and the user could benefit from searches performed by others in a community.","Exemplary Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800"]},"The computer system  includes one or more processors, such as processor . Processor  can be a special purpose or a general purpose digital signal processor. The processor  is connected to a communication infrastructure  (for example, a bus or network). Various software implementations are described in terms of this exemplary computer system. After reading this description, it will become apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art how to implement the invention using other computer systems and\/or computer architectures.","Computer system  also includes a main memory , preferably random access memory (RAM), and may also include a secondary memory . The secondary memory  may include, for example, a hard disk drive  and\/or a removable storage drive , representing a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, an optical disk drive, etc. The removable storage drive  reads from and\/or writes to a removable storage unit  in a well known manner. Removable storage unit , represents a floppy disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, etc. which is read by and written to by removable storage drive . As will be appreciated, the removable storage unit  includes a computer usable storage medium having stored therein computer software and\/or data.","In alternative implementations, secondary memory  may include other similar means for allowing computer programs or other instructions to be loaded into computer system . Such means may include, for example, a removable storage unit  and an interface . Examples of such means may include a program cartridge and cartridge interface (such as that found in video game devices), a removable memory chip (such as an EPROM, or PROM) and associated socket, and other removable storage units  and interfaces  which allow software and data to be transferred from the removable storage unit  to computer system .","Computer system  may also include a communications interface . Communications interface  allows software and data to be transferred between computer system  and external devices. Examples of communications interface  may include a modem, a network interface (such as an Ethernet card), a communications port, a PCMCIA slot and card, etc. Software and data transferred via communications interface  are in the form of signals  which may be electronic, electromagnetic, optical or other signals capable of being received by communications interface . These signals  are provided to communications interface  via a communications path . Communications path  carries signals  and may be implemented using wire or cable, fiber optics, a phone line, a cellular phone link, an RF link and other communications channels.","In this document, the terms \u201ccomputer program medium\u201d and \u201ccomputer usable medium\u201d are used to generally refer to media such as removable storage drive , a hard disk installed in hard disk drive , and signals . Computer program medium and computer usable medium can also refer to memories, such as main memory  and secondary memory , that can be memory semiconductors (e.g. DRAMs, etc.) These computer program products are means for providing software to computer system .","Computer programs (also called computer control logic) are stored in main memory  and\/or secondary memory . Computer programs may also be received via communications interface . Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer system  to implement the present invention as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor  to implement the processes of the present invention, such as operations in controller  and computers  discussed above. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controlling systems of the computer system . Where the invention is implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into computer system  using removable storage drive , hard drive  or communications interface .","The invention is also directed to computer products comprising software stored on any computer useable medium. Such software, when executed in one or more data processing device, causes the data processing device(s) to operation as described herein. Embodiments of the invention employ any computer useable or readable medium, known now or in the future. Examples of computer useable mediums include, but are not limited to, primary storage devices (e.g., any type of random access memory), secondary storage devices (e.g., hard drives, floppy disks, CD ROMS, ZIP disks, tapes, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, MEMS, nanotechnological storage device, etc.), and communication mediums (e.g., wired and wireless communications networks, local area networks, wide area networks, intranets, etc.). It is to be appreciated that the embodiments described herein can be implemented using software, hardware, firmware, or combinations thereof.","Query Expansion And Relevance Feedback: Local Context Analysis",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1","FIGS. 6 and 7"],"b":["940","106","104","112","608"]},"In one example, query expansion is done using control flow . Using control flow , given a query  specified by the user, query processing  is performed, using controller , to select those passages of information in storage  containing at least one of the terms. Also, a Retrieval Status Value (RSV) is assigned to each of these passages according to the scoring formula. In one example, an Okapi formula is used, which is commonly considered one of the most robust and effective formulas developed to date for information retrieval. What is treated as a passage is application dependent. Passages can be paragraphs or paragraph-sized fixed windows of text. Sentences can also be treated as passages. At the other extreme, entire documents can be the passages used for LCA. In an example being discussed, a passage is considered as co-extensive with a news story.","During step , top rated passages are mined for promising concepts that can be used as additional query terms. In one example, concepts are simple words. In other examples, concepts correspond to any lexical, syntactic or semantic marking of documents. For example, the use of named entities as concepts may be desired for analyzing broadcast news information. Alternatively, concepts can be limited to some subset of named entities, persons, for example. In one example, a user controls the concept space on a per-query basis. User intuition may deem persons to be critical elements for one information need, where locations are likely to be most helpful for another. Syntactic units, such as noun or verb phrases, can also serve as concepts.","Once passages have been scored and ranked, in step  LCA selects the top N ranked passages and considers all the concepts appearing at least one time in these top N passages.","In one example, each concept is then scored using the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"c"}},{"mover":{"munder":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mi":"M"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"0.1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":"co_degree","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["w","i"]}}}}}},{"mi":"idf","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["w","i"]}}}]}}],"mo":"="}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-2","num":"00001.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"co_degree","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["w","i"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"idf","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"c"}},"mo":"\u00b7","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"co","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["w","i"]}}}},"mo":"+","mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"N"}}]}}],"mo":"="}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-3","num":"00001.3"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"co","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["w","i"]}}}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["p","is","a","passage"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":",","msub":{"mi":["w","i"]}}},{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mi":["p","c"],"mo":","}}],"mo":"\u00b7"}}],"mo":"="}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-4","num":"00001.4"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"idf","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mi":"min","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1.0","mo":",","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"\/","msub":{"mi":["N","x"]}}}},"mn":"5.0"}}}}],"mo":"="}}}]},"For each of the M query terms, w, a value co(c,w) is calculated. The co function measures how much the concept c co-occurs with term w. Each passage that contains both the concept and the term contributes a value. This value is equal to the product of the number of times c occurs and the number of times woccurs in the passage. The log of this measure (1 is added to avoid the possibility of taking the log of 0) is normalized relative to one occurrence of both c and win every passage and then multiplied by idf(c), giving the co_degree. The idf statistic is a measure of how rare a word is. The idf formula used for LCA, a variant of idf weighting used in most modem information retrieval systems, is a function of Nc, the number of passages containing the concept c, out of the total set of passages, which is of size N. The fewer passages containing the word, the greater the idf value. The co_degree is a measure of co-occurrence between the concept c and query word w. A weighted product of the co_degrees (weighted by the idf values for the query words) yields a measure of how valuable the candidate concept c is taken to be relative to the given query.","The above LCA formula for scoring concepts is designed to assign high values to concepts co-occurring with a large number of the query terms in a large number of the top ranked passages. The greater the number of passages, the greater the score. The greater the number of terms it co-occurs with in a given passage, the greater the score is incremented for that passage. The number of times these terms occur, as well as the number of times the concept itself occurs, also affect the degree to which a given passage augments the overall score.","In step , once all concepts have been evaluated, a predetermined number of the most highly scoring concepts are chosen. These concepts are then added to the original query terms. If necessary, collection statistics, which may not be pre-computed for concepts as they are for simple query terms, are gathered for the expansion concepts.","If a search session has not been ended by the user, a suggested expanded query  is presented to the user. The user can then decide on an expanded query , which is used in step  to generate results with top ranking documents .","The following are two examples of query expansion terms resulting from LCA:","initial query1: Palestinian Israeli conflict","top  query1 expansion concepts: Israel, violence, Palestinians, Hebron, Gaza, gunmen, tanks, city, hamas","initial query2: bush budget","top  query2 expansion concepts: surplus, Medicare, funding, cut, tax, fall, spending, fought, fund, popular",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1060","1042","1046","942","946","940","1060","1058","1048","948","1052"]},"These alternatives can be combined in various ways. Both the top relevant documents and a list of suggested expansion terms can be generated in response to the initial query. The user can then choose to reformulate the query based on the list of suggested terms and, possibly a quick review of the top ranked documents to get a sense of how the system responded to the initial query, or simply mark the retrieved documents as to relevance. In either case, the system can respond with both a new set of documents and an updated list of potential expansion terms. This cycle can be repeated any number of times. In addition, during any given interaction, the user can request that the system apply automatic query expansion and return the results of a feedback cycle in place of the list of candidate expansion terms and the top ranked documents from the unexpanded query.","User Interests And Preferences","There are a number of methods that can be applied to create and exploit a model of user interests and preferences. Regarding user interests and\/or information needs, typically these are captured in the form of content profiles explicitly stated by the user. This can occur in a user profile, in which a user can specify their information needs either as a list of keywords and\/or a list of named entities, e.g., people, organizations, or locations, as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1","FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["1170","104","604","1170","1172","110","1170","1172","1174","1176","1178","1180"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 13"],"b":["1282","1284","1286","1288","1390"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 3 and 5","FIGS. 6 and 7"],"b":["1390","1390","328","1392","1392","608"]},"Based upon preferences selected in , only two and a half stories are being displayed on screen . If the user had established a profile stating a preference for only one-line summaries, about twice as many stories could be displayed. However, the automatically generated one-line summary fails completely in story . The user would have no description of this story in a summary-only display. Desirably, the user is provided the flexibility of choice in presentation.","As discussed above in regards to step  () and other operations, a user's interests is determined not only by what they indicate interest in explicitly (e.g., their search keywords and\/or named entities), for example by using box , but also by reasoning about terms and\/or entities related to their stated interests, e.g., implicitly. For example, if a user searches for stories about the location (e.g., Iraq), the story set returned is analyzed and it might be determined that the person \u201cSaddam Hussein\u201d occurs frequently. Or if the person searches for stories in which the name \u201cSaddam Hussein\u201d and location \u201cIraq\u201d appear, she might frequently find the terms \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d or \u201cUN inspections\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1496","1496","1170","1490","1496","1496","1496","1496"]},"After selecting sources, time range, and the type of search in screen  () the user is presented detailed search tool screen  (). For each category selected in screen , a selectable menu of actual named entities with the ability to select one or more elements appears in screen .

In this example, the user types in the terms \u201cbush\u201d and \u201cwar.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1590","1170","1496","1592"]},"Controller  () or computer  () then uses LCA to expand the user's query terms, for example to perform step  () or other refinement operations discussed above. In particular, the terms \u201cBush\u201d and \u201cwar\u201d are expanded into a list which is displayed in  in area E. The expanded list includes person names such as \u201cDonald\u201d and \u201cRumsfeld,\u201d terms such as \u201cdevelopments\u201d and \u201cmoney,\u201d adjectival locations such as \u201cPakistani,\u201d and so on, as described above.","In the example in , the user selects the term \u201cIraq\u201d from the location menu and then reruns the query, expanded now to include the terms \u201cBush\u201d, \u201cwar\u201d, and \u201cIraq\u201d, for example to perform step  () or similar operations discussed above.","Another screen similar to screen  () would then be shown with updated results from the refined search. The user can again select a box similar to  for those stories from the returned story list that they deem most relevant to their information needs. The most frequently occurring terms in these selected stories will be added to further refine the user's query as discussed above.","Additional Aspects","Automatic Logging And Inference Of User Interests","With users increasingly learning, working, and playing in digital environments, monitoring user interactions is feasible and has shown value. In information seeking sessions, detecting selections and rejections of information provides an opportunity to induce individual and group profiles that can assist in content selection and presentation generation. For example, each of the user actions shown in  (e.g., query, story selection, media selection) affords an opportunity for modeling user interest in the first two actions and\/or preference in the last. In addition to explicit user interest collection, an implicit method could build an interest model by watching the user session to track the user's query, selection of particular stories, and choice of media. The system could then automatically construct content interest and display profiles.","Tailoring","More sophisticated mechanisms are required to tailor content to specific topics or users. In addition to content selection, material must be ordered and customized to individual user interests. This will require methods of presentation generation that integrate extracted or canned text with generated text.","Information Extraction","Other techniques being developed allow system  to automatically summarize, fuse, and tailor selected events and stories. This requires deeper understanding of the source news material beyond extracting named entities, key frames, or key sentences.","Multilingual Content","Because news is global in production and dissemination, it is important to support access to and integration of foreign language content. This poses not only multilingual processing challenges, but also requires dealing with different country\/cultural structures and formats.","Cross Story Fusion","An important aspect is not only the summarization of individual stories, but also summarizing across many stories, possibly from different sources or languages. This is particularly challenging when the sources are possibly inconsistent in content or form. This ultimately requires cross story multimodal presentation generation.","Persistence\/Transience Of Interest Profiles","Users' information needs tend to change over time, with profiles rapidly becoming out of date. Monitoring user queries and story selections over time is one method that can address this problem. Generalizing from their specific interests can yield an even richer user model.","Evaluation","Community defined multimedia evaluations will be essential for progress. Key to this progress will be a shared infrastructure of benchmark tasks with training and test sets to support cross-site performance comparisons.","System  can be considered either a Peronalcasting or Personalized Broadcast News Navigator (P-BNN) system that provides tailored content and presentation of broadcast video news. System  uses combined automated video understanding and extraction together with user modeling to provide individualized personalcasts at the story level based on broadcast network news. System  supports explicit user content and display profiles, it implicitly reasons about terms co-occurring with user query terms, and it accepts and modifies its model of the user's information need based on user feedback on the relevance of provided content. Accordingly, system  overcomes the fixed organization of news programs produced for stereotypical audiences by segmenting, selecting, and reordering content based on user preferences and feedback. Moreover, it represents an advance beyond program-level electronic program guides that are beginning to find their way into the commercial marketplace by not relying upon any externally provided program metadata and by providing more fine-grained content tailoring at the story rather than program level. Accordingly, it is believed this kind of interactive, fine-grained, content-based personalization will be fundamental to television and news understanding systems of the future.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
