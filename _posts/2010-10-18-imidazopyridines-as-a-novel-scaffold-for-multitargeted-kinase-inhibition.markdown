Specifically, 10 \u03bcL C-terminal GST-tagged, recombinant, human EGFR, amino acids 696-end containing the mutation L858R expressed by baculovirus in Sf21 cells (Millipore) was mixed with 10 ul inhibitor (various concentrations, 2% final DMSO) and 10 ul of ATP (50 \u03bcM final concentration) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl, 2 mM MnCl, 0.1% BSA and 1 mM DTT, 40 \u03bcL final volume). The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 ul of biotinylated peptide substrate (Biotin-Ahx-AEEEYFFLFA, 0.5 \u03bcM final concentration) in a black 384-well plate (Packard). After 60 minutes incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by addition 60 \u03bcL stop\/revelation buffer to give 30 mM EDTA, 1 \u03bcg\/ml streptavidin-APC (Prozyme), 50 ng\/ml anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PT66-K Europium Cryptate, 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mM KF, 0.005% Tween-20, 0.05% BSA).

kinase activity was assayed by a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) in vitro kinase assay (Mathis, G., () . J Biomol Screen, 1999. 4(6): p. 309-314). Specifically, 10 \u03bcL C-terminal GST-tagged, recombinant, human IGF1r, amino acids 954-1367 expressed by baculovirus in Sf21 cells (Cell Signaling Technology) was mixed with 10 ul inhibitor (various concentrations, 2% final DMSO) and 10 ul of ATP (50 \u03bcM final concentration) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl, 2 mM MnCl, 0.1% BSA and 1 mM DTT, 40 \u03bcL final volume). The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 ul of biotinylated peptide substrate (Biotin-Ahx-AEEEYFFLFA, 0.5 \u03bcM final concentration) in a black 384-well plate (Packard). After 60 minutes incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by addition 60 \u03bcL stop\/revelation buffer to give 30 mM EDTA, 1 \u03bcg\/mlstreptavidin-APC (Prozyme), 50 ng\/ml anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PT66-K Europium Cryptate, 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mM KF, 0.005% Tween-20, 0.05% BSA). The quenched reaction was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour and then read in a time-resolved fluorescence detector (Envision, Perkin Elmer) at 615 nm and 665 nm simultaneously. The ratio between the signal of 615 nm and 665 nm was used in the calculation of the IC.
