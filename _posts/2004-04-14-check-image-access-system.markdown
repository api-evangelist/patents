title: Check image access system
abstract: Systems and methods of processing financial transaction information are provided. In one embodiment, a financial institution runs an index generating software program to generate a downloadable index of images of cleared checks. The account customer uses complementary software to remotely download, search, and display the index of cleared check images, together with the images themselves. In another embodiment, the financial institution periodically runs a software program to generate digital archives of the cleared check images for the account customer. The account customer is provided with secure online access to the digital archives. The account customer may use standard financial bookkeeping software to download and display the cleared check images and associate the cleared check images with transactions in the associated account registers.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/449,306 for a \u201cFinancial Transaction Information Capturing and Indexing System,\u201d filed May 28, 2003, now abandoned which is herein incorporated by reference.","The invention relates generally to systems for accessing information, and more particularly, to systems for accessing financial transaction information.","For well over a decade, individuals and small businesses have had access to financial software packages, such as the Intuit Corporation's Quicken\u00ae software, to electronically store information about financial transactions. For much of that time, software has been available to download financial transaction information from financial institutions. Many financial institutions have made check images available to customers online. The check images can be copied or downloaded onto the computer of the customer. Those downloads, however, typically failed to reveal the payee named on the check, requiring software users to keep separate records\u2014such as carbon copies of the checks\u2014of the check number and payee, and then to manually enter such information into their financial transaction tracking software. Recently, it has been possible to download text information from credit cards and bank accounts into applications like Quicken and Quickbooks.","Also, existing financial software packages inadequately prepare taxpayers for an audit. During an audit, revenue officials often demand copies of cancelled or processed checks. But existing financial software packages lack any means for capturing and storing images of the processed checks and linking the images to a data file containing the key information on the checks. One known method of providing customers with check information has been to copy the information onto a CD-Rom and mail it to the customer. Because of the large size of the daily or monthly transactions, the downloading of statements and check images has not been simple and in many cases has not been practical.","Therefore, there is a long felt, but unmet meet, for improved financial transaction systems that are capable of automatically incorporating check image data, reducing the burdens of manual entry of payee information, or both by supplying the information in usable digital form.","There is also a need for system and software tools for capturing, organizing, and perusing financial transaction information, including the check images. Financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, and saving and loan institutions are currently spending large amounts of money to store or scan and archive images of the billions of cancelled checks, deposit slips, and other financial documents that they process every year. Some of these institutions mail copies of cancelled checks to their customers at great expense. The check images can also be downloaded. To reduce those expenses, others make their customers' account information, including check and deposit slip images, available to their customers online. The account information has also been made available on CD-Roms.","The customers of these financial institutions, however, have no efficient way of making a permanent record and searchable archive of the cancelled check or deposit slip images. Instead, such customers are typically required to open each check image individually, one at a time, and print or locally save the check image. For high-transaction-volume customers, this is an exceedingly time-consuming exercise. Needless to say, there is a substantial need for an efficient method of making a permanent and searchable database of a customer's check and deposit slip images.","This invention is directed to, but not limited by, one or more of the following objects, separately or in combination:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","122","124","126","128","130","124","130","122","124","122","126","128","120","170","172"]},"The computer  is capable of running software programs, including an operating system . Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a computer is a machine and that the execution of a software program on the computer  produces useful, concrete, and tangible results. Also, it will be understood that the remote computers  are also machines that comprise one or more processors, memory, data transfer buses, and the like (not shown), and which produce useful, concrete, and tangible results.","At least one of the one or more remote computers  maintains a repository  of check images and associated data such as check number, date, amount and sometimes payee. An optical character recognition (\u201cOCR\u201d) software module or program  may be provided to extract handwritten and\/or printed information from any stored check images to identify such items as the payee listed on the check, information listed in the memo field, check numbers, account numbers, and the like. Alternatively or in addition, such information may be obtained by conventional data entry means.","The financial transaction indexing system comprises an index generator  residing on one of the remote computers  and a complementary or data-compatible check data and image perusal system  residing on the customer's computer . The index generator  generates an index , preferably a searchable index, of a subset (not illustrated) of the check images and associated data stored in the repository . The subset may comprise all, or anything less than all, of the check images and data stored in the repository . For example, the subset may be limited by date range, customer account number, and other variables.","If the bank's repository  of check images simply contains image files, one or more simple HTML files will preferably be generated to incorporate the image files. The index generator  will then index the HTML files.","Techniques for generating the index include, but are not limited to, techniques described in our co-pending patent application Ser. Nos. 10\/449,306 and 09\/257,714, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. It will be understood that the index  may be comprised of either a single archived file or multiple files, and that the index  may either directly incorporate the images into the index, simply provide links to check images stored in the repository  or elsewhere, or both.","The check data and image perusal system  is capable of downloading the generated index  and associated check images (whether the check images are incorporated into the index  or not), saving the index  to memory , and providing the customer with searchable access to the index and associated images. The check data and image perusal system  may be a full or stripped-down version of the information capturing and indexing system described in our co-pending patent application identified by Ser. No. 10\/449,306. For example, the check data and image perusal system  may include a graphical user interface and web browser that acts as a client to a remote web server and displays HTML files having formatting control tags in a graphical user interface in accordance with the formatting control tags of the HTML files. The check data and image perusal system  may also include a database selection module and a search module.","Alternatively, the check data and image perusal system  is a cooperative or integral part of a financial bookkeeping software program  (including, if permitted via license or assignment of any patent derived from this application, commercially well-known programs such as Intuit's Quicken\u2122 and Quickbooks\u2122 programs, Microsoft's Money\u2122 program, and Peachtree's Peachtree Accounting\u2122 program).","The check data and image perusal system  or financial bookkeeping software program  of which it is a part is also optionally equipped with an OCR module  to extract handwritten and\/or printed information from any stored check images to identify such items as the payee listed on the check, information listed in the memo field, check numbers, account numbers, and the like, and record the corresponding financial transaction. The user of a financial bookkeeping software program  equipped with such capabilities could furthermore be given an opportunity to verify the information extracted from the check image. Such an embodiment would advantageously spare a user of a financial bookkeeping software program  the burden of manually entering such information to record a financial transaction. Persons of ordinary skill in the art of OCR will appreciate how to structure and code an OCR module  to extract such useful information from a check image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","172","182","172","220","172","142","110","142","120"]},"The National Check Fraud Center reports that a type of check fraud known as \u201ccheck washing\u201d is growing at an alarming rate, defrauding consumers and financial institutions close to $1 billion per year. Check washing refers to the practice of erasing the ink on a stolen check (often using a common household cleaning product such as acetone, benzene, or bleach) and rewriting the amount or payee, or both, on the check. Generally, consumers who do not report any problem within 30 days of receiving their bank statements become liable for any losses. Those consumers (and there are many) who do not receive or check their cancelled or processed checks to verify that the amounts were paid to the proper payee risk falling victim to such frauds. And consumers who limit their verification efforts to confirming that their checks were cashed for the amount originally written on the check risk falling prey to thieves who check wash only the payee listed on the check.","Despite the long-felt need for systems to alert consumers to such frauds, vendors of popular financial transaction software programs have not, to the applicants' knowledge, conceived, reduced to practice, or sold versions of programs to effectively address this problem. Instead, year after year, many vendors seem content to crank out \u201cnew\u201d versions of software that scarcely improve upon past versions, tinker with the interface, and do little more than churn (i.e., promote and demote between \u201cstandard,\u201d \u201cprofessional,\u201d \u201cpremium\u201d and subscription-based products) features introduced in previous versions of the software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","310","160","162","160","160","320","330","340","350","342","360","362","182","172","340","350","182"]},"Next, the index generator  generates an index  of check data and images. The customer, using the financial bookkeeping software program  on his computer , accesses one of the remote computers  over the network and downloads the index , including the associated check images. Then, a check image\/data mapping module  identifies the check numbers, payees, and check amounts reflected on the associated check images (using OCR capabilities, if necessary). A mismatch detection module  compares the check number, payee, and check amount identified by the mapping module  with the information manually entered or prerecorded by the customer or automatically recorded by the check generation module . If a mismatch is identified, the financial bookkeeping software  alerts the user. The financial bookkeeping software  is also optionally configured to transmit an alert over the network  to the financial institution serving the customer, the financial institution that cashed or deposited the check, or the Federal Reserve .","In an alternative embodiment, the mismatch detection module  is equipped to differentiate images using techniques known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. In this embodiment, the mismatch detection module  would compare an image of the check when written or printed with the image of the downloaded check. In one embodiment, the financial bookkeeping software  would infer what the original check image looked like on the basis of data stored about the type of check stock used and the information printed on the check through the check generation module . In other embodiment, the financial bookkeeping software  would obtain an image of the check produced by a scanner or imager (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["400","220","400","440","430","410","440","430","410","440","410","412","414","416","416","422","424","426"]},"The word \u201cindex,\u201d as used in the specification, unless specified otherwise or unless otherwise mandated by the context, may either refer to the meta-data  exclusive of the check images , process data , and OCR data  (if any) associated with the meta-data , or to the meta-data  together with the check images , process data , and OCR data  (or a copy or derivation of the same).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["500","520","110","530","142","220","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","110","620","630"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","160","710","160","160","720","1010","740","160","930"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["810","182","820","830","220","220"]},"As illustrated in block , the index generation process preferably creates copies of the HTML encapsulation files and inserts authentication information (such as a hash code) into the HTML files. Authentication methods are disclosed in our parent patent application Ser. No. 10\/449,306. Preferably, the hash codes are generated from the content of both the HTML encapsulation file and the digital check image(s) it encapsulates. In this manner, alterations to either the encapsulation file or the digital check image(s) can be detected.","In step , a wrap-around program (which may be separate from or an integral module of the index generator) zips the HTML encapsulation files, check images, index, and optionally also an account statement into an encrypted and preferably password-protected archive . In step , one of the remote computers  serving the bank sends the account customer an e-mail notifying the customer that new transaction information (such as an account statement or a check image archive) is available. In step , the customer clicks or executes an e-mail link or attachment, which causes the customer's browser or financial bookkeeping software  to connect to the bank's website or server.","In step , the customer provides a password to access the bank's website or server. The financial bookkeeping software  may also exchange one or more encryption keys with the remote computer  to safeguard the information transaction. After the customer is logged in, in step  the customer is given the opportunity to download a statement and the indexed check image archive . Alternatively, the indexed check image archive  is automatically downloaded to the customer's financial bookkeeping software  or check data and perusal system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["910","950","810","850","910","182","920","930","220","940","950","142"]},"In step , the customer launches the financial bookkeeping software program , a check data and perusal system , or a regular browser like Microsoft's Internet Explorer\u00ae resident on computer . In step , the customer executes an option to log into the bank's website or server. In a financial bookkeeping software program , this might be accomplished by selecting a \u201cdownload transactions\u201d option or something similar. In a regular browser or in a check data and perusal system  equipped with a browser, this might be accomplished by directing the browser to a website for perusing the customer's account information. In step , the customer provides a password to access the bank's website or server. One or more encryption keys may also be exchanged to provide secure access to the transaction information. If a regular browser is used, then in step , the website or server recognizes a cookie on the customer's computer, and instructions are executed to launch the customer's financial bookkeeping software  or check data and perusal system . Alternatively, if the website has been accessed through the browser of a check data and perusal system , the customer may click on a button (like the dollar sign icon  in ) or select a menu option to send a code to the remote computer  asking it to download any available indexed check image archives .","In step , the indexed check image archives  are downloaded to the customer's computer . If operated through the customer's check data and perusal system , a folder selection dialog box  is opened to prompt the customer to define or select a database or folder  into which to save the downloadable archive  generated by the index generator .","Persons of ordinary skill in the art, enlightened by the present specification and those incorporated by reference, will understand how to build a system or write software code capable of carrying out the inventive concepts disclosed herein.","It will be seen that the invention can be expressed in many structurally or functionally distinct ways, in varying degrees of scope, and with many different combinations of elements.
