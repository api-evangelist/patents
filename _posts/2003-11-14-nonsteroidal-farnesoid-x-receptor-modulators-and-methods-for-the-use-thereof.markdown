title: Non-steroidal farnesoid X receptor modulators and methods for the use thereof
abstract: The efficient regulation of cholesterol synthesis, metabolism, acquisition, and transport is an essential component of lipid homeostasis. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a transcriptional sensor for bile acids, the primary product of cholesterol metabolism. Accordingly, the development of potent, selective, small molecule agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists of FXR would be an important step in further deconvoluting FXR physiology. In accordance with the present invention, the identification of novel potent FXR activators is described. Two derivatives of invention compounds, bearing stilbene or biaryl moieties, contain members that are the most potent FXR agonists reported to date in cell-based assays. These compounds are useful as chemical tools to further define the physiological role of FXR as well as therapeutic leads for the treatment of diseases linked to cholesterol, bile acids and their metabolism and homeostasis.

In a particular aspect, the present invention relates to non-steroidal modulators of farnesoid X receptors (FXR). In another aspect, the present invention relates to methods for modulating FXR-mediated processes employing the novel compounds described herein.","The following discussion of the background of the invention is merely provided to aid the reader in understanding the invention and is not admitted to describe or constitute prior art to the present invention.","The efficient regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism, acquisition and transport is an essential function of mammalian cells. High levels of cholesterol are associated with atherosclerosis, a leading cause of death in the western world and a major risk factor correlated with the occurrence of coronary heart disease and stroke. Until recently, recommendations for the treatment of hypercholestemia were focused on the use of statins, which inhibit the de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol, and the use of bile acid sequestering agents. While statin-based agents are still in widespread use as cholesterol-lowering drugs, an evolving understanding of the mechanisms controlling cholesterol homeostasis has led to new molecular targets as candidates in therapeutic intervention.","Cholesterol metabolism is controlled through a complex feedback loop involving cholesterol itself and bile acids (which are primary oxidation products), and through secretion in the gut, the single most critical regulators of cholesterol absorption. The nuclear receptors LXR (liver X receptor) and FXR (farnesoid X receptor) are the specialized sensors of cholesterol and bile acids that control transcription of networks encoding key metabolic enzymes. For example activation of LXR by oxysterols (i.e., mono-oxygenated cholesterol metabolites) leads to the up-regulation of CYP7A1, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. In turn, bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 1, a low affinity endogenous agonist for FXR, whose structure is shown below) are potent ligands for FXR, whose activation leads to down-regulation of CYP7A1, leading to the completion of the feedback circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"35.73mm","wi":"69.77mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Thus, the identification of potent, selective, small molecule FXR agonists, partial agonists and antagonists would be powerful tools and would have many potential applications. For example, such compounds would facilitate the in vivo analysis of FXR physiology in vivo. In addition, such compounds, in conjunction with DNA arraying technology, might allow for the discovery of new gene products under the control of FXR. Further, FXR modulators might find potential utility in the treatment of cholestasis and other disease states associated with aberrant levels, flow and release of bile acids. Moreover, in the absence of a crystal structure of FXR, a thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of ligands that modulate the activity of FXR would allow for the delineation of the structural requirements for ligand binding and might aid in the design of future ligands and potential therapeutics.","In accordance with the present invention, the identification of novel potent FXR activators is described. Initial screening of a 10,000-membered, diversity-orientated library of benzopyran containing small molecules for FXR activation utilizing a cell-based reporter assay led to the identification of several lead compounds owning low micromolar activity (EC's=5-10 \u03bcM. These compounds were systematically modified employing parallel solution-phase synthesis and solid-phase synthesis to provide numerous compounds that potently activate FXR. Two derivatives of invention compounds, bearing stilbene or biaryl moieties, contain members that are the most potent FXR agonists reported to date in cell-based assays. These compounds are useful as chemical tools to further define the physiological role of FXR as well as therapeutic leads for the treatment of diseases linked to cholesterol, bile acids and their metabolism and homeostasis.","In accordance with the present invention, there are provided compounds having the structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"30.56mm","wi":"53.51mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"A is a C3 up to C8 branched chain alkyl or substituted alkyl group, a C3 up to C7 cycloalkyl or substituted cycloalkyl, an optionally substituted aryl or an optionally substituted heteroaryl,","X is \u2014C(O)\u2014 or \u2014CH\u2014,","R is methyl or ethyl,","Ris H, hydroxy, alkoxy, benzoyloxy, mesityloxy, or \u2014OCHC(O)OCH,","Ris H or Rcan cooperate with Rto form a benzopyran, wherein the pyran ring has the structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"22.78mm","wi":"25.48mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein:\n\n","Rcan cooperate with Rto form a benzopyran having the structure set forth above, or Ris alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl, or optionally substituted arylalkenyl or heteroarylalkenyl,","Ris H or hydroxy, and","Ris H, hydroxy, alkoxy or aryloxy.","As employed herein, \u201calkyl\u201d refers to saturated straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical having in the range of 1 up to about 20 carbon atoms. \u201cLower alkyl\u201d refers to alkyl groups having in the range of 1 up to about 5 carbon atoms. \u201cSubstituted alkyl\u201d refers to alkyl groups further bearing one or more substituents selected from hydroxy, alkoxy (of a lower alkyl group), mercapto (of a lower alkyl group), cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, heterocyclic, substituted heterocyclic, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, nitrone, amino, amido, \u2014C(O)H, acyl, oxyacyl, carboxyl, carbamate, dithiocarbamoyl, sulfonyl, sulfonamide, sulfuryl, and the like.","As employed herein, \u201calkenyl\u201d refers to straight or branched chain hydrocarbyl groups having at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and having in the range of about 2 up to 20 carbon atoms, and \u201csubstituted alkenyl\u201d refers to alkenyl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.","As employed herein, \u201calkoxy\u201d refers to \u2014O-alkyl groups having in the range of 2 up to 20 carbon atoms and \u201csubstituted alkoxy\u201d refers to alkoxy groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.","As employed herein, \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d refers to a cyclic ring-containing groups containing in the range of about 3 up to about 8 carbon atoms, and \u201csubstituted cycloalkyl\u201d refers to cycloalkyl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.","As employed herein, \u201cheterocyclic\u201d refers to cyclic (i.e., ring-containing) groups containing one or more heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S, or the like) as part of the ring structure, and having in the range of 3 up to 14 carbon atoms and \u201csubstituted heterocyclic\u201d refers to heterocyclic groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.","As employed herein, \u201caryl\u201d refers to aromatic groups having in the range of 6 up to 14 carbon atoms and \u201csubstituted aryl\u201d refers to aryl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.","As employed herein, \u201caryloxy\u201d refers to \u2014O-aryl groups having in the range of 6 up to 14 carbon atoms and \u201csubstituted aryloxy\u201d refers to aryloxy groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.","As employed herein, \u201carylalkenyl\u201d refers to aryl-substituted alkenyl groups and \u201csubstituted arylalkenyl\u201d refers to arylalkenyl groups further bearing one or more substituents as set forth above.","As employed herein, \u201cheteroaryl\u201d refers to aromatic groups having in the range of 4 up to about 13 carbon atoms, and at least one heteroatom selected from O, N, S, or the like;

Replacement of the benzoyl group in region II of compound 102 with the cyclohexylcarbonyl moiety afforded the even more potent compound 149 (EC=188 nM).","Although compound 149 (EC=188 nM) represents a significant improvement in potency over compound 65 (EC=348 nM), it was not readily apparent how the activity of this class of compounds could be further improved. Therefore, it was decided to examine the effect of replacing the benzopyran moiety with other ring systems.","Thus, a series of compounds (i.e., Compounds 104-129) in which the benzopyran moiety was replaced with certain groups of varying molecular diversity was prepared (see Examples 10 to 17) and tested.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0077"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00025","num":"00025"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00025","he":"227.41mm","wi":"59.01mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00025.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00026","num":"00026"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00026","he":"223.77mm","wi":"63.42mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00026.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00027","num":"00027"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00027","he":"111.42mm","wi":"40.47mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00027.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Biological assays showed that replacement of the benzopyran with a small aromatic unit generally had a detrimental effect on activity. For instance, compounds 110 and 112-117 were inactive, while compounds 111 and 118 showed only moderate activation of FXR (EC=680 nM and 606 nM, respectively; see Table 3 in Example 1). However, replacement of the benzopyran with an aromatic ring bearing substituents at the para position produced compounds with improved activity. For example, 4-tert-butyl cinnamate 105 (EC=127 nM), stilbenes 121 and 122 (EC=36 and 208 nM, respectively), biaryls 124-127 (EC=510, 69, 77, 227 nM, respectively) and aryl thiophenes 128 and 129 (EC=206 and 256 nM, respectively) were all potent activators of FXR in the cell-based reporter assay (see Tables 1, 9, 10 and 11 in Example 1).","This initial survey of the three regions of SAR outlined above led to the identification of several potent FXR agonists for further evaluation. One such agonist is the benzopyran-derived dichlorocyclopropane 149 (EC=188 nM). Compound 105 (EC=127 nM) is an example of a bis-cinnamate derivative. Finally, compounds 121 (EC=36 nM) and 124 (EC=69 nM) are stilbene and biaryl derivatives, respectively, of invention compounds.","Based on the results observed thus far, compound 149 appeared to represent the most potent derivative that could be readily obtained among the benzopyran-derivatives. However, the bis-cinnamate, biaryl, and stilbene derivatives of invention compounds were thought to still possess considerable potential for further development and rigorous SAR analysis. Below the results of such investigations are detailed, which indeed led to further enhancement of biological activity.","Examination of the Bis-Cinnamate Series","Similar to the results described above, the meta substituted methyl cinnamate moiety on the \u201cright-hand\u201d region of the molecule remained a desirable component for elevated activity among the bis-cinnamate derivatives of invention compounds (see compounds 105 and 133-139).","Replacement of the methyl acrylate unit with either a methyl or ethyl allylic ether (compounds 136 and 137) caused only a slight decrease in activity (EC=243 and 220 nM, respectively). A marked decline in potency accompanied substitution of the methyl acrylate by more sterically bulky ethers or esters (compounds 133 and 134) or amides (compound 135). Interestingly, saturation of the acrylate olefin (compound 139) afforded only a two-fold decrease in potency, EC=274 nM, which supports the notion that conformational rigidity is a factor contributing to, but not essential for, high affinity ligands. Importantly, compound 139 suggests that the methyl acrylate moiety is not simply functioning as a latent electrophile.","Region II also closely mirrored the preceding data as cycloalkyl amides remained the preferred substituents (see, compounds 105 and 140-145: EC=127-250 nM) among the bis-cinnamate derivatives of invention compounds. Aromatic and heterocyclic amides as well as alkyl ureas led to moderate potency (compounds 143-145: EC=205-236 nM) whereas incorporation of bulky ureas such as compound 146 rendered compounds of only marginal efficacy.","As mentioned above, replacement of the benzopyran moiety with a benzyl group bearing a tert-butyl acrylate moiety in the para-position yielded compound 105 with dramatically increased efficacy (EC=127 nM). Interestingly, placement of the same tert-butyl acrylate group in either the meta or ortho positions of the aromatic ring in Region III led to only micromolar potency (see compounds 107 and 109). Further investigation of the \u201cleft-hand\u201d region in this series of compounds demonstrated that a decrease in ester group size yielded a corresponding decrease in efficacy (ECof t-butyl>i-propyl>ethyl>methyl (see, compounds 105 and 150-152). Similarly, substitution of the ester with either carboxylic acid or amide functionality provided less effective compounds with ECvalues in the micromolar range. Substitution of the tert-butyl acrylate moiety with a methyl or ethyl allylic ether (see, compounds 156 and 157) retained considerable potency (EC=233 and 198 nM, respectively). However, the more bulky phenyl allylic ether 158 possessed only micromolar activity. In addition, saturation of the acrylate moiety (compound 159) showed a two-fold decrease in potency from the parent compound 105. Finally, substitution of the ortho position of the aromatic ring of the tert-butyl acrylate series with oxygenated functionality afforded compounds with very low biological activity (see compounds 161-167).","Construction of Biaryl and Stilbene Containing Focused Libraries","In an effort to further explore the activities of biaryl and stilbene derivatives of invention compounds, a 94-membered library of such compounds was constructed employing a solid phase strategy (see Example 18).","The selection of appropriate styrenes and boronic acids for inputs into this combinatorial library was guided by initial comparisons of tert-butyl stilbene (compound 123, EC=>1000 nM) to the unsubstituted stilbene 102 (EC=36 nM), and biaryl compound 124 (EC=510 nM) to compound 125 (EC=69 nM). It was reasoned that both the stilbene and the biaryl ligands needed to fit into the same region of space within the receptor site for potent activation. Thus, stilbenes in which the aromatic nucleus is removed two carbon atoms further away from the core of the molecule should be adorned with small substituents while the biaryl compounds should be adorned with larger functionality for optimal activity. Screening of this compound library in the cell-based assay led to some intriguing results as summarized in Tables 12-15 of Example 1.","Thus, it was found that in both stilbene and biaryl derivatives of invention compounds, analogs bearing the cyclohexylamide moiety are generally the most potent followed by those bearing the isopropyl amide or isopropyl urea units. As predicted above, stilbenes bearing smaller substituents were more potent than those bearing larger functionality. For instance, substituted stilbene 121 and mono-fluoro stilbenes 192, 201, and 204 were among the most active, while mono-methyl derivative 174 and tri-methyl derivative 195 were among the least active. Also of interest were heterocyclic compounds 207 and 210, which retained good potency (EC=309 and 227 nM, respectively) and may possess improved pharmacological properties. With biaryl derivatives of invention compounds, compounds which present more bulk at the terminus of the structure were more active. With these derivatives, compounds 259 (EC=25 nM) and 244 (EC=38 nM) were particularly active. Overall, most of the compounds synthesized in this follow-up library were efficient activators of FXR, confirming the accuracy of the working hypothesis for the FXR binding pocket described above, which provides a solid basis for further development of FXR activators.","A summary of the molecular requirements for potent FXR activation is shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0089"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00028","num":"00028"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00028","he":"33.95mm","wi":"45.89mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00028.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In order to determine how selectively the above-described compounds activated FXR, some of the most active compounds were screened against a panel of nuclear receptors. Most of these compounds were found to be selective for activation only of FXR. Notably, however, compound 149 also potently activated SXR. This result may lead to compounds which have utility in the treatment of diseases linked to the accumulation of toxic bile acids.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided formulations comprising at least one of the above-described compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.

Since individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of symptoms and each drug has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise mode of administration and dosage employed for each subject is left to the discretion of the practitioner.","Amounts effective for the particular therapeutic goal sought will, of course, depend on the severity of the condition being treated, and the weight and general state of the subject. Various general considerations taken into account in determining the \u201ceffective amount\u201d are known to those of skill in the art and are described, e.g., in Gilman et al., eds., Goodman And Gilman's: The Pharmacological Bases of Therapeutics, 8th ed., Pergamon Press, 1990; and Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.","The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d as applied to invention compounds, means the quantity necessary to effect the desired therapeutic result, for example, a level effective to treat, cure, or alleviate the symptoms of a disease state for which the therapeutic compound is being administered, or to establish homeostasis. Since individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of symptoms and each drug or active agent has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise mode of administration, dosage employed and treatment protocol for each subject is left to the discretion of the practitioner.","In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods for modulating process(es) mediated by farnesoid X receptor polypeptides, said methods comprising conducting said process(es) in the presence of an effective amount of at least one compound according to the invention.","As employed herein, \u201cmodulating\u201d refers to the ability of a modulator for a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (e.g., FXR) to either directly (by binding to the receptor as a ligand) or indirectly (as a precursor for a ligand or an inducer which promotes production of ligand from a precursor) induce expression of gene(s) maintained under hormone expression control, or to repress expression of gene(s) maintained under such control. Exemplary processes contemplated for modulation according to the invention include cholesterol metabolism, regulation of lipid homeostasis, stimulation of bile transport and absorption, regulation of the expression of genes involved in the excretion and transportation of bile acids (including intestinal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP)), bile salt export pump (BSEP) and canalicular multi-specific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), and the like.","Bile acids are derivatives of cholesterol synthesized in the hepatocyte. Cholesterol, ingested as part of the diet or derived from hepatic synthesis is converted into the bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, which are then conjugated to an amino acid (glycine or taurine) to yield the conjugated form that is actively secreted into cannaliculi. Bile acids are facial amphipathic, that is, they contain both hydrophobic (lipid soluble) and polar (hydrophilic) faces. The cholesterol-derived portion of a bile acid has one face that is hydrophobic (that with methyl groups) and one that is hydrophilic (that with the hydroxyl groups); the amino acid conjugate is polar and hydrophilic. Therefore, compounds that can be used to modulate such pathways via effects on FXR involving bile acids are useful in cholesterol metabolism.","Bile acid synthesis is a major pathway for cholesterol disposal and thus represents a potential therapeutic target pathway for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. FXR acts as a bile acid receptor and biological sensor for the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis. FXR is known to regulate cholesterol metabolism in two ways: (1) chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a primary bile acid, binds directly to and activates FXR, which then mediates the feedback suppression by bile acids of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol; and (2) FXR participates in the activation of intestinal bile acid binding protein (IBABP), which is involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Thus FXR constitutes a potential therapeutic target that can be modulated to enhance the removal of cholesterol from the body. Novel compounds identified by the methods presented herein provide a new tool for regulating or modulating FXR function.","Furthermore, FXR is known to in turn activate a series of target genes. In particular FXR functions as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR). A number of target DNA binding sequences that would be present in target genes have recently been identified. A consensus sequence has been determined, which contains an inverted repeat of the sequence AGGTCA with a 1-base pair spacing (IR-1) (Laffitte et al., 275:10638-10647 (2000). This sequence was shown to be a high affinity binding site for FXR\/RXR in vitro and to confer ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by FXR\/RXR to a heterologous promoter in response to a bile acid or synthetic retinoid. Although these studies demonstrated that the FXR\/RXR heterodimer binds to the consensus IR-1 sequence with the highest affinity, it was also demonstrated that FXR\/RXR can bind to and activate through a variety of elements including IR-1 elements with changes in the core half-site sequence, spacing nucleotide, and flanking nucleotides. In addition, it was shown that FXR\/RXR can bind to and transactivate through direct repeats. Therefore, by providing novel ways to modulate FXR function, the present invention in turn provides a method of modulating the function of a variety of target genes that are acted upon by FXR.","In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods for the treatment of hypercholestemia, said methods comprising administering an effective amount of at least one compound according to the invention to a subject in need thereof.","In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods for the treatment of cholestasis, said methods comprising administering an effective amount of at least one compound according to the invention to a subject in need thereof.","The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the following non-limiting Examples.","The feasibility of creating high throughput screens (HTS) for ORs was explored using FXR as a candidate orphan receptor (OR) with a known activator, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a ligand. The screen is based on the co-transfection of a full-length receptor with the reporter vector containing a natural hormone response element under a minimal eukaryotic promoter. The results provided herein (see, ) demonstrate that compounds can be successfully screened in a dose dependent manner for potential activating chemical ligands using a full length FXR on a natural response element. These results validate the robustness of the assay for FXR, in 384-well plates. Using this 384-well format, the high throughput screening (HTS) approach to FXR as a candidate OR was employed. For this test screen, a 10,000 membered library, constructed around the privileged 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran scaffold, was employed (see Nicolaou et al., 122:9939-9953 and 9954-9967 (2000)). This library comprises approximately 10,000 distinct compounds with structures and sizes similar to natural products such as phyto-estrogens, flavanoids, coumarins and long chain fatty acids. A central question in the feasibility studies is whether this library is suitable for screening for nuclear receptor ligands. Samples of this library were first reformatted into a 384-well format and then subjected to the FXR cell-based assays described above and assessed for FXR-mediated transcriptional activity. Cells were exposed to approximately 10 \u03bcM of sample for 18 hrs prior to washing and luciferase analysis.","The 25 most active compounds at 10 \u03bcM were re-synthesized to confirm their structure and activity. Smaller \u201cfocused\u201d chemical libraries were then designed and prepared around these hits and subjected to multiple rounds of screening. Through this iterative process a total of seven additional rounds of synthesis and selection was conducted resulting in novel compounds that are as effective as a proprietary synthetic ligand developed by Glaxo-Smith-Kline (GW 4064) in cell based assays. Using one of these identified compounds, fexaramate (105; EC127 nM), as a scaffold, three additional focused libraries were made and screened to obtain at least four potent, non-steroidal FXR agonists termed fexarene (121; EC, 36 nM), fexaramine (259; EC, 25 nM), fexarine (244; EC, 38 nM) and fexarchloramide (149; EC, 188 nM). ECvalues were determined with Prism 3.0 software via the activity of the subject compound in the previously described cell based assay.","ECvalues for the \u201cscaffold\u201d compound, fexaramate (105), and numerous variations thereof, are presented below (see Tables 1-11).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0111"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00029","num":"00029"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00029","he":"33.02mm","wi":"58.93mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00029.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"a.

Hence this type of screen is also an effective measure of the affinity of binding without the use of a radiolabel. The approach employed herein is termed AlphaScreen technology. For this assay purified receptor protein is expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and is bound via a GST antibody to a \u201cdonor\u201d bead. This is then mixed with a biotinylated co-activator peptide that has been linked to an Avidin proximity sensitive \u201cacceptor\u201d bead. These reactants are mixed in a 384-well plate and are then exposed to either a known inducer (control) or an ordered array of unknown compounds (library). If the acceptor bead (linked to the co-activator peptide) is brought into close proximity of the donor bead, by virtue of a biological interaction, singlet-state oxygen molecules are released and react with chemiluminescent groups in the acceptor beads. The effect of either known inducers or candidate chemical compounds on the interaction of a receptor and its co-activator peptide can be measured by a change in the Alpha signal.","The ability of the in vitro AlphaQuest assay to detect receptor\/co-activator peptide interactions in a 384 well format has been evaluated using the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) as positive controls. The results demonstrate that receptor\/co-activator peptide interactions can be detected in a dose-dependent manner with binding efficiencies similar to those reported in the literature, validating this as a critical in vitro approach to demonstrate binding of candidate ligands in the absence of a high affinity radiolabeled competitor.","Representative procedures for the preparation of Region I modified compounds are shown in Examples 3 to 6.","The strategy employed for the preparation of Compound 29 is shown below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0133"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00045","num":"00045"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00045","he":"139.19mm","wi":"75.18mm","file":"US07671085-20100302-C00045.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Thus, 2,3-dihydroxy benzaldehyde 59 is selectively methylated (NaH, MeI) to afford the monoalcohol benzaldehyde S-5.

Analysis of the library by LCMS after purification showed the average purity of these compounds to be >95%.","To determine if the compounds identified as ligands could promote the association of FXR with co-activators in vitro, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based coactivator binding assay was employed (see, for example, Makishima et al. (1999), supra, Urizar et al. (2002). A natural product that lowers cholesterol as an antagonist ligand for FXR. Science. 296(5573), 1703-6). This assay relies on an agonist-induced interaction between the nuclear receptor and its coactivator bringing two fluorogenic partners together resulting in the nuclear receptor ligand-dependent FRET. Specific recruitment of a peptide containing the receptor binding domain of the steroid receptor co-activator SRC-1 (LXXLL) to the FXR ligand-binding domain was only observed in the presence of the agonists fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene, SRI-1, SRI-2 and GW4064. GW4064 demonstrated the strongest recruitment with an ECvalue of 100 nM followed by fexaramine (EC255 nM), fexarine (EC222 nM), and fexarene (EC\u2248255 nM). Weaker recruitment is seen with compounds SRI-1 and SRI-2.","The ability of these compounds to activate the receptor in a number of different cell-based reporter gene assays was then determined. The recently identified high affinity non-steroidal synthetic compound GW4064 was used as a control in these experiments. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for mouse FXR and human RXR with a thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter reporter vector containing either no copies or six copies of the ecdysone response element (ECRE), a well-characterized FXR response element (FXRE). In addition, two copies of the recently identified FXRE everted repeat separated by 8 nucleotides (ER-8) was also studied (see, for example, Laffitte et al. (2000). Identification of the DNA binding specificity and potential target genes for the farnesoid X-activated receptor. J Biol Chem. 275(14), 10638-47; Kast et al. (2002). Regulation of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (ABCC2) by the nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor, farnesoid X-activated receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor. J Biol Chem. 277(4), 2908-15).","The cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene, SRI-1, SRI-2 or GW4064. Fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene and GW4064 showed robust activation of both of the FXREs (ECRE 100-fold; ER-8 4-fold) with a maximal activity achieved at 1 \u03bcM (concentrations higher than 1 \u03bcM were tested but produced no more activity). The compounds SRI-1 and SRI-2, although structurally similar to fexaramine, showed little or no activity. Novel compounds idntified above showed no activity on the minimal TK promoter. However, GW4064 displayed a weak activity (less than 2 fold) on this promoter. Similar results were found in a variety of different cell types including liver cells (HEPG2) and kidney cells (HEK 293).","Having demonstrated that the newly identified compounds could robustly activate multiple copies of FXREs linked to a TK minimal promoter, the ability of the compounds to activate natural promoters of known FXR targets in a transient transfection cell-based assay was examined. For this study, the following gene promoters were used: intestinal bile acid binding protein (IBABP; see, for example, Grober et al. (1999). Identification of a bile acid-responsive element in the human ileal bile acid-binding protein gene. Involvement of the farnesoid X receptor\/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer. J Biol Chem. 274(42), 29749-54), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (Urizar et al (2000). The farnesoid X-activated receptor mediates bile acid activation of phospholipid transfer protein gene expression. J Biol Chem. 275(50), 39313-7) and multidrug resistance related protein 2 (MRP-2) (Kast et al. (2002), supra), which are all well characterized targets of FXR. The natural promoters of both the IBABP and PLTP genes contain one copy of an inverted repeat with a one base spacing (IR-1) while MRP-2 contains an ER-8 element. The results obtained were similar to experiments with multiple FXRE copies with maximum efficacy of the fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene and GW4064 compounds observed at 1 \u03bcM, while SRI-1 and SRI-2 showed little or no activity. The most robust activation (28-fold) was seen on the IBABP promoter. Less robust (2-3 fold) but specific activation was observed on the PLTP and MRP-2 promoters.","RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization","HepG2 or HT29-derived cell lines were typically cultured in medium containing superstripped FBS for 24 hr before the addition of a ligand or DMSO (vehicle) for an additional 24-48 hr. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and was resolved (10 \u03bcg\/lane) on a 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and cross-linked to the membrane with UV light.","cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [\u03b1-P]dCTP using the highprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Membranes were hybridized using the QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were normalized for variations of RNA loading by hybridization to a control probe, either, 18 S ribosomal cDNA, or the ribosomal protein 36B4. The RNA levels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software; Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.) in addition to being exposed to X-ray film.","RNA Analysis of FXR Target Genes","The liver and the intestinal system are the major areas where FXR plays a role in the induction of specific gene targets in response to bile acid (BA) concentrations. To establish that the identified compounds are effective in studying the function of FXR in these systems, the compounds were examined for their ability to induce characterized gene targets. In addition to the ability to induce characterized gene targets, invention compounds are also useful for identification of gene targets for FXR, i.e., genes which are modulated (i.e., induced or repressed) by FXR.","Human colon cells HT29 (FXR null until differentiated) were infected with retroviral vectors that expressed either FXR constructs and the puromycin-resistant gene or the puromycin-resistant gene alone. Puromycin resistant cells were isolated and pooled cell populations were propagated that harbored either the vector alone (HT29-BABE), overexpressed FXR full length (HT29-FXRFL), a non-functional FXR truncated at the AF2 region (HT29-FXR-AF2), or a constitutively active FXR that has the VP16 activation domain fused N-terminal of the protein (HT29-VP16-FXR). Confirmation of the successful establishment of the different stable cell lines was established via northern blot analysis of FXR message levels in the cells.","HT29-BABE lines do not express FXR while the stable cell lines expressed the exogenous FXR message. To test the ability of these cell lines to induce FXR target genes total RNA was isolated from cells treated overnight with increasing amounts of CDCA or GW4064. Northern blot analysis of the HT29-FXRFL cell line showed robust concentration dependent induction of IBABP mRNA by both CDCA and GW4064. Maximal activation of the IBABP gene by CDCA was observed at 100 \u03bcM while only 1 \u03bcM of GW4064 was needed to achieve the same level of induction. No induction of IBABP mRNA levels was observed in the HT29-BABE or HT29-FXR-AF2 cell lines. Constitutive expression was seen in the HT29-VP16-FXR and was super-induced by addition of CDCA and GW4064. These observations verify the usefulness of this colon cell model system for studying the induction of FXR target genes.","The ability of the novel compounds identified herein to induce IBABP gene expression in this cell system was also examined. Total RNA from HT29 stable cells treated overnight with fexaramine, fexarine and fexarene was probed for IBABP gene expression. Fexaramine, fexarine and fexarene all induced expression of the IBABP mRNA in the HT29-FXRFL with similar profiles to that seen for GW4064 (maximal activity at 1 \u03bcM concentration). No induction was seen in the HT29-BABE or HT29-FXR-AF2 cell lines, proving the specificity of the compounds. These results demonstrate that the novel compounds of the present invention are effective in studying FXR target genes in an intestinal model cell system.","To demonstrate the usefulness of these compounds in studying FXR function in the liver, a model hepatocyte cell system that expresses the FXR gene was employed (Kast et al. (2002), supra). Confluent HEPG2-FXR cells were treated overnight with increasing concentrations of fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene SRI-1, SRI-2 and the control ligands GW4064 and CDCA. Total RNA was isolated and the expression of the FXR target genes SHP, MRP-2, BSEP and PLTP was measured by Northern blot analysis.","The control ligands CDCA and GW4064 showed similar induction of the target genes to what has been previously reported. Of the novel compounds identified herein, fexaramine was the most effective inducer of target genes, although strong induction was also observed with fexarine and fexarene. In this hepatocyte cell system, maximal activation of FXR target genes by these compounds was achieved at 10 \u03bcM, which is similar to the control ligand GW4064. Interestingly, although GW4064 showed slightly better induction of the FXR target genes PLTP and SHP, fexaramine matched GW4064 induced activation of the BSEP and MRP-2 genes. These results demonstrate that these novel compounds can be used to identify and characterize new FXR target genes in the liver and the intestinal cell systems. Differences in efficacy of target gene induction between the liver and the intestinal cell systems may reflect the ability of the liver hepatocytes to mount a xenobotic response or cell specific permeability to the identified compounds. Modification of the ligands to overcome these effects may be made in order to increase the efficacy of these drugs in liver cell systems.","Further evidence that invention compounds can be used to identify and characterize additional FXR gene targets is provided by the large scale screening summarized in Appendix 1 (for genes upregulated by invention compounds) and Appendix 2 (for genes downregulated by invention compounds).","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and therefore, the invention encompasses embodiments in addition to those specifically disclosed in the specification, but only as indicated in the appended
