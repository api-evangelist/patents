title: Anti-collision lighting systems and methods for a micro aerial vehicle
abstract: Systems and methods for anti-collision lights on a UAV. A method for passive anti-collision lights on a Micro-Aerial Vehicle (“MAV”) including determining a location of the MAV using a flight management computer configured to fly the MAV on a programmed path using data from a global positioning system and an inertial navigation system. The flight management system transmits light activation data and selectively activates at least one navigation light located on a visible surface of the MAV using the light activation data from the flight management computer.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under U.S. Government Contract No. W56HZV-05-C-0724. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.","Aircraft navigation lights are generally located with a red navigation light on the left wingtip leading edge, a green light on the right wingtip leading edge and a white navigation light is as far aft as possible on the tail or each wing tip. High-intensity strobe lights are located on the aircraft to aid in collision avoidance. Navigation lights in civil aviation are required to be operational and to be turned on from sunset to sunrise. High-intensity white strobe lights are part of the anti-collision light system, as well as the aviation red or white rotating beacon. The anti-collision light system (either strobe lights or rotating beacon) is required to be operational and to be turned on for all operating airplanes.","An unmanned, aerial vehicle (UAV), sometimes called an \u201cunmanned, air-reconnaissance vehicle,\u201d is an unpiloted aircraft. UAVs can be remote controlled or fly autonomously based on pre-programmed flight plans or more complex dynamic automation systems. UAVs are currently used in a number of military roles, including reconnaissance operations.","The Micro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV) is designed as a ducted fan unmanned air vehicle, and flies like a helicopter (Vertical Take Off and Landing), using a fan that draws in air through a duct to provide lift. The MAV's fan is enclosed in the duct and is generally driven by a gasoline or heavy fuel (kerosene based) engine. The MAV is controlled using Honeywell's\u00ae micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) electronic sensor technology. The MAV currently has no dihedrals and, therefore, it is challenging to visually observe and determine which direction a MAV is flying in order to avoid collisions.","Currently there are no requirements for navigation lights for UAVs or MAVs. UAVs are generally large enough to have lights and\/or a collision avoidance system. However, as the airspace begins to fill up, when UAV technology is used less for military operations and more for day-to-day police, fire and even news operations there will be an increasing need to avoid collisions. A MAV by necessity is very small and very lightweight for man portability.","Anti-collision lighting systems and methods for a MAV\u201d are disclosed herein. A method for passive anti-collision lights on a MAV including determining a location of the MAV using a flight management computer configured to fly the MAV on a programmed path using data from a global positioning system and an inertial navigation system is disclosed herein. The flight management system transmits light activation data and selectively activates at least one navigation light located on a visible surface of the MAV using the light activation data from the flight management computer.","A system for passive anti-collision lights on a MAV includes a flight management computer located on the MAV and configured to fly the MAV on a programmed path using data from a global positioning system and an inertial navigation system and configured to transmit light activation data; and at least one navigation light located on a visible surface of the MAV and configured to receive light activation data from the flight management computer.","Systems and methods for anti-collision lights on a UAV are disclosed herein. Currently there are no requirements for navigation\/anti-collision lights on a UAV, however, because most UAV's are generally shaped like an airplane, at least during daylight operations the vehicle can be seen by other pilots and can be avoided. MAVs, and in particular ducted fan MAVs are not dihedral in shape, can be cylindrical or circular so there is no clear indication of front and back. In fact the airframe is not limited to moving in one direction. Therefore, as shown in one embodiment of the present invention, lightweight lights are used as a passive anti-collision system. More particularly, lights are used at the corners of the aircraft using similar lighting systems as are required for civilian aircraft. Further, in one embodiment of the present invention lights can be selectively altered depending on the direction of travel, the threat level, and the needs of the MAV. For example, each corner of the aerial vehicle may have red, green and white lights. Then depending on the direction of travel, white lights will be activated in the front and rear, green on the starboard and red on the port. By selectively altering the lights, the direction of travel of the MAV can be determined by another pilot or a user on the ground.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","102","104","104","106","108","110","104","102","110","112","112","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-1","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2","200","201","200","201","200","203","201","200","200","202","204","206","208","200","208","210","204","212","214","216"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","306","300","304","308","300","303","305","307","309","308","308","304","302","306"]},"FIGS. --- show a series of placements of lights on a MAV .  shows a MAV  with a light  placed at the front and a light  placed at the rear of the MAV .
