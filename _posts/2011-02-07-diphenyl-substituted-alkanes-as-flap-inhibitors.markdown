that inhibit 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), compositions containing such compounds and methods of treatment using such compounds for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and related diseases and conditions.","Inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis has been an active area of pharmaceutical research for many years. Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived through the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase.","One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). In general, 5-LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5-LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton, which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently, it has been reported that 5-LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process; see Mehrabian, M. et al., Circulation Research, 2002 Jul. 26, 91(2):120-126.","A new class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors (now known as FLAP inhibitors) distinct from 5-LO inhibitors is described in Miller, D. K. et al., \u201cIdentification and isolation of a membrane protein necessary for leukotriene production,\u201d Nature, vol. 343, No. 6255, pp. 278-281(18 Jan. 1990). See also Dixon, R. A. et al, \u201cRequirement of a 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein for leukotriene synthesis,\u201d Nature, vol 343, no. 6255, pp. 282-4 (18 Jan. 1990). 5-LO inhibitor compounds were used to identify and isolate the inner nuclear membrane 18,000 dalton protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). These compounds inhibit the formation of cellular leukotrienes but have no direct effect on soluble 5-LO activity. In cells, arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of cytosolic phospholipase 2. This arachidonic acid is transferred to nuclear membrane bound 5-lipoxygenase by FLAP. The presence of FLAP in cells is essential for the synthesis of leukotrienes. Additionally, based on studies described in Helgadottir, A., et al., Nature Genetics, vol 36, no. 3 (March 2004) pp. 233-239, it is believed that the gene encoding 5-lipoxygenase activating protein confers risk for myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.","Despite significant therapeutic advances in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events, such as the improvements that have been achieved with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, further treatment options are clearly needed.

Another aspect of this invention involves a method for preventing or reducing the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor to a patient in need of such treatment.","The ability of the compounds of Formula I to inhibit biosynthesis of the leukotrienes makes them useful for preventing or reversing the symptoms induced by the leukotrienes in a human subject. This inhibition of the mammalian biosynthesis of leukotrienes indicates that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are useful to prevent or reduce the risk for, treat or ameliorate in mammals and especially in humans: 1) pulmonary disorders including diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and related obstructive airway diseases, 2) allergies and allergic reactions such as allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and the like, 3) inflammation such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, 4) pain, 5) skin disorders such as atopic eczema, and the like, 6) cardiovascular disorders such as angina, formation of atherosclerotic plaques, myocardial ischemia, hypertension, platelet aggregation and the like, 7) renal insufficiency arising from ischaemia induced by immunological or chemical (cyclosporin) etiology and 8) migraine or cluster headache, 9) ocular conditions such as uveitis, 10) hepatitis resulting from chemical, immunological or infectious stimuli, 11) trauma or shock states such as burn injuries, endotoxemia and the like, 12) allograft rejection, 13) prevention of side effects associated with therapeutic administration of cytokines such as Interleukin II and tumor necrosis factor, 14) chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchitis and other small- and large-airway diseases, 15) cholecystitis, 16) multiple sclerosis, 17) proliferation of myoblastic leukemia cells, and 18) acne.","Thus, the compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat or prevent mammalian (especially, human) disease states such as erosive gastritis; erosive esophagitis; diarrhea; cerebral spasm; premature labor; spontaneous abortion; dysmenorrhea; ischemia; noxious agent-induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or myocardial tissue; liver parenchymal damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CCland D-galactosamine; ischemic renal failure; disease-induced hepatic damage; bile salt induced pancreatic or gastric damage; trauma- or stress-induced cell damage; and glycerol-induced renal failure. The compounds also act as inhibitors of tumor metastasis and exhibit cytoprotective action.","The FLAP inhibitors of this invention can also be administered for prevention, amelioration and treatment of glomerulonephritis (see Guasch A., Zayas C. F., Badr K F. (1999), \u201cMK-591 acutely restores glomerular size selectivity and reduces proteinuria in human glomerulonephritis,\u201d Kidney Int., 56:261-267); and also for and prevention, amelioration and treatment of kidney damage resulting from diabetes complications (see Valdivielso J M, Montero A., Badr K F., Munger K A. (2003), \u201cInhibition of FLAP decreases proteinuria in diabetic rats,\u201d J. Nephrol., 16(1):85-940.)","In addition, the compounds of this invention can also be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As described in S. Kilfeather, Chest, 2002, vol 121, 197, airway neutrophilia in COPD patients is believed to be a contributing source of inflammation and is associated with airway remodeling. The presence of neutrophils is mediated in part by LTB, and treatment with the instant compounds could be used to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in patients with COED.","The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions, and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are: (A) an ethanol-induced lesion assay and (B) an indomethacin-induced ulcer assay and are described in EP 140,684.","In particular, the compounds of the invention would be useful to reduce the gastric erosion caused by co-administration of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and low-dose aspirin. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are widely used as effective anti-inflammatory drugs with less potential for gastrointestinal complications as compared to traditional, non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the combined use of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor with low-dose aspirin for cardio protection may compromise the gastrointestinal safety of this class of compounds. By virtue of its activity as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, the compounds of the invention would be expected to be gastric protective in this regard. See Fiorucci, et at FASEB J. 17:1171-1173, 2003. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors for use with the invention include but are not limited to etoricoxib (ARCOXIA\u2122), celecoxib (CELEBREX\u00ae) and valdecoxib (BEXTRA\u2122). A compound of this invention in combination with a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form or separately to a patient on low-dose aspirin therapy. Alternatively, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form with low-dose aspirin, in which case a compound of this invention would be administered separately. All three active ingredients in unit dosage form is also encompassed. Conventional dosage amounts of the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and aspirin (for cardio protection) may be utilized. Aspirin could be administered at 81 mg once daily.","In general, FLAP inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which have an ICin the \u201cFLAP Binding Assay\u201d that is less than or equal to 1 \u03bcM, and preferably 500 nM or less.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of onset of atherosclerosis.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment to slow progression of existing atherosclerosis, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of an atherosclerotic disease event or formation of new lesions.","An effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor in the method of this invention is in the range of about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 30 mg\/kg of body weight per day, preferably 0.1 mg to about 15 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.5 to 7.5 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. A single daily dose is preferred but not necessary. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the dosage level is therefore from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg of drug per day, e.g. 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 175 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg per day, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to four times a day, or in sustained release form. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the patient's condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the FLAP inhibitor will administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting months, years or the life of the patient.","One or more additional active agents may be administered with a compound of Formula I. The term \u201cadditional active agent (or agents)\u201d is intended to mean a pharmaceutically active agent (or agents) different from the compound of formula I. In a broad embodiment, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound, anti-diabetic agents and\/or anti-obesity agents, may be used in combination with the compound of formula I in a single dosage formulation, or may be administered to the patient in a separate dosage formulation, which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents. The additional active agent or agents can be lipid modifying compounds or agents having other pharmaceutical activities, or agents that have both lipid-modifying effects and other pharmaceutical activities. Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which include statins in their lactonized or dihydroxy open acid forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, including but not limited to lovastatin (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,767), simvastatin (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,784), pravastatin, particularly the sodium salt thereof (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,227), fluvastatin particularly the sodium salt thereof (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,354,772), atorvastatin, particularly the calcium salt thereof (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,995), pitavastatin also referred to as NK-104 (see PCT international publication number WO 97\/23200) and rosuvastatin (CRESTOR\u00ae; see U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,440); 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors; cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, for example JTT-705 and torcetrapib, also known as CP529,414; HMO-CoA synthase inhibitors; squalene epoxidase inhibitors; squalene synthetase inhibitors (also known as squalene synthase inhibitors), acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors including selective inhibitors of ACAT-1 or ACAT-2 as well as dual inhibitors of ACAT-1 and -2; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors; niacin; niacin receptor agonists such as acipimox and acifran, as well as niacin receptor partial agonists; bile acid sequestrants; LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor inducers; platelet aggregation inhibitors, for example glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa fibrinogen receptor antagonists and aspirin; human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) agonists including the compounds commonly referred to as glitazones for example pioglitazone and rosiglitazone and, including those compounds included within the structural class known as thiazolidinediones as well as those PPAR\u03b3 agonists outside the thiazolidinedione structural class; PPAR\u03b1 agonists such as clofibrate, fenofibrate including micronized fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil; PPAR dual \u03b1\/\u03b3 agonists; vitamin B(also known as pyridoxine) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof such as the HCl salt; vitamin B(also known as cyanocobalamin); folic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof such as the sodium salt and the methylglucamine salt; anti-oxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and E and beta carotene; beta-blockers; angiotensin II antagonists such as losartan; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril and captopril; calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and diltiazam; endothelian antagonists; agents that enhance ABCA1 gene expression; PXR and LXR ligands including both inhibitors and agonists; bisphosphonate compounds such as alendronate sodium; and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors such as etoricoxib, celecoxib and valdecoxib.","Still another type of agent that can be used in combination with the compounds of this invention are cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors block the movement of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes of the small intestinal wall. This blockade is their primary mode of action in reducing serum cholesterol levels. These compounds are distinct from compounds which reduce serum cholesterol levels primarily by mechanisms of action such as acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) inhibition, inhibition of triglyceride synthesis, MTP inhibition, bile acid sequestration, and transcription modulation such as agonists or antagonists of nuclear hormones. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,966, U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,365, U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,115, U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,001, U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,171, U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,473, U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,470, U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,321, U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,672, U.S. Pat.

An exemplary cholesterol absorption inhibitor is ezetimibe, marketed in the U.S. under the tradename ZETIA\u00ae described in U.S. Pat. No. Re 37721 and the Physician's Desk Reference.","This and other cholesterol absorption inhibitors can be identified according to the assay of hypolipidemic compounds using the hyperlipidemic hamster described in U.S. Pat. Re 37721, beginning in column 20, in which hamsters are fed a controlled cholesterol diet and dosed with test compounds for seven days. Plasma lipid analysis is conducted and data is reported as percent reduction of lipid versus control.","Therapeutically effective amounts of cholesterol absorption inhibitors include dosages of from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 30 mg\/kg of body weight per day, preferably about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the dosage level is therefore from about 0.7 mg to about 2100 mg of drug per day, e.g. 10, 20, 40, 100 or 200 mg per day, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response when the cholesterol absorption inhibitor is used in combination with a compound of the instant invention.","In the method of treatment of this invention, the FLAP inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as orally, parenterally, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred.","For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be far example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.","Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. One example of a time-controlled release device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,738. They may also be coated by the technique described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.","Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.","Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.","Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.","Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.","Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.","The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for treating or preventing any of the medical conditions described herein, in dosage amounts described herein. For example, a compound of Formula I can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerotic disease, halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically manifest, and preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event. Additionally, the medicament may be useful for the treatment of asthma, allergies and allergic conditions, inflammation, COPD or erosive gastritis. The medicament comprised of a compound of Formula I may also be prepared with one or more additional active agents, such as those described herein.","The compounds of structural formula I of the present invention can be prepared according to the procedures of the following Schemes and Examples, using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the specific examples which follow. Moreover, by utilizing the procedures described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art can readily prepare additional compounds of the present invention claimed herein. The compounds illustrated in the examples are not, however, to be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention. All temperatures are degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted. Mass spectra (MS) were measured by electron-spray ion-mass spectroscopy (ES-MS).","The instant compounds are generally isolated in a pharmaceutically acceptable form which can either be the free base or an appropriate salt derivative, such as those described above. The free amine bases corresponding to the isolated salts can be generated by neutralization with a suitable base, such as aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide, and extraction of the liberated amine free base into an organic solvent followed by evaporation. The amine free base isolated in this manner can be further converted into another pharmaceutically acceptable salt by dissolution in an organic solvent followed by addition of the appropriate acid and subsequent evaporation, precipitation, or crystallization.","Some abbreviations used herein are as follows:","Ar is Aryl; Bu is butyl; t-Bu is tert-butyl; celite is Celite\u00ae diatomaceous earth; DCM is dichloromethane; Dess-Martin Periodinane is 1,1,1-tris(acetyloxy)-1,1-dihydro-1,2-benzodoxol-3-(1H)-one; DIPEA is diisopropylethylamine; DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide; dppf is 1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene; equiv. is equivalent(s); ES-MS is electron spray ion-mass spectroscopy; Et is ethyl; EtOAc is ethyl acetate; HATU is O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; HetAr or HAR is Heteroaryl; HPLC is high performance liquid chromatography; i is Iso; LDA is lithium diisopropylamide; LG is leaving group; Me is methyl; m.p. is melting point; MS is mass spectrum, and a mass spectrum obtained by ES-MS may be denoted herein by \u201cES\u201d; p is para; Ph is phenyl; Pr is propyl; i-Pr is isopropyl; p-TSA is para-toluenesulfonic acid; Tf is trifluoromethanesulfonyl; TFA is trifluoroacetic acid; and THF is tetrahydrofuran.","In the Schemes, all substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.","Reaction scheme A illustrates the preferred method for synthesis of compounds of structural formula 3 and 4. In this method, a benzophenone of type 1 is treated with an organometallic reagent of type 2, capable of transferring an alkyl group, and the product of the reaction is a compound of structural formula 3. Preferred organometallic reagents for this transformation include organomagnesium (Grignard) or organolithium compounds. When Grignard reagents are employed as shown in scheme A, it is customary to conduct the reaction in a suitable ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, or THF or mixtures thereof, at temperatures between \u221278\u00b0 C. and the boiling temperature of the solvent. In the case of an organolithium reagent, the reaction can be conducted in a variety of solvents such as diethyl ether or hexanes, at temperatures between \u221278\u00b0 C. and room temperature. The Grignard and the organolithium reagents are often purchased commercially, but can be prepared synthetically according to known methods in organic synthesis. Removal of the tertiary hydroxyl group in 3 will depend upon the identity of the Zand Zsubstituents. If these substituents are unaffected by hydrogenation conditions, then the hydroxyl group may be removed by hydrogenolysis using a palladium-on-carbon catalyst in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol and in the presence of hydrogen gas or a hydrogen donor such as formic acid. Occasionally it may be the case that either one or both of the Zand Zsubstituents are sensitive to hydrogenation conditions, and in these instances 3 is reacted with a organosilane such as triethylsilane in the presence of a protic acid like TFA or a Lewis acid like boron trifluoride. It is customary to conduct the reaction in an inert organic solvent like DCM or 1,2-dichloroethane at temperatures between 0\u00b0 C. and boiling point of the solvent.
