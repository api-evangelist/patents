title: Query translation using bilingual search refinements
abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer program products, for generating visual media search results are provided. A first visual media search query in a first language is received. One or more bilingual refinements are identified for the first visual media search query. Each bilingual refinement associates an initial query in the first language and a subsequent query in a different second language. The initial query is equivalent to the first visual media search query. The subsequent query is a translation of the initial query in the second language. The subsequent query followed the initial query in a series of queries received from a user in a session. A first bilingual refinement is selected from the one or more bilingual refinements according to a first criterion. A set of visual media search results is generated based on the first search query and the selected first bilingual refinement's associated subsequent search query.

No. 61\/178,830, filed May 15, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to increasing the number of visual media search results generated in response to a visual media search query.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},"In , the visual media search query is \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1 . \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1 is the Greek word for skier. In response to receipt of the visual media search query, a search is performed, one matching result  is identified, and this one matching result  is presented to the user through the user interface.","In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the following. A first visual media search query in a first language is received. One or more bilingual refinements are identified for the first visual media search query. Each bilingual refinement associates an initial query in the first language and a subsequent query in a different second language. The initial query is equivalent to the first visual media search query. The subsequent query is a translation of the initial query in the second language. The subsequent query followed the initial query in a series of queries received from a user in a session. A first bilingual refinement is selected from the one or more bilingual refinements according to a first criterion. A set of one or more visual media search results is generated based on the first search query and the selected first bilingual refinement's associated subsequent search query. Other implementations of this invention include corresponding systems, apparatus, computer program products, and computer readable media.","These and other implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. The initial query can be identical to the first visual media search query. The first criterion can include selecting a most frequently appearing bilingual refinement in the one or more bilingual refinements. The subsequent query can follow the initial query in the series of queries within a threshold.","A set of one or more visual media search results can be presented.","A second bilingual refinement can be selected from the one or more bilingual refinements according to a second criterion. The set of visual media search results can be further based on the subsequent query associated with the second bilingual refinement. The second criterion can include selecting a second most frequently appearing bilingual refinement in the one or more bilingual refinements.","The visual media can be an image, a video, an image embedded in a file, or a video embedded in a file.","Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. A larger set of relevant visual media search results can be provided in response to a visual media search query. A set of visual media search results that are more responsive to a given visual media search query can be provided in response to the visual media search query. Search results relevant to a local concept can be returned even if the user searches in a language different from the local language.","The details of one or more implementations of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","The small set of search results shown in  can be disappointing to a user. There are many reasons a set of search results can be small, including an unusual topic or a misspelled search query. However, in many cases, the set of search results is small because of the language the user is searching in. Some concepts are more popular in certain languages. For example when discussing the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Calif., people are more likely to use English than Dutch, because the Golden Gate Bridge is a United States' landmark, and the English phrase is how the bridge is named in the United States. If a user has entered a search query in a language where the search query is not a popular concept, few results may be returned. This is true even though the search query concept may be very popular in other languages and, if the user entered a visual media search query in one of those other languages, he or she would be presented with a larger number of search results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},"In general, a session is a period during which a user is performing searches. A session can be measured in a number of ways including, for example, by a specified period of time (for example, thirty minutes), by a specified number of queries (for example, 15 queries), until a specified period of inactivity (for example, 10 minutes without performing a search), or while a user is logged-in to a system.","In , the user has entered the visual media search query \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1 , meaning skier in Greek. A bilingual refinement is selected from one or more bilingual refinements corresponding to the search query \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1 . The bilingual refinement can be selected according to various criteria including, for example, selecting the most frequently occurring bilingual refinement in a set of one or more bilingual refinements corresponding to the visual media search query. Here, a bilingual refinement from \u201c\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1\u201d to \u201cskier\u201d is selected. A search is performed using both \u201c\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1\u201d and \u201cskier\u201d. The result is a more robust set of search results. The result from   is again presented, but two additional results in English  and  are also presented.","Thus, if a visual media search query is augmented with its translation into a second relevant language, for example, through examining bilingual refinements, the user can be provided with additional search results. Because visual media typically involves image and video content which conveys information independent of language, the user is likely less concerned with the language of the search result and more concerned with the content of the visual media. Therefore, visual media search queries are an especially fruitful area for query translation. However, similar techniques could be used in any other type of search, for example, documents searches.","Visual media is not limited to images. For example, visual media can include video, images embedded in an electronic file, video embedded in an electronic file, and interactive media such as javascript or actionscript games. Visual media does not necessarily correspond to an electronic file. Visual media can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the visual media in question, or in multiple coordinated files. Moreover, visual media can be stored in memory without first having been stored in a file.","The search query does not have to be received from a user; instead, it can be received from any source, including, for example, a computer or a process on a computer. The search query does not have to be received through a search engine user interface, but can be received through any interface that allows a user, a computer, or a process to send a search query.","Presenting search results is not limited to causing visual media to be presented to the user. Presenting search results can include, for example, displaying search results on a display device, transmitting search results to a user's computer for presentation to the user, transmitting search results to another device, transmitting sounds corresponding to the search results, providing haptic feedback corresponding to the search results, or transmitting signals comprising haptic feedback corresponding to the search results to a user's computer for presentation to the user. Other methods of presenting search results are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","206","208","232","238","208","232","238"]},"User A  begins by searching for \u201cde Toren Van Eiffel\u201d . This is Dutch for the Eiffel Tower. As time  continues, user A  searches for \u201cFranse toren\u201d . \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel,\u201d does not translate to \u201cFranse toren,\u201d and thus {de Toren Van Eiffel, Franse toren} is not a bilingual refinement. The user next searches for \u201ctijdelijke structuur\u201d . \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel\u201d does not translate to \u201ctijdelijke structuur,\u201d and thus {de Toren Van Eiffel, tijdelijke structuur} is not a bilingual refinement. Furthermore, \u201cFranse toren\u201d does not translate to \u201ctijdelijke structuur,\u201d and thus {Franse toren, tijdelijke structuur} is also not a bilingual refinement. Finally, user A searches for \u201c\u201d . \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel\u201d does translate to \u201c,\u201d and thus {de Toren Van Eiffel, } is identified as a bilingual refinement  corresponding to \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel,\u201d and stored in a collection of bilingual refinements .","In some implementations, the translation from the initial query to the subsequent query does not have to be an identical translation. For example, approximate translations, such as approximate translations that use slang words or synonyms, or approximate translations that add or leave off stop words (e.g., known terms that do not contribute to the topicality of the query such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d) can be sufficient.","User B  begins by searching for \u201cde Toren Van Eiffel\u201d . User B then proceeds to search for a number of queries that do not translate to \u201cde Toren Van Eiffel\u201d or to each other. These queries  are all part of a first session. At some point in time, user B's first session ends. Because none of the queries  entered by user B  in his first session translate to each other, no bilingual refinements are identified from the first session. At a later point in time, user B begins a second session in which he searches for two queries  including \u201c \u201d . \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel\u201d is a translation of \u201c .\u201d If the queries \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel\u201d and \u201c \u201d had been entered in the same session, they would be considered a bilingual refinement corresponding to De Toren Van Eiffel. However, because \u201cde Toren Van Eiffel\u201d  was entered in user B 's first session and \u201c\u201d  was entered in user B 's second session, the two queries are not considered a bilingual refinement. Thus, no bilingual refinements are identified from either of user B's sessions.","In some implementations, even queries that translate to each other and are received during the same session are not considered a bilingual refinement if they do not occur within a specified threshold. A threshold is a estimate of an acceptable distance that can separate two queries and still result in the queries being considered a bilingual refinement. For example, a threshold can be a number of queries (e.g., 5) or a period of time, (e.g., 5 minutes). Other measures of an acceptable distance that can separate two queries and still result in the queries being considered a bilingual refinement are possible. The threshold can be chosen to include all queries in a session or be chosen to include a subset of queries in a session.","User C  searches for three queries . During his session, user C searches for \u201cde Toren Van Eiffel\u201d  followed by \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d . \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel\u201d is a translation of \u201cEiffel Tower,\u201d and thus {de Toren Van Eiffel, Eiffel Tower} is identified as a bilingual refinement  corresponding to \u201cde Toren Van Eiffel,\u201d and stored in the collection of bilingual refinements .","Bilingual refinements can be identified in a number of ways. In various implementations, bilingual refinements are identified from stored user search histories corresponding to a series of search queries received from a user in a session. In some implementations, search queries are considered as they are received from a user to identify bilingual refinements. In some implementations, bilingual refinements that correspond to one or more potential visual media search queries are identified in advance and stored until they are needed. In some implementations, bilingual refinements are identified on-the-fly in response to a user's visual media search query.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"A collection of identified bilingual refinements  corresponding to \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel,\u201d Dutch for \u201cthe Eiffel tower,\u201d is shown. These bilingual refinements include translations into a number of languages such as Russian , French , Chinese , English , Portuguese , and others. Some of the bilingual refinements appear more than once.","The various bilingual refinements are repeated in the collection of bilingual refinements different numbers of times. For example, {De Toren Van Eiffel, } appears three times and {De Toren Van Eiffel, Eifel Tower} appears four times. One way of selecting a bilingual refinement is to select the most frequently appearing bilingual refinement in the collection of identified bilingual refinements. For example, here, the most frequently appearing refinement is {De Toren Van Eiffel, Tour Eiffel}, which appears seven times. Because {De Toren Van Eiffel, Tour Eiffel} appears more than any other bilingual refinement in the collection of bilingual refinements, it is selected as the bilingual refinement  corresponding to \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel.\u201d","In alternative implementations, different criteria can be used to select a bilingual refinement. These criteria include, for example, selecting the most recently observed bilingual refinement in the collection of identified bilingual refinements, selecting the least frequently appearing bilingual refinement in the collection of identified bilingual refinements, selecting the best bilingual refinement in the collection of identified bilingual refinements, chosen according to a subjective standard, or selecting a bilingual refinement at random from the collection of identified bilingual refinements. Other criteria for selecting a bilingual refinement can also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Once a query  has been received and a translation of the query corresponding to a selected bilingual refinement  has been selected, the two queries are passed to a results generator . The results generator  applies the query  and its translation  to one or more corpora of documents, resulting in a set of results . A corpus of documents is a collection of documents, visual media, and other information.","The set of results may include results in the language of the query, e.g. Result A , and may also include results in the language of the translation, e.g. Result  . In , Results A, B, C, and D correspond to results with Dutch phrases (corresponding to \u201cDe Toren Van Eiffel\u201d) and Results , , and  correspond to results with French phrases (corresponding to \u201cTour Eiffel\u201d). Results can include phrases in more than one language. In some implementations, a result with a phrase satisfying the search query or its translation is returned even if other parts of the result are in a different language.","The results can be generated in a number of ways. In various implementations, the results generator  combines the query and its translation into one query that searches for both queries with equal weight. For example, the combined query in  might be \u201c\u2018De Toren Van Eiffel\u2019 or \u2018Tour Eiffel.\u2019\u201d The combined query is then passed to a search engine backend  that generates the set of search results . In some implementations, the results generator combines the two queries into one query, but gives the two queries differing weights, for example, weighting the translated query using a quality of result statistic for the translated query as discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12,481,421, for \u201cQuery Translation Quality Confidence,\u201d incorporated by reference. In some implementations, the results generator  uses the search engine backend  to run two searches: one corresponding to the query and one corresponding to its translation. The results generator then combines the resulting sets of results, for example, by alternating results from the two sets of results, considering scores associated with the results, or estimating the relevance of the results.","The search engine backend can be part of the results generator, a separate process run on the same computer as the results generator, or a separate process run on a different computer.","Other methods of generating a set of search results responsive to a query and its translation are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"In step , a visual media search query is received (e.g., by a search engine provider). A visual media search query is a word or words defining a search for visual media. Any method of receiving a search query can be used. For example, in various implementations, the visual media search query is received from a user's computer through a web interface. The web interface can be, for example, a webpage, run by a search engine provider, that receives search queries from a user and presents results and other information relevant to the search query to the user. In some implementations, the visual media search query is received from a process running on a computer of the search engine or a computer of a third party. In some implementations, the visual media search query is received from a computer.","In step , one or more bilingual refinements are identified (e.g., by a search engine provider). In general, each bilingual refinement associates an initial query in the first language and a subsequent query in a different second language. The initial query is equivalent to the visual media search query. The subsequent query followed the initial query in a series of queries received from a user in a session, and is a translation of the initial query in the second language. Examples of bilingual refinements are illustrated in .","In some implementations, two queries are equivalent when they are identical. In alternative implementations, two queries can be equivalent even though they are not identical. For example, two queries can be equivalent when they have the same meaning, despite small differences in spelling, small differences in word order, the use of abbreviations, the use of synonyms, or the use of stop words (e.g., known terms that do not contribute to the topicality of the query, such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d). Other common measures of similarity can also be used, for example, using the edit distance for the two queries.","In some implementations, the one or more bilingual refinements are identified in advance. In some implementations, all bilingual refinements that exist in the received series of user queries are identified in advance. In some implementations, only certain bilingual refinements are identified in advance, for example, only bilingual refinements that correspond to the most popular queries.","In various implementations, when one or more bilingual refinements are identified in advance, the identified bilingual refinements, or a representation of the identified bilingual refinements, can be stored for later access (e.g., by the search engine provider). In some implementations, the one or more identified bilingual refinements are stored, for example on one or more machine readable storage devices. The identified bilingual refinements do not have to be in a contiguous section on a machine readable storage device, nor do the identified bilingual refinement have to be completely stored on the same machine readable storage device. In some implementations, the identified bilingual refinements are stored in a bilingual refinement database that associates a given visual media search query with its corresponding identified bilingual refinements.","In some implementations, the one or more bilingual refinements are identified on-the-fly, in response to receiving the visual media search query. In some implementations, some bilingual refinements are identified in advance and some are identified on-the-fly in response to receiving the first visual media search query.","In some implementations, the one or more bilingual refinements are identified by searching one or more user search histories. A user search history stores a sequence of queries received from a user. User search histories may also include additional information such as which results were selected after a search was performed and how long each selected result was viewed. Each user search history can be searched for a query in one language followed, in the same session, by the translation of the query in a different language.","In some implementations, the one or more bilingual refinements are identified as a series of search queries is received from a user. In these implementations, the series of search queries is monitored in real time as each query is received, and bilingual refinements are identified as they are received.","Other methods of identifying bilingual refinements are possible.","In step , a bilingual refinement is selected from the one or more identified bilingual refinements (e.g., by a search engine provider). The bilingual refinement can be selected according to a criterion. A criterion specifies which bilingual refinement to select. For example, the criterion can specify one or more attributes the selected bilingual refinement should have, or can specify a method or algorithm for selecting the selected bilingual refinement. For example, the first criterion can specify that the most frequently appearing bilingual refinement should be selected. The most frequently appearing bilingual refinement can be determined, for example, through the process described in . Alternative criteria are possible, for example, a criterion specifying that the most recently identified bilingual refinement should be selected.","In some implementations, a bilingual refinement is selected in advance. When a bilingual refinement is selected in advance, the selected bilingual refinement, or a representation of the selected bilingual refinement, can be stored for later use, for example on one or more machine readable storage devices. The bilingual refinement does not have to be in a contiguous section on a machine readable storage device, nor does the bilingual refinement have to be completely stored on the same machine readable storage device. In alternative implementations, a bilingual refinement is selected on-the-fly, in response to receiving the visual media search query. In some implementations, once a bilingual refinement is selected on-the-fly, it is stored for later use much as a bilingual refinement selected in advance is stored for later use. In some implementations, the selected bilingual refinement is stored in a bilingual refinement database that associates a given visual media search query with its selected bilingual refinement or bilingual refinements.","In some implementations, more than one bilingual refinement is selected. In some implementations, additional bilingual refinements are selected according to the same or similar criteria as the first bilingual refinement, for example, selecting the first bilingual refinement by selecting the most frequently appearing refinement, and selecting a second bilingual refinement by selecting the second most frequently appearing bilingual refinement. In some implementations, the additional bilingual refinements are selected according to different criteria from the first bilingual refinement, for example, selecting the first bilingual refinement by selecting the most frequently appearing bilingual refinement, and selecting the second bilingual refinement at random.","In step , one or more visual media search results are generated based on the visual media search query and the translated query from the selected bilingual refinement (e.g., by a search engine provider).

While only one data processing apparatus is shown in , a plurality of data processing apparatus may be used.","In various implementations, the server  runs a number of processes, e.g. executable software programs. In various implementations, these processes include a bilingual refinement identifier process , a bilingual refinement selector process , a results generator process , and an optional search engine backend . Running a process includes, for example, instantiating a copy of the process, providing system resources to the process, and communicating with the process through a hardware or software interface. A hardware or software interface is an interface that allows processes to communicate with each other or with system hardware, for example, a system bus or commands specified in an application programming interface.","The bilingual refinement identifier process  identifies one or more bilingual refinements from a series of search queries submitted by a user. In various implementations, this includes searching one or more user search histories to identify bilingual refinements, either in advance or on-the-fly in response to a search query. In some implementations, the user search histories are stored on the server , for example, on the computer readable medium  or an additional device  such as a hard drive. In alternative implementations, the user search histories are stored on client computers  and . In these implementations, the bilingual refinement identifier process  accesses the search histories through, for example, the network . In some implementations, a series of search queries from a user is monitored in real time as each query is received from a client computer, and bilingual refinements are identified as they are received.","The bilingual refinement selector process  selects a bilingual refinement from the one or more bilingual refinements identified by the bilingual refinement identifier . In various implementations, this includes counting how many times each bilingual refinement appears in the set of one or more bilingual refinements and selecting the bilingual refinement that appears the most frequently.

The bilingual refinement selector can select a bilingual refinement corresponding to one or more search queries in advance, or on-the-fly in response to a visual media search query.","The results generator process  generates a set of search results responsive to a visual media search query and a selected bilingual refinement associating the visual media search query (or an equivalent query) and its translation into a different language. In various implementations, this includes combining the query and its translation into one query where the query and its translation are considered with equal weight or with different weights. The combined query is then passed to a search engine backend. In alternative implementations, the query and its translation are provided separately to a search engine backend resulting in two separate sets of sets results, and the results generator process  combines the resulting two sets of search results into one set of search results.","A search engine backend performs a search corresponding to a query over one or more corpora of documents and returns a set of search results.

In some implementations, a representation of the identified bilingual search refinements or a representation of the selected bilingual refinement is stored instead of or in addition to the bilingual refinements themselves. In some implementations, a bilingual refinement database is stored. The bilingual refinement database associates a given query with its corresponding identified bilingual refinement or its corresponding selected bilingual refinement, allowing the server to quickly access identified bilingual refinements or a selected bilingual refinement associated with a query in the database.","The server  also has hardware or firmware devices including one or more processors , one or more additional devices , computer readable medium , and one or more user interface devices .

In alternative implementations, the process is running on another computer and the visual media search query is received, for example, through the network .","In some implementations, the bilingual refinement identifier has identified one or more bilingual refinements corresponding to the visual media search query in advance, and the bilingual refinement selector has selected a bilingual refinement from the one or more bilingual refinements in advance. In these implementations, the translated search query from the selected bilingual refinement and the visual media search query are sent to the results generator process . In some implementations, the one or more bilingual refinements corresponding to the visual media search query have been identified in advance and stored on the server , but a bilingual refinement has not been selected. In these implementations, the server  sends the identified bilingual refinements to the bilingual refinement selector . The bilingual refinement selector then selects a bilingual refinement corresponding to the visual media search query. The search query and the translated search query associated with the selected bilingual refinement are then sent to the results generator . In some implementations, some bilingual refinements corresponding to the visual media search query have been identified in advance but it is possible that others might not yet have been identified. In these implementations, the visual media search query is provided to the bilingual refinement identifier. The bilingual refinement identifier identifies any additional bilingual refinements and the pre-identified and newly identified bilingual refinements are sent to the bilingual refinement selector. The bilingual refinement selector then selects a bilingual refinement corresponding to the visual media search query. The visual media search query and the translated search query associated with the selected bilingual refinement are then sent to the results generator . In some implementations, no bilingual refinements corresponding to the visual media search query have been identified in advance and no bilingual refinement corresponding to the visual media search query has been selected in advance. In these implementations, when the bilingual refinement identifier  receives the visual media search query, it identifies one or more bilingual refinements and sends these to the bilingual refinement selector . The bilingual refinement selector  selects a bilingual refinement corresponding to the visual media search query, for example, by selecting the most frequently appearing bilingual refinement in the identified bilingual refinements corresponding to the visual media search query. The search query and the translation of the search query associated with the bilingual refinement are then sent to the results generator .","In some implementations, more than one bilingual refinement corresponding to the search query is selected. For example, the bilingual refinement selector can select the first and second most frequently appearing bilingual refinements. In these implementations, additional selected bilingual refinements are used much as the first selected bilingual refinement is used.","In various implementations, the results generator generates a set of search results by combining the search query and the translated search query into one query and using a search engine backend  to run a search corresponding to the combined query. In some implementations, the search engine backend  is run on the server , and the combined query is sent to the search engine backend, for example, through a hardware or software interface. The search engine backend  then sends search results responsive to the combined query to the results generator , for example, through a hardware or software interface. In some implementations, the search engine backend  is part of the results generator . In some implementations, the search engine backend  is run on a separate data processing apparatus and the search query and resulting search results are sent, for example, through the network . In some implementations, the results generator generates a set of search results by sending two queries to the search engine backend , one corresponding to the search query and one corresponding to the translated search query, receiving two sets of results from the search engine backend , and combining the results.","In various implementations, once the results generator  has generated a set of search results, the server  presents the search results by sending them through the network  to user 's computer . In some implementations the server  can present the results in other ways, including, for example, sending the results to the process that sent the visual media search query, displaying search results on a display device, transmitting sounds, or providing haptic feedback. In some implementations, the search results are presented by a results presenter  run on the server . In some implementations, the results presenter  is part of the results generator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","500","800","624","626","1","622","602"]},"The system  includes a processor , a memory , a storage device , and an input\/output device .
