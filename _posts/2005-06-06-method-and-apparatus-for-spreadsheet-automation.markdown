{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent application claims priority of U.S. Application Ser. No. 60\/578,136 filed on Jun. 8, 2004, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Spreadsheet Automation\u201d, which is by the same inventors as this application and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention pertains to spreadsheets. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for spreadsheet automation.","Spreadsheets are ubiquitous. They are used by individuals as well as the largest organizations. Spreadsheets, originally designed as personal productivity tools, have become the application of choice for a wide variety of enterprise, department and team processes. Spreadsheets are used throughout enterprises, both large and small, for mission critical forecasting, budgeting, reporting, analysis, etc. They are easy to create, easy to modify and easy to use, however there are possible problems.","For example, consider this scenario: A budget administrator is burdened with bringing together diverse inputs and models from all over the enterprise. Getting the relevant operational data from spreadsheets from manufacturing, sales and marketing into the plan along with expense information from all of the cost center managers is an overwhelming task. Add to this the possibility that the capital plan and the compensation plan may both cross all these functions. This may result in budget administrators spending excessive hours completing this task, fraught with possible errors, and not having enough time for analysis. This presents a problem.","The natural temptation is to blame the spreadsheets for creating this situation; however, the alternative is generally replacing spreadsheets with a pre-packaged application lacking the ability of the spreadsheets in modeling your business. Furthermore, your models, processes and expertise may be built around spreadsheets. The bottom-line is that the loss of visibility, the cost of re-engineering business rules and processes, and re-training people is expensive. This presents a problem.","Spreadsheets, for example, Microsoft Excel were designed for personal productivity and this may lead to problems when being used by workgroups. It may be easy to merge, for example, a sales forecast when a spreadsheet is used by three sales managers. However, when as few as 5 users try to consolidate their information, it can be both cumbersome and trouble-prone. For example, one approach involves emailing spreadsheet workbooks to individuals, then having those workbooks filled out and emailed back, which necessitates manually replacing the original worksheets. Because these operations involve file management, email-based communication, repetitive manual reporting, analysis, and reconciliation, it may be difficult and time-consuming for a process administrator to keep track of who has what version of a file, and to ensure that all changes have been correctly merged. This presents a problem.","Another complaint leveled against the corporate use of spreadsheets is the proliferation of \u201cspreadmarts,\u201d (spreadsheet+datamart), that is many individual spreadsheets that contain different snapshots of corporate data. The problem is that while one person's snapshot may be of, for example, the January forecast, another's may be the January budget plus actuals to date. When people try to do analysis based on different snapshots, they have a problem.","When spreadsheet processes become enterprise processes, the administrative burden may become untenable with costs, inaccuracy, and inefficiencies escalating. The integrity of the processes may be at stake. This presents a problem.","Additionally, traditional spreadsheets are not web enabled, which is a benefit in today's connected world. This presents a problem.","Spreadsheet automation is a framework for building efficient spreadsheet processes, while capitalizing on the models, analytics, and expertise that already exist in a user's current spreadsheets. Spreadsheet automation may lead to results of high value, and easy-to-deploy solutions at low total cost, especially when compared to traditional enterprise applications. In one embodiment of the invention, spreadsheet automation provides efficiency via fast, accurate, and automated distribution of data, collection of data, consolidation of data, reporting, and analysis. This may lead to higher integrity, productivity, communications, and better visibility into business issues through real-time analysis.","In one embodiment of the invention, a spreadsheet automation approach wraps a spreadsheet environment, such as Excel, in a shell that handles enterprise-level issues such as deployment, authentication, process-control, and database connectivity.","In one embodiment of the invention, instead of using email as a distribution mechanism, the spreadsheet automation, which is built as a web application, delivers spreadsheets from a central server directly to a user's desktop.","In one embodiment of the invention, a user can retrieve a spreadsheet (also called a spreadsheet model, a template, or a template model), fill out the spreadsheet and submit the changes to the server, with the changes just made automatically available to everyone. And, the data the spreadsheet uses is automatically refreshed when a new spreadsheet is requested from the server. This provides for an up-to-date spreadsheet.","In one embodiment of the invention, content posted to a spreadsheet automation server requires only basic word processing skills and the messaging interface allows the process administrator to customize the messaging for different groups of users.","In one embodiment of the invention, the spreadsheet automation server is built around the concept of automating spreadsheets so that enterprise spreadsheet applications can be built by end users. This allows a company or workgroup to leverage its existing spreadsheet assets and spreadsheet skill set and business\/domain knowledge to build enterprise class applications.","In one embodiment of the invention, the spreadsheet automation server is a web based application. In one embodiment of the invention, the spreadsheet automation server functions are on an application server foundation and is built as a set of J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) and\/or .NET components. Thus, it leverages well-established IT (Information Technology) infrastructure found in today's corporations and integrates easily with some of the most popular application infrastructures (for example, Tomcat, BEA WebLogic, Microsoft Windows Server, Microsoft Internet Information Server (Microsoft IIS), and IBM Websphere).","In one embodiment of the invention, direct support for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) databases including, for example, Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services and Hyperion Essbase, as well as relational databases is provided.","In one embodiment of the invention, the spreadsheet model is centrally maintained and deployed, and models are delivered through the http protocol. This allows application administrators to centrally control and update each model's analytics, including for example, conditional rules, formatting, missing items suppressed, dynamic calculations, etc. while allowing tailored and personalized models to be delivered to each user.","One embodiment of the invention has the following components: a spreadsheet automation server, a portal, and an optional spreadsheet add-in (also called a player). The spreadsheet automation server may have various embodiments, for example, one tailored to the use of the web is called a Web Spreadsheet Server (WSS). The spreadsheet automation server is composed of an application server, and Java\/J2EE and\/or .NET components that aid in the construction of spreadsheet-based analytic applications. These components can parse XLS (Excel spreadsheet) templates, and dynamically fill them with data according to the business rules incorporated into the templates. They render the populated XLS models into either real-time XLS files delivered directly to Excel or to HTML web pages. The portal may serve as the web-based interface to the spreadsheet automation server. It allows users to select applications, to choose the model parameters to display and to dynamically generate these applications. The spreadsheet add-in is for users who require advanced spreadsheet functionality, and establishes a direct connection between, for example, Excel and the spreadsheet automation server. The spreadsheet add-in is delivered to the user's machine via the portal. Download of the spreadsheet add-in may be automatic, and thus would require no administrative access (and therefore no IT support) to the desktop.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304"]},"In one embodiment of the invention, the portal includes an area for announcements, for related links, and discussion boards.","In one embodiment of the invention, the spreadsheet automation server has pre-built modules, such as capital modeling, and compensation modeling.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","410","420","430","402","410","404","430"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","510","520","530","502","500","510","504","500"]},"The portal  has, in this embodiment, a variety of functions that may be accessed by users. For example, model access , workflow , an executive dashboard , an ad-hoc slice and dice , communications , and administration .","The spreadsheet engine  has, in this embodiment, security services , a modeling engine , and an object repository .","The data gateway  has, in this embodiment, a common OLAP gateway , and relational database services .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606","608","606","610","612"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702","703","704","706","707","708","704"]},"Spreadsheet automation works with one or more spreadsheets and leverages the existing spreadsheet assets, keeps the spreadsheet experience, and adds enterprise class features. It is adaptable because as the spreadsheets change the models and enterprise class features allow these to be used by all users. Since the changes may be implemented gradually, this may lead to better adaptability, lowered costs, decreased errors, and increased return on investment, etc.","The invention in one embodiment constructs XLS (Excel spreadsheet) models on-demand in a web environment. This involves deconstruction and reconstruction, use of spreadsheet specification, and a web spreadsheet engine.","In one embodiment of the invention, support is provided for communication with heterogeneous data sources. In one embodiment, a reusable catalog of objects, such as, business and application objects is an available resource. In one embodiment of the invention, integrated views and models are possible as are complex derived information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1302","1304","1306","1304","1308","1304","1310","1302","1306","1308"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"],"b":["1402","1404","1406","1","2","3","1408","1410"]},"Referring back to , the Data Sources , for the description above were a given data source so as to make the description clear. These data sources and the data that goes with them, for example, the regions and the associated data such as the sales, costs, shipping data, taxes, etc. from each region must somehow be constructed. In one embodiment of the invention (referring back to ) a group of original spreadsheets ( at ) are input into the system and their structure and data is deconstructed into objects ( at ). For example, in  at  mention was made of 135 Regions. Thus for example, the system  may have received 135 different spreadsheets from users in 135 different regions. The spreadsheets were each deconstructed to provide available objects  for later reconstruction into real-time models  based on a user's spreadsheet specification, such as illustrated in .","What is to be appreciated is that multiple spreadsheets from a variety of sources containing differing fields may be deconstructed, their data made available, and then reconstructed into real-time spreadsheet models. One of skill in the art will appreciate that this technique allows for the use of existing spreadsheets as well as up-to-date data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 13","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["2600","2602","2604","2606","2604","2608","2604","2608","2610","2612","2610","2612"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["2800","2802","2804","2806","2808","2810","2812","2814"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["2900","2902","2906","2916"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["3000","3018","3020","3020"]},"One of skill in the art will appreciate that by using a spreadsheet language, tokens, ranges, and spreadsheet contents, etc. and coupled with corporate metadata it is possible to make available dynamically spreadsheet models that may otherwise be delivered as static spreadsheets. Web enabling this spreadsheet automation allows for organizational controls, tracking, security, etc. otherwise not possible in spreadsheet applications. Additionally, the architecture for the spreadsheet may be on a server and\/or a client. These capabilities coupled with the ability to reuse objects provides an extensible environment for spreadsheet automation.","Thus a method and apparatus for spreadsheet automation have been described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","1","104","108","1","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"200"},"Referring back to ,  illustrates a network environment  in which the techniques described may be applied. The network environment  has a network  that connects S servers - through -S, and C clients - through -C. As shown, several computer systems in the form of S servers - through -S and C clients - through -C are connected to each other via a network , which may be, for example, a corporate based network. Note that alternatively the network  might be or include one or more of: the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), satellite link, fiber network, cable network, or a combination of these and\/or others. The servers may represent, for example, disk storage systems alone or storage and computing resources. Likewise, the clients may have computing, storage, and viewing capabilities. The method and apparatus described herein may be applied to essentially any type of communicating means or device whether local or remote, such as a LAN, a WAN, a system bus, etc. Thus, the invention may find application at both the S servers - through -S, and C clients - through -C.","Referring back to ,  illustrates a computer system  in block diagram form, which may be representative of any of the clients and\/or servers shown in . The block diagram is a high level conceptual representation and may be implemented in a variety of ways and by various architectures. Bus system  interconnects a Central Processing Unit (CPU) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , Random Access Memory (RAM) , storage , display , audio, , keyboard , pointer , miscellaneous input\/output (I\/O) devices , and communications . The bus system  may be for example, one or more of such buses as a system bus, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Advanced Graphics Port (AGP), Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard number  (FireWire), Universal Serial Bus (USB), etc. The CPU  may be a single, multiple, or even a distributed computing resource. Storage , may be Compact Disc (CD), Digital Versatile Disk (DVD), hard disks (HD), optical disks, tape, flash, memory sticks, video recorders, etc. Display  might be, for example, an embodiment of the present invention. Note that depending upon the actual implementation of a computer system, the computer system may include some, all, more, or a rearrangement of components in the block diagram. For example, a thin client might consist of a wireless hand held device that lacks, for example, a traditional keyboard. Thus, many variations on the system of  are possible.","For purposes of discussing and understanding the invention, it is to be understood that various terms are used by those knowledgeable in the art to describe techniques and approaches. Furthermore, in the description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical, electrical, and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Some portions of the description may be presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on, for example, data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others of ordinary skill in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of acts leading to a desired result. The acts are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, can refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission, or display devices.","An apparatus for performing the operations herein can implement the present invention. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer, selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, hard disks, optical disks, compact disk\u2014read only memories (CD-ROMs), and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), electrically programmable read-only memories (EPROM)s, electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), FLASH memories, magnetic or optical cards, etc., or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions either local to the computer or remote to the computer.","The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general-purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method. For example, any of the methods according to the present invention can be implemented in hard-wired circuitry, by programming a general-purpose processor, or by any combination of hardware and software. One of ordinary skill in the art will immediately appreciate that the invention can be practiced with computer system configurations other than those described, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, digital signal processing (DSP) devices, set top boxes, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network.","The methods of the invention may be implemented using computer software. If written in a programming language conforming to a recognized standard, sequences of instructions designed to implement the methods can be compiled for execution on a variety of hardware platforms and for interface to a variety of operating systems. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. Furthermore, it is common in the art to speak of software, in one form or another (e.g., program, procedure, application, driver, . . . ), as taking an action or causing a result. Such expressions are merely a shorthand way of saying that execution of the software by a computer causes the processor of the computer to perform an action or produce a result.","It is to be understood that various terms and techniques are used by those knowledgeable in the art to describe communications, protocols, applications, implementations, mechanisms, etc. One such technique is the description of an implementation of a technique in terms of an algorithm or mathematical expression. That is, while the technique may be, for example, implemented as executing code on a computer, the expression of that technique may be more aptly and succinctly conveyed and communicated as a formula, algorithm, or mathematical expression. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize a block denoting A+B=C as an additive function whose implementation in hardware and\/or software would take two inputs (A and B) and produce a summation output (C). Thus, the use of formula, algorithm, or mathematical expression as descriptions is to be understood as having a physical embodiment in at least hardware and\/or software (such as a computer system in which the techniques of the present invention may be practiced as well as implemented as an embodiment).","A machine-readable medium is understood to include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable medium includes read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.); etc.","As used in this description, \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d or similar phrases means that the feature(s) being described are included in at least one embodiment of the invention. References to \u201cone embodiment\u201d in this description do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment; however, neither are such embodiments mutually exclusive. Nor does \u201cone embodiment\u201d imply that there is but a single embodiment of the invention. For example, a feature, structure, act, etc. described in \u201cone embodiment\u201d may also be included in other embodiments. Thus, the invention may include a variety of combinations and\/or integrations of the embodiments described herein.","As used in this description, \u201cExcel\u201d which is a Microsoft spreadsheet product, is not intended to limit the invention. Rather Excel is a very common spreadsheet and any such reference to Excel is to be understood to refer to any class of spreadsheet products.","As used in this description, \u201cspreadsheet specification\u201d or \u201cspreadsheet model specification\u201d or \u201cmodel specification\u201d all refer to the same entity, that is a specification that defines a spreadsheet. As used in this description, \u201cspreadsheet\u201d or \u201cspreadsheet model\u201d or \u201cmodel\u201d or \u201ctemplate\u201d or similar terms all refer to a spreadsheet which a user may use. For example, in  at  is a portal model access. This \u201cmodel\u201d is to a spreadsheet and not to the spreadsheet specification (which may have been used to construct it).","Thus a method and apparatus for spreadsheet automation have been described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 29","FIG. 30"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
