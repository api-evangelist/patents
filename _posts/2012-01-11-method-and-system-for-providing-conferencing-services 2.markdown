{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/903,590, filed Jul. 30, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,140,980 which claims the benefit of the earlier filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/492,597, filed Aug. 5, 2003; the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to communications systems, and more particularly, to conferencing systems.","Network service providers recognize the key role that conferencing services play in the conduct of modern business. Despite the evolution in communications infrastructure and associated services, advancements in conferencing facilities have remained relatively stagnant, with the focus on improving audio conferencing systems. Collaborative applications, such as whiteboarding, have emerged as tools that are helpful in supporting productive meetings. However, these applications have largely been implemented at the end user level, with little or no coordination with the conferencing facilities.","Conventionally, the approach to scheduling conferences among many participants is performed in an ad hoc manner, and is manually intensive. For example, when a manager wants to set up a meeting with his team members who are geographically dispersed, the manager typically instructs an assistant to contact each of the potential participants either through e-mail or telephone. Generally, this invitation and response process is performed several times until the assistant can establish a time that is suitable for all of the team members. Thereafter, the assistant can schedule a time slot with the service provider for reserving the conference bridge. Generally, this conference bridge is reserved well in advance of the actual meeting date. Even up to this point in the process, scheduling and coordinating calendars can be overly cumbersome, particularly if the number of participants is large. Moreover, during the time period between the set up and the meeting date, invariably one or more of the team members will have a conflict that arises, thereby necessitating rescheduling of the meeting. Consequently, the assistant will need to begin this process anew to schedule the meeting; otherwise absenteeism can hinder the productivity of the meeting or render it all together ineffective, especially if the key members are not there to provide input.","Additionally, after the extensive effort at scheduling the conference, traditional conference facilities provide no services that assist with improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the meeting. That is, the provider of the conferencing services now merely supplies circuits and ports on the conference bridge.","Therefore, there is a need for providing enhanced conferencing services to facilitate the scheduling and conducting of the meeting.","These and other needs are addressed by the present invention, in which an approach for providing multi-media conferencing supplies enhanced services to the participants of the conference session. The scheduling of the conference can be conducted collaboratively in a communications environment that supports a variety of media (e.g., e-mail, page, instant messaging, and Internet Protocol (IP) telephony). During the conference or meeting, a language assistance application can be invoked to augment textual information for comprehension of the textual information. For a particular participant, configuration information corresponding to the participant specifies the nature of the language assistance requested. Language assistance involves augmenting the textual information according to the configuration information, wherein the augmented textual information can include language translation of the textual information, as well as assistive or supplemental information for the textual information. In an exemplary embodiment, the supplemental information conveys definitions of terms, which can include acronyms and abbreviations. The augmented textual information is forwarded for display to the participant during the conference session. By supplying augmented textual information, the participants are less likely to interrupt the flow of the conference session, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the meeting. The above arrangement advantageously improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the conference session by conveying information tailored to individual participates. The above approach also permits the service providers to enhance their communication service offerings, thereby providing new sources of revenue.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for providing multi-media conferencing is disclosed. The method includes receiving textual information for display during a conference session among a plurality of participants. The method also includes retrieving configuration information specifying language assistance for the textual information, wherein the configuration information is associated with one of the participants. Additionally, the method includes augmenting the textual information according to the configuration information for comprehension of the textual information by the one participant. Further, the method includes forwarding the augmented textual information for display to the one participant during the conference session.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a system for providing multi-media conferencing is disclosed. The system includes a conference scheduling application configured to receive textual information for display during a conference session among a plurality of participants, and to retrieve configuration information specifying language assistance for the textual information, wherein the configuration information is associated with one of the participants. Also, the system includes a language assistance application configured to augment the textual information according to the configuration information for comprehension of the textual information by the one participant, wherein the augmented textual information is forwarded for display to the one participant during the conference session.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a computer-readable medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions for providing multi-media conferencing is disclosed. The one or more sequences of one or more instructions including instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the steps of receiving textual information for display during a conference session among a plurality of participants; and retrieving configuration information specifying language assistance for the textual information. The configuration information is associated with one of the participants. Further steps include augmenting the textual information according to the configuration information for comprehension of the textual information by the one participant; and forwarding the augmented textual information for display to the one participant during the conference session.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The present invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawing and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A system, method, and software for providing multi-media conferencing are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention can be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Although the present invention is explained with respect to a specific communication and signaling protocols, the present invention also has applicability to other equivalent protocols. By way of example, these specific protocols include the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as specified in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request For Comment (RFC) 3261, the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) according to RFC 2705, and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Recommendations H.323 and H.248; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","103","105","103","105"]},"The conference scheduling application  provides resource management of both the telephone conference bridge  and the IP conference bridge . A service provider may have an overall capacity of hundreds or thousands of conferencing \u201cports\u201d\u2014referring to the number of separate connections that are supported at any one time. The conference scheduling application  processes requests to schedule a conference for a certain data and time, as well as a specified number of ports. The conference scheduling application  determines whether the request can be fulfilled and reserves (or allocates) the appropriate conferencing facilities. Additionally, the functions of the conference scheduling application  includes verifying schedules of physical facilities or equipment, as well as participants' individual schedules.","The conference scheduling application  also interacts with a calendar sharing application  and collaborative applications . These applications  can include a presentation sharing application , a language assistance application , an application integration and sharing program , and a logging and recording application ","These collaborative applications , according to one embodiment of the present invention, can run on servers (not shown) and are implemented as commercially hosted web services or are implemented as enterprise applications serving users within an enterprise or those who are able to access an enterprise network through, for example, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) arrangement.","Further, any one or all of these applications  can support a web-accessible interface and can be hosted as a service on server facilities independent from the network service provider (e.g., a third party apart from the network service provider and the enterprise). This type of service relates to so-called \u201cweb services,\u201d which are web-accessible applications hosted on, for example, server hardware of a first company and made available for use by, or on behalf of, a second company. In an exemplary embodiment, the conference scheduling application  can be accessible by web browser applications. In addition, the conference scheduling application  can also be a proprietary client-server application that enables users to conveniently schedule conferences.","The service provider can deploy a web server (not shown) as an interface between systems external to the service provider and those systems that are internal to the service provider. It is contemplated that the web server supports adequate privacy and security measures via user authentication. The web server can provide the user with the following functions: checking of status of a meeting, obtaining status on acknowledgement of participating parties, obtaining status on attendance confirmation of participating parties, modifying parameters set by the conference wizard (can be offered only for the initiator of the conference or a \u201csuper\u201d user), and reviewing (and selecting and modifying) the list of services\/resources available for the meeting.","The collaborative applications  allow multiple parties using web browsers or specialized applications to simultaneously view and\/or act upon a common view of a document, presentation or other data object. An example of a collaborative application is a document editor wherein multiple parties can view a common document and provide editing input, or even share editing control, to modify the document while viewing it. Another example is a common whiteboard wherein multiple parties can view a graphical workspace and may take turns modifying or adding to the content. Other advanced tools include collaborative computer-aided design (CAD) tools, whereby engineers working at different locations may collaboratively design and view manufacturable parts or data models. The collaborative applications  can also provide for parallel text messaging and audio conferencing as part of the communication session, as well as support live video to provide face-to-face interaction. Also, these collaborative applications  can provide for a session \u201cowner\u201d or \u201cmoderator,\u201d who exercises control over the session, to delegate editing control to other parties.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the application integration and sharing is a server process for enabling collaboration among multiple client application instances.","The conference logging and recording application allows for logging of events pertaining to a conference session and recording of the conduct of the session as well as the content of the session. Logging of events include, for example, start time, stop time, sign-on and sign-off times of each participant, along with indexing markers or annotations inserted during the session by a presenter or participants. The recording process, for instance, includes recording video, audio, textual messaging conversations, presentations and collaborative work as well as data items, such as documents or images, which are introduced by participants in the course of the meeting. Recording may also involve manual or automatic note taking, vote tallies, meeting minutes or meeting transcripts.","The conference scheduling application  accesses data from a database , which stores records of allocated conferencing resources and other pertinent data. The database  also connects to a billing system  that provides Rating, Billing, and Authorization (RBA) functions. Thus, the billing system  can use the database  to store account information or records of billing-related events received from other elements. The rating, billing, and authorization functions measure the usage of the communication services offered by the network service provider and determine billing for the usage. The billing system  receives notifications from other network elements indicating the nature and amount of services provided, such as the duration of telephone calls or video conferences. The billing system  can also be involved in determining whether to honor requests for service based upon the ability of parties accessing the system to arrange for payment to the service provider.","The network service provider employs a service management system  in support of various management functions for controlling the conferencing services.","A communications network  provides communications among the processes and sub-systems of the network service provider. For the purposes of explanation, numerous elements in  are shown as having connections to the network . However, it is recognized that the network  can include multiple interconnected networks, with connectivity, for example, to the global Internet (not shown) or other public data networks. The network , in an exemplary embodiment, is a data transport network, such as an Internet Protocol (IP)-based network, an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, a frame relay network, or a combination thereof. The network  interfaces with telephony systems, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  and a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) , via the following nodes: an Intelligent Service Node (ISN) , a network gateway , and an enterprise gateway .","The ISN  is a voice service platform that can include both human telephone operators and automatic voice response units (VRUs) capable of receiving telephone calls and providing interaction with callers. For example, the ISN  utilizes a VRU function by which a caller is provided with automatic prompts and may traverse a menu structure by providing Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones or spoken input to the system. The ISN , as a voice service platform, provides a service by taking action in response to caller input, such as retrieving information for the caller, connecting a telephone call, or performing transactions.","The network gateway  provides an interface between the network  and the PSTN . For example, the network gateway  may participate in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling on the data network side and present an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) interface or Signaling System 7 (SS7) signaling interface to the PSTN . As for the bearer channel for carrying telephony audio signals, the network gateway  converts among streaming data representing digitized audio in the network  and analog, or Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), signals suitable for the conventional PSTN . The network gateway  enables a party using a SIP phone  to call, or be called by, a party using a conventional phone such as telephone  or a wireless phone . It is noted that the SIP phone  can be implemented as a stand-alone device or a software client.","Similarly, the enterprise gateway  couples the network  to a private branch exchange (PBX) , which supports one or more PBX telephones . In this example, the PBX  resides at the customer premise of a business organization. The PBX  is often of proprietary design and function, but presents a standard signaling and trunk interface in order to be connected to conventional telephone networks. For phone  to reach or be reached by other phones coupled through the network , the enterprise gateway  appropriately adapts signaling and bearer channel information to support such communication.","The Network Service Provider additionally utilizes a Presence and Instant Messaging (IM) server  for determining whether a user is currently participating in an online communication session\u2014i.e., instant communication session. The Presence and IM server  can be a real-time communications server that supports text messaging and presence indication. As use herein, \u201cpresence\u201d generally refers to the technique of indicating to one party whether another party is available to communicate and often further indicating what mode of communication is available or preferred. The Presence and IM server  may operate as a presence server of the type described in Request For Comments (RFC) 2778 and RFC 2779 developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); these documents are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The Presence and IM server  receives presence indication from parties, usually through their use of client applications similar to client . Examples of such applications include AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) client, and a Microsoft Real-Time Communications (RTC) client, such as Windows Messenger.","The Presence and IM server  alerts interested parties whether a particular party has indicated that they are present. This facilitates the ease and spontaneity with which parties may initiate conversations with one another. For establishing communications among parties, the server  may employ the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as described in IETF RFC 3261, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition to text messaging sessions, the Presence and IM server  may facilitate audio or video communications among IC clients , ","The Presence and IM server  exchanges presence information with SIP Network Server and Redirect Server (NS\/RS) , which interact with the billing system  via a Fraud Management System (FMS) . In an exemplary embodiment, the Rating, Billing and Authorization function may subsume or communicate with the FMS. FMS  is used by the network service provider to detect and curtail fraudulent or abusive use of the network as well as misuse or \u201chacking\u201d of network facilities and resources. As indicated previously, the RBA function can receive event notifications from a wide variety of elements that experience or observe usage by users of the system. As various notifications are received from elements throughout the system related to usage or attempted usage, much of the same information used for billing purposes may also be used for monitoring of activity for the purpose of detecting fraud or abuse. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,601,048 to Gavan, et al., which is incorporated herein in its entirety, describes a suitable method by which the FMS  may process event notifications and facilitate the detection of possible fraud or abuse.","To further curb the possibility of unauthorized access or use of the system or its resources, the RBA function or some other supervisory function operated for the benefit of the network service provider may coordinate with an enterprise security function. This interchange of information may be used to, for example, involve an employee directory or authorization records maintained by the enterprise in decisions by the service provider's system as to whether to fulfill requests to establish communications, schedule conferences, etc.","Yet another measure for detecting fraud or breaches of security and privacy, relates to the manner in which presence information held in NS\/RS  or Presence and IM server  may be correlated with live conference attendee information known to collaborative applications  or conference bridges ,  (in ). Discrepancies in these pieces of information pertaining to the whereabouts and identity of a person can be detected. For example, a person registering presence at a given SIP phone that is known to have a particular physical location at the same time that they are involved in a conference from what is known to be an entirely different location may signify falsification by another party at either the phone or the conference. This occurrence may have a logical explanation in some circumstances, but may nevertheless warrant investigation.","Another protection may be realized in monitoring and controlling outbound dialing occurring from conferences that are already underway. Authorizations, abusive patterns among call participants and account balances may all be applied to controlling aspects of conferencing and collaboration service invocation.","The NS\/RS  is optionally implemented as a combination of two SIP components: a network server (NS) or \u201cproxy\u201d function; and a redirect server (RS) or location server function. The NS function has responsibility for locating and establishing contact with a party. The NS creates and dispatches messages to other elements to coordinate the providing of services. If there is any \u201cstatefulness\u201d in the course of processing a session request (e.g., a telephone call), it is the NS that holds such state. For example, in the context of a \u201cfind-me\u201d feature, wherein a series of contacts is to be tried in sequence, the NS sends SIP \u201cINVITE\u201d messages or the like to each contact and keeps track of which contacts have responded and which contacts have yet to be tried.","The NS\/RS  can interface to a Service Control Point (SCP) (not shown) in a traditional telephony intelligent network (IN) environment for various purposes. For example, in some implementations, VPN routing of telephone calls are performed in both a conventional telephone network and a packet switched telephony system that uses the network . A single version of the routing information are maintained in the SCP rather than having to synchronize SCP contents and RS contents. The main purpose of the RS function is to maintain profile information pertaining to the users. In a sense, the RS function also keeps track of where or how a user can be contacted at any point in time. As users move about physically or logically from one terminal device to another and \u201cregister\u201d their presence, the RS receives notifications from the users as to their latest location.","Presence-type information maintained by the RS function of the NS\/RS  is similar to information supplied by the Presence and IM server . Consequently, a presence-sharing connection  is provided for sharing of such information among these entities , . For example, the indication of presence by a party via an instant communications client is used to update presence information in the NS\/RS . This information can be used, for example, to complete telephone calls to the relevant party.","The fact that the scheduling application  or collaborative application  may sense when a given party is involved in a scheduled conference may be used to temporarily alter behavior of a user's profile in a redirect server of NS\/RS  such that inbound calls may be handled differently without the user having to explicitly make changes to the profile. Likewise, the detection of the conclusion of the conference may cause the profile behavior to revert to normal \u201cin the office\u201d handling or whatever mode of operation is appropriate.","In contrast to the NS function, the RS function generally does not maintain state information or carry out the mechanics of processing a call or session request. The RS is utilized as a repository for profile and contact information. Upon receiving a request from one party to establish communications with another party, the NS consults the RS for routing information. The RS reviews user profiles of one or both of the communicating parties and applies any applicable features, such as find-me or call blocking that may affect the applicable contact list for a given party. The RS provides the list of contact information to the NS so that the NS may then commence to try the contacts.","The profiles that the RS uses to affect processing of session requests are maintained by the Service Management function . The Service Management function  provides the capability to edit contents of stored profiles and to perform validity checking and policy enforcement on the profile contents. Additionally, the Service Management function  is employed by the network service provider to control user features. Some aspects of control through the Service Management function  may also be made available to users of the network so that the users or subscribers can customize their own features.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the functions and services provided by the Presence and IM server  can be supplied to the enterprise as a paid service.","To ensure acceptable performance, a Service Quality Monitor server  is utilized to track the parameters relating to the service quality of the communication sessions supported by the network .","Under this scenario, the network  serves the various communication needs of an enterprise, which utilizes multiple hosts (personal computers , ), a Voice Over IP phone (e.g., SIP phone) , and a number of enterprise applications . These enterprise applications  can include e-mail , calendar , workflow , a project management and organization chart ","The e-mail application can be implemented in a typical e-mail server for receiving, storing, and routing e-mail messages among enterprise clients and outside parties. The workflow application is a business process automation tool, which handles the routing of work items among different departments or individuals in an organization to implement a consistent business process. As will be more fully described with respect to , the workflow process can be enhanced with presence information.","The enterprise calendar application provides scheduling function across the enterprise. Many other enterprise applications, such as time sheet management and inventory tracking applications, are well known and are included in the set of enterprise applications . On the client side, the PCs ,  also include calendar applications , respectively. The PC  can execute a program that acts as a background client database access point. The program has access to databases that store the user's information about calendaring and contacts. In an exemplary embodiment, the program can access databases accessible by Microsoft Office Phone Accelerator. Further, the program can contact the conferencing system to update the database  with information maintained by the user's databases. The program can control certain resources of the user's PC  act on behalf of the conferencing system.","The project management or organization chart application provides another form of application integration. For instance, the invitees to a communications sessions such as conferences and collaborative sessions may change dynamically in response to groupings identified in a project management tool or a position in an organizational chart. It may be desirable to establish a conference or collaboration with whomever is serving in particular role, regardless of the particular names involved. This approach allows the manager to change assignments in the project management environment and not have to go into a separate communications-oriented address book to update such information or have to remember names and addresses corresponding to people performing in each role. The behavior of the communications support system automatically tracks the changes in assignments recorded in the project management application ","In general, communications may be addressed to a group name or a \u201crole name\u201d or title and the communications or scheduling system consults the other applications to resolve the group or role identifier to a list of one or more contacts.","A similar effect may be employed for temporary delegation, for example when one party leaves another party in charge of certain duties while they are away. When a person indicates delegation of responsibilities, such as signature authority, in another tool such as a workflow tool, a communications\/scheduling tool may correspondingly direct invitations to the delegate in lieu of the named party. Resolution may take place based on name or e-mail address rather than requiring that the intended party be identified by role name as described above.","This delegation behavior may differ from the mere forwarding of e-mail to the delegate that was originally addressed to the delegating party. The full richness of the delegate's own communications preferences, such as \u201cFind-me\u201d functionality and multiple modes of communication, may be employed by the communications system to reach the delegate, according to the various ways provided for in SIP-controlled communications systems.","Also, context-sensitive delegation is possible. A selective delegation of responsibilities with regard to a specific topic or project may be supported across all manner of communications in the system of . E-mail and workflow items may be routed to a delegate based upon content or subject line (as described later with respect to ). Even phone calls established using a SIP mechanism may bear a subject line header in the signaling information and may be selectively redirected based on this information.","It is contemplated that from within the project management or organization chart application , the conferencing capabilities of the system of  can be invoked based on the information contained within the application.","The enterprise applications can be hosted on computing servers maintained by the enterprise and housed at enterprise facilities. These applications are accessible to enterprise personnel through an enterprise data network. Although not shown, the enterprise can employ one or more local area network (LANs) or wide area networks (WANs) to which the hosts ,  (e.g., workstations and servers) can access the network  and provide connectivity to the enterprise. Such internal networks can be protected by the enterprise security system , which can implement a firewall for access to the Internet or to an external data network. For the purposes of explanation, the network  can effectively be regarded as a single contiguous information transport network.","Further, the enterprise can deploy an enterprise security system  for effecting security policies and mechanisms (e.g., firewalls) within the enterprise network. The system  can communicate with the service provider over the network  to coordinate and implement security measures.","As an example of the diversity of communication media within the enterprise, it is assumed that user of the PC  seeks to communicate with a user of the PC . Such communication can be accomplished in a variety of ways. These parties can perform text messaging (\u201cchat\u201d) with one another using applications, such as instant communications client , executed on the PCs , . Alternatively, these parties may converse by conventional telephones, PBX telephones, or by the use of SIP telephony applications on the computers or SIP phones  coupled to the network .","These parties can also engage in live video, or collaborative interactions, wherein other modes of communication are used in parallel (i.e., concurrently) with the collaborative applications . For example, the parties may collaborate on editing a document using their respective workstations, while discussing the work over a telephone connection.","For collaborative interactions, the PC  can execute an application instance with collaboration capabilities; the instance represents a client application (for example, a stand alone executable or an application provided by a web browser using such exemplary tools as applets, Java Server Pages (JSP), etc., by which the PC  can participate in collaboration via one or more collaborative applications . For example, the application instance can be a Project Management Application, a Resource Management Application, or a Financial Management Application integrated with collaboration-related tools or functions such as presence, sharing, and etc. The counterpart process to the application instance is the application integration and sharing program ","With the services offered by the network service provider via the network , the many network elements of  can exchange various information, including signaling, digitized audio signals, video, data files, SIP messages, text messaging, presence-related registrations and inquiries, images, authentications, billing-related events, etc. Both signaling and information traffic are communicated among the elements through the network . Digitized audio signals are as a stream of packetized data according to, in an exemplary embodiment, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) H.225 protocol suite, including the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).","With respect to the conferencing services, the telephone conferencing bridge  couples to the PSTN  to provide an audio conferencing bridge that multiple parties may dial into to communicate with one another. Although  shows the bridge  interfacing with the PSTN , it is contemplated that the service provider can own and operate some telephony switches, such as Class 3 switches, that are viewed as being a part of the PSTN  and may couple parties over a wide geographical area into the bridge  through a network of one or more Class 3 or Class 4 telephony switches.","Whereas the telephone conferencing bridge  provides conferencing among parties who are coupled through the PSTN , the Internet Protocol (IP) conferencing bridge  serves parties who are engaging in telephony via the data network . It is recognized that, by the presence of the network gateway , either the IP conferencing bridge  or the telephone conferencing bridge  can be used to conference a mixture of parties who are using traditional telephony as well as voice-over-packet technologies. For example, the SIP phone  may participate in a conference along with one or more conventional telephones ,  using the telephone conferencing bridge . To accomplish this, the SIP phone  can establish a two-way RTP audio connection with the gateway , which extends as a telephony connection through PSTN  and to the bridge .","In a voice-over-packet environment, the bridge  performs the equivalent function of a conventional audio bridge in processing audio signals from multiple parties coupled to the bridge . The IP conferencing bridge  can support two-way RTP stream connectivity with multiple sources and processes, wherein the various incoming digitized audio streams are combined or selectively gated, and subsequently, dispatched to the conference participants. The IP conferencing bridge  may also operate to serve as a video or multimedia conferencing bridge. To establish the multiple packet telephony connections, the bridge  is configured to conform to such standard signaling protocols as International Telecommunications Union (ITU) H.323 or SIP. The IP conferencing bridge  can also be referred to as a \u201cconferencing server.\u201d","Yet another approach for accommodating both IP phones and conventional telephones involves coupling the two types of conference bridges ,  to one another. This coupling can be readily accomplished, particularly if both bridges ,  are under control of a common service provider.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, each conference participant has a corresponding data profile. The data profile may include an image, a sound bite, a video clip, or an animated graphical presentation to be presented to callers either while in conference or while being summoned or while on hold.","The conferencing system may display each remote party by an image on the screen, perhaps as a static image in lieu of full motion video. The view may show an array of \u201chead shots\u201d of each participant. As each person talks, their corresponding image on the interface changes in some manner to highlight the source of the speaking. Alternatively, to save space while using a collaborative whiteboard for example, a single space for showing these images is provided and the image in this space changes to reflect whoever is speaking or dominating the bridge at that moment. The conferencing bridge ,  (or server) can sense which input channel is dominant (either due to automatic volumes sensing or due to active control by a moderator) and send this information along to the various client applications or devices being used by each participant. It is contemplated that a person participating via a RTP audio session or a conventional telephone call might nevertheless have an interface on a workstation that displays the various parties on the call and indicates who is speaking at any given moment. This may be achieved by communications from the conferencing bridge ,  or the collaborative application  to a workstation application resident on PCs , . Whereas the images or identifiers for the participants may have been communicated earlier at the commencement of the conference or as part of the invitation, the real-time display of currently talking parties may use the same identifiers or some other suitable mapping that adequately matches the dominant speaker to their respective display position.","Another data element available from the participant may be a business card, resume, or other textual data that is immediately viewable to other participants without having to be explicitly uploaded or displayed during the conference. In other words, every time a person participates in a conference, their electronic business card is automatically available to everyone else because it is provided in their profile information. Participant user interfaces may allow for selecting or activating a name, identifier or image corresponding participant to have the corresponding data presented for viewing or downloaded, such as into an address book or business contact database. An alternative may be a user interface control that, when selected or activated, performs a similar retrieval or display operation pertaining to whoever is speaking or dominating the bridge at that moment. The information may reside in a database (e.g., NS\/RS ) that is accessible to conferencing or collaborative applications servers. This information may be cached as each participant enters the conference or may be obtained prior to the commencement of the conference session. Alternatively, information such as SIP signaling messages used to join each participant to the conference may be augmented by a short data stream pertaining to the participant or pointing to a source of further information.","The conference scheduling application  can also provide automatic identification of the caller. The capability is particularly useful in conferences that involve a very large number of participants. For example, a company executive may wish to address a large number of employees and perform essentially a unidirectional broadcast. This situation is often handled differently than a conventional audio bridge conference session. To manage the large number of audio inputs and prevent talkers and extraneous noises from interrupting the conference, the many channels are coupled to the audio bridge in a listen-only mode. The incoming lines are coupled to a conference operator or moderator. If and when the session is opened for questions from the participants, each participant wanting to talk may indicate a desire to do so by pressing a key on a telephone keypad or otherwise summoning the attention of the moderator so that the participant may be queued for being able to talk on the bridge.","Another aspect of these types of calls is that, as each party joins the conference call, the moderator asks each party to identify themselves. This may be used for authentication purposes and may also be used by the moderator to introduce the participant to the listening audience when the participant is later granted permission to speak. In accordance with the present teachings, presence information maintained within Presence and IM server  or NS\/RS  may be used to provide or confirm the identity of a participant for the benefit of a moderator in these situations.","It is contemplated that system of  support rollover into conferencing or collaboration from chat or other modalities. In other words, users involved in communications sessions should be able to freely add or delete modes of communication (e.g., chat, voice, shared whiteboard, extra participants) without having to drop communications altogether or make pre-arrangements. The service provider should also be able to monitor the setup and dissolution of a variety of sessions and be able to accurately bill for such usage.","Throughout the description of various features and processes mentioned above, there are opportunities to take into account relative priorities and deciding whether one interest prevails over another. Relative priorities may be applied as various parties or project activities vie for conferencing resources or as urgent work items and events compete for the time of a busy enterprise employee.","It is contemplated that the conferencing services supported by the bridges ,  are provided as revenue-producing services by the network service provider. Accordingly, the billing system may play an integral role in a commercial service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring now to , the database  comprises multiple databases in support of the billing, rating and authorization function of the billing system , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The billing database  couples to a billing interface  that creates billing records within the billing database  in response to event notifications that are received from various network elements in the system of . These event notifications are indicative of service usage by the users. The billing system  are implemented, for example, as one or more server computer systems that executes billing interface  in software to collect usage-related information from other elements. A similar billing function is operated by a service provider that hosts collaborative applications  and\/or calendar sharing applications .","As mentioned, the billing system  collects and processes event notifications from other elements indicative of usage. The billing system  also compares notifications or records from various sources to compile event records that are related to a common conference session or common instance of usage. Additionally, the billing system  determines apportionment of charges and resolves how charges should be billed and who should be billed. As evident in , one option involves use of a credit card database  that can be coupled to external credit card systems . This is noteworthy in that users, who are not pre-subscribed to some services, may nevertheless use the system spontaneously as long as they are able to provide for some means of payment. This is referred to as \u201cwalk-in\u201d or random business, as opposed to subscribed or contractually prearranged business arrangements.","Another role of the billing system  is to authorize the accessing and usage of system resources based upon the ability of a party to pay for usage. In other words, when a user initiates a scheduling request or an actual communications or conference session, the billing system  determines whether the user has an account in good standing to which charges are applied. Furthermore, a balance related to a charge account limit or pre-paid account of some nature are debited and tested, while the user uses the system. The use of the system can be terminated, perhaps with advance warning to the user, upon the account balance being exhausted.","The billing database , by way of example, comprises a number of individual databases, each representing a particular method of billing: a Pre-Paid database , a Collect database , a Subscriber database , a Post-paid database , an Automatic Number Identification (ANI) database , a Third Party database , as well as an Other Billing database  to accommodate various other billing methods. Each individual database can be implemented by a standalone database containing records of accounts or can be an interface to an external system, such as a validation system operated by a credit card company. The description of the databases - is enumerated below in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Database","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Pre-paid","User purchases services prior to use, and billing"]},{"entry":["database 205","system deducts value of services from pre-paid"]},{"entry":[{},"balance"]},{"entry":["Post-paid","User pays for services after use"]},{"entry":"database 211"},{"entry":["Collect","Bills conferencing and communications services to"]},{"entry":["database 207","called party's telephony or communication services"]},{"entry":[{},"account"]},{"entry":["Credit card","Bills conferencing and communications services"]},{"entry":["database 203","against user's credit card account"]},{"entry":["Subscriber","Bills conferencing and communications services to"]},{"entry":["database 209","subscribed services account"]},{"entry":["ANI database 213","Bills conferencing and communications services to"]},{"entry":[{},"user's associated telephony services account"]},{"entry":["Third Party 215","Bills conferencing and communications services to"]},{"entry":[{},"user's account with third party, such as another"]},{"entry":[{},"service provider or commercial entity"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As indicated by the Other billing database , the above billing methodologies are not exclusive, but are instead merely illustrative of some of the billing options that can be used to receive value in exchange for the provision of chat-based services. It is noted that the various databases - can communicate with external systems for maintaining its data. For example, the Credit Card database  couples to a credit card system . The billing functionality can be logically or physically centralized or distributed and can be integrated to varying degrees with other network elements within the system of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"As seen in , a participant transmits a request via a user interface , such as the collaborative application instance , to the conference scheduling application . The application  in turn accesses the necessary information from the database  to create invitations to the other participants. In this example, the database  stores calendar information specifying schedules of the particular participants, address book information, and resource reservation information. The invitations are transmitted to the participants according to their respective profiles. For instance, the invitations can be sent based on the delivery mechanisms specified in the profiles. These mechanisms can include e-mail, paging, and instant messaging.","As an invitation to a meeting, conference or collaboration session is sent out, the invitation may contain elements that interact with a calendar application , (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) to cause the meeting to be automatically noted as an event on the personal schedule of the invitee, wherein an e-mail notification contains information that causes a scheduled event to be added to a participant's calendar. The notification can include an icon signifying the nature of the event so that, in a graphical rendering of the calendar, the icon provides a visually compact reminder of the nature of the event, such as a logo of a particular organization to denote a meeting of that organization.","Traditionally, calendar applications employ a fixed set of symbols to represent various types of events. However, the present invention, according to one embodiment, advantageously allows for sending of an arbitrary icon. This is highly flexible and enables the sender to make effective use of the invitation as a reminder.","In addition to the participants themselves having the capability to collaboratively establish a conference, the conference scheduling application  supports conference setup by a third party. For example, in some environments, it is desirable to allow a third-party, such as an administrative assistant, to set up conferences and collaborative sessions on behalf of the participants. This is important where a physical conference room needs to be scheduled in conjunction with the reservation. Where a service provider operates or hosts a conference scheduling application, an interface is provided wherein authorization to perform actions on behalf of others is configurable by the service provider or by a responsible party at the enterprise.","Upon receipt of the invitation, the invitee can accept or decline the invitation to join the conference via a number of communication mechanisms, as next described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":"401"},"The composing and embedding of response addresses in an invitation to facilitate responding to the invitation may depend on the type of communications used to send the invitation. For example, a telephone message can issue a callback telephone number before listing other response alternatives, such as an e-mail address. On the other hand, an invitation sent via instant messaging may provide a response screen name first, followed by e-mail or telephone number information. An e-mail invitation can supply a telephone number that is dialed and a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) hyperlink pointing to a web page, or an IM chat icon. Of course, the invitee can respond simply by replying to the e-mail. The telephone number that is provided in the e-mail invitation (or page) can be to an automated VRU, such as the Intelligent Service Node , to provide a response to the invitation. A connection is provided by which a voice response interaction with a user who has \u201cdialed in\u201d to respond to an invitation are used to update an invitation response status within conference scheduling application .","In addition, a paging message can be sent to a pager to provide a telephone number or text message indicating how the invitation is answered. In the case of a two-way pager, acknowledgement of receipt of a page is monitored to indicate receipt status to a requestor. The two-way paging system can provide for Yes\/No answers or even full text to be sent as a response via e-mail. It is recognized that some paging systems can also detect successful dispatching or receipt of a page even if there is no capability to support full two-way text messaging.","A web-based application may receive responses to invitations so that a participant can respond from any workstation with a web browser application. Under this scenario, network security measures can be taken, such as secured VPN access to internal application or authentication procedures and secure communications to Internet accessible sites.","As noted, the invitation can be dispatched by variety of means. Additionally, this dispatch can be subject to a profile-controlled \u201cfind-me\u201d function, which may involve presence state, employing a variety of contacts and a variety of modes of communication to reach an invitee party with the invitation.","It is recognized that under some circumstances the requestor of the meeting will contact prospective invitees before involving the reservation system. That is, the person may seek to informally determine whether a meeting is worthwhile before involving the formal scheduling mechanism. When it is decided that a meeting is desired, then the requestor can utilize the scheduling application  to reserve resources and obtain particular information, such as conference bridge dial-in number and password, physical location, etc. The conferencing system is useful in this type of scenario because the system provides broadcast of the finalized meeting information and can provide invitation response status, if needed. Upon sending out the invitations, the scheduling application  tracks the responses.","The conference requestor can elect to be actively notified of the invitation responses through the user interface . This notification  can similarly be accomplished in a variety of ways through various devices, including PDA, pager, telephone, text message, or e-mail. The frequency of updates or conditions under which the requestor is to be contacted with update information is configurable, as to suit the preferences of the requestor or in accordance with policies set at the enterprise level.","As explained previously, the conference scheduling application  processes input criteria  from the requestor, such as the meeting criteria , the time limit  for responding to the invitation, and the settings and criteria  for notifying the requestor. The application  ensures that the criteria is satisfied in setting up the conference, and determines whether to commit or release resources based on the received responses and the available resources (as indicated in the resource reservation information within the database ).","The conference scheduling application  also supports the capability for the requestor to inquire about the meeting confirmation status. For example, the requestor can determine the status by dialing via telephone to a VRU, establishing an instant messaging session with a chat-accessible service platform, using a suitable workstation client application, accessing a site on the web, or corresponding with the system via e-mail.","The conferencing system may also be configured to enforce any meeting confirmation criteria. For meetings involving selected groups of people, such as a department or a committee, an address book function is provided to maintain a corresponding list of attendees\u2014similar to an e-mail distribution list. To facilitate assembling lists of participant information, the contact information for a participant can be obtained from a variety of sources at the user's workstation (e.g., PCs , ). Electronic mail applications commonly provide many features to facilitate addressing of return mail and for accumulating and managing address book lists.","In the context of conferencing, collaboration, scheduling and instant communications it is advantageous to be able to glean contact information from the data items or applications. A user can retrieve contact information from an identifier from any source, including non-e-mail sources such as electronic business cards. The integrated desktop environment can utilize a clipboard feature (or comparable facility in other user interface environments) to collect or drag-and-drop names, and addresses (or information that could be interpreted and resolved to a contact) among the various applications.","A conference event can be represented as a \u201cpackaged\u201d data entity that is accessible by many applications and may exist as a desktop icon and exhibit menu-activated and drag-and-drop activity. This data entity has several important attributes, such as location, actual or planned attendees, scheduled times, actual duration and pointers to supplementary materials or transcripts. As one example of the use of this entity, a user may wish to set up a new conference having many or all of the same attributes as an existing planned or concluded conference. To schedule the new conference, the user may first launch a scheduling interface that provides text entry or other controls for accepting input on conference parameters. Where the interface provides a place to accept attendees, the user may drag and drop the former conference's data object onto the attendee entry area to have the attendee list from the former meeting applied to the new meeting. Where the interface is receptive to time and date information, the data object representing the earlier conference is drag-and-drop manipulated to replicate its time and\/or date parameters in the new conference. It should be noted that these actions provide a starting point from which the attendee list, time and date info or other attributes of the new conference may then be edited as needed before submitting the scheduling request to the scheduling application (or engine) .","Alternatively, the user may perform a copy-and-paste operation involving the original conference object to create a duplicate as a starting point. The conference data object is used for entering into an active conference by being manipulated onto, for example, an instant communications client or a telephone dialing application. The entry into the conference may also be a menu option associated with the desktop icon of the conference event object.","It is noted that the conference session can involve instant messaging communication, telephony communication, or even launching of a collaborative application. To facilitate such use, the user can be provided a menu option, toolbar icon or other \u201cactivatable\u201d user interface element which, in the context of an e-mail being selected or viewed by the user, draws the contact information from the e-mail and launches a communications interface having the same parties identified in preparation for engaging in instant communications with them.","This may also involve recognizing and converting names or e-mail addresses to other forms of addressing such as chat screen names, telephone numbers, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) aliases, etc. which are suitable for establishing instant communication with the appropriate parties. An alternative is to have a system supporting instant communications, scheduling, conferencing, etc. that accepts e-mail addresses directly and performs a best effort resolution of addresses.","One approach in which a user may arrange a conference involves establishing a chat session with a chat-accessible service. The user may converse with a human assistant or automated assistant via chat or using an instant communications client to request that a conference be scheduled, to request information about a conference or to immediately have a conference session established.","A regular meeting or an impromptu meeting can be readily called by referring to a preset group of attendees. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a meeting request may remain tentative until certain criteria are met. For example, one may specify that the meeting is not confirmed until all of the invitees agree to meet or at least some minimum number or percentage of the invitees agree to meet. In other cases, specific individuals are designated as \u201crequired,\u201d whereas other attendees are optional. The address book stores such information for specific groups or types of meetings, such as a \u201cquarterly operations review.\u201d In other cases, the conference requestor specifies these criteria on an ad hoc basis as part of the initial request. A maximum time (i.e., \u201ctime out\u201d) for invitation responses can be set.","The conferencing system supports various interfaces whereby the requestor can be notified of which and\/or how many invitees have responded and whether the conference has been successfully reserved based on the criteria set forth. The interfaces for receiving this \u201cstatus of the conference reservation\u201d can include e-mail, phone, text messaging, etc. The requestor is also provided with a list of names of parties that have responded and\/or a list of those who have not responded. The frequency of updates or conditions under which the requestor is to be notified of the status of the meeting is optionally configurable by the requestor.","It is noted that, at times, a conferencing collaboration or instant communications session is desired with at least one member of a given group (or category of invitees), but without requiring any specific member. For example, the invitation can be directed to a pool of employees within a particular department, wherein any one of the employees possesses the appropriate authority to take action (e.g., respond to requests or initiate work orders).","The various described procedures and mechanisms for setting up a conference can also be applied to reschedule conferences should the need arise.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the conferencing scheduling application  provides a conferencing \u201cwizard,\u201d which guides the user through screens and menus for setting up a conference. The wizard can prompt for information about the meeting and the participants. Meeting information can include parameters enumerated in Table 2 (below), and participant information can be those listed in Table 3. The complement of options provided to the user by the conferencing wizard may be affected by such factors as an assessment of resources that will be available during the desired meeting time, the set of features that the user is authorized to employ for conference scheduling, capabilities and schedule availability of invitees as may be determined in real time by checking calendar information or presence information, or consulting of databases or directories or applications (organizational chart, project tracking application, etc.) which determine a set of invitees corresponding to a particular group or class of invitees.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Participants for the meeting"},{"entry":"Type of meeting, in which one, many, or all of the following can be"},{"entry":"selected:"},{"entry":"1.

Any concurrent invitations to other members of the group who were not the first to respond are optionally withdrawn, or those members can simply be copied on the finalization details of the conference. The other members of the group are informed of which group member responded on behalf of the group or is indeed handling the matter.","Returning to the example of , when a user receives an invitation, the user can be presented with a meeting reminder in a calendar application (e.g., Microsoft Outlook calendar application or a meeting invitation similar to Windows Messenger, Sametime or AOL IM) that allows the recipient to click one button for entry into the conference, either through voice, video, and\/or data collaboration (e.g., file sharing, application sharing, electronic white board, etc.) In this manner, the participation process is automated, such that the recipient need not perform any process manually.","In the response process, a file containing a description and identification of the conference can be exchanged, whereby the file can be input into and interpreted by a conference application within a host, workstation, or device of the participant. The file can be specified as a particular file type (or extension) that is readily recognized at the device, thereby causing a conferencing application to be launched for handling the file to enter the conference with minimal additional input from the user.","The workstation can provide for entry into conference in a largely automatic manner without the user having to locate and act upon the invitation to enter into a conference. Entry into a conference is automatically triggered as a recurring event, when a conference becomes active or when the scheduled start time of the conference arrives. Another type of automatic conference entry may occur when an immediate conference invitation is received. The user may configure the workstation or system profile information such that, when a conference invitation from a certain party or concerning a certain subject arrives, the user is automatically entered into the conference including any parallel sessions or applications required for participation.","Alternatively, a user can select or activate this type of feature associated with an invitation whereupon the user is presented with a dialog box to verify that the user indeed wants to join the conference at that time. The option to enter the meeting immediately is conditionally presented to the user based upon whether the current time is within the published time frame of the conference or is responsive to sensing whether the conference is indeed underway as will be described later herein. The dialog box may provide an opportunity to authenticate the user attempting to enter the conference.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the information necessary to identify the conference and any required parameters for successfully joining the conference are embedded in or referenced by the invitations. When the user activates this feature in the invitation, the user is automatically joined to the conference if the conference is underway. That is, the user need not perform any additional steps to join the conference, such as invoking a separate application and then specifying what conference is to be joined.","Data pertaining to the conference, such as presentation handouts or e-mails, may also automatically be presented to the user upon entering the conference or as an option upon activating or selecting a feature embedded in the invitation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["101","500","501","503","505","507"]},"Although the screen  is shown as appearing in a user interface as list or table of invitee names (or other identifiers) along with one or more indicators representing whether each entry has received, acknowledged, accepted or declined the invitation, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that there are many possible configurations for presenting this type of information. For example, the status fields , ,  can be represented by changes in the appearance (e.g., color, font style) of the invitee's name or changes in the graphical icon associated with the name. Alternatively, the list can selectively indicate only those parties who have or have not responded in some manner. Also, the screen  can display an array of images representing the invitees. The images may similarly change in appearance or placement so as to convey the acknowledgment\/acceptance status of invitees. Textual identifiers and graphical representations for invitees are used as alternatives or in combination subject to implementation, display device capabilities, and to the preferences of the user viewing the interface. The images can also change to represent the availability of the invitees based on the invitees' electronic calendars.","The user interface for displaying the invitation response status for a given event can be provided via an application on a requestor's workstation, corporate application or web-service, with due consideration for security measures. That is, the screen  can be displayed to the conference requestor through a web browser application or other equivalent client application.","The response status information is synchronized with the respective participants' electronic calendar (e.g., , ).

The appearance of the calendar application  can be manipulated to indicate when the meeting is actively in session and when the user is an invitee. The appearance may also communicate whether attendance of the particular user is imperative or optional. The size occupied by the indication (e.g., a bar indicator) superimposed in the calendar or day planner interface is indicative of actual start and stop times or overall duration.

The extraction application , according to various embodiments, can range from a minimal process operating invisibly on the workstation  to a complete standalone application providing a user interface by which the user can configure its operation, such as controlling what information are extracted and presented to others. Alternatively, the extracting process may operate elsewhere on another host, wherein access to this type of information at the workstation  is through file sharing or inter-process communication.","As shown, the users' calendars can be maintained entirely in a central location, such as the enterprise-wide calendar  and the group scheduling application . The information is readily accessible to a scheduling function, and the parties can access their calendars through web browsers or other clients. The calendar information that is extracted, remotely maintained, and made available for scheduling processing or review by others are all inclusive or are selectively restricted. For example, only unreserved or \u201copen\u201d (or available) time slots are extracted and provided to the scheduling application  (which can be deployed as a scheduling server). In other cases, a user's entire schedule is remotely recorded, whereby only free time slots are made visible to the scheduling application  or to other parties. The ability of other users to access this information, in an exemplary embodiment, depends on their access privileges, delegation of authority or their role within an organization. The access control parameters are configurable at an enterprise level according to policy and\/or by individuals associated with the calendar information.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the users' schedules are implemented as a server that is accessible by users from many enterprises or other parties outside of the enterprise. This type of server is depicted in  as calendar sharing application , which may or may not be hosted and controlled by the network service provider. It should be noted that the calendar sharing application  enables sharing of availability information among users from different organizations in addition to users within the same organization. This capability is useful when two different organizations need to closely collaborate; for example, a team of designers from one company works with a group of manufacturing engineers from another company in a joint venture. For the benefit of the collaborative effort wherein the users from different companies will function temporarily as a single, cohesive team, the scheduling application  supports scheduling of meetings or conferences with knowledge of the time slots available for the team members.","With due consideration for security and privacy issues, the calendar sharing application  may serve as a repository for limited personal schedule information to be shared among companies. This avoids the companies having to expose some of their network and computing infrastructure to one another. In this regard, the calendar sharing application  complements the common meeting point role served by the collaborative applications .","The manner and degree to which personal or resource schedule information is provided to the calendar-sharing application and the control of who may access such information are administered by selected users in the enterprise, or by a service provider or other entity having control of the application. For example, limited sharing arrangements mutually agreed upon by collaborating organizations are configured, for example, through service management application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0155"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]},"Media crossover may involve, for example, having audio converted to\/from text messaging, having graphical text converted to text messaging or audio, and having snapshots of images sent via facsimile transmission. The collaborative applications  are utilized to accommodate differences between presentation media and participant reception capabilities. This technique can be applied, as seen in , to a participant who is using only a telephone (e.g., a SIP phone) , whereas other participants are engaging on chat or viewing textual information via a chat server . While monitoring the conference by listening through the telephone , the participant can receive a low-volume audio signal from a text-to-speech (TTS) converter . By the proper selection of speech characteristics for the speech rendering, the text reading undertone can be readily distinguished from live conference speeches from the other participants connected to the audio bridge  (e.g., telephone conference bridge ). The TTS converter  can be controlled by user profile settings supplied by a NS\/RS server . For a SIP call, the \u201cRTP mixing\u201d can be performed at the SIP phone ; alternatively, if the call is a conventional telephony call (i.e., circuit switched call), then the TTS audio undertone can be supplied to the audio bridge .","As another example of media crossover, a user can participate in the conference session by video through an instant communications client; however, the user may not have full access to a collaborative application by which to participate and view the shared whiteboard or workspace. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the participant who has a video connection may receive the whiteboard image as a converted video image. Under this scenario, the participant's video feed can switch between the presenter and a video rendering of the whiteboard space. This switching may occur either automatically, under the control of the presenter, or as requested by the participant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0158"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"]},"As shown, multiple presentation application instances  are executed, wherein each of the respective instances loads a presentation file  and transmits the file  to corresponding device context modules , , . The instances , in an exemplary embodiment, are launched from the presentation sharing application (of ). Although shown as separate components, the presentation application instances  and the device context modules , ,  reside on a common server. In fact, the collaborative applications  can be executed on such a common server.","The presentation sharing application (shown in ) supports the ability to show a view of the presentation file  to users who do not have the presentation application on their computers or devices, but instead have, for example, a web browser application. This approach advantageously minimizes the requirement of the end devices to have additional applications and avoids having to disseminate copies of the presentation before or during the conference. Additionally, the approach ensures that proprietary presentations are not stored or distributed without the consent of the presenter.","In the course of providing slideshow presentations and whiteboarding display to a variety of participants, the server customizes output in a variety of ways, including language translation of text passages within presentations and messaging communications. Also, the output of graphical information to participants is differentiated at the server. The presentation (or collaboration) server tailors the output format to suit various types of end user devices, associated connection speeds, and user preferences. Specifically, each of the device context modules , ,  converts the file  to accommodate the end device that is to display the presentation; the conversion can involve altering the size, resolution, color format, etc. of the presentation file . For example, a lower resolution view of a presentation is suitable for using a PDA . Rather than sending a high-resolution image to a small display, the resolution is reduced and efficiently transmitted a lower resolution view. This avoids burdening the end user device with scaling down or re-sampling the image \u201con the fly.\u201d Having the server perform the display adaptation is especially practical if the server is already occupied in playing a presentation into a virtual display space as in the presentation sharing application ().","Where a presentation includes animation or transitions between slides, the server is able to render these effects, whereby each receiving device will receive a best effort rendering limited primarily by the bandwidth or refresh rate afforded by the connection. As a further advantage, having the server perform re-sampling, magnification, color conversion, scrolling, rotating, panning and other graphical tasks ensures that the handling of the image is not dependent upon specific applications being present and properly configured on the small device. In many cases, generic web browsers are used as a \u201ccommon denominator\u201d client supported by a wide variety of receiving devices.","Rendering attributes are profile-associated for the user or device. These attributes can be changed dynamically by commands sent from the device to the server during the communications session. In this example, these commands are carried in the form of so-called SIP \u201cre-INVITE\u201d messages or in Session Description Protocol (SDP) content sent therewith.","The device context modules , ,  communicate with corresponding transmitters (XMTs) , ,  to the hosts or devices. In this example, the PDA  can view the presentation file , which is adapted for the processing power and storage capability of the PDA . Additionally, the presentation file  can be processed by the language assistance intercept such that esoteric terminologies, acronyms, and abbreviations can be explained or defined.","If the presentation file  includes audio, the presentation sharing application may provide play-out and feed audio into a conference bridge or as a RTP stream to an instant communications client. Consequently, even non-PC connected users or users accessing the conference by phone will receive the sound program from the presentation without manual intervention from the conference presenter, who is likely remote from the conferencing application server and has to provide presentation audio feed through a separate connection into a bridge or conferencing application. Thus, the audio associated with the presentation is fed to a bridge (or broadcaster) , which outputs to the conference participants.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["109","109","109","109"],"i":["b ","b ","b ","b "]},"In step , textual information (e.g., text string) is received.

The supplemental information can be presented automatically by the application or elicited by the participant by, for example, clicking on the problematic word or phrase as it appears in the text. The availability of this supplemental information is represented by highlighting, bolding underlining or italicizing of the text for which \u201chelp\u201d is available.","If the selective translation feature is active, as determined in step , then the text is translated in part as assistive (or supplemental) information without replacement of the text, per step . This assistive information is then sent to the participant client, as in step . The received text is highlighted in some fashion, as in step , to indicate to the user that supplemental information is available.","Returning to step , if the selective translation feature is not active, then the language assistance application defaults to \u201ctranslating\u201d acronyms or providing definitions. This mode of operation is extended to conferencing that does not necessarily entail differing languages but instead involves specialized terminology, such as technical, legal or medical terms. The received text is compared with a predetermined list of terms and their definitions, and\/or a list of acronyms, per step . Even in the context where parties are very familiar with a topic, it is desirable to ensure a common understanding of certain terminology. In some cases, operational definitions are set forth by a presenter to facilitate clear communications. As one advantage of the presently taught mode of operation, the availability of definitions in this manner may avoid participants having to interrupt the presenter to ask for clarification, especially in cases where a participant is late and misses the beginning of a conference when such operational definitions may have been introduced. Even in the case where a participant receives the initial presentation of a definition, the participant may want to recall the information later during the presentation.","These lists can be third-party-provided definitions, such as known dictionaries or technical dictionaries, or terminologies and definitions supplied by the user organization. That is, the language assistance application can incorporate special data repositories offered by third-party suppliers. For example, depending on subject matter, it is useful to recognize key words, phrases or acronyms and to insert information drawn from resources such as Newton's Telecom Dictionary, Black's Law Dictionary or a medical encyclopedia. Such assistive or supplemental information is useful, for example, in the case where different engineering teams across the same organization use different terms for the same meaning. In step , it is determined whether the received text matches any terms or acronyms on the list. If so, the term is retrieved as supplemental information for the received text, per step .

For example, the annotations can be textual information or involve recorded audio. A participant engaged in an audio conference can momentarily \u201cmute\u201d the audio feed into a bridge to record or dictate a brief, private audio annotation to be associated with that point in the conference in progress. In this example, the workstation  includes a microphone  for providing audio annotation. Text annotation can be input using a keyboard . Also, a mouse  is utilized to select a marker location and type.","For parties who are participating by a conventional telephone station (not shown) with DTMF signaling and who want to provide verbal annotation during a conference, a specific DTMF key sequence (or some other in-band or out-of-band signaling mechanism) is used to cause the telephone's microphone to be momentarily decoupled from being input to the bridge so that the caller's voice are separately recorded. The verbal annotations are intercepted and recorded by the conferencing system and stored in a file to be later accessed or downloaded by the participant who recorded the annotation or by others, if so authorized. To conclude the verbal annotation, the caller may press another key sequence.","To prevent the DTMF tones or other in-band signals used in this manner from interrupting the conference audio, the conference bridge are designed with a modified gating behavior so that it recognizes and switches to a dominant signal only if the signal does not conform to the standard frequencies and amplitudes specified for DTMF tones. In the case of a bridge that mixes signals rather than switching on a dominant signal, each audio input may undergo signal processing, with a slight delay, to detect and squelch such tones before they enter the audio program that is heard by all of the bridge participants.","It is noted that recording of a conference or collaboration may extend to textual transcription and meeting notes, either of which are offered as a service by another party or commercial service provider.","With respect to the playback of the annotated conference session, the workstation  receives the recorded conference session, which is stored remotely by the recording application .

The logic  generates a new media file  with all the markers (both public and personal) and the public and personal annotations.","In some instances it is advantageous to integrate conferencing, collaboration, scheduling and instant communications with other applications. For example, information maintained in a database application, such as Microsoft Access, Microsoft Active Directory, X.500\/(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), may be accessible to these communications-oriented tools. This might enable a scenario wherein an account executive may, with a single action, initiate a communication session with a customer and have the appropriate cognizant engineer or salesman automatically included in the session.

Delegation may also be multi-layered, meaning different delegations may selectively apply to communications, signature authority, workflow, etc. In the case where the addressee has an associated delegate who can act on behalf of the addressee, the delegate's availability is determined, per step . The work item is then sent to the delegate, as in step , if the delegate is available.","In step , the process checks whether there are time frame requirements associated with the work item. The work item is sent to the addressee, per step , if no time frame requirements are imposed. Workflow processing is made presence-aware by interaction with Presence and IM server  or NS\/RS .

If the person is not indicated as being available by conventional means (e-mail, messaging), a personal calendar may then be consulted to determine how soon the person might have unscheduled time to be able to address the work item. This is compared against the time frame allowed for processing the item and the relative importance of adhering to that time frame. If it is imperative that the item be handled within 24 hours and the addressee is out of the office for several days, then a delegate is sought.

Accordingly, RS , according to an embodiment of the present invention, may be modified to provide a form of redirect or location server, which provides differentiated responses depending upon the type of information that is sought, the type of communications modality to which a request pertains, the type of server or application making the request, or other circumstances pertaining to the request for information solicited from the RS.","In step , a routing request is received.

The formats of these requests may be quite similar and differentiated by the content of particular fields or header information in the requests. In some cases, all requests serviced by the redirect server may be submitted in a generally consistent format, such as a SIP message, but may be differentiated by the presence of, or values of, specific headers in the SIP message. In other implementations, requests to the redirect server may be received in a variety of formats to better accommodate the native capabilities and protocols used by the various requestors. Whereas a SIP proxy server may submit requests in a format similar to a SIP \u201cINVITE\u201d message, other processes or applications may submit requests in the form of XML, Java byte code, arbitrarily formatted flat text, data structures having particular formats and semantics, telephony signaling messages, or virtually any other format that can be used to achieve data communication as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","Whether the request requires interpretation, or such interpretation is unnecessary due to the source of the request, in step , a response appropriate for the request is prepared, accounting for the formatting of the response as well as the complement of features, profile and presence information. The response may also relate to the nature of the request, for example, whether the contact that is sought relates to establishing a real-time telephony communication from a live originator as opposed to a meeting notification being sent out by an automated application.
