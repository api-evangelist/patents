{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is related to New Gasbarro U.S. patent application Ser. No. entitled \u201cPersonal Digital Assistant Having Satellite Communications Capacity\u201d, Filed Aug. 5, 2003, assigned to the same assignee as the present application.","This invention relates to the field of portable computing devices, specifically the field of laptop or tablet computers.","The use of communication systems having wireless mobile communication units has become widespread. Wireless communication systems that operate within a cell or coverage area provide several important advantages over conventional wired systems. For example, wireless communication users can communicate in locations where wired service is not available or feasible, such as remote or rugged locations. Additionally, wireless communication users within the cell have much more mobility because the units do not have to be connected to a fixed wired network. These and other favorable characteristics make wireless communications ideally suited for personal, business, military, search and rescue, law enforcement, water vehicle, and other field related applications.","If an area is equipped with robust communications infrastructures (e.g., cell towers), there are relatively easy ways to establish and maintain such wireless communications to mobile users, by making use of the infrastructure. However, there are some endeavors where it is necessary to provide such a wireless communications capability even while in an area that does not have such a communications infrastructure, and in such cases it is much more difficult to establish and maintain such wireless communications to mobile users.","Even in areas without such a robust wireless communications infrastructure, there are techniques that have been developed to enable the mobile members of a team to establish and maintain digital communications. For example, it has become increasingly common to provide wireless communication devices in motor vehicles. The interior of a motor vehicle provides a relatively controlled environment for such a device to operate, and the motor vehicle itself generally provides a large antenna mount and, more importantly, a ready source of power. This has allowed vehicles to incorporate a number of useful functions, including automated incident notification, two-way audio communication, and even limited information retrieval, such as sporting event results and stock reports. Several successful implementations in the military sphere have been based on netted line-of-sight radios, and netted line-of-sight radios combined with satellite data terminals designed for mobile operations.","While vehicle mounted wireless communications systems offer many convenient features, they are disadvantageous in that they require the operator to remain within the vehicle to be useful. Often, the very time where a wireless device would be most useful is a situation where a motor vehicle has become damaged or inoperative. In such a case, it may become hazardous for an operator to remain within the vehicle to make use of the communications system. Similarly, situations may arise where an occupant must leave the vehicle for another reason. For these situations, a dismount solution would be desirable that maintains much of the functionality of the vehicle communications system while maintaining a minimal size and weight.","Presently, the functionality of dismount devices is limited by a number of considerations. Increased functionality requires an increased number of components increasing the size, weight, and power consumption of the dismount device. These considerations are aggravated by the redundancy of the dismount device in the context of a vehicle communications system, as the dismount device is necessary only on those infrequent occasions where the operator requires wireless communications while separated from the vehicle.","In military applications, existing communications systems to and from individuals separated from a vehicle (referred to as dismounted users), however, have suffered from severe technical limitations that impede and degrade tactical operations in significant ways. Existing problem areas include battery life, range, relaying, safety, weight, complexity of operation, setup and configuration time, and missing functionality. Similar problems plague electronic communications to small mobile teams in other domains, such as search-and-rescue teams, and law enforcement agents in the field.","Most of these problem areas can be related to the issue of battery life; the severe limitations on battery capacity limit the transmit power, which in turn limits communications range. The same severe limitations on battery capacity also limit the transmit duty cycle (i.e., the duration or percentage of time which a transmitter can be on and transmitting), preventing a dismounted individual from communicating continuously without either receiving new batteries or having access to a battery charger for appropriate mission durations. Current implementations are so inefficient that to carry spare batteries for an entire week's worth of mission would be infeasible.","The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is intended neither to identify key or critical elements of the invention nor delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a tablet computer assembly is provided. The tablet computer assembly includes a global positioning system module that produces location information associated with the position of the tablet computer assembly. An L-band satellite transceiver broadcasts the location information to at least one portable communication device through a relay network and receives location information from the at least one portable communications device via the relay network. A computer processing unit provides messages to the L-band transceiver and updates a display associated with the tablet computer assembly according the received location information and the location information produced at the global positioning system module. The tablet computer assembly can be provided with custom software and one or more antennas.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a vehicle communications system is provided. The system includes a dismount communications device and a mounting unit. The dismount communications device comprises a global positioning system module, and L-band transceiver, and a tablet computer. The global positioning system module determines the location of the device. The L-band transceiver receives data from at least one portable communications device via a satellite relay. The tablet computer that provides a user interface for the global positioning module and the L-band transceiver. The mounting unit allows the dismount communication device to be mechanically fixed to the interior of a vehicle and electrically connected to a power supply within the vehicle.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for updating location information at a tablet computer via a communications relay network. The location of the tablet computer is determined at regular intervals via a global positioning system. The determined location information is broadcast on an L-band frequency via the relay network to at least one communications device. Location information is received from at least one portable communications device on an L-band frequency via the relay network at the tablet computer. The determined location and the received location information are displayed on a display associated with the tablet computer.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The present invention relates to systems and methods for utilizing one or more tablet computers in a communications network. A tablet computer can be in the form of tablet, a laptop, notebook computer or other portable computing device. The tablet computers incorporate L-band transceivers and GPS modules to allow automated communication of position data to and from other portable communications devices within the communications network. Each tablet computer can contain geographic information and appropriate software for viewing and manipulating the position data and the geographic information. The tablet computers can also include the capacity for broadcasting text messages, either with or without position data associated with the tablet. These messages can include preset messages, such as a request for supporting fire or a hazardous materials warning, or they can simply be a free-text message composed on a touchscreen keyboard.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the tablet computer can comprise one element of a vehicle communications system within a tactical network. For example, the tablet computer can be mounted to a mount within the vehicle interior to serve as a display for a communications system within the vehicle. One or more ports can be made available within the tablet for electrically connecting to vehicle components to receive power or exchange data. The tablet computer can also be removed from the vehicle at need to provide a self-contained dismount communications system compatible with the tactical network.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the tablet computer assembly can be made modular to allow replacement of obsolete portions of the assembly without incurring significant reengineering costs. For example, a suitable tablet computer assembly can be adapted from a commercially available tablet computer. Converting an existing tablet computer requires the addition of one or more new computer boards as part of a transceiver module and an antenna to interface with GPS and L-band communications satellites. In the exemplary embodiment, the transceiver module comprises three board assemblies. The three boards include an RF transceiver assembly containing circuitry for L-band communications, an amplifier board that contains amplifiers necessary for transmitting and receiving L-band and GPS signals, and a digital board that includes a GPS module for determining the location of the tablet and control circuitry for the GPS module and the transceiver.","A major problem with incorporating additional boards is the accumulation of heat from the amplifiers and other digital components in the proximity of the heat sensitive components, such as a central processing unit and one or more memory chips, within the tablet computer. To combat the heat problem, an aluminum enclosure can be added to enclose and support the additional circuit board assemblies. In addition to acting as a heat sink for the internal circuit cards, the enclosure provides both a mechanical interface for the transceiver module and support for the satellite antenna. The enclosure also acts as a Faraday cage, which shields the internal circuitry from unwanted electromagnetic interference (EMI) radiating from external devices and the tablet computer.","The tablet computer can be connected to the transceiver module through hardwired circuitry or an expansion board. The connection to the transceiver module passes through filters installed in the lid of the Faraday cage. The design approach is modular, enabling quick replacement of damaged components, with minimal invasion to the tablet computer. Internal metal shielding with the Faraday cage provides additional protection to the RF and amplifier assemblies from both the tablet computer and the other circuit boards within the transceiver module. The present design overcomes previous problems in isolating the interference caused by normal antenna radiation patterns and internal RF emissions, which previously had interfered with the proper functioning of the compact satellite communications devices. Efficiencies gained by packaging, message representation schemes, software, a combined GPS\/L-band satellite antenna, and system-level power management (including automatic GPS power cycling) combine to achieve a level of battery life that makes this device feasible and useful, and distinguishes it from all previous implementations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","16"]},"The control module  is fitted with a back plate .

This can include filtering and demodulating the messages, as well as other known signal processing techniques. The digital logic board  is also responsible for the conversion of data between analog and digital formats, where it is necessary. Thus, the digital logic board  can include an analog-to-digital converter and\/or a digital-to-analog converter for digital sampling.","The GPS module  provides position information to be included in broadcast messages. For example, in a battlefield implementation of the tablet computer assembly , one of the predetermined messages available for user selection can be a request for evacuation and medical assistance. The GPS module  can provide location information for the requesting unit, so the information can be automatically include in the call for assistance. In addition, the location information for the unit will be automatically broadcast to one or more other portable communications devices (not shown) over a tactical network.","The RF transceiver assembly  contains the hardware components necessary for the communications functions of the transceiver module . These hardware components are located on one or more circuit boards comprising the RF transceiver assembly. For example, the RF assembly  can include an IF (intermediate frequency) board with frequency tuning circuitry for upmixing signals from the digital logic board  for transmission and for downmixing received signals to appropriate frequencies for processing, as well as an amplifier board with one or more amplifiers. In an exemplary implementation, the RF transceiver assembly  can include appropriate shielding to prevent interference with the processing by external electrical and magnetic fields.

In an exemplary implementation, the antenna has a helical configuration stretching over a length of approximately four inches.","An input\/output conversion card  regulates the logic and power connections between the control module  and the transceiver module . For example, the input\/output conversion card  can regulate a power supply voltage to the transceiver module  via a DC-to-DC converter that produces an appropriate supply voltage from a power supply  associated with the control device . The input\/output conversion card  can also regulate the logic level of signals passing between the control device  and the transceiver module .

The transceiver control  also provides an application programming interface to external applications. The digital board  further comprises a modulator\/demodulator  that translates between the baseband signal associated with the transceiver control  and the intermediate frequency associated with the a frequency converter  on the RF board .","In an exemplary embodiment, the modulator\/demodulator  comprises a field programmable gate array (FPGA) configured to provide the acquisition of a forward channel from the tactical network and to track the signal within that channel. After acquiring and tracking the signal from the forward channel, the FPGA decodes the forward error correction information coded into the data and provides the signal information to the transceiver control  for further processing.

Similarly, the SPOT option allows for automated reporting of the location of enemy troops. In an exemplary embodiment, the type (e.g., artillery, infantry, etc.) and approximate number of the enemy troops can be entered at a menu along with an estimate of their location. The Medical Evacuation and Check Fire commands work similarly, broadcasting a request for assistance from the user with location data for the tablet computer.","When a preset message is not appropriate for a particular message, a user can select the free text entry as an option. Free text can be entered via an attached keyboard, or as part of an on-screen keyboard accessible via an appropriate input device, such as a touchscreen or a mouse.

The GPS interface routine  also drives the GPS module  periodically to produce updated location data according to a predetermined update schedule. The user interface routine  is responsive to commands from an input device, such as a touchscreen keypad. This can include commands to adjust the display of data, to generate a message for an associated transceiver , or to initiate a tablet destruct routine  that completely erases and destroys the device memory.","The tablet computer assembly can contain security protocols besides the memory destruction of the tablet destroy routine . For example, the tablet computer assembly can include remote challenge protocols, remote lockout protocols, remote memory destruction, and remote re-keying of the L-band SATCOM transceiver from a central station.","When a command is received requiring the broadcast of a message at the transceiver, the user interface routine  provides the command to a message processing routine . The message processing routine  generates an appropriate message according to the user command and provides the message to a transceiver interface routine . The message processing routine can also generate automated messages according to a predetermined schedule. The generated message can include location data provided from the user interface process  as well as appropriate encryption. Where a message is received at the tablet computer, the message processing routine  decrypts the message, logs it to a memory, and assigns a time and date stamp to the message. Any text or position data provided within the message is then extracted and provided to the user interface routine  to be displayed to the user.","The transceiver interface routine  interfaces with the control circuitry of the transceiver  to drive the processor to broadcast messages from the message processing routine . The transceiver interface can drive the transceiver to error code a message and modulate to a radio frequency signal. The message is then amplified and broadcast over an associated antenna. The transceiver interface routine  also oversees the demodulation and error checking of messages received at the transceiver .

For example, the software can transition the tablet to a state of lower power consumption, such as a blank display condition, when it has not received input from a user for a predetermined period. The transitions can also be instigated directly by user input at a graphical user interface on the tablet. The graphical user interface can display an estimate of the remaining battery power for the device to guide the user in determining an appropriate power consumption state for the tablet, the transceiver, and the GPS module. The tablet can produce visual and audible alerts when the battery level reaches one or more predetermined levels.","Turning to the illustrated stages , when the tablet is displaying or receiving information, it remains in a Tablet On mode . This is the mode of the highest power consumption for the tablet, and it provides full functionality to the user. In the On mode , the tablet can display geographical information and received location updates, receive additional location updates from the transceiver and the GPS module, and process message requests from the user.","When the tablet has been idle for a set period of time, the tablet will enter a Stand-by mode . In the tablet stand-by mode , the tablet will blank its display until it receives input the user. In an exemplary embodiment, the tablet can transition from Stand-by mode  to On mode  when it receives input from the GPS module, or the transceiver, providing an audible alert to the user that updated information is available.","The lowest power consumption stage for the tablet is the Tablet Off mode . The Off mode  can be selected by a user or automatically selected after a predetermined idle period for the tablet. As the name would suggest, in the Off mode , the tablet cannot display or receive information or receive user input until it is restarted. Position updates and text messages received during the tablet Off mode will not be stored at the tablet, but in an exemplary embodiment, incoming messages can be cached at the transceiver control hardware until the tablet is reactivated.","The transceiver is also controlled by circuitry, and can be transitioned through its power management stages by control software at the transceiver as well as the tablet software. The transceiver generally remains within a Keep Alive mode  until it is necessary to receive or transmit data. In the Keep Alive mode , the transceiver consumes a minimal amount of power to monitor the antenna for incoming signals and to maintain memory in power sensitive applications within the transceiver control. The transceiver only transmits data at a user command and at predefined intervals, so the transceiver will generally spend a majority of its operation at the Keep Alive mode .","The transceiver is switched to an On mode  when it is actively transmitting and receiving data. This can be the result of user intervention (e.g., a message request) or automated processes within the control software of the tablet and the transceiver (e.g., a scheduled location update transmission). The transceiver can also be switched to an ON mode  in response to an incoming transmission. A transceiver off mode  can be selected by the user or by a control process for situations requiring extreme power conservation. While in the Off mode, the transceiver cannot send or receive messages and can lose queued data stored in memory within the transceiver control circuitry.","The GPS is controlled through GPS power cycling software at the GPS module and has three primary power modes , , and , as well as an Off stage . At a GPS On mode , the GPS has normal functionality. In other words, the GPS module determines the location of the tablet and provides this information to the tablet. The GPS module remains in a Stand-By mode  between periodic position updates. As it is only necessary to update the location data for the tablet information at periodic intervals (e.g., every 150 seconds), the GPS module In the Stand-by mode , the GPS module does not actively acquire position data, but maintains a ready state to conduct periodic updates of the device position.","The third primary power mode is a Keep Alive mode . The Keep Alive mode has the lowest power consumption of the three primary power modes. The Keep Alive mode provides enough power to retain data stored in nonvolatile memory, such as almanac data, cryptography parameters, operator entered data, the current time, the last recorded position, and similar data. In an exemplary embodiment, there is a timeout period in which the transceiver will switch to Keep Alive mode if no operator interaction has occurred in the GPS ON mode . Finally, a GPS off mode  can be selected by the user or by a GPS control process for situations requiring extreme power conservation. While in the Off mode , the GPS cannot send or receive messages and will lose any stored initialization data in memory. It would thus be necessary for the GPS module to repeat the \u201cfirst fix\u201d initialization process when reactivated.","In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above, methodologies in accordance with various aspects of the present invention will be better appreciated with reference to . While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies of  are shown and described as executing serially, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the illustrated order, as some aspects could, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other aspects from that shown and described herein.

At , routing information within the message is processed to determine which of a plurality of relay points within the relay network should rebroadcast the message to the associated plurality of portable communication devices. The friendly communication units can include tablet computers intended for dismounted units in accordance with the present invention, as well as larger tactical systems within vehicles and stationary encampments. One or more selected relays can re-broadcast the message at a power level substantially larger than the received message signal to increase the coverage area of the tactical communication system. At , the message is multicast at the one or more selected relay points.","At , the rebroadcast message is received at the tablet computer. The message is checked for routing data at , and at , the tablet computer determines if the message is intended for the tablet computer. If not, the methodology advances to  where the message is ignored. If the message is intended for the tablet computer, the methodology advances to , where the display of the tablet computer and the system memory are updated to reflect the information from the message. For example, if the message includes location data, the system memory will be changed to reflect the new position of the originating object will be moved relative to the map on the display.

At the end of this interval, the tablet computer assembly updates its location information using a GPS module. In an exemplary embodiment, the first interval has a length of two and one-half minutes. If it is necessary to update the GPS location information, the transceiver module enters a GPS receiver mode at . In the GPS receiver mode, the transceiver module sends received L1 and L2 signals directly to a GPS module for analysis. The methodology then continues to , where the GPS module analyzes the received signals to determine the present location of the tablet computer assembly. This can be accomplished by any of a number of means known in the art. The methodology then advances to .
