{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to software, and more specifically, trade-off\/semantic networks.","In system administration, configuration, troubleshooting, and other similar tasks, various resources, components, and other environmental factors are evaluated. However, administration may be difficult and complex, particularly with configurable systems. Installation and administration of configurable systems are problematic because various features, if altered, may result in cascading effects that can negatively affect overall system performance. Given the complexity involved with large-scale systems, such as distributed or enterprise software systems, modification of a single resource or component may lead to unpredictable or unforeseen effects.","There are several challenges associated with resource and system configuration of complex systems. Numerous resources such as individual servers, clients, databases, and other components may be placed into a particular system configuration. Troubleshooting a performance problem may be difficult because each performance problem in a configuration may require the manipulation of multiple resources. Determining which resources to manipulate can involve significant time, skill, and labor. Another challenge occurs when a resource is manipulated to alleviate a problem, but creates or causes an unforeseen effect in other resources. Configurable systems are difficult to troubleshoot given relationships between system components. For example, a server-based system (e.g., SQL server) may be affected by one or more resources or attributes including CPU speed, CPU stress, hardware costs, available memory, and communication bus speed. However, when one of these attributes is modified, an unforeseen, detrimental effect may be caused, resulting in poor system performance.","Thus, what is needed is a solution for managing configurable systems while avoiding the limitations of conventional techniques.","In system configuration, there is a need for proactively and reactively managing changes, attributes, and other elemental attributes for troubleshooting, administration, and maintenance purposes. The use of a trade-off\/semantic network enables configurable systems to be managed using a graph or map of trade-off relationships between elemental attributes.","In one example, a method for authoring a trade-off semantic network is described, including identifying a plurality of elemental attributes, relating each of the plurality of elemental attributes to the others to configure a trade-off relationship between each of the plurality of elemental attributes, and defining an agility extension configured to modify a value for each of the plurality of elemental attributes, wherein the value affects the trade-off relationship between each of the plurality of elemental attributes and the trade-off semantic network.","In another example, a method for using a trade-off semantic network is described, including providing a map of the trade-off semantic network, including a plurality of nodes and a relationship between each of the plurality of nodes, the relationship and the plurality of nodes having a cause and an effect on a current configuration, determining if pain exists in the current configuration, and enabling manipulation of a value of each of the plurality of nodes to alleviate the pain.","As another example, a method for using a trade-off semantic network is described, including identifying a pain point, determining a path associated with the pain point, returning a plurality of nodes associated with the pain point, determining whether any of the plurality of nodes has changed, returning a new plurality of nodes associated with the pain point, and enabling the manipulation of a value associated with each node of the new plurality of nodes to correct the pain point.","Yet another example describes a trade-off semantic network including an authoring tool configured to map the trade-off semantic network including one or more elemental attributes, a logic module configured to evaluate information from the trade-off semantic network, and a configuration module configured to determine a value for the one or more elemental attributes.","Another example describes a system for modeling trade-offs including a user interface configured to provide user input to and data output from a trade-off semantic network, a plurality of elemental attributes arranged within the trade-off semantic network, a configuration module for relating each of the plurality of elemental attributes to each other to configure a trade-off relationship between each of the plurality of elemental attributes, and a logic module configured to define an agility extension for modifying a value for each of the plurality of elemental attributes, wherein the value affects the trade-off relationship between each of the plurality of elemental attributes.","Still another example includes a computer program product for configuring a trade-off semantic network, The computer program product is embodied in a computer readable medium and comprises computer instructions for: identifying a plurality of elemental attributes; relating each of the plurality of elemental attributes to each other to configure a trade-off relationship between each of the plurality of elemental attributes; and defining an agility extension configured to modify a value for each of the plurality of elemental attributes, the value affects the trade-off relationship between each of the plurality of elemental attributes.","Additional features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the following description, are obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practicing the described techniques. The features and advantages may be realized and obtained by means of the implementations and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an apparatus, a system, a composition of matter, a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network wherein program instructions are sent over optical or electronic communication links. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of the disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.","Configurable systems may be diagnosed and managed using a trade-off\/semantic network (hereinafter \u201ctrade-off semantic network,\u201d \u201ctrade-off\/semantic network\u201d or \u201cTOSN\u201d). As a tool, a TOSN may be used to graph or map trade-off relationships between elemental attributes in a system (e.g., SQL server). Elemental attributes (\u201cattributes\u201d) describe each facet of a system's resources, components, devices, or a system's basic characteristics. Incremental changes to attributes may cause an overall effect because of the existence of trade-off relationships. Trade-off relationships or \u201ctrade-offs\u201d are based on the interaction between elemental attributes. By manipulating values of elemental attributes (i.e., basic aspects of a system, such as but not limited to memory, CPU clock speed, RAM, and the like) and trade-off relationships, administrators may perform proactive and reactive system configuration, enabling efficient system administration. Various classes of paths in a TOSN may also be used to manage elemental attributes, trade-off relationships, and other aspects of configurable systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","108","104","104","106","108","104","106"]},"In some examples, authoring tool  and consumer tool  may include more than one tool, module, or system. TOSN user interface  provides a communication interface between TOSN application  and a user (not shown). TOSN application  may be used to map trade-offs associated with system , using data from database . In some cases, data base  may be implemented using various techniques including a storage system, network (e.g., SAN), facility, repository, or other storage resource. In some examples, TOSN application  may also be installed on a client with a system that is being managed. In other examples, TOSN application  may be remotely installed at one location while managing disparate resources at other locations. TOSN application  may be used to manage relationships such as those shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","202","216","200","200","200","200"]},"Trade-off relationships - are shown between each of elemental attributes -. These relationships illustrate basic characteristics of trade-offs between system resources or components when values for elemental attributes are adjusted. In some cases, modifying the value of a single elemental attribute may cause the value of an elemental attribute associated with a trade-off relationship to be affected in a directly proportional or inversely proportional manner. In the case of directly proportional relationships, the relationship between two elemental attributes is such that as the value of the first elemental attribute increases, the value of the second elemental attribute also increases. In the case of indirectly proportional relationships, the relationship between the two elemental attributes is such that as the value of the first elemental attribute increases, the value of the second elemental attribute decreases. In either case, the reverse may be true. In either case, the impact of modifying the value of one elemental attribute on another node may be referred to as an \u201caffect.\u201d Affects may also be described in terms of the direction or strength of a trade-off relationship. Trade-off relationships may also be described as unidirectional or bidirectional. In the case of unidirectional relationships, modifying the value of one elemental attribute has an affect on another elemental attribute, but not vice versa. For bidirectional relationships, two elemental attributes may affect each other across a trade-off relationship in either direction. In other words, a bidirectional relationship enables, for example, elemental attribute  to affect elemental attribute  and vice versa. By establishing a trade-off graph using elemental attributes connected through trade-off relationships, a system may be mapped to determine the particular effects changing one or more elemental attributes of a specific configuration, providing a valuable tool for system administrators, managers, and developers.","TOSN  may be used for various purposes by system administrator, managers, and developers. As an example, configurable systems may be mapped using TOSN  to identify lowest-level system components, resources, and attributes as elemental attributes. Upon determining elemental attributes, trade-off relationships may be established. Trade-off relationships may be used to determine the effect of one elemental attribute upon another, as well as indicate a direction (e.g., bidirectional, unidirectional) and a strength of the relationship. In some examples, trade-off relationships may be associated with paths, which may be used to determine a \u201ctreatment\u201d for the alleviation of \u201cpain\u201d associated with a particular configuration. In some examples, \u201cpain\u201d may be described as a condition where system tolerances, limits, or parameters are exceeded. For example, a trade-off relationship may cause available memory (e.g., RAM) to be exceeded. For example, different classes of paths (e.g., first-class, second-class, third-class) may be used to aid administrators in diagnosing a problem in a system, where the paths may be used to narrow or identify the particular source of pain for an elemental attribute. Classes of paths will be described in greater detail below in connection with . Pain may be described as a system or configuration problem that may affect one or more elemental attributes, and which may be alleviated, transferred, or eliminated by modifying the value of one or more elemental attributes in TOSN . In some cases, elemental attribute values that do not share a direct trade-off relationship may be modified to indirectly alleviate system pain. Several elemental attributes may be affected by a single pain source. Likewise, several elemental attributes may be causing pain at, or to, a particular elemental attribute. For example, referring to , pain may be caused at battery charge elemental attribute  by hard drive stress elemental attribute  and RAM stress elemental attribute . In these cases, both elemental attributes  and  are depleting battery charge and causing a detrimental effect at and to elemental attribute . As another example, size of RAM elemental attribute  may create performance or configuration restrictions at memory paging elemental attribute  and cost of the hardware elemental attribute . TOSN  enables administrators to preview, diagnose, and manipulate system configurations in order to determine resultant effects of modifications to values of various elemental attributes.","Using a TOSN may be performed through a user interface such as TOSN user interface  (), providing data communication and display abilities with TOSN application . As an example, system  may be managed by evaluating and analyzing its attributes (including database ) to identify issues involved with system performance, maintenance, and troubleshooting. In some examples, a user interface (not shown) may be used in which TOSN  is illustrated in one window, a taxonomy and\/or trade-off data structure or categories may be illustrated in another window, with reports of system information generated in yet another window. In other examples, various user menus and actions may be performed to graphically manipulate elemental attribute values (e.g., sliding a bar and changing the value of an elemental attribute or trade-off relationship, double-clicking on an elemental attribute or trade-off relationship icon and entering a value for an elemental attribute, selecting an elemental attribute or trade-off relationship in a window and entering a value, or other similar user interface-oriented actions). Various techniques may be used to implement a user interface for TOSN application  and TOSN  other than those described above and are not limited to the examples provided. A taxonomy may be used with a trade-off graph such as that described in .","A taxonomy, which refers to the \u201cSN\u201d side of a TOSN, provides a separate framework for analyzing and performing other tasks in relation to TOSN . As an example, trade-off relationships may fall into various categories, including parent-child relationships or those that are specific to a given context (e.g., SQL server, system or network configurations, and others). Trade-off relationships may include trade-off relationships such as those illustrated in . In other examples, trade-off relationships may also include elemental attributes such as those shown in , and described above. Here, elemental attributes may be classified using a taxonomy including terms such as \u201cpart of a\u201d, \u201cis a\u201d, or \u201ca kind of\u201d. These relationships may also be considered as sub-categories. These are sub-categories for classifying trade-offs that aid in describing and analyzing a TOSN. In other examples, more, fewer, or different relationships may be used. Using a taxonomy, elemental attributes may be categorized and reconstituted into real-world objects, that enable inference of information that may be useful to a administrator, developer, or other TOSN user.","Each of the sub-categories provides a classification for the different types of elemental attributes that may be used in a TOSN. The \u201cpart of a\u201d sub-category may be used to classify trade-off relationships as a collection of items in a process, procedure, object, or other abstract concept. The \u201ca kind of\u201d sub-category classifies elemental attributes that may be grouped as a set of choices. For example, the use of a table-join may involve three types: merge, hash, and nested. By selecting one of the types of table-joins, a trade-off relationship is \u201ca kind of\u201d type of join. Finally, the \u201cis a\u201d sub-category enables trade-off relationships that are similar to each other to be grouped together. However, trade-off relationships in this category are different than those in the \u201ca kind of\u201d category in that they are not interchangeable with other similar trade-off relationships. In other examples, different categories and sub-categories of trade-off relationships may be used as a taxonomy for classifying relationships between elemental attributes in a TOSN. In still other examples, more or fewer categories and sub-categories may be used to describe trade-off relationships. TOSN application  may be implemented using computer source code to perform functions such as those described below in connection with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 4"],"b":["302","304","306","102","308","206","204","204","206","200","310","5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["402","102","404","200","406","408","200","200"]},"As a planning tool, TOSNs enable system administrators to preview the effect of modifying or adjusting the value of an elemental attribute. As an example, if a system administrator reduces the amount of available memory storage for a system, trade-off relationships may convey various effects to a system. In the example shown in , if \u201csize of RAM\u201d elemental attribute  is reduced, affects may occur in \u201cmemory paging\u201d elemental attribute  and \u201ccost of the hardware\u201d elemental attribute  because of unidirectional trade-off relationships. In other examples, indirect effects may cascade to other elemental attributes in TOSN . Different configurations or processes for using TOSN  may be implemented and the above example is a single illustration of how TOSNs may be used to diagnose system performance in a proactive manner. TOSN  may also be used in a reactive manner, as a tool for alleviating or reducing pain in a current system configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["502","504","506","508","510","112","512","514","516"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["518","520","200","112","522","200","524","200","526","528","530"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","606","608","610","612","614","616","618"]},"According to one embodiment of the invention, computer system  performs specific operations by processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in system memory .
