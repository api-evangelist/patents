{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES","Example 1","Preparation of 13,13-dimethyl-des-C,D analogs of (20S)-2-methylene-1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D16 (13Me) and 17 (13Me-C)"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/022,696 filed Jan. 22, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Not Applicable.","The natural hormone, 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin Dand its analog in ergosterol series (i.e., 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) are known to be highly potent regulators of calcium homeostasis in animals and humans. More recently, it has been reported that their activity in cellular differentiation has been established. (Ostrem et al., 1987, 84, 2610). Many structural analogs of these metabolites have been prepared and tested, including 1\u03b1-hydroxyvitamin D, 1\u03b1-hydroxyvitamin D, various side chain homologated vitamins and fluorinated analogs. Some of these compounds exhibit an interesting separation of activities in cell differentiation and calcium regulation. Such differences in activity may be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases such as renal osteodystrophy, vitamin D-resistant rickets, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and certain malignancies.","In 1990, a new class of vitamin D analogs was discovered. The so-called 19-nor-vitamin D compounds were reported, which have been characterized by the replacement of the ring A exocyclic methylene group (carbon 19) (typical of the vitamin D system) by two hydrogen atoms. Biological testing of such 19-nor analogs (e.g., 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D) have revealed a selective activity profile having high potency to induce cellular differentiation with very low calcium mobilizing activity.","Thus, these 19-nor analog compounds have been potentially useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignancies and\/or various skin disorders. Two different methods of synthesis of such 19-nor-vitamin D analogs have been reported. (Perlman et al., 199031, 1823); Perlman et al., 199132, 7663); and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,086,191 to DeLuca et al.). A few years later, synthesis of analogs of 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-19-norvitamin Dsubstituted at 2-position with hydroxy or alkoxy groups were reported. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,713 to DeLuca et al.) These 19-nor-vitamin D compounds also exhibit interesting and selective activity profiles. Binding sites in vitamin D receptors can accommodate different substituents at C-2 in the synthesized vitamin D analogs.","Recent synthesis and testing of the 19-nor class of pharmacologically important vitamin D compounds has been reported, whereby the analogs are characterized by the transposition of the ring A exocyclic methylene group from carbon 10 (C-10) to carbon 2 (C-2) (i.e., 2-methylene-19-nor-vitamin D compounds have been recently synthesized and tested). (Sicinski et al., 199841, 4662; Sicinski et al., 200267, 247; and, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,928, 5,936,133 and 6,392,071, each to DeLuca et al.).","Molecular mechanics studies, performed on these analogs, showed that a change of A-ring conformation can be expected resulting in the \u201cflattening\u201d of the cyclohexanediol ring. From molecular mechanics calculations and NMR studies their A-ring conformational equilibrium was established to be ca. 6:4 in favor of the conformer that has an equatorial 1\u03b1-OH. Introduction of the 2-methylene group into 19-nor-vitamin D carbon skeleton changes the character of its (1\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-) A-ring hydroxyls. They are both now in the allylic positions, similar to the 1\u03b1-hydroxyl group (crucial for biological activity) in the molecule of the natural hormone, 1\u03b1,25-(OH)D. It was found that 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-2-methylene-19-norvitamin D analogs are characterized by significant biological potency, enhanced dramatically in compounds with \u201cunnatural\u201d (20S)-configuration.","An interesting modification of the vitamin D skeleton is removal of its C and D rings. The first compound (retiferol) lacking the C,D-substructure, was obtained thirteen years ago (Kutner et al., 1995, 23, 22). Later, several des-C,D vitamin Dderivatives, including 19-nor analogs, were synthesized. (Bauer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,190; and, Barbier et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,422) and some compounds (Ro 65-2299) showed improved biological activities. (Hilpert et al., 2001, 57, 681).","Recently, biological testing and synthesis of des-C,D analog of 2-methylene-1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-19-norvitamin Dhave been reported. (DeLuca et al., U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. US 2007\/0112077). The analog retained some VDR binding ability and transcriptional activity albeit significantly decreased in comparison to the analogous vitamins possessing intact C,D rings.","One aspect of the

A new synthetic route has been developed starting from the known (S)-7-benzyloxymethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-heptan-2-ol (DeLuca et al., U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. US 2007\/0112077). A process involving transformation of the starting alcohol 2, prepared in 6 steps from commercially available (1R,3R,4S,5R)-(\u2212)-quinic acid, into the aldehyde 14, and its subsequent coupling with the phosphine oxide 15, is summarized by the Scheme I and Scheme II.","Thus, the tertiary hydroxy group in 2 was protected as TBS ether and primary hydroxyl was deprotected by hydrogenation of the formed ether 3. Oxidation of the alcohol 4 provided the aldehyde 5 which was subjected to Still-Gennari reaction with the phosphono ester 6. The resulted mixture of the isomeric unsaturated esters 7 was hydrogenated to the saturated compounds 8. Alkylation process of the carbanions (generated from these esters by LDA) resulted in the introduction of a methyl substituent in the \u03b1 position to the carbomethoxy group.","DIBALH reduction of the formed methylated esters 9 provided the alcohols 10 which were converted to imidazole-1-carbothioic acid esters 11. These, in turn, were subjected to reduction with tributyltin hydride to yield the expected compound 12 possessing gem-dimethyl group. Deprotection of primary hydroxy group in 12 gave the alcohol 13 which was oxidized to the aldehyde 14. Wittig-Horner coupling of this compound with lithium phosphinoxy carbanion (generated from the phosphine oxide 15 and phenyllithium) yielded the expected mixture of protected vitamin D analogs. After deprotection with hydrogen fluoride, 13,13-dimethyl-des-C,D analogs of (20S)-2-methylene-1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D(16 and 17) were produced.","For the preparation of the required phosphine oxides of general structure III, a synthetic route has been developed starting from a methyl quinicate derivative which is easily obtained from commercial (1R,3R,4S,5R)-(\u2212)-quinic acid as described in Sicinski et al., 1998, 41, 4662 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,928 to DeLuca et al.","SCHEMES I and II set forth herein below in the examples show a detailed illustration of the preparation of compounds of formula Ia, and specifically 13,13-dimethyl-des-C,D analogs of (20S)-2-methylene-1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D.","As used herein, \u201ctherapeutically effective dose\u201d and \u201cadministering to a human a therapeutically effective dose\u201d refers to an amount of one or more APIs sufficient to treat (e.g., prophylactic, treating the active condition or curing) one or more of acne vulgaris, psoriasis, ichthyosis, photoaging, photodamaged skin, and\/or skin cancer.","Treatment regimens may also include numerous dosing regimens. For a human, various therapeutically effective doses and dosing regimens thereof may be determined from the animal data set forth herein using known Allometric Scaling (AS) factors. For example, for a mouse having a body weight of 0.03 kg, the AS factor is around 7 assuming a human body weight of 70 kg.","The predictive dosing range set forth in Table 2 was calculated assuming that the dose given to the Rhino mouse has been corrected for the expected lesser sensitivity of the human and further increased by 0.5 log dose. For the high end of the topical dose, the value was further multiplied by a factor of 20 as humans absorb only about 5% of the dose compared to 100% by the mouse. The low dose is 1\u00d710lower than the high dose. Differences in the animal species sensitivity to various vitamin D analogs as well as differences in relative absorption of various vitamin D analogs by the skin may also significantly affect the human efficacious dose compared to that used in the animal studies detailed herein.","The pharmaceutically suitable topical carrier system (also referred to as drug delivery systems, which are modern technology, distributed with or as a part of a drug product that allows for the uniform release or targeting of drugs to the body) preferably include FDA-approved and\/or USP-approved inactive ingredients. Under 21 CFR 210.3(b)(8), an inactive ingredient is any component of a drug product other than the active ingredient. According to 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), an active ingredient is any component of a drug product intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or other animals. Active ingredients include those components of the product that may undergo chemical change during the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect.","As used herein, the topical dosage form includes various dosage forms known in the art such as lotions (an emulsion, liquid dosage form, whereby this dosage form is generally for external application to the skin), lotion augmented (a lotion dosage form that enhances drug delivery, whereby augmentation does not refer to the strength of the drug in the dosage form), gels (a semisolid dosage form that contains a gelling agent to provide stiffness to a solution or a colloidal dispersion, whereby the gel may contain suspended particles), ointments (a semisolid dosage form, usually containing <20% water and volatiles 5 and >50% hydrocarbons, waxes, or polyols as the vehicle, whereby this dosage form is generally for external application to the skin or mucous membranes), ointment augmented (an ointment dosage form that enhances drug delivery, whereby augmentation does not refer to the strength of the drug in the dosage form), creams (an emulsion, semisolid dosage form, usually containing >20% water and volatiles 5 and\/or <50% hydrocarbons, waxes, or polyols as the vehicle, whereby this dosage form is generally for external application to the skin or mucous membranes), cream augmented (a cream dosage form that enhances drug delivery, whereby augmentation does not refer to the strength of the drug in the dosage form), emulsion (a dosage form consisting of a two-phase system comprised of at least two immiscible liquids, one of which is dispersed as droplets, internal or dispersed phase, within the other liquid, external or continuous phase, generally stabilized with one or more emulsifying agents, whereby emulsion is used as a dosage form term unless a more specific term is applicable, e.g. cream, lotion, ointment), suspensions (a liquid dosage form that contains solid particles dispersed in a liquid vehicle), suspension extended release (a liquid preparation consisting of solid particles dispersed throughout a liquid phase in which the particles are not soluble;

Alcohol is a good example of an ingredient that may be considered either active or inactive depending on the product formulation.","As used herein, \u201cprodrugs\u201d are compounds that are pharmacologically inert but are converted by enzyme or chemical action to an active form of the drug (i.e., an active pharmaceutical ingredient) at or near the predetermined target site. In other words, prodrugs are inactive compounds that yield an active compound upon metabolism in the body, which may or may not be enzyme controlled. Prodrugs may also be broadly classified into two groups: bioprecursor and carrier prodrugs. Prodrugs may also be subclassified according to the nature of their action. Bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds that already contain the embryo of the active species within their structure, whereby the active species are produced upon metabolism. For example, the first prodrug, antibacterial prontosil, is metabolized in vivo to its active metabolite sulphanilamide. Carrier prodrugs are formed by combining the active drug with a carrier species forming a compound having desirable chemical and biological characteristics, whereby the link is an ester or amide so that the carrier prodrug is easily metabolized upon absorption or delivery to the target site. For example, lipophilic moieties may be incorporated to improve transport through membranes. Carrier prodrugs linked by a functional group to carrier are referred to as a bipartate prodrug. Prodrugs where the carrier is linked to the drug by a separate structure are referred to as tripartate prodrugs, whereby the carrier is removed by an enzyme-controlled metabolic process, and whereby the linking structure is removed by an enzyme system or by a chemical reaction.

Vitamin D Receptor Binding. Test Material Protein Source. Full-length recombinant rat receptor was expressed in BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL cells and purified to homogeneity using two different column chromatography systems. The first system was a nickel affinity resin that utilizes the C-terminal histidine tag on this protein. The protein that was eluted from this resin was further purified using ion exchange chromatography (S-Sepharose Fast Flow). Aliquots of the purified protein were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use. For use in binding assays, the protein was diluted in TEDK50 (50 mM Tris, 1.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 5 mM DTT, 150 mM KCl) with 0.1% Chaps detergent. The receptor protein and ligand concentration was optimized such that no more than 20% of the added radiolabeled ligand was bound to the receptor.","Study Drugs. Unlabeled ligands were dissolved in ethanol, and the concentrations determined using UV spectrophotometry (1.25(OH)D: molar extinction coefficient=18,200 and \u03bb=265 nm; Analog: molar extinction coefficient=30,200 and \u03bb=243 nm).

The rats were then switched to a diet containing 0.47% Ca for one week followed by two weeks on a diet containing 0.02% Ca. Dose administration began during the last week on 0.02% calcium diet. Four consecutive intraperitoneal doses were given approximately 24 hours apart. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, blood was collected from the severed neck and the concentration of serum calcium determined as a measure of bone calcium mobilization. The first 10 cm of the intestine was also collected for intestinal calcium transport analysis using the everted gut sac method.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0131"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"COMEDOLYTIC EFFECT OF DAILY TOPICAL"},{"entry":"APPLICATION OF 1,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D3"},{"entry":"AND 13MeTO THE RHINO MOUSE"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Comedone Area",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Compound*","(% Vehicle)**","Dose (nmol\/kg)","N"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1,25(OH)D","187 \u00b1 30","6.0","6"]},{"entry":[{},"13Me","26 \u00b1 3","217","6"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"*All compounds were applied topically on a daily basis for ca. 3 weeks in vehicle comprised of 70 vol % ethanol and 30 vol % propylene glycol."]},{"entry":[{},"**Values are mean + standard error of the mean"]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0132"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PREDICTIVE HUMAN TOPICAL DOSING RANGE"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"COMPOUND","TOPICAL DOSING RANGE"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"13Me","36 mg to 11 ng\/kg\/day"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Rhino mice were used to topically test the compounds and compositions of the invention. The Rhino mouse is a well-established animal model used to study the comedolytic effects of anti-acne agents including retinoids. (See Boulcier M et al., 1990, Experimental Models in Skin Pharmacology, 42:127-154). The Rhino mouse model was used to study the therapeutic potential of 13Me.","Animals and dose administration. Rhino mice were enrolled in the study at 6-8 weeks of age and were dosed daily via the topical route. The mice were weighed three times per week and doses were adjusted weekly based on body weight. The topical formulations were applied to the back of the animal in a maximum volume of 100 \u03bcL. The topical formulations were made by mixing the 13Mewith a topical carrier comprising 70 vol % ethanol and 30 vol % propylene glycol, as indicated. The topical vehicle control was the vehicle carrier solution matched to the formulation containing API and vehicle carrier. Mice were sacrificed 72 hours after the final topical dose. At sacrifice, the dorsal skin was collected for histology studies.","Comedolytic effect. The extent of the comedolytic effect (i.e., efficacy) was assessed by measuring the average area of the comedones, whereby the smaller the area, the larger the effect. The comedone area was determined by histological analysis of tissue sections based upon lab methods. Skin was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0 C. with gentle agitation, and dehydrated the next day into 100% methanol.","Samples were embedded in paraffin and a total of nine 10\u03bc sections 150\u03bc apart were prepared from each Rhino mouse. Five of the nine sections were digitally imaged (6\u00d7 magnification) for comedone analysis using Metamorph Imaging Software (trace function). The perimeter of each comedone on the images taken from the 5 sections was then traced using a Wacom Intuos 3 Graphics Tablet interfaced with the software.","The number of pixels comprising the area of each individual comedone was obtained, and the mean number of pixels per comedone was obtained for each Rhino mouse. For comedones that were completely healed (area=0) a pixel value approaching 0 (<10) was scored. The individual comedone area average for each mouse was then used to calculate the treatment group mean. Results in the figures are expressed in terms of mean\u00b1standard error of the mean.","Preparation of topical formulations containing 13Me. A concentrated ethanolic stock of 13Mewas diluted to a final concentration containing 30 vol % propylene glycol and 70 vol % ethanol as the excipient carrier system. The mixture was thoroughly mixed. The topical dosing formulation delivered a predetermined dosing amount of drug on a per kilogram body weight basis. A 100 \u03bcL dose was administered to the back of the mouse. An average weight of 24-30 g\/mouse was assumed in dose volume calculations. Dosing volumes were adjusted weekly to deliver the desired predetermined dosing amount of API based on the body weight of each individual animal."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["2 ","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":["2 ","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["2 ","2","3 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sub":["2 ","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":["2 ","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sub":["2 ","BW","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":["2 ","BW","2 "]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
