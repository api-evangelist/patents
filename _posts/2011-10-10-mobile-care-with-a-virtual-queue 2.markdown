A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the West MCAP services layer , the provisioning module , the authentication module , the Client #1 ICM module , the Client #3 ICM module , the WEST CORPORATION ICM module , the Client #2 Genesys module , the push notification module , and the mobile push services module  can be stored on one or more servers (not shown). The Client #1 contact center  can be implemented on a remote server (not shown). However, what hardware devices are used to store the various software applications, and where they are stored, is a matter of design choice.","The mobile application  is configured to send or transmit a request message to a mobile web server (not shown), via the Internet . The mobile web server can be implemented on the WEST MCAP services layer . The request message is a request to connect an agent with the user of the mobile application . The request message may include, amongst other things, a client identification, an application authentication key, a callback number, etc. Using the information in the request message, the mobile web server is configured to authenticate the mobile application (or user) , via the authentication module  and return a session token to the mobile application . Upon authentication, the mobile web server is further configured to utilize the provisioning module  to provision a database (not shown) for enabled services and service location based on the information included in the request message. It should be appreciated that the mobile web server can provision for client identification, an application authentication key, enabled services, service location, and security level information, as well as any other desired information or data.","Based on the provisioning, the mobile web server then forwards the request message to the appropriate server or service provider. For instance, the request message can be sent to the appropriate Client #1 IVR-PG servers or the Client #1 ICM module . If the Client #1 ICM module  does not have agents available, the call of the mobile application is placed in a queue and a progress message is sent to the mobile web server. The mobile web server forwards or transmits the progress message to the mobile application .","If the agent is currently available, or once the agent becomes available, the Client #1 ICM module  sends an agent selected message to the mobile web server. The agent selected message can include the client identification, application authorization, and other optional data such as target contact center information and\/or dial-in number (i.e., 1-8YY Number). The mobile web server issues a push notification request message, and sends the push notification request message with the target contact center information to the push notification module (or push notification services) . The push notification module  forwards the push notification request message to the mobile push module (or mobile push services) , which forwards the push notification request message to the mobile application  with a message, such as \u201cthe agent is ready to take your call.\u201d The user of the mobile application  selects the view and\/or call button to open the mobile application  and the event is sent to the mobile web server. The mobile application  dials the 1-8YY number to begin the call and the call is connected to the target call center in order for the target call center to assist the user of the mobile application . In this case, the target call center can be the Client #1 contact center . When the call has ended with the ACD of the Client #1 contact center , the call is terminated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","210","220","230","240","250"]},"In this embodiment, a user (or customer) of a mobile device includes a mobile application, which has been enabled with a West mobile care service application (or a mobile care application). When a \u201cConnect Me to an Agent\u201d button is selected on the mobile application, the mobile application communicates with the mobile care service application. The mobile care service application is operably connected to one or more clients (or service providers), with each client including a contact center. See service layer  in . Because the mobile care service application can access each contact center, the mobile care service application can request an agent at one of the contact centers with the appropriate skills needed to effectively service the user. Once the mobile care service application identifies the agent with the skills needed to handle the request, the mobile application receives information instructing the mobile application to dial a specific phone number and, upon dialing the phone number, the mobile care service application is configured to connect the mobile application to the agent at the contact center.","It should be appreciated that, when the \u201cConnect Me to an Agent\u201d button is selected, caller data is collected and passed to the mobile care service application for authentication and provisioning. In particular, when the user selects the \u201cConnect Me to an Agent\u201d button, the caller data is sent to the targeted contact center so the agent can have the appropriate information when the call arrives at the contact center. This allows the agent to better understand what the customer was doing within the mobile application just before selecting the \u201cConnect Me to an Agent\u201d button.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","330","340","350","320"]},"The application layer  includes a server, which includes at least the mobile care application (or a mobile care service application).

Similar to , when the user of the mobile application selects the \u201cconnect me to an agent\u201d button, the mobile application communicates with the mobile care service application. This time, however, the mobile application prompts the user with, \u201cThis type of request usually has high wait times. Would you like us to notify you when you're next in the queue?\u201d If the user selects \u201cyes\u201d, this information is sent to the mobile care service application. The mobile care service application is operably connected to one or more clients (or service providers), with each client including a contact center. See service layer in . Because the mobile care service application can access each contact center, the mobile care service application can request an agent at one of the contact centers with the appropriate skills needed to effectively service the user. The mobile care service application determines whether the agent is available. If the agent is not available, the mobile care service application responds to the mobile application by notifying the mobile application that the request has been received, and the \u201cexpected wait time\u201d is \u201cX\u201d minutes. The mobile application then displays this information to the user like a timer and informs the user that the user can close this window and they will be notified when they are next to connect with the agent.","Once the mobile care service application identifies the agent with the skills needed to handle the user's request, the mobile care service application sends an application \u201cAlert\u201d or \u201cNotification\u201d with a message such as \u201cYour agent is ready to speak with you . . . click View to be connected.\u201d Once the user selects the view button, the mobile application then dials a specific phone number and connects the user to a contact center agent.","Similar to the embodiment described in , caller data can be collected by the mobile application and sent to the mobile care service application.
