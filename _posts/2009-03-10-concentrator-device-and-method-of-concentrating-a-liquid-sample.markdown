title: Concentrator device and method of concentrating a liquid sample
abstract: A concentrator device and method of concentrating a liquid sample may be provided. The concentrator device may include a pressure vessel and a filter element disposed within the pressure vessel. The pressure vessel may include an inlet configured to introduce pressurized air into a first portion of the pressure vessel and a first outlet fluidly coupled with a second portion of the pressure vessel. The first outlet may be adapted to be selectively opened and closed. A second outlet may be configured to receive a capillary tube inserted into the first portion of the pressure vessel. The filter element may be configured to receive a liquid sample to be concentrated. The filter element may substantially separate the first portion of the pressure vessel from the second portion of the pressure vessel and may define a retentate side adjacent to the first portion and a filtrate side adjacent to the second portion. When pressurized air is introduced through the inlet and the first outlet is open, a filtrate of the liquid sample received in the filter element may pass from the retentate side to the filtrate side such that a concentrated retentate of the liquid sample remains on the retentate side. When the first outlet is closed, the concentrated retentate of the liquid sample may be forced out through the capillary tube.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example 1","Example 2","Example 3"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","1. Field of Invention","The invention may relate to devices, systems, and\/or methods for concentrating a liquid sample and to the detection, identification, and monitoring of submicron-sized particles in the concentrated sample such as, for example, viruses, virus-like agents, prions, viral subunits, viral cores of dilapidated viruses, etc.","2. Related Art","Detection and identification of viruses pathogenic to humans in an environment without limiting the detection and identification to a particular family, genus and species can be difficult, particularly in combat conditions such as, for example, a potential biological warfare (BW) threat environment. Instruments are needed which enable detection of, for example, remote releases of biological agents in a field environment, thereby providing early warning capabilities and allowing calculations for troop movements and wind patterns.","In the detection and monitoring of viruses, false positives associated with background materials can be a major obstacle. Background materials may include biological or other debris which obscures the detection of the viruses by registering as a virus when a sample is analyzed. Analysis of viruses requires a high degree of purification of those viruses to overcome background loading in order to avoid false positives. For example, a BW virus may be buried within loadings of other microorganisms which form biological debris having loading on a magnitude of 10larger than the threshold loading for the targeted virus itself.","Methods that culture viruses can often be used to increase the virus over background material. Culture methods, however, may be too slow for effective viral BW detection. Furthermore, some important viruses cannot be easily cultured.","Viruses may also be extracted from an environment and concentrated to an extent that permits detection and monitoring of viruses, without culturing procedures. Generally, in the detection of small amounts of viruses in environmental or biological liquids, it is necessary to both enrich the concentration of viruses many orders of magnitude (i.e., greatly reduce the volume of liquid solubilizing the viruses) and accomplish removal of non-viral impurities. In the presence of non-viral impurities, even the most sensitive detection methods generally require virus concentrations on the order of 10 femtomoles\/microliter or more in the sampled liquid to reliably detect the viruses. In general, a standard method for the concentration of virus samples involves a tangential flow (cross-flow) filtration system to reduce the volume of the sample while removing impurities such as salts and small cellular debris. A more practical and effective device is needed, for example, for use with a capillary inlet of a gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) device.","In an embodiment of the invention, a liquid sample concentrator device may include a pressure vessel and a filter element disposed within the pressure vessel. The pressure vessel may include an inlet configured to introduce pressurized air into a first portion of the pressure vessel and a first outlet fluidly coupled with a second portion of the pressure vessel. The first outlet may be adapted to be selectively opened and closed. A second outlet may be configured to receive a capillary tube inserted into the first portion of the pressure vessel. The filter element may be configured to receive a liquid sample to be concentrated. The filter element may substantially separate the first portion of the pressure vessel from the second portion of the pressure vessel and may define a retentate side adjacent to the first portion and a filtrate side adjacent to the second portion. When pressurized air is introduced through the inlet and the first outlet is open, a filtrate of the liquid sample received in the filter element may pass from the retentate side to the filtrate side such that a concentrated retentate of the liquid sample remains on the retentate side. When the first outlet is closed, the concentrated retentate of the liquid sample may be forced out through the capillary tube.","In an embodiment of the invention, a method for concentrating a liquid sample may be provided. The method may include introducing a predetermined amount of a liquid sample to be concentrated into a filter element disposed within a pressure vessel. The method may include introducing pressurized air into a first portion of a pressure vessel on a retentate side of the filter element. The method may include opening a first outlet fluidly coupled with a second portion of the pressure vessel, whereby a filtrate of the liquid sample passes through the filter element to the second portion from the retentate side. The method may include closing the first outlet when a predetermined amount of the liquid sample remains on the retentate side of the filter or after a predetermined amount of time, whereby when the first outlet is closed, a concentrated retentate of the liquid sample is forced through an inlet end of a capillary tube positioned proximate the retentate side of the filter element.","This summary is provided merely to introduce certain concepts and not to identify any key or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Further features and advantages, as well as structure and operation of an embodiment of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","An embodiment(s) of the invention is discussed in detail below. While an embodiment is discussed, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected and it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations can be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention defined by the claims. Each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.","In the following description of an embodiment of the invention, directional words such as, for example, \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cleft,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d \u201cupwardly,\u201d and \u201cdownwardly,\u201d \u201cclockwise,\u201d \u201ccounter-clockwise,\u201d are employed by way of description and not limitation with respect to the orientation of the device and its various components as illustrated in the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","16","18","14","12","20","16","12","22","24","28","14","12","28","104"]},"A filter element  may be disposed within the pressure vessel  and may be configured to receive a liquid sample S to be concentrated. The filter element  may substantially separate the first and second portions ,  of the pressure vessel . The filter element  may define a retentate side adjacent to the first portion  and a filtrate side adjacent to the second portion . An electrically conductive wire  such as, for example, a platinum wire, may be coupled to a voltage source of the electrospray unit of the GEMMA device (not shown) and may extend through the first portion  into the retentate side of the filter element  in order to establish a current return for the electrospray operation.","The liquid sample S may have an initial volume of, for example, approximately 500 \u03bcl when received in the filter element  within the pressure vessel . When pressurized air is introduced through the inlet  and the valve mechanism  at the first outlet  is open, a filtrate of the liquid sample S may pass from the retentate side to the filtrate side of the filter element  such that a concentrated retentate of the liquid sample S remains on the retentate side. The pressurized air may be, for example but not limited to, clean, regulated air supplied under approximately 3-4 psi, although other pressures may be sufficient depending upon the properties of the various components employed in the device, particularly the filter element . Once the concentrated retentate remaining on the retentate side of the filter element  reaches a predetermined volume such as, for example, approximately 80-100 \u03bcl, or alternatively, after a predetermined amount of time, the valve mechanism  of the first outlet  may be closed (e.g., manually by a user or automatically by a control device (not shown)). When the valve mechanism  of the first outlet  is closed, the remaining concentrated retentate of the liquid sample S may be forced out through the capillary tube  on to the electrospray unit of the GEMMA device (not shown).","In this way, the concentrator device  may utilize an existing overpressure at the capillary inlet of the electrospray unit to filter and concentrate a virus sample and thereby allow analysis with the GEMMA device without removal of the concentrated sample from an Integrated Virus Detection System (IVDS).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","104","102","104","106","100","108","102"]},"The hollow outer housing  may be, for example, a substantially cylindrical container, although other configurations and shapes are envisioned. The housing may have an open end and an inner surface  defining an interior volume. The housing  may include an inlet , a first outlet , and a second outlet . A valve mechanism ,  may be coupled to the first outlet  and may be any suitable pressure release device including, for example, a thumb valve or the like. The valve mechanism may include an outlet  and a flow-control element  which may be adjustable between open and closed positions and may be manually operable or automatically controllable with a control device (not shown). The second outlet  may be configured to receive a threaded fitting  for receipt of a capillary tube from an electrospray unit of a GEMMA device (not shown in ). An electrically conductive wire  may extend from the fitting  into the interior volume of the housing .","The inner member  may include a base portion and an upper portion  configured to be received through the open end of the hollow outer housing . Like the housing , the inner member  may be substantially cylindrical, although other configurations and shapes are envisioned. The upper portion  of the inner member  may include an outer surface  and may define an interior cavity  constructed to receive the filter element  when the concentrator device  is assembled. A passageway  between the interior cavity and the outer surface  may be provided. The upper portion  of the inner member  may also include one or more seal elements ,  such as, for example, polymeric or rubber O-rings, disposed about the outer surface  at positions both above and below the passageway . When the concentrator device  is assembled and the inner member  is received in the housing , the interior cavity , passageway , may be fluidly coupled with the first outlet  by way of an annular volume defined (radially) between the outer surface  and inner surface  as well as (longitudinally) between seal elements , .","When assembled (see ), the inner member  and the hollow outer housing  may be removeably coupled to one another by at least one of a friction fit, a snap fit, a bayonet connection, a fastener connection, a latch connection, and\/or a threaded connection. In the embodiment depicted in , a bayonet connection is shown wherein one or more pegs  may be disposed on the inner surface  of the housing  for receipt in one or more angled slots  defined on the outer surface  of the upper portion .","The filter element  may be a centrifugal ultrafiltration wedge filter such as, for example but not limited to, a Ultrafree\u00ae-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit, available from Millipore Corp. of Billerica, Mass., USA, having a predetermined molecular weight cut-off value (MWCO) of, for example but not limited to, 100K Da.
