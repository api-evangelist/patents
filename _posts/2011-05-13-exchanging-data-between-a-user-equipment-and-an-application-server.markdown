title: Exchanging data between a user equipment and an application server
abstract: A user equipment (UE) and an application server exchange data in a wireless communications network. The UE is configured to connect to both a wireless local area network (WLAN) and a wireless wide area network (WWAN). The application server is positioned within the WWAN behind a WWAN firewall. The WLAN includes a WLAN network address translation (NAT) component and firewall such that the UE and the application server do not have a persistent data connection over the WLAN. In an embodiment, the application server can open a WWAN firewall to permit uploads from the UE over the WLAN. In another embodiment, the UE can open the WLAN firewall and/or NAT to permit downloads from the application server over the WLAN. In another embodiment, the application server or UE can upload files to a server outside the WLAN and WWAN firewalls and send a link to the uploaded files for retrieval.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments relate to exchanging data between a user equipment (UE) and an application server.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In W-CDMA wireless communication systems, user equipments (UEs) receive signals from fixed position Node Bs (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Node Bs provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the Node Bs generally interacts with UEs through an over the air interface and with the RAN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as W-CDMA, CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (e.g., UEs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","A user equipment (UE) and an application server exchange data in a wireless communications network. The UE is configured to connect to both a wireless local area network (WLAN) and a wireless wide area network (WWAN). The application server is positioned within the WWAN behind a WWAN firewall. The WLAN includes a WLAN network address translation (NAT) component and firewall such that the UE and the application server do not have a persistent data connection over the WLAN. In an embodiment, the application server can open a WWAN firewall to permit uploads from the UE over the WLAN. In another embodiment, the UE can open the WLAN firewall and\/or NAT to permit downloads from the application server over the WLAN. In another embodiment, the application server or UE can upload files to a server outside the WLAN and WWAN firewalls and send a link to the uploaded files for retrieval","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of non-transitory computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as user equipment (UE), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more access points (APs), which may be referred to as Node Bs. A UE transmits and receives data packets through one or more of the Node Bs to a Radio Network Controller (RNC). The Node Bs and RNC are parts of a network called a radio access network (RAN). A radio access network can transport voice and data packets between multiple UEs.","The radio access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio access network, such core network including specific carrier related servers and devices and connectivity to other networks such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, public switched telephone network (PSTN), a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN), a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), and may transport voice and data packets between each UE and such networks. A UE that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more Node Bs may be referred to as an active UE, and can be referred to as being in a traffic state. A UE that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel (TCH) connection with one or more Node Bs can be referred to as being in a connection setup state. A UE may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel. A UE may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash device, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the UE sends signals to the Node B(s) is called an uplink channel (e.g., a reverse traffic channel, a control channel, an access channel, etc.). The communication link through which Node B(s) send signals to a UE is called a downlink channel (e.g., a paging channel, a control channel, a broadcast channel, a forward traffic channel, etc.). As used herein the term traffic channel (TCH) can refer to either an uplink\/reverse or downlink\/forward traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless communications system  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote UEs, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, core network , the Internet, PSTN, SGSN, GGSN and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a RNC . The RNC  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and the UEs \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the RNC  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the RNC  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The core network  may communicate with the RNC  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the RNC  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the core network  and the RNC  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The RNC  can be connected to multiple Node Bs . In a similar manner to the core network , the RNC  is typically connected to the Node Bs  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The Node Bs  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the UEs, such as cellular telephone . The Node Bs , RNC  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the RNC  and one or more of the Node Bs  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the RNC  and the Node B(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["126","126","160","165","175","175"]},"Generally, GPRS is a protocol used by Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) phones for transmitting Internet Protocol (IP) packets. The GPRS Core Network (e.g., the GGSN  and one or more SGSNs ) is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W-CDMA based 3G networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network, provides mobility management, session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W-CDMA networks.","The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users (e.g., access terminals) of a GSM or W-CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the internet as if from one location at the GGSN . This is achieved transferring the subscriber's data from the subscriber's current SGSN  to the GGSN , which is handling the subscriber's session.","Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network; namely, (i) GTP-U, (ii) GTP-C and (iii) GTP\u2032 (GTP Prime). GTP-U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol (PDP) context. GTP-C is used for control signaling (e.g., setup and deletion of PDP contexts, verification of GSN reachability, updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another, etc.). GTP\u2032 is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.","Referring to , the GGSN  acts as an interface between the GPRS backbone network (not shown) and the external packet data network . The GGSN  extracts the packet data with associated packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or PPP) from the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN , and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN  to the SGSN  which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer (RAB) of the destination UE served by the RAN . Thereby, the GGSN  stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and his\/her profile in its location register (e.g., within a PDP context). The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected UE. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.","The SGSN  is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network , in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN  includes packet routing and transfer, mobility management (e.g., attach\/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, PDP address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN , for example, within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus, SGSNs are responsible for (i) de-tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN , (ii) uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN , (iii) carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and (iv) billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, aside from (i)-(iv), SGSNs configured for GSM\/EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W-CDMA networks.","The RAN  (e.g., or UTRAN, in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) system architecture) communicates with the SGSN  via a Iu interface, with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN  communicates with the GGSN  via a Gn interface, which is an IP-based interface between SGSN  and other SGSNs (not shown) and internal GGSNs, and uses the GTP protocol defined above (e.g., GTP-U, GTP-C, GTP\u2032, etc.). While not shown in , the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System (DNS). The GGSN  is connected to a Public Data Network (PDN) (not shown), and in turn to the Internet , via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway.","The PDP context is a data structure present on both the SGSN  and the GGSN  which contains a particular UE's communication session information when the UE has an active GPRS session. When a UE wishes to initiate a GPRS communication session, the UE must first attach to the SGSN  and then activate a PDP context with the GGSN . This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN  that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN  serving the UE's access point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","1","120","1","3","120","162","162","188","175","182","184","186","170","2","5","120","164","162","164","188","175","182","184","186","170","4","175","175"]},"Referring to , UEs ,  and  . . . N are illustrated as wireless cell-phones, UE  is illustrated as a wireless tablet-PC and UE  is illustrated as a wired desktop station. However, in other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system  can connect to any type of UE, and the examples illustrated in  are not intended to limit the types of UEs that may be implemented within the system. Also, while the AAA , the provisioning server , the IMS\/SIP registration server  and the application server  are each illustrated as structurally separate servers, one or more of these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.","Further, referring to , the application server  is illustrated as including a plurality of media control complexes (MCCs)  . . . N B, and a plurality of regional dispatchers  . . . N A. Collectively, the regional dispatchers A and MCCs B are included within the application server , which in at least one embodiment can correspond to a distributed network of servers that collectively functions to arbitrate communication sessions (e.g., half-duplex group communication sessions via IP unicasting and\/or IP multicasting protocols) within the wireless communication system . For example, because the communication sessions arbitrated by the application server  can theoretically take place between UEs located anywhere within the system , multiple regional dispatchers A and MCCs are distributed to reduce latency for the arbitrated communication sessions (e.g., so that a MCC in North America is not relaying media back-and-forth between session participants located in China). Thus, when reference is made to the application server , it will be appreciated that the associated functionality can be enforced by one or more of the regional dispatchers A and\/or one or more of the MCCs B. The regional dispatchers A are generally responsible for any functionality related to establishing a communication session (e.g., handling signaling messages between the UEs, scheduling and\/or sending announce messages, etc.), whereas the MCCs B are responsible for hosting the communication session for the duration of the call instance, including conducting an in-call signaling and an actual exchange of media during an arbitrated communication session.","Referring to , a UE , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the core network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u2019)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include a UE including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the UE  in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the UE  or  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), W-CDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. For example, in W-CDMA, the data communication is typically between the client device , Node B(s) , and the RNC . The RNC  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the core network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, a SGSN, a GGSN and the like, thus allowing the UE  or  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","Below, embodiments of the invention are generally described in accordance with W-CDMA protocols and associated terminology (e.g., such as UE instead of mobile station (MS), mobile unit (MU), access terminal (AT), etc., RNC, contrasted with BSC in EV-DO, or Node B, contrasted with BS or MPT\/BS in EV-DO, etc.). However, it will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art how the embodiments of the invention can be applied in conjunction with wireless communication protocols other than W-CDMA.","In a conventional server-arbitrated communication session (e.g., via half-duplex protocols, full-duplex protocols, VoIP, a group session over IP unicast, a group session over IP multicast, a push-to-talk (PTT) session, a push-to-transfer (PTX) session, etc.), a session or call originator sends a request to initiate a communication session to the application server , which then forwards a call announcement message to the RAN  for transmission to one or more targets of the call.","User Equipments (UEs), in a Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) (e.g., the RAN ) may be in either an idle mode or a radio resource control (RRC) connected mode.","Based on UE mobility and activity while in a RRC connected mode, the RAN  may direct UEs to transition between a number of RRC sub-states; namely, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, CELL_FACH, and CELL_DCH states, which may be characterized as follows:\n\n","Accordingly, URA_PCH State (or CELL_PCH State) corresponds to a dormant state where the UE periodically wakes up to check a paging indicator channel (PICH) and, if needed, the associated downlink paging channel (PCH), and it may enter CELL_FACH state to send a Cell Update message for the following event: cell reselection, periodical cell update, uplink data transmission, paging response, re-entered service area. In CELL_FACH State, the UE may send messages on the random access channel (RACH), and may monitor a forward access channel (FACH). The FACH carries downlink communication from the RAN , and is mapped to a secondary common control physical channel (S-CCPCH). From CELL_FACH State, the UE may enter CELL_DCH state after a traffic channel (TCH) has been obtained based on messaging in CELL_FACH state.

Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks, in this case the service provider network or WWAN , that are connected to the Internet . The WWAN firewall  is configured to permit or deny network transmissions based upon a set of rules and other criteria. All messages entering or leaving the WWAN  via the Internet  pass through the WWAN firewall , which inspects each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.","By punching through the WWAN firewall , the application server  can access the Internet . As shown in , the Internet  is connected to both WLAN  and to a file server , which is positioned outside of both the WWAN firewall  and a WLAN firewall  (discussed below in more detail). Through the Internet , the application server  of the WWAN  is theoretically connected to the WLAN , although it will be appreciated that the WLAN  has its own security (e.g., a NAT\/Firewall) that may block access.","Turning to the WLAN , the WLAN  includes the WLAN AP  (e.g., a WiFi router or hotspot, etc.) that was mentioned above, and further includes a Network Address Translation (NAT) component  and a WLAN firewall , which may alternatively be referred to as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) firewall. While the NAT  and WLAN firewall  are illustrated as separate entities or components in , it will be appreciated that their respective functions can be consolidated into a single server or switch in other embodiments of the invention (e.g., such as routing unit  of , for example).","Referring to , NAT  and WLAN firewall  separate the WLAN  from the Internet  and\/or other core networks or WLANs. For example, the NAT  can be configured to modify network address information in datagram (IP) packet headers such that outgoing Internet Protocol (IP) packets from the WLAN  appear to originate from the NAT  instead of the originator of the IP-packet (e.g., UE ), and incoming IP packets appear to terminate at the NAT . The NAT  can be implemented in accordance with any of a variety of schemes of translating addresses and\/or port numbers, with each type of NAT-scheme affecting application communication protocols differently. For example, NAT-types include full-cone NAT (also known as one-to-one NAT), address-restricted cone NAT, port-restricted cone NAT and symmetric NAT.","With respect to the WLAN firewall , the WLAN firewall  can be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks, such as intranets, that are connected to the Internet . The WLAN firewall  is configured to permit or deny network transmissions based upon a set of rules and other criteria. All messages entering or leaving the WLAN  pass through the WLAN firewall , which inspects each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria. Further, the WLAN firewall  provides private addresses as defined in RFC 1918 to the hosts protected behind the WLAN firewall . Once a pass through connection is opened through the WLAN firewall , NAT translation association for the data session is often released by the NAT  within a few seconds of data inactivity for the session. Thus, the NAT  and WLAN Firewall  are used to collectively refer to the hardware and\/or software that performs the firewall and NAT functions for a particular intranet, in this case the WLAN .","UEs can typically obtain higher bandwidth via the WLAN  (e.g., WiFi hotspots, etc.) as compared to the WWAN  (e.g., a cellular communications system, etc.). Accordingly, precious WWAN bandwidth may be consumed if the WWAN is used for large file transfers (uploads or downloads) when the WLAN could be used instead, or when the UE could have waited for a WLAN connection before initiating the large file transfer. However, it can be difficult to send data from UE  to the application server  within the WWAN  over the WLAN  due to the security settings of the NAT , WLAN firewall  and the WWAN firewall . Embodiments of the invention are thereby directed to exchanging data between a UE and the WWAN-based application server  using a high-bandwidth WLAN connection even when a direct connection between be WLAN  and the WWAN  is difficult to establish due to the security settings of the NAT , WLAN firewall  and\/or WWAN firewall .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","170"]},"Referring to , assume that UE  establishes a connection with the RAN  and registers for a given communication service (e.g., PTT, etc.) with the application server  within the WWAN , and that the UE  is engaged in a communication session for the given communication service via the established WWAN connection in . For example, the data exchanged between UE  and the application server  in  corresponds to low-bandwidth data, such as low-bandwidth streaming sessions (e.g., voice data) and\/or file-transfers of files below a given size threshold used for WWAN-based file transfers. Next, while UE  continues the WWAN-based communication session in , UE  determines whether to transmit a file to the application server  over the WLAN , . If UE  determines that the file need not be transmitted over the WLAN , the process returns to  and UE  transmits the file within the established WWAN-based communication session. Otherwise, if UE  determines to transmit the file over the WLAN , UE  establishes a connection to the WLAN AP  of the WLAN  and obtains a private IP address, . In an example, UE  may already be connected to the WLAN  when the determination of  is made, in which case the WLAN-connection operation of  can be skipped.","The remainder of  operates under the assumption that UE  is aware or at least believes there is a high likelihood that NAT , WLAN firewall  and WWAN firewall  will function as obstructions to a direct attempt to send the file to the application server  via the WLAN . Accordingly, the NAT\/firewall bypass procedures discussed below are based upon this assumption.","Referring to , after UE  connects to the WLAN  via the WLAN AP  in , UE  requests its public IP address from the file server  using a protocol such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN). STUN is defined in RFC 5389 and provides a means for an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated by a NAT that corresponds to its private IP address and port. STUN, along with some extensions, may also be used to keep a NAT binding alive or the like, and to perform connectivity checks between two endpoints. The UE  uses a binary signaling protocol to implement a protocol (e.g., STUN) in order to request its public IP address, , and also to maintain its IP address and port association. The file server  then sends the public IP address to UE , . As will be appreciated, the public IP address corresponds to the IP address used by entities external to the WLAN  to send data to\/from the WLAN , whereas the private IP address is the IP address used for entities within the WLAN  itself. In addition to obtaining the public IP address for the WLAN , UE  monitors the behavior of the NAT  in order to determine additional WLAN connection information, . For example, in , UE  can exchange IP data packets with the file server  while changing the source port and\/or destination port of the IP data packets. In this manner, UE  can determine the relationship between the internal or private IP address and port number of UE  within the WLAN  with the public IP address and port number for the WLAN . For example, the UE  can send two or more follow-up queries to the file server  to determine its public IP and port for that specific private IP to test the NAT behavior. In each of the queries, the UE  can change the source port in the UDP header. The UE can compare its request and the responses received from the file server  to determine a relation used by the NAT to map the 4 tuple (e.g., private IP address of UE , UE 's port number, the file server 's IP address and the file server 's port number) to the UE 's public IP address and port numbers as assigned by the NAT. For example, the UE 's determination at  can correspond to figuring out that the NAT  is merely adding a fixed number (e.g., 10000, etc.) to the ports selected as long as the port numbers are within the allowable limits, based on the messages exchanged as noted above.","After UE  determines the public IP address ( and ) as well as the NAT behavior related to the correspondence between UE 's private IP address and port number to the public IP address and port number (), UE  uses this information to punch holes through the NAT  and WLAN firewall  of the WLAN  in an attempt to send the file to the application server , . In , assume that UE  is successful in exporting the file outside of the WLAN  and to the Internet , but that the WWAN firewall  blocks the file transfer. Accordingly, UE  determines that the attempt to transmit the file over the WLAN  to the application server  has failed due to the WWAN firewall , .","Accordingly, UE  transmits its WLAN connection information to the application server  over its WWAN connection, . For example, the WLAN connection information sent to the application server  in  can include the WLAN'S speed or bandwidth, the WLAN'S latency, the WLAN's packet drop rate, and\/or other performance information associated with the WLAN connection to WLAN .","The application server  receives the WLAN connection information and then punches holes through its own WWAN firewall  within the WWAN  so as to send an ACK to UE 's message from , . Because the ACK is generated within the firewalled WWAN , the ACK passes through the WWAN firewall  and is then sent to UE  over the WLAN , . Also in , along with punching the holes in the WWAN firewall , the application server  opens the WWAN firewall  to permit bi-directional traffic to pass-through the WWAN firewall  between UE  and the application server  until expiration of a given WWAN firewall timer. Thus, after opening the WWAN firewall  to permit bi-directional traffic between UE  and the application server , the ACK sent back to UE  functions to notify UE  that another attempt to transmit data through the WWAN firewall  to the applicant server  will be successful.","Accordingly, UE  makes another attempt to send the file to the application server  via the WLAN  in . The attempt of  is successful because both the WLAN firewall  and WWAN firewall  are now open to traffic being exchanged between UE  and the application server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 4","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["170","200","200","170","170","200"]},"Accordingly, referring to , similar to  of , assume that UE  establishes a connection with the RAN  and registers for a given communication service (e.g., PTT, etc.) with the application server  within the WWAN , and that the UE  is engaged in a communication session for the given communication service via the established WWAN connection, B. Next, while UE  continues the WWAN-based communication session in B, the application server  determines whether to transmit a file to UE  over the WLAN , B. If the application server  determines that the file need not be transmitted over the WLAN  (e.g., if the file-size is not above a threshold), the process returns to B and the application server  transmits the file within the established WWAN-based communication session. Otherwise, if the application server  determines to transmit the file over the WLAN , the application server  notifies UE , over the WWAN, of the application server 's intent to transmit a relatively large file to the UE , B.","Referring to , UE  receives the notification from the application server  and determines whether to attempt to download the file from the application server  over the WLAN , B. If UE  determines not to attempt to download the file over the WLAN  in B, the process returns to B where the file is either downloaded over the WWAN  or is simply not downloaded at all.

For example, the data exchanged between UE  and the application server  in  corresponds to low-bandwidth data, such as low-bandwidth streaming sessions (e.g., voice data) and\/or file-transfers of files below a first size threshold used for WWAN-based file transfers.

In an embodiment of the invention, after determining that the attempt to transmit the file to the application server  over the WLAN  has failed due in part to the WWAN firewall  in A, UE  assumes that subsequent attempts to upload the file in the same manner will also result in failure. Accordingly, instead of repetitively attempting upload-attempts that result in failure, UE  determines whether the file to be transmitted to the application server  is above a second size threshold, A. For example, the second size threshold can be set to a higher level than the first size threshold, such that the first size threshold functions to facilitate a determination regarding whether to attempt a WLAN-based file transfer (if possible) at A, and the second size threshold functions to facilitate a determination regarding whether to transmit the file to the application server  in the event that the initial attempt to transmit the file to the application server  over the WLAN  results in failure.","In the embodiment of , assume that the file to be transmitted to the application server  is not above the second size threshold.
