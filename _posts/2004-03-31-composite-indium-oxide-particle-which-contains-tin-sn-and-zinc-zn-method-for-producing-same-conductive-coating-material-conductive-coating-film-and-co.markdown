Further, sheets having the tin-containing indium oxide particles dispersed and applied thereon are used for not only displays but also a wide variety of other applications such as touch panels, because of their translucency and conductivity.","However, the properties of coating films comprising the tin-containing indium oxide particles are inferior to tin-containing indium oxide films formed by a vapor deposition process or a sputtering process, and thus, the application of such coating films has been limited, because the advantage that the coating films can be formed by a relatively simple and inexpensive method, i.e., coating, has not been fully utilized. The tin-containing indium oxide particles have another problem in the higher cost of raw materials since indium as a main raw material is expensive.","On the other hand, zinc oxide particles, titanium oxide particles, cerium oxide particles, iron oxide particles, etc. are known as materials for UV-shielding or highly refractive coating compositions. Among these materials, zinc oxide particles show superior shielding properties to UV rays within the region of UV-A, and particularly show high transparency to visible light. Therefore, the zinc oxide particles are used as UV-shielding cosmetic materials and are further used as highly refractive materials because of their high refractive index (2.1).","When these transparent particles such as tin-containing indium oxide particles and zinc oxide particles are dispersed in a binder for application, it is needed that the particle size thereof should be generally at most a half of the wavelength of visible light in order to obtain high transparency to visible light. Accordingly, in order to be transparent to, for example, visible light, these particles should have a particle size of as small as 200 nm or less.","One of typical methods for manufacturing such fine particles is disclosed in JP-A-62-7627. According to this method, an aqueous alkaline solution such as an aqueous ammonia, an aqueous ammonium carbonate solution or the like is added to an aqueous solution of a mixture of indium chloride and tin chloride to form a co-precipitated hydroxide; the co-precipitated hydroxide is then treated by heating to form tin-containing indium oxide; the tin-containing indium oxide is mechanically ground to obtain fine particles thereof. In the method of JP-A-62-7627, tin-containing indium oxide particles having an average particle size of 0.1 \u03bcm are obtained by the heat treatment and the mechanical grinding.","According to JP-A-5-201731, the co-precipitated hydroxide of indium and tin is obtained in the same manner as in JP-A-62-7627, and then is baked and ground to obtain tin-containing indium oxide particles, while it is important in this method that the contents of sodium and potassium should not be larger than a specified amount in order that the resultant particles can have high conductivity. In the method of JP-A-5-201731, tin-containing indium oxide particles having a particle size of 0.01 to 0.03 \u03bcm are obtained after the grinding.","On the other hand, it is known that zinc oxide fine particles themselves have strong coagulating power and thus are hard to disperse. In order to improve the dispersibility of zinc oxide fine particles, a very small amount of an oxide or an hydroxide of silicon or aluminum is contained into the respective zinc oxide particles (see JP-A-201382). Thereby, zinc oxide particles having a particle size of not larger than 0.03 \u03bcm and having sufficient dispersibility are obtained.","For example, these transparent conductive particles and UV-shielding and highly refractive particles are used for anti-reflection films having excellent antistatic effect. While a conventional anti-reflection film of this type is obtained by laminating a plurality of layers having individual functions, recently, an anti-reflection film having a plurality of functions in a single layer structure is desired in association with the development of a variety of thin-shaped appliances. For example, JP-A-2002-16757 discloses such a single-layer film. In this publication, a highly refractive and conductive material is obtained by dispersing, in a binder, conductive fine particles which comprise indium oxide and tin oxide as main components and highly refractive particles which comprise titanium oxide and zinc oxide. In this method, it is necessary that the sizes of the particles should not be larger than 0.2 \u03bcm, and the thickness of a coating film should not be larger than 20 \u03bcm in order to maintain the transparency of the film and the dispersibility of the particles. In Example 1 of this publication, a coating composition is prepared by mixing and dispersing tin-containing indium oxide particles and cerium oxide particles, and a coating film having a refractive index of 1.68 and a surface resistance of 2.5\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 is formed by applying this coating composition.","In the above mixture dispersion system of conductive particles and non-conductive particles, the non-conductive particles are held between the conductive particles by mixing and dispersing the non-conductive particles and the conductive particles, so that the contacts between each of the conductive particles are decreased. As a result, the electric conductivity of the resultant coating film tends to lower. This is one of the essential features of the mixture dispersion systems of this type. As for the antistatic effect alone, a coating film having a surface resistivity of about 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 has sufficient conductivity, in other words, an antistatic function, and is expected to have further functions such as an electromagnetic wave-shielding property, or conductivity so high as to be applicable to a touch panel or the like. However, to obtain such excellent conductivity, it is needed to increase the content of conductive particles of tin-containing indium oxide or the like as much as possible. However, disadvantageously, an increase of the content of the conductive particles leads to a decrease of the content of non-conductive particles such as zinc oxide or the like. As a result, the UV-shielding effect, i.e., one of the features of the zinc oxide is hardly exhibited. In this way, there is a relationship of trade-off between the conductivity and the UV-shielding function.","In these years, there is an increased demand for antistatic coating compositions comprising white conductive particles, for use in white garment and the interior decoration of clean rooms required to have cleanliness, or bright and vivid color coating compositions or plastic products. Examples of the white conductive particles for use in these applications are white inorganic pigment particles each of which comprises a core of potashmica coated with tin-containing indium oxide (JP-A-60-253112), white conductive particles each of which comprises a white inorganic pigment particle of zinc oxide, titanium oxide or the like, coated with tin dioxide and further coated with tin-containing indium oxide (JP-A-06-338213), etc. Some of these white conductive particles are manufactured by coating the outer surfaces of UV-shielding white pigment particles of titanium oxide or zinc oxide as cores with conductive tin oxide, tin-containing indium oxide or the like. Theses particles are manufactured for the purpose of obtaining white colors but are not used as UV-shielding agents. Further, because of the influence of the white inorganic pigment particles as base substances, it is difficult to sufficiently lower the volume resistivity of the particles to a level necessary for use in conductive coating composition or the like.","To form a coating film containing the above-described metal oxide particles, usually, the particles of this kind are dispersed in a solvent containing an inorganic or organic binder dissolved therein, and the resultant coating composition is applied on a variety of substrates. In order for the resultant coating film to have transparency, the particles to be used should be very fine, and simultaneously should be uniformly dispersed in the coating film. However, such fine particles tend to form secondary coagulations in the coating composition, which makes it difficult to obtain an uniform dispersion. Such coagulations in the coating composition not only lower the conductivity of the resultant coating film but also degrade the transparency thereof.","Under the above-discussed circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide composite indium oxide particles having excellent dispersibility, as novel fine particles having transparency, conductivity and UV-shielding properties, for use in coating films, and further as fine particles for use in coating type transparent and conductive films which can be manufactured at lower cost by decreasing the amount of indium, and another object of the invention is to provide methods for manufacturing the same. A further object of the present invention is to provide a conductive sheet or the like having excellent transparency, conductivity and UV-shielding properties, by using the same composite indium oxide particles.","As a result of the present inventors' extensive researches for achieving the above objects, they have found the following: composite indium oxide particles having an average particle size of 5 to 100 nm, which substantially consist of zinc oxide and tin-containing indium oxide and which is manufactured by coating the zinc oxide as a core with the tin-containing indium oxide, have transparency and conductivity derived from the tin-containing indium oxide particles, and UV-shielding properties derived from the zinc oxide, and further excellent dispersibility, in spite of the fact that the amount of indium used is smaller than that used in any of the conventional tin-containing indium oxide particles; namely, fine particle materials suitable for use in coating films or coating type transparent conductive films can be obtained. The use of the particles having an average particle size of less than 5 nm is undesirable, because such particles are hard to disperse in the preparation of a coating composition by using the same, and because the manufacturing of such particles is difficult. The use of the particles having an average particle size exceeding 100 nm is also undesirable, because the resultant coating film is hard to ensure transparency to visible light.","Preferably, the composite indium oxide particles of the present invention are composite particles of zinc oxide and tin-containing indium oxide in which the zinc oxide and the tin-containing indium oxide keep their own crystalline structures, respectively. Preferably, compressed powder of such composite particles shows a volume resistivity of 10to 10 \u03a9cm under a pressure of 14.7 MPa (150 kgf\/cm).","The present inventors further have found that the conductivity of the composite indium oxide particles can be further improved by a unique and specific method which the present inventors have developed by themselves, wherein a part of at least one metal of the constituent metals of the tin-containing indium oxide and the zinc oxide is substituted by a trivalent element such as aluminum, gallium, boron, thallium or the like, preferably aluminum or gallium, and such a trivalent element is contained in the composite particle to obtain a composite indium oxide particle of the chemical formula:\n\n[(ZnA)O][(ITO)A]\n\nwherein A represents a trivalent element such as Al, Ga or the like, and that this composite indium oxide particle is further improved in conductivity.\n","Furthermore, the present inventors have succeeded in manufacturing of composite indium oxide particles which have an average particle size of 5 to 100 nm as mentioned above, and which comprise zinc oxide and tin-containing indium oxide, by a novel manufacturing process which is quite different from any of the conventional processes.","The process of the present invention comprises the steps of preparing an aqueous alkaline solution by adding a zinc compound (or a zinc compound elementarily substituted by aluminum, gallium or the like) to an aqueous alkaline solution containing a tin salt dissolved therein, and, if the tin-containing indium oxide phase is elementarily substituted by aluminum, gallium or the like, adding an aluminum compound, a gallium compound or the like thereto; adding an aqueous solution of an indium salt to the above aqueous alkaline solution; adjusting the pH of the resultant suspension containing precipitates of a zinc compound coated with a hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium, to 4 to 12; treating the suspension by heating at a temperature of 110 to 300\u00b0 C. in the presence of water; filtering and drying the resultant particles; treating the resultant particles by heating at a temperature of 300 to 1,000\u00b0 C. in an air; and reducing the resultant particles at a temperature of 150 to 400\u00b0 C. under a reducing atmosphere. Thus, the above composite indium oxide particles which are composite particles of zinc oxide and tin-containing indium oxide are manufactured.","The composite indium oxide particles obtained by the process of the present invention have a significant feature in that they have UV-shielding properties in addition to transparency and conductivity. This is considered to be induced as follows: by coating zinc oxide with tin-containing indium oxide, electrons flow along the tin-containing indium oxide formed on the surfaces of the particles so that the excellent conductivity of the tin-containing indium oxide is exhibited, and light passes through a whole of the particles, so that the excellent UV-shielding property of the zinc oxide is exhibited. As a result, it becomes possible for one kind of the particle to concurrently exhibit transparency, conductivity and UV-shielding property.","Furthermore, the composite particles of the present invention can be manufactured at lower cost, because indium is used in a smaller amount. The conventional tin-containing indium oxide particles as transparent conductive materials are expensive, and thus have not been widely used, whereas the composite particles of the present invention can be manufactured at lower cost since the amount of indium can be decreased by 20 to 80%, while the conductivity thereof is being kept equal to or higher than that of the conventional tin-containing indium oxide particles.","According to the present invention, by compounding zinc oxide and tin-containing indium oxide (more preferably by coating zinc oxide with tin-containing indium oxide), fine particles having transparency and conductivity derived from the tin-containing indium oxide and also UV-shielding properties and transparency derived from the zinc oxide can be provided. In this case, by substituting any of the metal elements of the zinc oxide and the tin-containing indium oxide with aluminum, gallium or other element, the composite particles can have improved conductivity while maintaining the transparency and the UV-shielding properties. This feature can not be obtained from the conventional particles as a mixture of transparent conductive particles and UV-shielding particles, and this feature can be firstly realized by the composite particles of the present invention. The composite indium oxide particles obtained in the present invention are most suitable as conductive particles for use in transparent conductive coating films capable of exhibiting UV-shielding effect. In this sense, the industrially applicable values of the present invention are very significant.","As described above, the composite indium oxide particles of the present invention can be obtained by compounding zinc oxide and tin-containing indium oxide (more preferably compounding by coating zinc oxide with tin-containing indium oxide). Thereby, the amount of indium used can be remarkably decreased, and the cost can be decreased by the decreased amount of indium. In addition, the composite indium oxide particles of the present invention have excellent UV-shielding properties which are the characteristics of zinc oxide, while maintaining excellent conductivity. Accordingly, coating compositions of the present invention comprising such composite particles, coating films of the present invention formed of the same coating compositions, and conductive sheets of the present invention obtained by forming the same coating films on the surfaces of transparent sheet-form substrates have excellent transparency, conductivity and UV-shielding properties.","According to the manufacturing process of the present invention, the above mentioned composite indium oxide particles having an average particle size of 5 to 100 nm can be obtained, wherein each composite particle comprises zinc oxide coated with tin-containing indium oxide. Such composite indium oxide particles are novel functional particles which have been firstly developed in the present invention.","The manufacturing process of the present invention is carried out as follows: in the first step, a zinc compound, or a zinc compound substituted by an element such as aluminum, gallium or the like is added and mixed into an aqueous alkaline solution containing a tin salt previously dissolved therein; and an aqueous solution of an indium salt is added to the aqueous solution of the tin salt which contains the zinc compound. When the tin-containing indium oxide phase in a composite indium oxide particle as a final product is substituted by an element such as aluminum, gallium or the like, an aluminum compound, a gallium compound or the like is further added and mixed to prepare an aqueous alkaline solution, to which an aqueous solution of an indium salt is added. In this step, a zinc compound coated with a hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium is obtained. Preferably, by adding an indium salt, the pH of a suspension containing precipitates of the zinc compound coated with the hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium is adjusted to 4 to 12.","Next, this zinc compound coated with the hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium is treated in an autoclave or the like by heating at a temperature of 110 to 300\u00b0 C. in the presence of water, to regulate the particles to a desired particle shape with a desired particle size.","In the second step, the zinc compound coated with the hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium is treated by heating in an air so as to be reduced with hydrogen gas. Thus, composite indium oxide particles which have a uniform particle size distribution and which are hardly sintered or coagulated are obtained.","The present inventors have firstly succeeded in the development of the composite indium oxide particles having an average particle size of 5 to 100 nm, based on an inspired conception that the step for regulating the shapes and particle sizes of the particles is carried out separately from the step for extracting the intrinsic physical properties of the materials as much as possible, in the course of manufacturing the composite indium oxide particles, i.e., the composite particles of zinc oxide and tin-containing indium oxide.","A coating film comprising the composite indium oxide particles of the present invention manufactured by the above steps exhibits excellent performance, i.e., concurrently have high transparency and conductivity, and UV-shielding properties, which have not been achieved by any of the conventional coating films.","Hereinafter, the process for manufacturing the composite indium oxide particles of the present invention will be described in more detail.","(Formation of Precipitates)","An indium salt such as indium chloride, indium nitrate, indium sulfate or the like is dissolved in water to prepare an aqueous solution containing indium ions. Among these indium salts, indium chloride is most preferable to obtain fine composite indium oxide particles.","Separately, an alkaline solution containing tin ions is mixed with a zinc compound or an elementarily substituted zinc compound to prepare a solution. In detail, an alkali such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, an aqueous ammonia solution or the like is dissolved in water, and then, a tin salt such as tin chloride, tin nitrate, tin sulfate or the like is dissolved in the resultant aqueous alkaline solution. Further, a zinc compound such as zinc hydroxide, zinc oxide or the like, or an elementarily substituted zinc compound such as zinc hydroxide, zinc oxide or the like substituted by a trivalent element such as aluminum, gallium or the like is mixed with the above solution to prepare an alkaline solution. Among the above tin salts, tin chloride is most preferable to obtain fine composite indium oxide particles.","In this step, this alkaline solution may be mixed with an aluminum compound such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum oxide or the like, or a gallium compound such as gallium hydroxide, gallium oxide or the like. By this mixing, a part of the tin atoms or indium atoms in the tin-containing indium oxide phase in the composite indium oxide particles as a final product are substituted by a trivalent element such as aluminum, gallium or the like, to further improve the conductivity of the particles.","To improve the conductivity and the UV-shielding effect of the composite indium oxide particles as the final product, the concentration of the zinc compound to be mixed is controlled so that the concentration of the zinc oxide in the composite indium oxide particles can be 5 to 70 mol %, preferably 10 to 50 mol %, and that the concentration of the tin in the tin-containing indium oxide phase can be preferably 3 to 30 mol %, more preferably 5 to 15 mol %.","To further improve the conductivity of the composite particles, the concentration of the trivalent element in the composite indium oxide particles is preferably not larger than 30 mol %, when the trivalent element such as aluminum, gallium or the like is contained in the zinc oxide phase by way of substitution. Specifically, the concentration of the trivalent element in the zinc oxide phase is 0 to 30 mol %, preferably 2 to 15 mol % based on the mole of the zinc oxide, and the concentration of the trivalent element in the tin-containing indium oxide phase is 0 to 10 mol %, preferably 2 to 5 mol % based on the mole of the tin-containing indium oxide. In this regard, the wording \u201c0 to X mol %\u201d seen in the description and the claims of the present specification means that the lower limit \u201c0 mol %\u201d is not included, and that the upper limit \u201cX mol %\u201d is included, unless otherwise specified.","This is described below. In the composite indium oxide particle represented by the formula: [(ZnA)O][(ITO)A], the respective concentrations are preferably controlled as follows: the concentration of the zinc oxide or the elementarily substituted zinc oxide (the concentration being represented by \u201c1\u2212x\u201d in the above formula) is 5 to 70 mol %; the total content of the element A which is a trivalent element such as aluminum, gallium or the like, and which is contained in the zinc oxide and the tin-containing indium oxide by way of the substitution is not larger than 30 mol %; the concentration of the element A in the zinc oxide (represented by \u201cy\u201d in the above formula) is 0 to 30 mol %; the concentration of the element A in the tin-containing indium oxide (represented by \u201cz\u201d in the above formula) is 0 to 10 mol %; and the concentration of tin in ITO is 3 to 30 mol %. In this case, the concentration of the zinc oxide, (1-x), smaller than the lower limit of the above range does not influence the conductivity but degrades the UV-shielding effect. This concentration larger than the upper limit of the above range does not influence the UV-shielding effect but markedly degrades the conductivity. When the total content of the trivalent element(s) to be added to improve the conductivity is larger than the above specified value, the conductivity of the composite particles, on the contrary, tends to lower, or the trivalent elements separate since they are not completely used for the substitution. As a result, for example, aluminum oxide is formed in the final product, so that particles of a mixture are provided. The concentration of tin in the tin-containing indium oxide smaller than the lower limit of the above range makes it impossible to obtain sufficient conductivity. On the contrary, the concentration of tin in the tin-containing indium oxide larger than the upper limit of the above range impairs the conductivity.","To contain the trivalent element in the composite particle, at least one oxide of the internal zinc oxide and the tin-containing indium oxide formed on the surface of the zinc oxide is substituted by this trivalent element to introduce the trivalent element into the above oxide. To more effectively improve the conductivity, the trivalent elements are contained in both the oxides by way of substitution. Preferably, aluminum is contained in the composite particle as the trivalent element.","Hydroxyalkylamine may be added to the above alkaline solution. Hydroxyalkylamine acts as a pH buffer within the alkaline region, and simultaneously acts as a crystal growth-controlling agent. Examples of hydroxyalkylamine for use in this case include monoethanolamine, triethanolamine, isobutanolamine, propanolamine and the like, among which monoethanolamine acting also as a crystal growth-inhibiting agent is most preferable to obtain fine particles.","Next, the above aqueous solution of indium salt is added dropwise to the above alkaline solution to form a zinc compound (precipitate) coated with a hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium. The pH of the suspension containing this precipitate is adjusted to 4 to 12, and the resulting suspension is preferably aged at a temperature of 10 to 50\u00b0 C. for 10 to 100 hours. The pH adjustment and the aging are effective to obtain composite indium oxide particles at a relatively low treating temperature in the subsequent hydrothermal treatment. When the aging time is shorter than 10 hours, the effect of aging is poor. On the other hand, when the aging time is longer than 100 hours, so serious influence is not given the suspension, but such long aging is meaningless since the effect of aging is saturated.","(Hydrothermal Treatment)","The suspension containing the zinc compound coated with the hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium is subjected to a hydrothermal treatment in an autoclave or the like. By washing the suspension containing the above precipitate with water in this hydrothermal treatment, products and residues other than the precipitate are removed. After that, the pH of the suspension may be again adjusted with NaOH or the like. The pH of the suspension in this adjustment is preferably within a range of 4 to 12. When the pH is lower than the lower limit, tin hydroxide is again dissolved in the hydrothermal treatment. When the pH is too high, the particle size distribution of the resultant particles becomes wider, or tin, zinc and indium and further aluminum are not compounded by the re-dissolution thereof, so that a compound may be formed.","The temperature for the hydrothermal treatment is preferably in the range of 110 to 300\u00b0 C. When this temperature is lower than the lower limit, sufficient crystal growth of the particles can not be expected. When the temperature is higher than the upper limit, a generated pressure becomes higher for which an expensive apparatus is needed to withstand such a high pressure, resulting in no advantage.","The time required for the hydrothermal treatment is preferably in the range of 1 to 4 hours. When this time is too short, the crystal growth of the particles becomes insufficient. The too long hydrothermal treatment is no use, resulting in higher manufacturing cost, although no particular problem arises therefor.","(Heat Treatment)","The zinc compound coated with the hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium obtained after the hydrothermal treatment is filtered and dried and then is subjected to a heat treatment. In this step, prior to the filtration, the zinc compound is preferably washed with water so as to adjust the pH of the compound to about 6 to about 9 within the neutral region. This is because the water-soluble Na ions, or the amine-containing substance, if hydroxyalkyl-amine is added, are removed by the washing with water. If the zinc compound retaining such Na ions or such an amine-containing substance is filtered and dried and then is subjected to a heat treatment, the conductivity of the resultant particles tend to lower, and therefore, it is desirable to remove the above Na ions, etc. as much as possible.","Alternatively, the zinc compound coated with the hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium may be further admixed with a silicon compound such as sodium silicate or the like to carry out a silica treatment. This silica treatment is effective for the composite indium oxide particles as the final product to be kept as fine particles. The composite indium oxide particles are finally coated at their surfaces with silica films by this treatment, and therefore, silica is effective to maintain the fine particles. However, the silica films tend to lower the conductivity of the composite indium oxide particles. Therefore, the amount of the silicon compound to be added is preferably 0.1 to 5 wt. % based on the weight of the composite indium oxide particles.","Next, the zinc compound coated with the hydroxide or hydrate of tin and indium, which has been filtered and dried, is subjected to a heat treatment to obtain composite indium oxide particles. This heat treatment is carried out under an atmosphere of an oxygen concentration of at least 10%. The heating in an air is preferable since it costs lowest. The temperature for the heat treatment is preferably in the range of 300 to 1,000\u00b0 C. When this temperature is lower than 300\u00b0 C., the tin of the tin-containing indium oxide for coating is hardly substituted, so that the resultant particle has a mixture-like structure of tin oxide, indium oxide and zinc oxide, or that the hydroxide is left as it is and is not transformed into an oxide. Under such a situation, the resultant particles are hard to obtain sufficient conductivity. When this temperature is too high, the particles are easily sintered, and such particles are not sufficiently dispersed in the preparation of a coating composition. Further, when such a coating composition is used to form a coating film, the transparency of the resultant coating film tends to degrade.","The composite indium oxide particles obtained after the heat treatment are reduced in an atmosphere of 150 to 400\u00b0 C. to obtain conductive composite indium oxide particles colored yellowish gray or blue-greenish white.","The composite indium oxide particles thus obtained have a particle size of 5 to 100 nm which is within a range particularly preferable for use in transparent conductive films. When the particle size is smaller than 5 nm, the coagulating force among the particles becomes extremely large so that the dispersion of such particles becomes hard. When the particle size is larger than 100 nm, the transparency of the resultant coating film obtained by applying a coating composition having such particles dispersed therein tends to degrade. For these reasons, the average particle size of the composite indium oxide particles is preferably 5 to 100 nm, more preferably 10 to 60 nm.","(Preparation of Coating Composition and Manufacturing of Sheet)","A conductive sheet according to the present invention is manufactured by applying, to a sheet-shaped substrate, a conductive coating composition which is prepared by adding the composite indium oxide particles obtained as above to a solution containing a binder and a solvent, and mixing and dispersing them in each other. Hereinafter, the manufacture of this conductive sheet is described in detail.","For example, a resin film or sheet is used as the substrate. The resin film or sheet may be manufactured by any of known methods. For example, a resin such as a saturated polyester resin, polycarbonate resin, polyacrylate resin, alicyclic polyolefin resin, polystyrene resin, polyvinyl chloride resin, polyvinyl acetate resin or the like is formed into a film or sheet by melt-molding such as extrusion molding, calender molding, compression molding, injection molding or the like; or otherwise, the resin is dissolved in a solvent, and the solution of the resin is cast to form a film or sheet. The thickness of the substrate is preferably about 10 \u03bcm to about 5 mm. In this regard, the substrate may contain additives such as an antioxidant, a flame retardant, a heat resisting agent, a UV absorbent, a lubricant, an antistatic agent, etc. To improve the adhesion of the film, the substrate may be provided at its surface with an adhesive layer (or a primer) or may be subjected to any of known surface treatments such as corona treatment, plasma treatment or the like.","A dispersing machine for dispersing the composite indium oxide particles and a binder to form a dispersion is not particularly limited, and a known dispersing machine such as a three-roll mill, a ball mill, a paint shaker, an ultrasonic dispersing machine or the like can be used.","The amount of the composite indium oxide particles in relation to the binder is preferably 50 to 99%, more preferably 70 to 92%, in terms of the weight content of the solids in the coating composition (that is, preferably 100 to 9,900 wt. parts, more preferably 230 to 1,150 wt. parts of the composite indium oxide particles per 100 wt. parts of the binder). When this weight content is lower than 50%, the probability of the mutual contact of the particles deteriorates, which makes it hard to form electrically conductive paths, so that the conductivity of the resultant film becomes lower, and the UV-shielding effect of the film tends lower, since the particles can not have a sufficient physical volume in the film. On the other hand, when the weight content exceeds 99%, the binding power of the binder to the particles becomes lower, so that some of the particles drop or that the resultant film cracks, which leads to a decrease in the adhesion between the coating film and the substrate. As a result, the conductivity of the coating film degrades. In the meantime, when other conductive substance (e.g., a metal such as Au or Ag, metal colloid, carbon nanotubes or the like) is added together with the composite indium oxide particles to the binder, to an extent that the optical properties of the film are not impaired, the weight content of all the conductive substances is also preferably within the above specified range.","As the binder (a polymer binder), all kinds of binders, including aqueous types and non-aqueous types, can be used, so long as the dispersion is not inhibited by any of such binders. Examples of the binder include acrylic resins, polyurethanes, polyvinyl chloride, epoxy resins, polyesters, polyvinyl acetates, polystyrene, cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol and polybutyral, and resins produced by copolymerizing these resins.

When it exceeds 15 \u03bcm, the transmittance of the coating film to visible light becomes poor, so that, undesirably, the coating film tends to have lower transparency or tends to crack.","The conductivity and visible light transmittance of the coating film can be improved by calendering the coating film. In this case, the calendering is carried out at a rate of 1 to 30 m\/min. and at a heat-treating temperature within a range of Tg\u00b150\u00b0 C.

The conditions for the measurement were as follows:","Density of particles: 2.7 g\/cm","Inner diameter of a container: 2 cm","Distance between probes: 3 mm","(Surface Resistivity of Coating Film)","The surface resistivities of the conductive coating films of the conductive sheets obtained in Examples and Comparative Examples were evaluated according to JIS K7194-1994. The surface resistivity was measured by the four-terminal method, using RORESTA PA system (MCP-PD41 model manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation).","(Transmittance of Coating Film)","To evaluate the wavelength dependency of the transmittance, the spectrum of the transmittance of the conductive film obtained in Example 5 within a wavelength range of 200 to 2,500 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer (\u201cUbest V-570 model\u201d manufactured by Jasco). This spectrum of transmittance is shown in .","Further, the spectral of the transmittance of the conductive films of the conductive sheets obtained in Examples and Comparative Examples were measured in the same manner as above within a wavelength range of 200 to 2,500 nm, and the values of the transmittance of the coating films at a wavelength of 350 nm were read from the spectrum of transmittance.","Table 2 shows the results of the above measurements. According to Table 2, the smaller the value of the volume resistivity, the higher conductivity the particles have, which indicates the excellence of the resultant coating film as a conductive film. Table 2 further shows that, the smaller the value of the UV transmittance (indicated by \u201ctransmittance at 350 nm\u201d in Table 2), the higher UV-shielding effect the coating film has. Therefore, a coating film smaller both in volume resistivity and UV transmittance has superior characteristics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"371pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Composite indium oxide particle"},{"entry":"[(ZnAlO)][(ITO)Al]"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Content of ZnO","Content of Zn","Content of Al","pH during",{},"Volume","Surface",{}]},{"entry":[{},"or AZO (1 \u2212 x)","in particle","in particle","hydrothermal","Particle","resistivity","resistivity","Transmittance"]},{"entry":[{},"(mol %)","(mol %)","(mol %)","treatment","size (nm)","(\u03a9cm)","(\u03a9\/\u25a1)","at 350 nm (%)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Ex. 1","50","50","0","10","20-30","9.9 \u00d7 10","1.3 \u00d7 10","0.05"]},{"entry":["Ex. 2","50","45","5","10","20-30","5.4 \u00d7 10","5.6 \u00d7 10","0.03"]},{"entry":["Ex. 3","20","18","2","10","20-30","1.8 \u00d7 10","8.1 \u00d7 10","1.15"]},{"entry":["Ex. 4","50","50","2","10","20-30","5.1 \u00d7 10","5.2 \u00d7 10","0.06"]},{"entry":["Ex. 5","50","45","7","10","20-30","2.4 \u00d7 10","1.7 \u00d7 10","0.02"]},{"entry":["Ex. 6","20","18","5.2","10","20-30","9.8 \u00d7 10","4.1 \u00d7 10","1.21"]},{"entry":["Ex. 7","50","50","0","10","50-60","1.12","2.5 \u00d7 10","0.05"]},{"entry":["Ex. 8","50","45","7","5","40-50","8.2 \u00d7 10","1.5 \u00d7 10","0.12"]},{"entry":["Ex. 9","20","18","5.2","5","40-60","7.3 \u00d7 10","5.2 \u00d7 10","1.05"]},{"entry":["C.

This is because, since the indium oxide and the zinc oxide are not compounded but are independently present in the particles of Comparative Example 2, the zinc oxide as an insulating substance hinders the electrical conduction among the particles, with the result that the conductivity of the particles is inferior to the composite indium oxide particles obtained in Examples.","Regarding Comparative Example 3, the indium oxide is not substituted by tin, and therefore, the indium oxide as a coating substance does not exhibit conductivity, which leads to no conductivity of the resultant particles.","Regarding Comparative Example 4, the amount of aluminum used for the substitution is too large, and therefore, an excess of aluminum deposits as aluminum oxide and impairs the conductivity of the particles. On the other hand, in any of the composite particles of Examples, the tin-containing indium oxide coats the zinc oxide to inhibit heterogeneous particles from hindering the electrical conduction, and thus, electrical conduction is possible among the particles by allowing an electrical current to passing along the tin-containing indium oxide on the surfaces of the particles. Further, by the substitution with an appropriate amount of aluminum, it becomes possible for the composite particles of Examples to maintain the conductivity to be equal to or higher than that of the conventional simple tin-containing indium oxide particles (Comparative Example 1)."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
