title: Load restraining device
abstract: A load restraining device provides a system in which straps extending from one side of a web strap arrangement initially run parallel to the wall to which they are connected, as opposed to extending perpendicular to the wall as in the prior art. The anchor itself is a horizontal wall member running longitudinally along the wall of the railcar or trailer. An adjustable anchor is used to permit moving the attachment point several inches to allow for load variations. The attachment of the web strap arrangement is normally 14″ to 18″ behind the face of the load. Unlike previous systems, this provision of anchor points behind the load effectively “encapsulates” the load rather than merely providing a bulkhead effect. Ratchets provided as part of one of the wall anchor arrangements allow the web straps to be tightened into final position, imparting a restraining force to the load and preventing the load from shifting during transport. A removable load restraining system using multiple restraining net portions and flush-mounted anchor assemblies is also described.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Priority is claimed based on our Provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/343,106 filed Oct. 25, 2001 and entitled \u201cLOAD RESTRAINING DEVICE.\u201d","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to securement of loads and in particular to securement of loads for transport by railcar, and is more particularly directed toward a system for restraining loads in box cars or other transportation vehicles by use of a web strap net and ratchets.","2. Description of Related Art","Loads being transported generally require some type of restraint system in order to prevent damage to both the load and the transportation vehicle. Loads on rail cars need to be restrained from shifting under the various loads imposed by draft, buff, and rocking of the car.","For particular types of loads, such as large rolls or coils of sheet material, or palletized loads, tensioning mechanisms using straps and anchors are advantageous. When cargoes contained in boxes or bags, and arranged on pallets or slip-sheets, are loaded into railcars, some form of cargo restraint is required. One presently known form of load restraint is a movable bulkhead or \u201cdoor\u201d that can be placed in selected positions along the length of a box car. This bulkhead is held in place by locking pins inserted into floor tracks and ceiling tracks. Adjustment of bulkhead position is facilitated by rollers on a ceiling carriage that engages a ceiling rail or track.","This bulkhead approach has become less popular in recent years due to high maintenance. A bulkhead unit will frequently fail because the unit ceases to roll well, or fails to lock properly. There is also a safety concern, since bulkheads can disengage from the top track and fall, causing injury or death to workers, and damage to railcars and cargoes.","A form of bulkhead restraint system implemented with web strapping and ratchets has been tried on railcars and highway trailers. In this prior art system, the web connects to a side wall via a wall anchor and hook, extends outwardly at an angle of about 90 degrees to a point on the opposite wall of the car or trailer. This portion of the web is connected to the opposite wall via similar wall anchors and hooks. To provide tension in this \u201cbulkhead web,\u201d ratchets are provided on the netting itself.","This system has a number of disadvantages, among which are an inherent \u201ccross-car\u201d load distribution that has a tendency to pull car walls in. In addition, the bulkhead web is not easily positioned or adjusted to prevent undesired load shift. Accordingly, a need arises for a load restraining device that is dependable and safe in operation, as well as being economical to install and relatively maintenance-free. The load restraining device should be capable of providing appropriate load tension to prevent load shift, as well as keeping the load centered in the car or trailer to eliminate the need for so-called \u201ccenter-void\u201d fillers.","These needs and others are satisfied by the load restraining device of the present invention, in which the known bulkhead restraint system is replaced by web strap netting and ratchets in a unique arrangement. Briefly stated, the load restraint system of the present invention does not rely on the traditional method of a wall anchor and hook, but instead provides a system in which straps extending from one side of a web strap arrangement initially run parallel to the wall to which they are connected, as opposed to extending perpendicular to the wall as in the prior art. The anchor itself is a horizontal wall member running longitudinally along the wall of the railcar or trailer. An adjustable anchor is used to permit moving the attachment point several inches to allow for load variations. The attachment of the netting is normally 14\u2033 to 18\u2033 behind the face of the load. Unlike previous systems, this provision of anchor points behind the load effectively \u201cencapsulates\u201d the load rather than merely providing a bulkhead. The side of the railcar or trailer that includes these adjustable anchors is termed the \u201cfixed\u201d side and has no ratchets.","The netting is similar to known web strap netting. It has horizontal and vertical web straps (3\u2033 wide is used but other widths are possible). It features ends on one side that fit into nut bolts in the wall anchor on the fixed side. The net runs behind the load to these anchoring points, and then around the load in front and over the top if needed. The other side of the net runs behind the load and the straps are fed into rings, which allow the strap ends to be fed into ratchets for tightening. The web strap is not normally secured to the ceiling or floor, but such features could be incorporated under unique circumstances.","The netting of the present invention also features a multitude of vertical straps in positions corresponding to the \u201ccorners\u201d of the load (where the netting wraps around the load). This \u201csoft corner protector\u201d provided by this unique web strap geometry is to prevent the horizontal straps from digging into the load at the corners. This soft corner protection feature may also be implemented by providing canvas or other fabric at the sides of the net, about 12\u2033 to 18\u2033 in width, and extending the full height of the net. Preferably, the canvas or fabric would not extend over the full width of the net as in previous designs. There are no ratchets positioned along the netting itself as in previous systems.","Along the wall opposite the \u201cfixed\u201d anchors is a series of ratchets mounted on the wall horizontally and parallel to the wall. The ratchets may be mounted either permanently or in such a way as to allow easy removal by unscrewing, unbolting or tack weld cutting. Damaged ratchets can thus be removed easily for repair or replacement, if needed.","The netting is connected to the ratchets by taking the horizontal loose strap ends and feeding them around pins, or through adjustable rings, mounted on a horizontal rail parallel to the wall. The rings or pins are preferably located about 10\u2033 to 18\u2033 behind the load face. This results in the net \u201cencapsulating\u201d the load along the face that abuts the net. The loose ends are then fed into the ratchet and reel bars, and pulled tight to remove any slack, then the ratchet handle is \u201cpumped\u201d to tighten the load to the desired \u201cpreload\u201d tension. At unloading, the tension is released, in this case by rotating the ratchet handle 180 degrees. The ratchet is mounted far enough from the load face to permit this operation. Upon unloading and loosening of the net, it is stored on a hanger provided on the same wall as the \u201cfixed\u201d anchors.","Using a web strap netting that starts behind the load instead of the traditional \u201cstraight across\u201d method allows the web strap net to pull the load toward the center of the railcar or trailer to prevent load shift. \u201cBehind the load\u201d securement allows load-shifting forces to be taken down the length of the car instead of across the car. This eliminates the potential to pull car walls in. It also keeps the load centered in the car, and thus eliminates the need for center void fillers.","An alternative embodiment utilizing multiple restraining net portions and flush-mounted anchors is also described. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a load restraining system adapted for installation in a cargo transportation vehicle comprises a cargo restraining net including horizontal and vertical strap elements attached at their intersections, and an extension portion proximate an upper edge, the extension portion adapted to engage with one or more corners of a cargo being restrained, a plurality of anchors affixed to a first sidewall of the transportation vehicle, a plurality of strap adjustment mechanisms affixed to an opposing sidewall of the transportation vehicle, a first plurality of web straps extending from a first side of the cargo restraining net and affixed to the plurality of anchors, and a second plurality of web straps extending from a second side of the cargo restraining net and engaged with the plurality of strap adjustment mechanisms. The cargo restraining net firmly restrains the cargo when the strap adjustment mechanisms apply tension to the web straps, each of the first and second plurality of web straps extending from the cargo restraining net to the anchors and strap adjustment mechanisms is substantially parallel to the first and second sidewalls of the transportation vehicle, and the extension portion of the cargo restraining net engages the corners of the cargo to prevent horizontal strap damage to cargo corners.","In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the invention, a removable load restraining system adapted for installation in a cargo transportation vehicle comprises first and second cargo restraining net portions including horizontal and vertical strap elements attached at their intersections, a plurality of anchors substantially flush-mounted to interior sidewalls of the transportation vehicle, web straps extending from a first side of the first cargo restraining net portion and from a second side of the second cargo restraining net portion, the web straps removably engaged with the plurality of anchors, a plurality of strap adjustment mechanisms affixed proximate a first side of the second cargo restraining net portion, and a plurality of web straps extending from a second side of the first cargo restraining net portion and removably engaged with the plurality of strap adjustment mechanisms. The cargo restraining net portions meet along the cargo load face and firmly restrain the cargo when the strap adjustment mechanisms apply tension to the web straps, and each of the web straps extending from the first side of the first cargo restraining net portion and from the second side of the second cargo restraining net portion, in removable engagement with the plurality of anchors, is substantially parallel to the first and second sidewalls of the transportation vehicle.","Further objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The railroad box car  includes vertical members  that provide structural integrity for the side wall of the car. The vertical members  are substantially equally spaced along each of the opposing railcar sidewalls, and may be formed from wood, steel, or aluminum, for example. Generally, interior walls  for the railcar  are constructed from plywood sheets that are attached to the vertical supports by conventional means, such as nails, screws, or other known fasteners. The railroad box car  also includes doors  located approximately centrally along each sidewall. Of course, the presence of doors  and their locations have no particular impact on the present invention.","The anchoring system has been devised such that there are four \u201cfixed side\u201d anchors  and four \u201cratchet side\u201d anchors  for each load restraining device installation. There are four such load restraining devices contemplated for the standard railroad box car installation, but there could be more or fewer depending upon the specific application, and the type of transport vehicle into which the devices are installed. For the box car application, there are preferably two retraining devices installed on each side of the railcar lateral centerline (labeled A in FIG. ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","2","2","100","103","104"]},"Hangers  (shown in a closer view in FIG. ), for easy storage of the restraining devices, are provided on the railcar doors . Of course, the hangers  may be positioned in other convenient locations within the transportation vehicle as well.  illustrate a suitable configuration for the hangers . A pair of steel hanger plates , preferably from \u215b\u2033 stock and curved outward slightly at one end, are attached (such as by welding, for example) to a transverse steel retainer plate . Holes  are provided through the hanger plates  and retainer plate  for attachment to a door or interior wall of a transportation vehicle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 through 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","104","5","6","103","102","101","103","102","102","3","4","104","104","103","103","105","102"]},"Each of the fixed side anchors , illustrated in , is preferably formed from steel channel stock, C4X5.4 (ASTM A36), although the anchors  could be made from other suitable materials of similar strength and structural integrity. Each of the anchors  is preferably cut to a length of about 42\u2033 for interposition between the vertical support members  of the railcar or trailer in which they are installed. Of course, custom length dimensions may be indicated for specific kinds of installations. In their preferred form, sets of eight holes  are provided along the length of the anchor . The holes  are designed to accommodate bolts (\u00f8\u00be, 10\u00d76, grade 8, preferably, although not shown in the drawings) to secure the web strap netting  at the fixed end. One of the holes  in each set may be threaded to accommodate a threaded bolt for greater security, although this would not always be necessary. This aspect of the present invention will be discussed in detail in a subsequent paragraph.","As mentioned previously, the \u201cratchet side\u201d requires one of the fixed side anchors  and a ratchet support assembly , which is depicted in detail in . The ratchet support assembly is preferably formed from a length of steel channel stock  of the same specifications as that of the fixed anchor , and cut to the same length. A pair of ratchet support brackets  is affixed to the front face of the channel , and provided with holes  therethrough for attachment of the ratchet itself (not illustrated in the figure). A support plate  is also affixed to the channel  adjacent to the brackets . Attachment of the brackets  and plate  may be accomplished by welding or other suitable means.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIGS. 25 and 26","b":["2202","105","2502","1403","2501","1402","2202","2505","2202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIGS. 8-10","b":["103","104","801","803","802","802","801"]},"The configuration of the web strap net  itself is shown in FIG. . Preferably, the net  is constructed from polyester web straps of varying lengths and widths that are sewn together at their intersections as illustrated. In its preferred form, the web strap net  is based around four horizontal straps  that are about 206\u2033 long and 3\u2033 wide. Approximately 18\u2033 from one end (the \u201cfixed\u201d end) of these horizontally arranged straps , a 12\u2033 wide section of web strap  is sewn to the horizontal straps  such that the horizontal straps  are spaced apart by about 26 inches. This vertical strap  is allowed to overlap the uppermost horizontal strap  by about 13\u2033 for a reason that will become clear in the subsequent section.","A second vertical 12\u2033 strap  is laterally spaced from the first vertical strap  by about 96 inches, and is also arranged to overlap the uppermost horizontal strap. The interior portion of the web strap net is comprised of a series of vertical straps , approximately 2\u2033 wide and spaced about 14\u2033 apart, in conjunction with a similar arrangement of horizontal 2\u2033 straps , spaced apart at the same distance. The vertical straps  are also allowed to extend beyond the topmost horizontal strap  by about 13 inches, and an additional 3\u2033 strap  is sewn to the ends of these vertical straps  and allowed to overlap on the ends by about 12 inches.","As shown in , the short extensions of the horizontal strap  are folded over and sewn to the uppermost of the long horizontal straps . This operation creates a region  in the finished net  that includes a multitude of vertical strap sections secured to the upper strap  by short oblique strap sections , . This folded over section  provides a network of vertical straps that settle over the upper edge and upper corners of a load , serving as corner protectors that forestall the tendency of the horizontal straps  to \u201cdig\u201d into load corners.","The horizontal straps  include short extensions  that extend beyond the first vertical strap  by about  inches, and are terminated in loops or eyes  that are formed by folding over the strap material  and sewing the material together in the \u201csewing area\u201d illustrated in FIG. . The opposing ends  of the horizontal straps  extend beyond the nearest vertical strap  by about 92 inches. These longer extensions  are intended to interconnect with the ratchet anchor assemblies  provided on the side of the transport vehicle opposite the fixed side.","In an alternative form, the strap ends  can also be equipped with steel rings , as shown in . The steel rings  are securely sewn onto the straps, preferably by folding the strap around the ring and sewing it securely. Of course, the rings  could also be fastened to the straps by other, equally secure, methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["1702","1708","2301","103","2201","1708","2301","103","801","803","802","1703","801","2201","103","1703","2202","105","803","2201","803","1703","101","100","802"]},"In operation (referring also to FIGS.  and ), the straps  are fed through the reel bars  of the ratchets  in order to eliminate slack. The handle of the ratchet  is then operated back and forth until the webbing is properly tensioned. Preferably, the reel bars  have at least two wraps of webbing to help ensure that no slippage occurs. To release tension on the webbing, a pawl provided on the handle is pulled back, and the handle is rotated over center to the full open position.","Of course, the use of the load restraining device is not limited to railcar applications. The inventive system is readily adaptable to over-the-road trailers, even those where cargoes are loaded and unloaded through a single rear door. In those applications, the bolts  are disposed on the side of the load face  that is away from the rear door of the trailer. Thus, the load restraining device will forestall undesirable shifting of cargoes toward the loading door in such over-the-road trailer installations.","Of course, there are situations in which the permanent mounting of ratchet assemblies to the interior sidewalls of transport vehicles (such as railcars) cannot be tolerated. This is true, for example, for multiple use railroad boxcars that may carry various types of loads. Permanently installed ratchets would protrude into the cargo space and could cause damage to some types of cargoes, as well as interfering with the loading of certain cargoes that actually require the entire boxcar width for proper accommodation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 27","FIG. 27"],"b":["2701","2704","2705","2701","2702","2704","2703","2703","2703","2701","2703","2703"]},"As noted, because this alternative restraint system is designed to be removable, the web strap nets themselves are provided in sections. The large nets described above in conjunction with the previous embodiment would simply be too heavy, once encumbered with ratchet assemblies, to function satisfactorily in a removable environment. Consequently, the web strap net configuration illustrated in  is designed to mate with the net of FIG. .","Since the web strap net of  does not include ratchets (these are provided on the mating structure of FIG. ), this particular web strap net of  is intended to be the longer of the two removable sections. Preferably, the web strap net of  is about fourteen feet in length. The web straps  are preferably formed from 4-inch polyester material. 12-inch wide vertical strap sections  are secured to the horizontal straps . At first ends of the straps , securement pins  are attached to the straps  in much the same fashion described in conjunction with FIG. . The anchor mechanism used with the securement pins  will be described in more detail below.","The vertical strap sections  are positioned relatively close to the securement pin  ends of the straps . The wide vertical straps  are employed because of uncertainty regarding the precise corner locations for various cargoes, and it is believed that this structure provides a wide range of corner support to meet most eventualities. A relatively long run of free strap ends  is designed to extend along the cargo frontage and mate with the ratchet assemblies  of the mating web strap section. Since the ratchet assembles  and the free strap ends will mate and engage with each other at a point along the frontage (or face) of the cargo, it is contemplated that a cushioning material, such as cardboard dunnage sheets, for example, will be inserted between the ratchets and the load face in order to avoid damage to the cargo.","Alternative web strap net configurations are also provided.  illustrates a web strap net having three horizontal 4-inch polyester web straps , unequally spaced at 21 inches and 23 inches apart. Of course, many different spacings may be selected without diminishing the effectiveness of the present restraint system. The web strap net of  includes a plurality of 12-inch wide vertical web straps  secured to the horizontal straps . At first ends of the web straps , ratchet assemblies  are provided, while at the strap ends opposite from the ratchets , securement pins  are provided in the manner described above. A three-strap net configuration similar to the net of  (except with three horizontal straps arranged in the same vertical spacing as those of ) is contemplated, but is not illustrated in a drawing figure. It is believed that utilizing more that three horizontal straps in a web strap net, particularly for the section having ratchet assemblies, renders the net too heavy for easy removability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["3000","3001"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIGS. 31 and 32","b":["2801","3001","2703","3001","3101","2703","3001"]},"Using the web strap nets described above, removable restraint configurations can be easily achieved featuring various combinations of horizontal straps to accommodate a variety of loads. For example, using the plurality of anchors provided in the railcar of , one could devise a removable restraint system in which a pair of lower web strap nets having three horizontal straps each, combined with a pair of upper web strap nets having a pair of horizontal straps each, provides a total of 5 horizontal straps across the cargo being secured, but is still easily removable, and is relatively light in weight because it is provided in four sections. Other configurations of horizontal straps, such as single 2- or 3-strap nets, or a six-strap net comprised of two pairs of three-strap nets, are easily installed and removed after use utilizing the restraint system of the present invention.","There has been described herein a load restraining device that offers distinct advantages when compared with the prior art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the illustration and description of the present invention in a railcar installation is not intended to limit the invention to railcar applications alone."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"],"b":["10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"],"b":["16","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 25"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 27"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":"31"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
