However, when the tire frame is formed of a uniform thermoplastic polymer material which is not equipped with a reinforcing member such as a carcass ply, there is room for improvement from the viewpoint of the resistance to stress, internal pressure and the like, compared to the conventional tires made of rubber (see, for example, JP-A No. 2003-104008).","Furthermore, conventional rubber tires cannot be easily recycled, and recycling applications thereof are limited, for example, incinerating the tires, or crushing the tires to be used in the material for road pavement. On the other hand, tires in which a thermoplastic polymer material is used have an advantage that the degree of freedom of the applications is high, even from the viewpoint of recycling.","In JP-A No. 03-143701, a reinforcing layer in which a reinforcing cord is helically wound continuously in the circumferential direction of the tire is provided on the outer surface in the tire radial direction of the tread bottom of the tire main body (tire frame) to improve the resistance to cutting or the resistance to puncture of the tire main body. However, when a reinforcing layer in which a reinforcing cord is helically wound directly around a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic polymer material, is formed, and a tread is formed on the outer side in the radial direction of the reinforcing layer, even though an adhesive is used for the reinforcing cord, it cannot be said that sufficient adhesiveness is provided, and there may be air remaining around the reinforcing cords. As such, if air remains around the reinforcing cord, the reinforcing cord may move at the time of driving and cause detachment between the members. Thus, there is room for an improvement from the viewpoint of the durability of tires. Furthermore, since the region around the reinforcing cord is all covered with a cushion rubber, detachment of the reinforcing cord and the like may occur as a result of the difference in the hardness of materials between the tire main body and the region around the reinforcing cord.","Also, when a tire is produced by using a thermoplastic polymer material, it is demanded to realize a performance (required characteristics of the tire) that is comparable to that of the conventional rubber tires, while realizing low cost by increasing the production efficiency. For example, when a thermoplastic resin material is used as the material for a tire frame, it can be considered, from the viewpoint of production efficiency and the like, to form the tire frame by injecting a polymer material into a mold by injection molding as described in JP-A No. 03-143701. Accordingly, as the thermoplastic polymer material, it is desirable to select a material which is excellent in the durability obtainable when the material is produced into a tire, and in the handleability at the time of molding (manufacturability) (first, third, fourth, and seventh to thirteenth aspects of the present invention as described below).","Furthermore, for example, a tire is required to have strong resistance to impact; however, it is requested that tires formed by using a thermoplastic polymer material also have impact resistance that is equal to or higher than the impact resistance of conventional tires made of rubber (second aspect of the present invention as described below).","Furthermore, regarding the characteristics required of tires, for example, factors such as having an elastic modulus in a certain range, having a low dynamic loss factor at 30\u00b0 C., 20 Hz and a shear strain of 1% (coefficient of rolling: tan \u03b4 (hereinafter, may be simply referred to as \u201ctan \u03b4\u201d)), having excellent heat resistance, and the like respectively constitute important characteristics. However, decrease in the tan \u03b4 value and increase in the elastic modulus in a polymer material are usually in a contradictory relationship. Accordingly, it is desired to develop a tire which can achieve a good balance between these characteristics at a high level (fifth aspect of the present invention as described below).","Also, on the other hand, use of a thermoplastic resin material in a tire tends to further increase the electrostatic property of the tire surface. Since electrostatic charging of a tire may cause the occurrence of discharge, and adhesion of fine dust and the like to the tire surface, a tire in which a thermoplastic resin material is used and which has a superior antistatic ability is desired. However, no such tire has been provided yet (sixth aspect as described below).","The present invention was achieved in view of the various circumstances described above.","An object according to a first aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic polymer material and exhibits excellent durability and manufacturability.","An object according to a second aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic polymer material and exhibits excellent durability, manufacturability and impact resistance.","An object according to a third aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material and has excellent tensile elasticity and fracture properties, and a method for producing this tire.","An object according to a fourth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material and exhibits excellent steering stability with small rolling resistance.","An object according to a fifth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic polymer material, is highly elastic, has a low loss factor, and exhibits excellent heat resistance.","An object according to a sixth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material and has an excellent antistatic performance.","An object according to a seventh aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material, and in which even if the elastic modulus is increased, an increase in rolling resistance can be suppressed.","An object according to an eighth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a resin material, and in which an elastic modulus in a suitable range can be obtained and an increase in rolling resistance can be suppressed.","An object according to a ninth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a resin material and in which impact resistance can be enhanced.","An object according to a tenth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material, has high durability at the time of driving since air is prevented from remaining in a region around the reinforcing cord member, and is not easily affected by temperature change.","An object according to an eleventh aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material and has excellent impact resistance, and in which the temperature dependency of the tensile yield strength is suppressed.","An object according to a twelfth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material and has excellent impact resistance and fracture properties, and a method for producing a tire with excellent productivity.","An object according to a thirteenth aspect of the present invention is to provide a tire which is formed using a thermoplastic resin material, and has excellent impact resistance since air is prevented from remaining in a region around the reinforcing cords.","The means for solving the problem of the first aspect is as follows.","(1-1) The tire of the first aspect of the present invention is a tire including at least a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material, in which the tire includes a reinforcing cord member that forms a reinforcing cord layer on the outer circumference of the tire frame, and the thermoplastic resin material includes at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer.","The reinforcing cord layer may be wound around the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction, or may also be wound around the outer circumference in a crossing manner.","The tire of the first aspect of the present invention includes a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. The \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d means a thermoplastic resin material which is formed of a copolymer including a polymer constituting a hard segment that is crystalline and has a high melting point, and a polymer constituting a soft segment that is non-crystalline and has a low glass transition temperature, and which has an amide bond (\u2014CONH\u2014) in the main chain of the polymer constituting the hard segment.","Furthermore, the \u201cthermoplastic resin\u201d means a resin having thermoplasticity, and does not encompass conventional vulcanized rubbers such as natural rubber or synthetic rubbers. Polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomers have an advantage that when used as a material for forming tire frames, the elastomers have heat resistance and also exhibit excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and fracture strain. Also, when a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used in a tire frame, the structure of the tire can be simplified as compared with the conventional tires made of rubber, and as a result, weight reduction of the tire can be realized. Therefore, when a tire frame is formed using the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance and durability of the tire can be enhanced. In addition, since a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can have the melting point set to near 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., it is easy to handle the resin material, and energy consumption at the time of forming a tire frame can be suppressed, while productivity can be increased.","In an embodiment of the tire of the first aspect of the present invention, the reinforcing cord member is wound around the outer circumference of a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and thus a reinforcing cord layer is formed. When a reinforcing cord layer is formed on the outer circumference of the tire frame, the resistance to puncture and resistance to cutting of the tire, and the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire (tire frame) are increased. Also, as the rigidity in the circumferential direction is increased, creeping (a phenomenon in which plastic deformation of the tire frame increases with time under a constant stress) in the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic material is suppressed.","Furthermore, a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can easily penetrate not only between the fibers of the reinforcing cord member itself, but also between twisted cords in the case where the reinforcing cord member has a twisted-fiber structure, due to the low melt viscosity of the elastomer. Accordingly, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness to reinforcing cord members, and has excellent fixing performance such as welding strength. Also, when the reinforcing cord member is an organic fiber, since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer that forms the tire frame can be welded to the reinforcing cord member, high welding properties and excellent fixing performance are obtained. Further, since a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer exhibits excellent elongation, the fracture properties are excellent. Therefore, for example, the phenomenon in which air remains in the region around the reinforcing cord members in the reinforcing cord winding step (incorporation of air) can be suppressed. If the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness and welding properties to the reinforcing cords, and incorporation of air into the surroundings of the reinforcing cord members is suppressed, the movement of the reinforcing cord members due to, for example, a force applied during driving can be effectively suppressed. Thereby, for example, even in the case where a tire-constituting members is provided so as to cover the entirety of the reinforcing cord members in the outer circumference of the tire frame, since the movement of the reinforcing cord members is suppressed, detachment or the like between these members (including the tire frame) is prevented from occurring, and durability of the tire is enhanced.","(1-2) The tire of the first aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material. As such, when the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material, the difference in hardness between the tire and the reinforcing cord layer can be decreased as compared with the case where the reinforcing cord member is fixed with a cushion rubber, and therefore, the reinforcing cord member can be adhered and fixed to the tire frame further. Thereby, the incorporation of air as described above can be effectively prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving can be effectively suppressed. Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord member is a steel cord, if an attempt is made to separate the reinforcing cords from the cushion rubber at the time of disposal of the tire, while it is difficult to separate a vulcanized rubber from the reinforcing cord only by heating, a resin material can be separated from the reinforcing cord member by heating only. Therefore, it is advantageous in view of recyclability of the tire. Furthermore, a resin material usually has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubbers. Accordingly, if the reinforcing cord layer contains a large amount of a resin material, the rolling properties of the tire can be enhanced. Moreover, a resin having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubbers is advantageous in that the resin has high in-plane shear rigidity, and also exhibits excellent steering stability at the time of tire driving, and excellent abrasion resistance.","In regard to the first aspect of the present invention, if the expression \u201cresin\u201d is used alone, the \u201cresin\u201d is a concept which encompasses thermoplastic resins (including thermoplastic elastomers) and thermosetting resins, and does not encompass vulcanized rubbers.","When the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material, from the viewpoint of increasing the pull-out properties (difficulty to be pulled out) of the reinforcing cords, the reinforcing cord members are preferably covered by a resin material over 20% or more of the surface, and more preferably 50% or more of the surface. Also, the content of the resin material in the reinforcing cord layer is preferably 20 mass % or more, and more preferably 50 mass % or more, relative to the total amount of the materials that constitute the reinforcing cord layer excluding the reinforcing cords, from the viewpoint of increasing the pull-out properties of the reinforcing cord.","In order to configure the reinforcing cord layer to include a resin material, for example, the reinforcing cord layer can be formed in a configuration such that when viewed from a cross-section of the tire frame along the axial direction, at least a portion of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame that is formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer of the outer circumference of the tire frame in which the reinforcing cord member is embedded corresponds to the resin material as a component of the reinforcing cord layer, and the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (thermoplastic resin material) forming the tire frame and the reinforcing cord member constitute the reinforcing cord layer. Furthermore, in order to configure the reinforcing cord layer to include a resin material, a coated cord member obtained by coating a reinforcing cord with a resin material of the same kind as or a different from the resin material that forms the tire frame, may be wound in the circumferential direction of the tire frame. The \u201csame kind\u201d as used for resin material means a situation in which both are ester-based resin materials, or both are styrene-based resin materials, or the like.","(1-3) The tire of the first aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. As such, when the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is adjusted to 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., a balance can be achieved between durability as the tire performance, and manufacturability in view of reducing the production cost.","(1-4) The tire of the first aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the content ratio of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material is 50 mass % to 100 mass %. When the content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material is 50 mass % to 100 mass %, the performance of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can be sufficiently exhibited, and a balance can be achieved between durability as the tire performance, and handleability or manufacturability in view of reducing the production cost.","The tire of the first aspect of the present invention can be produced by a production method which includes a tire frame piece forming step of forming a tire frame piece for constituting a portion of a circular tire frame, using a thermoplastic resin material including at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer; a tire frame piece bonding step of forming the tire frame by fusing two or more of the tire frame pieces, which make a pair, by applying heat to bonding surfaces of the tire frame pieces; and a reinforcing cord member winding step of winding a reinforcing cord members around the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction to form a reinforcing cord layer.","In the production method described above, tire frame pieces of the circular tire frame are formed using a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. Since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can have its melting point set to about 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., for example, it is not necessary to carry out a process of fusing the tire frame pieces at or above 300\u00b0 C., and the process of fusing can be carried out at a relatively low temperature. As such, since the process of fusing can be carried out at a relatively low temperature, from the viewpoint of energy availability or the like, the tire productivity can be increased. Furthermore, when tire frame pieces in which a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer are fused to form a tire frame, sufficient adhesive strength between the tire frame pieces can be obtained, and the performance of the frame itself is not deteriorated by the temperature at the time of fusion. Therefore, durability at the time of driving, such as the resistance to puncture or abrasion resistance of the tire thus produced can be increased.","The production method can be configured such that in the tire frame piece bonding step, the bonding surface of the tire frame piece is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material that constitutes the tire frame piece (for example, melting point +10\u00b0 C. to +150\u00b0 C.).","As such, when the bonding surface of the divided body is heated to a temperature higher than or equal to the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material that constitutes the tire frame piece, since fusion between the tire frame pieces can be sufficiently achieved, productivity of the tire can be increased, while durability of the tire is enhanced.","The means for solving the problem of the second aspect is as follows.","(2-1) The tire of the second aspect of the present invention is a tire including at least a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material, in which the tire includes a reinforcing cord member that forms a reinforcing cord layer on the outer circumference of the tire frame, and the thermoplastic resin material includes at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cother elastomer\u201d in relation to the second embodiment of the present invention).","The reinforcing cord layer may be wound in the circumferential direction of the outer circumference of the tire frame, or may be wound around the outer circumference in a crossing manner.","The tire of the second aspect of the present invention includes a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer. Here, the \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention as described above.","The other elastomer means a thermoplastic resin material formed of a copolymer including a polymer constituting a hard segment that is crystalline and has a high melting point, or a hard segment that has high cohesive force, and a polymer constituting a soft segment that is non-crystalline and has a low glass transition temperature, in which the polymer constituting the hard segment is a polymer other than a polyamide having amide bonds (\u2014CONH\u2014) in the main chain, for example, a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomer (including an olefin copolymer such as an olefin-methacrylic acid copolymer or an olefin-acrylate copolymer), a polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer and the like obtainable by polymerizing urethane, styrene, an olefin, and a polyester, respectively. The thermoplastic resin for the second aspect of the present invention has the same definition as that used in the present invention according to the first aspect as described above. A thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer has heat resistance and also exhibits excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and fracture strain. Furthermore, when a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer is used in the tire frame, the structure of the tire can be simplified as compared to the conventional rubber tires, and as a result, weight reduction of the tire can be realized. Therefore, when a tire frame is formed using the thermoplastic resin material, abrasion resistance and durability of the tire can be increased. On the other hand, in the case where a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used alone, when an attempt is made to adjust the elastic modulus, it is necessary to control the ratio of the hard segment and the soft segment. On the contrary, when a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer are used in combination, the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material can be easily adjusted by adjusting the content ratio of the two components, as compared to the case of using a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer alone. Therefore, since the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material can be easily set to a desired range, the resin material is excellent in view of the production cost, and impact resistance can be easily enhanced.","In an embodiment of the tire of the second aspect of the present invention, a reinforcing cord member is wound around the outer circumference of a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer, to form a reinforcing cord layer. When the reinforcing cord layer is formed on the outer circumference of the tire frame, the resistance to puncture and resistance to cutting of the tire, and the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire (tire frame) are increased. Also, as the rigidity in the circumferential direction is increased, creeping (a phenomenon in which plastic deformation of the tire frame increases with time under a constant stress) in the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic material is suppressed.","Furthermore, a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can easily penetrate not only between the fibers of the reinforcing cord member itself, but also between twisted cords in the case where the reinforcing cord member has a twisted-fiber structure, due to the low melt viscosity of the elastomer.

Further, since a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer exhibits excellent elongation, the fracture properties are excellent. Therefore, when a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer is used, for example, the phenomenon in which air remains in the surroundings of the reinforcing cord members in the reinforcing cord winding step (incorporation of air) can be suppressed. If the thermoplastic resin material has high adhesiveness and welding properties to the reinforcing cord, and incorporation of air into the surroundings of the reinforcing cord members is suppressed, the movement of the reinforcing cord member due to, for example, a force applied during driving can be effectively suppressed.

As such, when the mass ratio (x:y) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x) and the other elastomer (y) is set to 95:5 to 60:40, a good balance can be easily achieved between the welding properties between the reinforcing cord members and the tire frame, and the impact resistance of the tire.","(2-4) The tire of the second aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the other elastomer is any one selected from a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomer, of a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer. When the other elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material is any one selected from a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomer, or a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer, the performance of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can be sufficiently exhibited, and also, a balance between durability and impact resistance of the tire can be easily achieved.","The tire of the second aspect of the present invention can be produced by a production method which includes a tire frame piece forming step of forming a tire frame piece for constituting a portion of a circular tire frame, using a thermoplastic resin material including at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the another elastomer; a tire frame piece bonding step of forming a tire frame by fusing two or more of the tire frame pieces, which make a pair, by applying heat to bonding surfaces of the tire frame piece; and a reinforcing cord member winding step of winding a reinforcing cord member around the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction to form a reinforcing cord layer.","In the production method described above, tire frame pieces of the circular tire frame can be formed by using a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another r elastomer. Since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can have its melting point set to about 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., for example, it is not necessary to carry out a process of fusing the tire frame pieces at or above 300\u00b0 C., and the process of fusing can be carried out at a relatively low temperature. As such, since the process of fusing can be carried out at a relatively low temperature, deterioration of the resin can be prevented, and from the viewpoint of energy availability or the like, the tire productivity can be increased. Furthermore, a tire frame piece in which a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the another elastomer is used is such that when tire frame pieces are fused to form a tire frame, sufficient adhesive strength between the tire frame pieces is obtained, and the performance of the frame itself is not deteriorated by the temperature at the time of fusion. Therefore, durability at the time of driving, such as the resistance to puncture or abrasion resistance of the tire thus produced can be increased.","The production method can be configured such that in the tire frame piece bonding step, the bonding surface of the tire frame piece is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material that constitutes the tire frame piece (for example, melting point +10\u00b0 C. to +150\u00b0 C.).","As such, when the bonding surface of the divided body is heated to a temperature higher than or equal to the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material that constitutes the tire frame piece, since fusion between the tire frame pieces can be sufficiently achieved, productivity of the tire can be increased, while durability of the tire is enhanced.","The means for solving the problem of the third aspect is as follows.","(3-1) The tire of the third aspect of the present invention is a tire including at least a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material, in which the thermoplastic resin material includes a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying a thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, or a mixture of a thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying the elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer.","That is, the tire of the third aspect of the present invention includes a circular tire frame formed of a specific thermoplastic resin material, and the specific thermoplastic resin material includes at least 1) a combination of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying a thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, or 2) a combination of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, a thermoplastic elastomer other than a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying a thermoplastic elastomer other than a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer.","Hereinafter, the \u201cthermoplastic elastomer\u201d refers to a thermoplastic resin material formed of a copolymer that includes a polymer constituting a hard segment that is crystalline and has a high melting point or a hard segment that has high cohesive force power, and a polymer constituting a soft segment that is non-crystalline and has a low glass transition temperature.","The \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention as described above.","In the third aspect of the present invention, the \u201cthermoplastic elastomer other than a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d means a thermoplastic elastomer which does not include an amide bond (\u2014CONH\u2014) in the main chain of the polymer constituting the hard segment, among thermoplastic elastomers.

Furthermore, as the thermoplastic resin material includes an acid-modified elastomer, since the elasticity of the resin material does not become too strong, and the thermoplastic resin material is flexible, the tensile modulus of elasticity can be decreased, and impact resistance can be improved. Furthermore, even if the resin material is fractured, the resin material is not easily torn off and ruptured, and the resin material easily forms a stretched state.

In regard to the tire of the fifth aspect of the present invention, since the tire frame is formed of the resin material, a vulcanization process that is an essential process for the conventional tires made of rubber is not essential, and the tire frame can be molded by, for example, injection molding. Therefore, simplification of the production process, time shortening, cost reduction, and the like can be promoted. Furthermore, when a resin material is used in the tire frame, the structure of the tire can be simplified as compared with the conventional tires made of rubber, and as a result, weight reduction of the tire can be realized. Accordingly, abrasion resistance and durability of the tire in which a tire frame is formed of the tire material can be enhanced.","The \u201cthermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the present invention according to the third aspect as described above. In order to increase the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic elastomer (for example, the tensile modulus of elasticity defined in JIS K7113:1995), increasing the content ratio of the hard segment in the elastomer may be considered. However, when the content ratio of the hard segment is increased in order to increase the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic elastomer, the loss factor (tan \u03b4) of the thermoplastic elastomer also increases along therewith.","Furthermore, in order to enhance the heat resistance (temperature dependency of deflection under load, the elastic modulus, and the like) of the tire frame, using a thermoplastic elastomer having a high glass transition temperature or a thermoplastic elastomer having a high elastic modulus can be considered. However, as explained above, these thermoplastic elastomers also undergo an increase in the tan \u03b4 value.","In the tire of the fifth aspect of the present invention, the resin material that forms the tire frame includes the specific resin according to the fifth aspect of the present invention, which has a glass transition temperature (Tg) higher than that of the hard segment, in addition to the thermoplastic elastomer. Therefore, as compared with the case of using the thermoplastic elastomer as a single substance, an increase in the elastic modulus can be achieved while the tan \u03b4 value of the tire frame is maintained low. Thereby, a tire having a low rolling resistance and a high elastic modulus can be provided. Furthermore, since the elastic modulus can be increased while the tan \u03b4 value of the tire frame is maintained low, heat resistance of the tire frame can also be increased.","(5-2) In regard to the tire of the fifth aspect of the present invention, a resin having a glass transition temperature that is higher by 20\u00b0 C. or more than the glass transition temperature of the hard segment of the thermoplastic elastomer can be used as the resin.

The \u201cresin of the same kind as the hard segment\u201d included in the thermoplastic elastomer refers to a resin having a skeleton that is common with the skeleton constituting the main chain of the hard segment included in the thermoplastic elastomer. Meanwhile, the resin in the seventh aspect of the present invention has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention as described above. The thermoplastic elastomer also does not encompass conventional vulcanized rubbers such as natural rubber or synthetic rubbers.","Hereinafter, a resin of the same kind as the hard segment included in the thermoplastic elastomer, which is other than the thermoplastic elastomer, is also simply referred to as \u201cspecific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention\u201d.","When the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention has a skeleton that is common with the skeleton constituting the main chain of the hard segment carried by the thermoplastic elastomer, the affinity between the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention and the hard segment of the thermoplastic elastomer increases. Therefore, as the thermoplastic resin material includes the thermoplastic elastomer of the constitution described above and the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention, the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention is compatible with the hard segment of the thermoplastic elastomer and is localized in the hard segment of the thermoplastic elastomer. Thus, the region of the hard segment increases.","Therefore, in a thermoplastic resin containing the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention and a thermoplastic elastomer, it is believed that it is not such that simply the two components are included, and the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention is uniformly dispersed in the thermoplastic elastomer, and exhibit the respective properties of the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention and the thermoplastic elastomer, but that the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material increases due to increase in the region of the hard segment of the thermoplastic elastomer.","Since the rolling resistance of a tire is caused by vibration at approximately 10 Hz to 100 Hz at near 50\u00b0 C., when the viscoelasticity of the tire is measured, the magnitude of the rolling resistance can be expressed by tan \u03b4 at 30\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C.","A tire formed using a resin material composed only of a thermoplastic elastomer has a tendency that when the number of hard segment regions of the thermoplastic elastomer is increased to increase the elastic modulus, the loss tangent (tan \u03b4) increases. Specifically, when the ratio of the hard segment and the soft segment of the thermoplastic elastomer is changed to increase the elastic modulus, the peak of tan \u03b4 of the thermoplastic elastomer in the measurement of viscoelasticity is shifted to the higher temperature side, and the tan \u03b4 value at 30\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. tends to increase.","When the loss tangent (tan \u03b4) of the resin material increases, the energy loss (heat generation) occurring upon deformation at the time of tire rolling tends to increase, and the rolling resistance tends to increase. Accordingly, a car using a tire which uses such a resin material as a raw material tends to have a large fuel consumption. That is, in a tire formed by using a resin material that is composed only of a thermoplastic elastomer, if the elastic modulus of the resin material is increased for the purpose of enhancing the resistance to deformation of the tire, the tan \u03b4 value of the resin material also increases at the same time. Therefore, it has been difficult to realize low fuel consumption.","On the contrary, when a tire frame is produced using the thermoplastic resin material according to the seventh aspect of the present invention having the constitution described above, and thus a tire is formed, even if the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material increases, the tan \u03b4 value does not easily increase. This is thought to be because when the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention is compatible with the hard segment of the thermoplastic elastomer, the region of the hard segment itself increases, and in the measurement of viscoelasticity, a shift of the peak of tan \u03b4 of the thermoplastic resin material is suppressed. As a result, it is speculated that although a peak of tan \u03b4 of the specific resin according to the seventh aspect of the present invention appears, the tan \u03b4 is suppressed in overall.","Thus, it is thought that in the seventh aspect of the present invention, even though the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material increases, the tan \u03b4 value does not easily increase.","(7-2) The tire of the seventh aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the elastic modulus of the resin is 100 MPa or greater.","As such, when the elastic modulus of the resin that is easily compatible with the hard segment included in the thermoplastic elastomer is adjusted to the range described above, the elastic modulus of the hard segment of the thermoplastic elastomer can be further increased.

Here, the \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention as described above.","The \u201cpolyester-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the second aspect of the present invention described above.","The thermoplastic resin according to the tenth aspect of the present invention means a resin having thermoplasticity, and does not encompass conventional vulcanized rubbers such as natural rubber or synthetic rubbers.","The thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer has excellent durability. More specifically, the resin material has heat resistance, and also exhibits excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and fracture strain. Therefore, when a tire frame is formed using the resin material, the tire obtains excellent durability and manufacturability. Furthermore, since the structure can be simplified, weight reduction can be expected.","Furthermore, since the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer exhibits less temperature dependency of tensile yield strength, the resin material exhibits less deformation or change in hardness that is caused by temperature fluctuation in the use environment, and has a high deflection temperature under load. Therefore, the influence of the use temperature environment for the tire can be decreased, and the tire can be used in an environment of a wide range of temperatures.","On the other hand, when the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used alone, in the case of adjusting the elastic modulus, it is necessary to control the ratio of the hard segment and the soft segment. In this regard, when a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester thermoplastic elastomer are used in combination, the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin composition can be easily adjusted by adjusting the content ratio of the two components, as compared with the case of using a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer alone. Therefore, the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material can be easily set to a desired range.","In an embodiment of the tire of the tenth aspect of the present invention, a reinforcing cord member is wound around the outer circumference of a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer, and thus a reinforcing cord layer is formed. When a reinforcing cord layer is formed on the outer circumference of the tire frame, the resistance to puncture and resistance to cutting of the tire, and the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire (tire frame) are enhanced. In addition, when the rigidity in the circumferential direction is increased, creeping (a phenomenon in which plastic deformation of the tire frame increases with time under a constant stress) in the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic material is suppressed.","Furthermore, a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness to the reinforcing cord members, and also exhibits excellent fixing performance such as welding strength. Therefore, when a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer is used, for example, the phenomenon in which air remains in the surroundings of the reinforcing cord members in the reinforcing cord winding step (incorporation of air) can be suppressed. If the thermoplastic resin material has high adhesiveness and welding properties to the reinforcing cord, and incorporation of air into the surroundings of the reinforcing cord members is suppressed, the movement of the reinforcing cord member due to, for example, a force applied during driving can be effectively suppressed. Thereby, for example, even in the case where a tire component member is disposed so as to cover the entirety of the reinforcing cord member in the outer circumference of the tire frame, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, detachment or the like between these members (including the tire frame) is prevented from occurring, and durability of the tire is enhanced.","(10-2) The tire of the tenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material. As such, when the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material, the difference in hardness between the tire and the reinforcing cord layer can be decreased as compared with the case of fixing the reinforcing cord member with a cushion rubber, the reinforcing cord members can be further adhered and fixed to the tire frame. Thereby, the incorporation of air described above can be effectively prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving can be effectively suppressed. Here, the \u201cresin material\u201d is a concept including thermoplastic resins (including thermoplastic elastomers) and thermosetting resins, and does not encompass vulcanized rubbers.","When the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material, from the viewpoint of increasing the pull-out properties (difficulty to be pulled out) of the reinforcing cord member, the reinforcing cord member is preferably covered by a resin material over 20% or more of the surface thereof, and more preferably 50% or more of the surface thereof. Also, the content of the resin material in the reinforcing cord layer is preferably 20 mass % or more, and more preferably 50 mass % or more, relative to the total amount of the materials that constitute the reinforcing cord layer excluding the reinforcing cord, from the viewpoint of increasing the pull-out properties of the reinforcing cords.","In order to configure the reinforcing cord layer to include a resin material, for example, the reinforcing cord layer can be formed in a configuration such that when viewed from a cross-section of the tire frame along the axial direction, at least a portion of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame that is formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer of the outer circumference of the tire frame in which the reinforcing cord member is embedded corresponds to the resin material as a component of the reinforcing cord layer, and the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer forming the tire frame and the reinforcing cord member constitute the reinforcing cord layer. Furthermore, in order to configure the reinforcing cord layer to include a resin material, a coated cord member obtained by coating a reinforcing cord with a resin material of the same kind as or different from the resin material that forms the tire frame, may be wound in the circumferential direction of the tire frame. The \u201csame kind\u201d as used for resin material means a situation in which both are ester-based resin materials, or both are styrene-based resin materials, or the like.","(10-3) The tire of the tenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the mass ratio (x:y) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x) and the polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer (y) in the thermoplastic resin is 95:5 to 50:50. As such, when the mass ratio (x:y) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x) and the polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer (y) is set to 95:5 to 50:50, durability of the tire is further enhanced, and a tire which is not easily deformed by temperature change can be obtained.","(10-4) The tire of the tenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the total content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material is 50 mass % to 100 mass %. By employing the configuration described above, the performance that can be exhibited by a combination of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer can be further enhanced.","The tire of the tenth aspect of the present invention can be produced by a production method which includes a tire frame piece forming step of forming a tire frame piece for constituting a portion of a circular tire frame using a thermoplastic resin material including at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer; a tire frame piece bonding step of forming the tire frame by fusing two or more of the tire frame pieces that make a pair, by applying heat to the bonding surface of the tire frame piece; and a reinforcing cord member winding step of winding a reinforcing cord member around the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction, and forming a reinforcing cord layer.","In the production method described above, a tire frame piece of a circular tire frame can be formed using a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer. The polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer included in the thermoplastic resin material can have the melting point set to about 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., and the polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer can have the melting point set to about 100\u00b0 C. to 260\u00b0 C. Therefore, for example, it is not necessary to carry out the tire frame piece bonding step at or above 300\u00b0 C., and the bonding step can be carried out at a relatively low temperature.","Therefore, deterioration of the resin can be prevented, and deformation of the tire frame piece can be suppressed. Accordingly, the product yield can be increased, and productivity of the tire can be increased.","Furthermore, tire frame pieces that a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer are bonded to form a tire frame, the adhesive strength between the tire frame pieces is sufficient, and the performance of the frame itself is not deteriorated by the temperature at the time of bonding. Therefore, durability at the time of driving such as the resistance to puncture or heat resistance of the tire thus produced can be enhanced.","The means for solving the problem of the eleventh aspect is as follows.","(11-1) The tire of the eleventh aspect of the present invention is a tire including at least a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material, in which the thermoplastic resin material includes a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and at least one copolymer selected from an olefin-(meth)acrylate copolymer or a metal crosslinked product (ionomer) of an olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer.","Here, the \u201cthermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention described above.","Also, the \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention described above.","The resin in the eleventh aspect of the present invention means a resin having a thermoplastic resin (including thermoplastic elastomers) or a thermosetting resin, and does not encompass conventional vulcanized rubbers such as natural rubber or synthetic rubbers.

In this regard, when a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a specific copolymer are used in combination, the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material can be easily adjusted by adjusting the content ratio of the two components, compared to the case of using a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer alone.","Furthermore, in order to cause the thermoplastic resin material to have yield strength, it can be considered to use a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an olefin-based resin such as polyethylene in mixture (blend). However, since the olefin-based resin (for example, polyethylene) does not have a polar group, even if the olefin-based resin is blended with the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the affinity is poor. Thus, by copolymerizing a polyolefin with a monomer having a polar group, and thus introducing a polar group into the molecule, the polyolefin-based resin can be made to have affinity with a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. As such, when a polyolefin is copolymerized with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid as a monomer having a polar group, the affinity of the copolymer thus obtained and a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is improved, but there have been cases in which the yield strength of the thermoplastic resin material including the copolymer and the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer depends on temperature.","In this regard, when a monomer obtained by esterifying or metal-ionizing acrylic acid or methacrylic acid is used instead of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, and a copolymer of the monomer obtained by esterifying or metal-ionizing acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with polyethylene is used as a copolymer that is used in combination with a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the impact resistance of the thermoplastic resin material including the copolymer and the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can be increased, and temperature dependency of the yield strength can be suppressed.","(11-2) The tire of the eleventh aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the mass ratio (x:y) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x) and the specific copolymer (y) is 95:5 to 50:50.","When the content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material is in the range described above, the performance of the thermoplastic resin material can be sufficiently exhibited, and the tensile characteristics such as tensile elasticity and breaking strength as the tire performance can be enhanced.","(11-3) The tire of the eleventh aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the total content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the specific copolymer in the thermoplastic resin material is 50 mass % to 100 mass %.","When the total content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the specific copolymer in the thermoplastic resin material is in the range described above, the performance of the thermoplastic resin material can be sufficiently exhibited, and the tensile characteristics such as tensile elasticity and breaking strength as the tire performance can be further enhanced.","(11-4) It can be configured such that the olefin-(meth)acrylate copolymer is an ethylene-(meth)acrylate copolymer.","When the olefin-(meth)acrylate copolymer is an ethylene-(meth)acrylate copolymer, flexibility of the thermoplastic resin material can be further enhanced, and impact resistance as the tire performance can be further enhanced.","(11-5) It can be configured such that the metal crosslinked product of the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer is a metal crosslinked product of an ethylene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer.","When the metal crosslinked product of the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer is a metal crosslinked product of an ethylene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer, flexibility of the thermoplastic resin material can be further enhanced, and impact resistance as the tire performance can be further enhanced.","Furthermore, the tire of the eleventh aspect of the present invention may include a reinforcing cord member that is wound around the outer circumference of a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material to form a reinforcing cord member layer, in addition to a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","When the reinforcing cord member is wound around the outer circumference of the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material to form a reinforcing cord member layer, the resistance to puncture and resistance to cutting of the tire and the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire (tire frame) are enhanced.

In this regard, when at least three components of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the specific copolymer and the specific acid-modified copolymer are used in combination, the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material can be easily adjusted by adjusting the content ratio of the three components, and the state of fracture when stretched can be improved, as compared with the case of using a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer alone.","(12-2) The tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the mass ratio (x:y+z) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x), the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer (specific copolymer; y) and the acid-modified copolymer (specific acid-modified copolymer; z) is 95:5 to 50:50.","When the mass ratio of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer and the acid-modified copolymer in the thermoplastic resin material is in the range described above, the performance of the thermoplastic resin material can be sufficiently exhibited, and the tensile characteristics such as tensile elasticity and breaking strength as the tire performance can be enhanced.","In addition, the tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the mass ratio (y:z) of the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer (specific copolymer; y) and the acid-modified copolymer (specific acid-modified copolymer; z) is 95:5 to 20:80.","When the mass ratio of the specific copolymer and the specific acid-modified copolymer in the thermoplastic resin material is in the range described above, the performance of the thermoplastic resin material can be sufficiently exhibited, and the tensile characteristics such as tensile elasticity and breaking strength as the tire performance can be enhanced.","(12-3) The tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the total content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer (specific copolymer) and the acid-modified copolymer (specific acid-modified copolymer) in the thermoplastic resin material is 50 mass % to 100 mass %.","When the total content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the specific copolymer, and the specific acid-modified copolymer in the thermoplastic elastomer is in the range described above, the performance of the thermoplastic resin material can be sufficiently exhibited, and the tensile characteristics such as tensile elasticity and breaking strength as the tire performance can be further enhanced.","Furthermore, the tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention may include a reinforcing cord member that is wound around the outer circumference of a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material to form a reinforcing cord layer, in addition to the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","When the reinforcing cord member is wound around the outer circumference of a tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material to form a reinforcing cord member layer, the resistance to puncture and resistance to cutting of the tire, and the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire (tire frame) are enhanced. In addition, when the rigidity in the circumferential direction is enhanced, creeping (a phenomenon in which plastic deformation of the tire frame increases with time under a constant stress) in the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic material is suppressed.","(12-4) The tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer is an ethylene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer, and the acid-modified copolymer is an acid-modified copolymer obtained by acid-modifying an ethylene-(meth)acrylate copolymer.","When the configuration described above is employed, the performance of the thermoplastic resin material can be sufficiently exhibited, and the tensile characteristics such as tensile elasticity and breaking strength as the tire performance can be enhanced.","(12-5) The method for producing a tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention includes at least a tire frame piece forming step of forming a tire frame piece for constituting a portion of a circular tire frame using a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, an olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer, and an acid-modified copolymer obtained by acid-modifying an olefin-(meth)acrylate copolymer; and a tire frame piece bonding step of forming a tire frame by fusing two or more of the tire frame pieces, which make a pair, by applying heat to the bonding surface of the tire frame piece.","In the method for producing a tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention, a tire frame piece of the circular tire frame is formed using a thermoplastic resin material. Since the thermoplastic resin material according to the twelfth aspect of the present invention includes the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the specific copolymer, and the specific acid-modified copolymer, the resin material exhibits excellent fluidity. Therefore, injection molding using the thermoplastic resin material can be easily carried out. Therefore, productivity of the tire can be enhanced.","This is thought to be because of the following.","Due to the acid group carried by the specific acid-modified copolymer, the miscibility between the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the specific copolymer is increased, so that when the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is formed into a sea phase, and the specific copolymer is formed into an island phase, the sea-island structure can be easily formed. It is thought that in such a sea-island structure, the specific acid-modified copolymer is present in the interface between the island phase and the sea phase and thus increases the affinity between the sea phase and the island phase. When the affinity between the sea phase and the island phase increases, the thermoplastic resin material has increased viscosity; however, when the thermoplastic resin material includes the specific copolymer, the affinity can be adjusted, and excellent fluidity is obtained. Therefore, it is thought that injection molding can be easily carried out.","(12-6) The method for producing a tire of the twelfth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the olefin-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer is an ethylene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer, and the acid-modified copolymer is an acid-modified copolymer obtained by acid-modifying an ethylene-(meth)acrylate copolymer.","When the configuration described above is employed, the performance of the thermoplastic resin material can be sufficiently exhibited, and a tire having excellent tensile characteristics such as tensile elasticity and breaking strength as the tire performance can be produced.","The means for solving the problem of the thirteenth aspect is as follows.","(13-1) The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention is a tire including at least a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material, in which the tire includes a reinforcing cord member that forms a reinforcing cord layer on the outer circumference of the tire frame, and the thermoplastic resin material includes at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber.","The reinforcing cord layer may be wound around the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction, or may be wound around the outer circumference in a crossing manner.","The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention includes a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber.","Here, the \u201cthermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention described above.","The \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d has the same definition as that used in the first aspect of the present invention described above.","A \u201crubber\u201d is a polymer compound having elasticity, but in the thirteenth aspect of the present invention, the rubber is distinguished from the thermoplastic elastomer described above.","In the thermoplastic elastomer, a hard segment which is crystalline and has a high melting point behaves as a pseudo-crosslinking point, and elasticity is exhibited. On the other hand, the rubber has, for example, double bonds in the molecular chain, and produces a three-dimensional network structure when crosslinked by added sulfur or the like (vulcanized), thereby exhibiting elasticity. Therefore, when a thermoplastic elastomer is heated, the hard segment melts, and when a thermoplastic elastomer is cooled, the hard segment reproduces pseudo-crosslinking points again. Thus, recycling is enabled. On the other hand, a rubber produces a three-dimensional structure when crosslinked (vulcanized) and loses fluidity, so that recycling is difficult even if heated. However, a rubber that is not crosslinked behaves like a thermoplastic elastomer.","The thermoplastic resin in the thirteenth aspect of the present invention a means a resin having thermoplasticity, and does not encompass conventional vulcanized rubbers such as natural rubber or synthetic rubbers. However, the \u201cthermoplastic resin material\u201d in the thirteenth aspect of the present invention means a material including at least a thermoplastic resin, and encompasses a material including a rubber in addition to a thermoplastic resin.","The thermoplastic resin material according to the thirteenth aspect of the invention is flexible and has excellent impact resistance. The thermoplastic resin material is also excellent in tensile characteristics such as tensile modulus of elasticity and tensile strength. Therefore, when a tire frame is formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the durability and manufacturability of the tire become excellent. Furthermore, since the structure can be simplified, there is an advantage that weight reduction can be expected.","On the other hand, in the case of using a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer alone, when an attempt is made to adjust the elastic modulus, it is necessary to control the ratio of the hard segment and the soft segment. In this regard, when a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber are used in combination, the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material can be easily adjusted by adjusting the content ratio of the two components, compared to the case of using a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer alone.","Since the rolling resistance of a tire is caused by vibration at approximately 10 Hz to 100 Hz at near 50\u00b0 C., for measuring the viscoelasticity of the tire, the magnitude of the rolling resistance can be expressed by tan \u03b4 at 30\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. When the tan \u03b4 value at 30\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. is small, the rolling resistance of the tire also tends to become small.","Here, in the case of using a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer alone, when the dynamic viscoelasticity is measured, a peak of tan \u03b4 originating from the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can be seen, and as the elastic modulus of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer increases, the peak value tends to shift to the higher temperature side. For example, when the dynamic viscoelasticity of UBESTA XPA9055X1 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. is measured, a peak is detected at near 10\u00b0 C.","On the other hand, when the dynamic viscoelasticity of a rubber is measured, a peak is generally detected at \u221210\u00b0 C. or lower. Therefore, when a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber are mixed, the peak height originating from the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is decreased depending on the mixing proportions, and the peak height originating from the rubber increases. However, since the peak position of the rubber is \u221210\u00b0 C. or lower, the influence on the tan \u03b4 value at 30\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. is reduced, and therefore, the tan \u03b4 value is decreased as a whole.","In an embodiment of the tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention, a reinforcing cord member is wound around the outer circumference of the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber, to form a reinforcing cord layer. When a reinforcing cord layer is formed around the outer circumference of the tire frame, the resistance to puncture and resistance to cutting of the tire, and the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire (tire frame) are enhanced. Meanwhile, when the rigidity in the circumferential direction is increased, creeping (a phenomenon in which plastic deformation of the tire frame increases with time under a constant stress) in the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic material is suppressed.","Furthermore, a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can easily penetrate not only between the fibers of the reinforcing cord member itself, but also between twisted cords in the case where the reinforcing cord member has a twisted-fiber structure, due to the low melt viscosity of the elastomer. Accordingly, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness to reinforcing cord member, and has excellent fixing performance such as welding strength. Also, when the reinforcing cord member is an organic fiber, since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer that forms the tire frame can be welded to the reinforcing cord member, high welding properties and excellent fixing performance are obtained. Further, since a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer exhibits excellent elongation, the fracture properties are excellent. Therefore, when a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer is used, for example, the phenomenon in which air remains in the surroundings of the reinforcing cord members in the reinforcing cord winding step (incorporation of air) can be suppressed. If the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness and welding properties to the reinforcing cords, and incorporation of air into the surroundings of the reinforcing cord members is suppressed, the movement of the reinforcing cord member due to, for example, a force applied during driving can be effectively suppressed. Thereby, for example, even in the case where a tire-constituting member is provided so as to cover the entirety of the reinforcing cord member in the outer circumference of the tire frame, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, detachment or the like between these members (including the tire frame) is prevented from occurring, and durability of the tire is enhanced.","(13-2) The thermoplastic resin material may further include a thermoplastic elastomer that has good affinity with the rubber. Particularly, when the thermoplastic resin material includes an acid modification product as the thermoplastic elastomer having good affinity with the rubber, the rubber can be finely dispersed in the thermoplastic resin material. Furthermore, it is speculated that the tensile strength is enhanced by the interaction between the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the acid-modified sites, and even if fractured, the resin material undergoes ductile fracture, so that brittle fracture or lamellar fracture does not easily occur.","The phrase \u201chaving good affinity with rubber\u201d implies that when a thermoplastic elastomer is mixed with a rubber, the molecular skeleton of the rubber and the molecular skeleton of the thermoplastic elastomer are similar, and the rubber is in a state of being incorporated into the dispersed particles of the thermoplastic elastomer, or the thermoplastic elastomer is in a state of being incorporated into the dispersed particles of the rubber.","However, not all of the thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber in the thermoplastic resin material need to be in the state described above, and the thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber in the thermoplastic resin material may be partially in the state described above.","(13-3) The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material. As such, when a resin material is contained in the reinforcing cord layer, the difference in hardness between the tire and the reinforcing cord layer can be decreased as compared to the case of fixing the reinforcing cord member with a cushion rubber, and therefore, the reinforcing cord member can be adhered and fixed to the tire frame further. Thereby, the incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord at the time of driving can be effectively suppressed. Here, the \u201cresin material\u201d in the thirteenth aspect of the present invention is a material including at least a resin, and this material may also include not only a resin, but also a rubber or an inorganic compound. Meanwhile, the \u201cresin\u201d is a concept which encompasses a thermoplastic resin (including a thermoplastic elastomer) and a thermosetting resin, and does not encompass a rubber (including a vulcanized rubber) or an inorganic compound.","When the reinforcing cord layer contains a resin material, from the viewpoint of increasing the pull-out properties (difficulty to be pulled out) of the reinforcing cord, the reinforcing cord is preferably covered by a resin material over 20% or more of the surface, and more preferably 50% or more of the surface. Also, the content of the resin material in the reinforcing cord layer is preferably 20 mass % or more, and more preferably 50 mass % or more, relative to the total amount of the materials that constitute the reinforcing cord layer excluding the reinforcing cords, from the viewpoint of increasing the pull-out properties of the reinforcing cords.","In order to configure the reinforcing cord layer to include a resin material, for example, the reinforcing cord layer can be formed in a configuration such that when viewed from a cross-section of the tire frame along the axial direction, at least a portion of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame that is formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber of the outer circumference of the tire frame in which the reinforcing cord member is embedded corresponds to the resin material that constitutes the reinforcing cord layer, and the thermoplastic resin material forming the tire frame and the reinforcing cord member constitute the reinforcing cord layer. Furthermore, in order to configure the reinforcing cord layer to include a resin material, a coated cord member obtained by coating a reinforcing cord with a resin material of the same kind as or different from the resin material that forms the tire frame, may be wound in the circumferential direction of the tire frame. The \u201csame kind\u201d as used for resin material means a situation in which both are ester-based resin materials, or both are styrene-based resin materials, or the like.","(13-4) The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the mass ratio (x:y) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x) and the rubber (y) in the thermoplastic resin material is 95:5 to 50:50. As such, when the mass ratio (x:y) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x) and the rubber (y) is adjusted to 95:5 to 50:50, the performance that can be exhibited by the combination of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber can be further enhanced.","However, when the thermoplastic resin material includes a thermoplastic elastomer other than a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the tire can be configured such that the mass ratio (x:y\u2032) between the total (y\u2032) of the rubber and the thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x) is 95:5 to 50:50.","(13-5) The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the mass ratio (x:y+z) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x), the rubber (y) and the thermoplastic elastomer having good affinity with the rubber (z) in the thermoplastic resin material is 95:5 to 50:50. As such, when the mass ratio (x:y+z) of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (x), the rubber (y) and the thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (z) is adjusted to 95:5 to 50:50, the performance that can be exhibited by the combination of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber can be further enhanced.","(13-6) The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the total content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber in the thermoplastic resin material is 50 mass % to 100 mass %. When the configuration described above is employed, the performance that can be exhibited by the combination of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber can be further enhanced.","However, when the thermoplastic resin material includes a thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the tire can be configured such that the total amount of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the rubber, and the thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is 50 mass % to 100 mass %.","(13-7) The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the present invention can be configured such that the total content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the rubber, and the thermoplastic elastomer having good affinity with the rubber in the thermoplastic resin material is 50 mass % to 100 mass %.

For example, in a case in which a frame of a tire is formed by fusion of divided bodies (frame pieces) thereof, the heating temperature for the bonding section can be set to be equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire frame, by using a thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer having a melting point of 120 to 250\u00b0 C. as described above. Since a thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used in the tire of the first aspect of the invention, the bonding strength between the tire frame pieces is sufficient even in the case of a frame fused in the temperature range of 120\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. Therefore, the tire of the first aspect of the invention has excellent durability at the time of driving, such as puncture resistance and abrasion resistance. Further, the heating temperature is preferably a temperature that is 10\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C. higher, and more preferably 10\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. higher, than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer for forming the tire frame pieces.","Furthermore, in the first aspect of the invention, the content ratio of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material is not particularly limited, and is preferably 50 to 100% by mass or more, and more preferably 90 to 100% by mass, with respect to the total amount of the thermoplastic resin material. When the content ratio of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is 50% by mass to 100% by mass with respect to the total amount of the thermoplastic resin material, the characteristics of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can sufficiently be exerted, and the durability or productivity of the tire can be improved. The thermoplastic resin material may contain, if desired, rubber, other thermoplastic elastomers, thermoplastic resins, various fillers (for example, silica, calcium carbonate, and clay), and various additives such as anti-aging agents, oils, plasticizers, colorants, weather resistant agents, and reinforcing agents.","In the first aspect of the invention, the thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has a tensile modulus of elasticity (hereinafter, \u201celastic modulus\u201d in this specification means a tensile modulus of elasticity unless specifically indicated otherwise) as defined in JIS K7113:1995 of preferably 100 MPa to 1000 MPa, more preferably 100 MPa to 800 MPa, and still more preferably 100 MPa to 700 MPa. When the tensile modulus of elasticity of the thermoplastic resin material is 100 to 1000 MPa, fitting onto a rim can be carried out efficiently while maintaining the shape of the frame of the tire.","In the first aspect of the invention, the thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer preferably has a tensile yield strength as defined in JIS K7113:1995 of equal to or higher than 5 MPa, more preferably 5 MPa to 20 MPa, and still more preferably 5 MPa to 17 MPa. When the tensile yield strength of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or higher than 5 MPa, resistance to deformation caused by a load applied to a tire during traveling or the like can be achieved.","In the first aspect of the invention, the thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer preferably has a tensile yield elongation as defined in JIS K7113:1995 of equal to or higher than 10%, more preferably 10% to 70%, and still more preferably 15% to 60%. When the tensile yield elongation of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or higher than 10%, the elastic region is large, and the fittability onto a rim is improved.","In the first aspect of the invention, the thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer preferably has a tensile elongation at break as defined in JIS K7113:1995 of equal to or higher than 50%, more preferably equal to or higher than 100%, still more preferably equal to or higher than 150%, and particularly preferably equal to or higher than 200%. When the tensile elongation at break of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or higher than 50%, fittability onto a rim is excellent, and resistance to breaking at collision can be obtained.","In the first aspect of the invention, the thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer preferably has a deflection temperature under load (under a load of 0.45 MPa) as defined in ISO 75-2 or ASTM D648 of equal to or higher than 50\u00b0 C., more preferably 50\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C., and still more preferably 50\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C. When the deflection temperature under load of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or higher than 50\u00b0 C., deformation of a tire frame can be suppressed even in cases in which vulcanization is performed during the production of a tire.","[Resin Material as Component of Reinforcing Cord Layer]","The tire according to the first aspect of the invention may be configured to include a resin material in the reinforcing cord layer. When a resin material is included in the reinforcing cord layer as described above, a difference in hardness between the tire and the reinforcing cord layer can be decreased, and, therefore, the reinforcing cord member can be more tightly adhered and fixed to the tire frame, compared with a case in which the reinforcing cord member is fixed using a cushion rubber. The concept of a simple expression \u201cresin\u201d, such as that described above, encompasses thermoplastic resins (including thermoplastic elastomers) as well as thermosetting resins, but does not encompass vulcanized rubbers.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord member is a steel cord, and in which an attempt is made to separate the reinforcing cord member from the cushion rubber at the time of disposal of the tire, vulcanized rubbers are difficult to separate from the reinforcing cord member only by heating; in contrast, resin materials can be separated from the reinforcing cord member only by heating, which is advantageous in terms of recyclability of the tire. Resin materials usually have a loss factor (tan \u03b4) lower than that of vulcanized rubbers. Accordingly, when the reinforcing cord layer contains a large amount of resin material, the rolling properties of the tire can be enhanced. Resin materials, having a higher elastic modulus relative to vulcanized rubbers, are advantageous in that the resin materials have high in-plane shear stiffness, and also provide excellent steering stability and excellent abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire.","Examples of the thermosetting resin which may be used in the reinforcing cord layer include phenol resins, urea resins, melamine resins, epoxy resins, polyamide resins, polyester resins, etc.","Examples of the thermoplastic resin include urethane resins, olefin resins, vinyl chloride resins, polyamide resins, and polyester resins.","Examples of the thermoplastic elastomer include amide-based thermoplastic elastomers (TPA), polyester-based thermoplastic elastomers (TPC), polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomers (TPO), polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomers (TPS), polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomers (TPU), thermoplastic cross-linked rubbers (TPV), and other thermoplastic elastomers (TPZ), which are defined in JIS K6418:2007. It is preferable to use a thermoplastic elastomer, in consideration of elasticity necessary for traveling and moldability for production.","The \u201csame kind\u201d as used for resin material means a situation in which both are ester-based resin materials, or both are styrene-based resin materials, or the like.","The elastic modulus (the tensile modulus of elasticity defined in JIS K7113:1995) of the resin material used in the reinforcing cord layer is preferably set to be within a range of 0.1 times to 10 times the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin that forms the tire frame. When the elastic modulus of the resin material is equal to or lower than 10 times the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire frame, the crown portion is not excessively rigid, and the fittability onto a rim is facilitated. When the elastic modulus of the resin material is equal to or higher than 0.1 times the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire frame, the resin as a component of the reinforcing cord layer is not excessively soft, the belt in-plane shear stiffness is excellent, and cornering force is improved.","When a resin material is contained in the reinforcing cord layer, it is preferable that 20% or more of the surface of the reinforcing cord member is covered with the resin material, and it is more preferable that 50% or more of the surface of the reinforcing cord member is covered with the resin material, from the viewpoint of improving the drawing properties (resistance to drawing) of the reinforcing cord. From the viewpoint of improving the drawing properties of the reinforcing cord, the content of the resin material in the reinforcing cord layer is preferably equal to or higher than 20 wt %, and more preferably equal to or higher than 50 wt %, with respect to the total content of the materials, other than the reinforcing cord, that constitute the reinforcing cord layer.","A tire according to Embodiment 1-1 of the tire of the first aspect of the invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.","A tire  according to this embodiment will be described below.  is a perspective view illustrating a cross-section of a part of a tire according to one embodiment of the invention.  is a cross-sectional view of a bead portion fitted to a rim. As shown in , the tire  according to this embodiment has substantially the same cross-sectional shape as those of conventional general rubber pneumatic tires.","As shown in , the tire  includes a tire case  composed of: a pair of bead portions  each contacting with a bead seat  and a rim flange  of a rim  shown in ; side portions  that extend from the bead portions  toward the outer side in the tire radial direction; and a crown portion  (outer peripheral portion) that connect the outer end in the tire radial direction of one side portion  and the outer end in the tire radial direction of the other side portion .","The tire case  according to the present embodiment is formed of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd., melting point: 162\u00b0 C.). Although the tire case  according to the present embodiment is formed of a single thermoplastic resin material (a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer), the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics may be used for the respective portions of the tire case  (such as the side portions , the crown portion , and the bead portions ), similarly to conventional general rubber pneumatic tires. A reinforcing material (such as fiber, cord, unwoven fabric, and woven fabric which are formed of a polymer material or a metal) may be disposed to be embedded in the tire case  (such as in the bead portions , in the side portions , or in the crown portion ) so as to reinforce the tire case  with the reinforcing material.","The tire case  according to the present embodiment is formed by bonding a pair of tire case half parts (tire frame pieces) A formed of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer to each other. The tire case half parts A is formed by placing circular tire case half parts A that have the same shape and that are obtained by molding one bead portion , one side portion , and a half-width of the crown portion  as an integral body by injection molding or the like, to face each other, and bonding the half parts to each other at the tire equatorial plane portion. The tire case  is not limited to that obtained by bonding two members, and may be formed by bonding three or more members.","Each tire case half part A formed of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer can be molded by, for example, vacuum molding, pressure molding, injection molding, or melt casting. Accordingly, when compared with a conventional case in which the tire case is molded from rubber, it is not necessary to perform vulcanization, as a result of which the production process can remarkably be simplified, and the molding time can be saved.","In the present embodiment, the tire case half parts A have a symmetric shape, that is, one tire case half part A and the other tire case half part A have the same shape; therefore, there is an advantage in that the tire case half parts A can be molded using only one type of mold.","In the present embodiment, as shown in , an annular bead core  formed of a steel cord is embedded in each bead portion , similarly to conventional general pneumatic tire. However, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; the bead core  may be omitted as long as the rigidity of the bead portions  is ensured and there is no problem in fitting to the rim . Other than the steel cord, the bead core may be formed of an organic fiber cord, a resin-coated organic fiber cord, a hard resin, or the like.","In the present embodiment, an annular sealing layer  formed of a material having higher sealing properties than those of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer constituting the tire case , for example rubber, is provided on a part of the bead portion  that contacts the rim  or at least on a part of the bead portion  that contacts the rim flange  of the rim . The sealing layer  may also be provided in a part in which the tire case  (the bead portion ) and the bead seat  contact each other. A material softer than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer that constitutes the tire case  may be used as the material having higher sealing properties than those of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer that constitutes the tire case . It is preferable to use, as a rubber usable for the sealing layer , the same kind of rubber as a rubber used on the outer surface of a bead portion of a conventional general rubber pneumatic tire. When the sealing between the bead portion  and the rim  can be ensured only with the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the rubber sealing layer  may be omitted, or other thermoplastic resins (thermoplastic elastomers) having higher sealing properties than those of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer may be used. Examples of other thermoplastic resins include resins such as a polyurethane-based resin, a polyolefin-based resin, a polystyrene-based resin, and a polyester resin, and a blend of any of these resins with a rubber or an elastomer. Thermoplastic elastomers can also be used, and examples thereof include a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomer, and a polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomer, and any combination of these elastomers and a blend of any of these elastomers with a rubber.","As shown in , in the crown portion , a reinforcing cord  having higher rigidity than that of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer constituting the tire case  is wound in the circumferential direction of the tire case . The reinforcing cord  is helically wound to form a reinforcing cord layer  in a state in which at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the crown portion  in a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of the tire case . A tread  formed of a material, such as rubber, having higher abrasion resistance than that of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer constituting the tire case  is disposed on the outer circumference side in the tire radial direction of the reinforcing cord layer .","The reinforcing cord layer  formed by the reinforcing cord  will be described below with reference to .  is a cross-sectional view taken along the tire rotation axis, which illustrates a state in which the reinforcing cord is embedded in the crown portion of the tire case of the tire according to Embodiment 1-1. As shown in , the reinforcing cord  is helically wound in a state in which at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the crown portion  in a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of the tire case , and, together with a part of the outer circumferential portion of the tire case , forms the reinforcing cord layer  specified by the dotted lines in . The part of the reinforcing cord  that is embedded in the crown portion  is in close contact with the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer constituting the crown portion  (the tire case ). A monofilament (single filament) of a metal fiber, an organic fiber, or the like, or a multifilament (stranded filament) in which fibers are stranded, such as a steel cord composed of steel fibers, may be used as the reinforcing cord . In the present embodiment, a steel cord is used as the reinforcing cord .","The embedding depth L in  represents the depth of embedding of the reinforcing cord  in the tire case  (the crown portion ) in the tire rotation axis direction. The depth of embedding L of the reinforcing cord  in the crown portion  is preferably equal to or greater than \u2155 of the diameter D of the reinforcing cord , and more preferably more than \u00bd of the diameter D of the reinforcing cord . It is most preferable that the entire reinforcing cord  be embedded in the crown portion . When the depth of embedding L of the reinforcing cord  is more than \u00bd of the diameter D of the reinforcing cord , the reinforcing cord  is difficult to drop off from the embedded portion due to the dimensions of the reinforcing cord . When the reinforcing cord  is entirely embedded in the crown portion , the surface (the outer circumferential surface) becomes flat, whereby entry of air into an area around the reinforcing cord can be suppressed even when a member is placed on the crown portion  in which the reinforcing cord  is embedded. The reinforcing cord layer  corresponds to a belt disposed on the outer circumferential surface of a carcass of a conventional rubber pneumatic tire.","As described above, the tread  is disposed on the outer circumferential side in the tire radial direction of the reinforcing cord layer . It is preferable that the same kind of rubber as that used for conventional rubber pneumatic tires is used as the rubber used for the tread . It is also possible to use, instead of the tread , a tread formed of another kind of thermoplastic resin material which has higher abrasion resistance than that of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer constituting the tire case . In the tread , a tread pattern composed of plural grooves is formed on the contact surface that comes into contact with a road surface, similarly to conventional rubber pneumatic tires.","A method of producing a tire of the first aspect of the invention will be described below.","(Tire Case Forming Step)","First, tire case half parts supported by thin metal support rings are arranged to face each other. Subsequently, a mold for bonding, which is not shown in the drawings, is placed so as to contact the outer circumferential surface of a portion at which the tire case half parts are contacted with each other. Here, the mold for bonding is configured to pressurize a region at or around the bonding section (the contact portion) of the tire case half parts A with a predetermined pressure. Then, the region at or around the bonding section of the tire case half parts is pressurized at a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material that constitutes the tire case. When the bonding section of the tire case half parts is heated and pressurized by the mold for bonding, the bonding section is melted, and the tire case half parts are fused with each other, as a result of which the members are integrated to form the tire case . Although the bonding section of the tire case half parts is heated using the mold for bonding in the present embodiment, the invention according to the first aspect is not limited to this configuration; heating of the bonding section may be carried out using, for example, a separately-provided high-frequency heater, or the tire case half parts may be bonded by softening or melting the bonding section, in advance, via application of hot air, irradiation of infrared rays or the like, and pressurizing the bonding section using the mold for bonding.","(Reinforcing Cord Member Winding Step)","Next, a reinforcing cord winding step will be described below using .  is an explanatory diagram explaining an operation of embedding the reinforcing cord in the crown portion of the tire case using a cord heating device and rollers. In , a cord feeding apparatus  includes a reel  on which a reinforcing cord  is wound, a cord heating device  disposed at the downstream side in the cord feeding direction of the reel , a first roller  disposed at the downstream side in the reinforcing cord  feeding direction, a first cylinder unit  for moving the first roller  in directions in which the first roller comes into contact with and get away from the outer circumferential surface of the tire, a second roller  disposed at the downstream side in the reinforcing cord  feeding direction of the first roller , and a second cylinder unit  for moving the second roller  in directions in which the first roller comes into contact with and get away from the outer circumferential surface of the tire. The second roller  can be used as a cooling roller formed of metal. In the present embodiment, the surface of the first roller  or the second roller  is coated with a fluororesin (TEFLON (registered trademark) in the case of the present embodiment) with a view to suppressing adhesion of the melted or softened polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. Although the cord feeding apparatus  is configured to have two rollers of the first roller  and the second roller  in the present embodiment, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the cord feeding apparatus may be configured to have only one of these rollers (that is, a single roller).","The cord heating device  includes a heater  and a fan  that generate hot air. The cord heating device  includes a heating box  into which hot air is supplied and in which the reinforcing cord  passes through the inside space thereof, and an discharge port  through which the heated reinforcing cord  is discharged.","In this step, first, the temperature of the heater  of the cord heating device  is increased, and the air around the heater  heated by the heater  is sent to the heating box  by an air current generated by the rotation of the fan . Then, the reinforcing cord  drawn out from the reel  is fed to the inside of the heating box  of which the inner space is heated with hot air, whereby the reinforcing cord  is heated (for example, to increase the temperature of the reinforcing cord  to be about 100\u00b0 C. to about 200\u00b0 C.). The heated reinforcing cord  passes through the discharge port , and is helically wound, with a constant tension, around the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  rotating in the direction of arrow R in . Here, as a result of the heated reinforcing cord  coming into contact with the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer at the contact portion is melted or softened, and at least a part of the heated reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . In this process, since the heated reinforcing cord  is embedded in the melted or softened polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the reinforcing cord  get into a state in which no space is left between the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the reinforcing cord , that is, in a tightly-contacted state. Accordingly, the incorporation of air into the portion in which the reinforcing cord  is embedded is suppressed. By heating the reinforcing cord  to a temperature higher than the melting point of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer of the tire case , the melting or softening of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the portion contacting the reinforcing cord  is promoted. By employing this configuration, embedding of the reinforcing cord  in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  is facilitated, and the incorporation of air can effectively be suppressed.","The depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  can be adjusted by the heating temperature for the reinforcing cord , the tension applied to the reinforcing cord , the pressure applied from the first roller , etc. In the present embodiment, the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is set to be equal to or greater than \u2155 of the diameter D of the reinforcing cord . The depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is more preferably more than \u00bd of the diameter D, and it is still more preferable that the entire reinforcing cord  is embedded.","In this way, a reinforcing cord layer  is formed on the outer circumference side of the crown portion  of the tire case  by winding the heated reinforcing cord  on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  such that the heated reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion .","A belt-shaped vulcanized tread  is wound on the outer circumferential surface of the tire case  for one revolution, and the tread  is bonded to the outer circumferential surface of the tire case  using, for example, an adhesive. For example, precured treads known thus far for use in retreaded tires may be used as the tread . This step is a step similar to a step of bonding a precured tread to the outer circumferential surface of a casing of a retreaded tire.","A tire  can be completed by bonding a sealing layer  formed of a vulcanized rubber to the bead portion  of the tire case  using, for example, an adhesive.","(Effects)","In the tire  according to the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the tire  has excellent heat resistance, excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, excellent tensile strength, and excellent fracture strain. In addition, since the tire  has a structure simpler than those of conventional rubber tires, the weight thereof is small. Therefore, the tire  according to the present embodiment has excellent abrasion resistance and durability. Further, since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer constituting the tire case  has a melting point of 162\u00b0 C., bonding of the tire case half parts A can sufficiently be carried out at a temperature of, for example, 250\u00b0 C. or lower; therefore, energy consumption can be reduced, and the cost incurred for heating can be reduced.","The polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness to the reinforcing cord , and has excellent fixing performance such as welding strength. Therefore, a phenomenon (incorporation of air) in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  can be suppressed in the reinforcing cord winding step. The high adhesiveness and weldability to the reinforcing cord  and suppression of incorporation of air into a region around the reinforcing cord member effectively suppress movement of the reinforcing cord  at the time a force is applied during traveling. Accordingly, for example, even in a case in which tire-constituting members are disposed on the outer circumference of the tire frame so as to cover the entire reinforcing cord member, the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, whereby separation between the members (including the tire frame), for example, is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In the tire  according to the present embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having higher rigidity than that of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is helically wound on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material in the circumferential direction, puncture resistance, cutting resistance, and rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  are improved. The improved rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  prevents creeping of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","In a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of the tire case  (the cross-section shown in ), at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and is in close contact with the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, as a result of which incorporation of air during production is suppressed, and movement of the reinforcing cord  due to, for example, a force applied at the time of traveling is suppressed. Accordingly, separation between the reinforcing cord , the tire case , and the tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","As shown in , since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is set to be equal to or greater than \u2155 of the diameter D thereof, incorporation of air during production is effectively suppressed, and movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied at the time of traveling is further suppressed.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer as described above, the reinforcing cord  can be made to more tightly contact the tire case  and fixed to the tire case  since the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  can be made smaller than that in a case in which the reinforcing cord  is fixed using a cushion rubber. Accordingly, the incorporation of air mentioned above can effectively be prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling can effectively be suppressed.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord  is a steel cord, the reinforcing cord  can easily be separated from the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer by heating and recovered at the time of disposing of the tire, and, therefore, there is an advantage from the viewpoint of recyclability of the tire . Further, since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with vulcanized rubbers, inclusion of a large amount of polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the reinforcing cord layer  makes it possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. Compared with vulcanized rubbers, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has advantages in terms of high in-plane shear stiffness, excellent steering stability at the time of traveling with the tire, and excellent abrasion resistance.","Since the tread  that contacts a road surface is formed of a rubber material having higher abrasion resistance than that of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Since the annular bead core  formed of a metal material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case  is strongly fixed to the rim , i.e., the tire  is strongly fixed to the rim , similarly to conventional rubber pneumatic tires.","Since the sealing layer  formed of a rubber material having higher sealing ability than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is disposed in a region of the bead portion  that contacts the rim , sealing between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Therefore, compared with a case in which sealing is carried out with the rim  and the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. Further, provision of the sealing layer  also improves fittability to the rim.","Although a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated such that the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in a portion that contacts the heated reinforcing cord  is melted or softened is adopted in the embodiment described above, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; a hot air generating device may be used, instead of heating the reinforcing cord , to heat the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, and the reinforcing cord  may thereafter be embedded in the crown portion .","Although the heat source of the cord heating device  includes the heater and the fan in Embodiment 1-1, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated by radiation heat (for example, infrared rays) may be adopted.","Although a configuration in which a region at which the thermoplastic resin material with the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened is forcibly cooled with the second roller  formed of metal is adopted in Embodiment 1-1, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; a configuration in which cold air is directly applied to the region at which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, to forcibly cool and solidify the region at which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened may also be adopted.","Although a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated is adopted in Embodiment 1-1, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as that of the tire case , for example, may be adopted. In this case, by heating the coated thermoplastic resin material along with the reinforcing cord  when the coated reinforcing cord is wound on the crown portion  of the tire case , incorporation of air can effectively be suppressed at the time of embedding the reinforcing cord in the crown portion .","The tire  according to Embodiment 1-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a complete tube shape may be adopted.","Helically winding the reinforcing cord  is easy from the viewpoint of production. However, a method in which the reinforcing cord  is discontinuous in the width direction, for example, may also be contemplated.","Although modes for carrying out the first aspect of the invention are described above with reference to embodiments, the embodiments are merely examples, and may be practiced with various modifications within a range that does not depart from the gist of the first aspect. Of course, the protection scope of the first aspect of the invention is not limited to these embodiments.","Embodiment 1-2 of the method for producing a tire and the tire according to the first aspect of the invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. Similarly to Embodiment 1-1, the tire according to this embodiment has substantially the same cross-sectional shape as those of conventional general rubber pneumatic tires. Accordingly, in the following drawings, the same elements as those described in Embodiment 1-1 will be designated by the same reference numerals.  is a cross-sectional view of the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 taken along the tire width direction, and  is an enlarged view of a cross-section, taken along the tire width direction, of a bead portion in a state in which a rim is fitted to the tire according to Embodiment 1-2.  is a cross-sectional view taken along the tire width direction, which illustrates a region around a reinforcing layer of the tire according to Embodiment 1-2.","Similarly to Embodiment 1-1, the tire case  of the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 is formed of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. with a melting point of 162\u00b0 C.). In the tire  according to the present embodiment, a reinforcing cord layer  (indicated by a dotted line in ) constituted by a coated cord member B wound in the circumferential direction is superposed on the crown portion , as shown in . The reinforcing cord layer  constitutes the outer circumferential portion of the tire case , and reinforces the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the crown portion . The outer circumferential surface of the reinforcing cord layer  is included the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case .","The coated cord member B is formed by a cord member A that has higher rigidity than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer forming the tire case , and that is coated with a coating resin material  as another member than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer forming the tire case . In regions in which the coated cord member B contacts the crown portion , the coated cord member B and the crown portion  are bonded (for example, welded, or adhered with an adhesive) to each other.","The elastic modulus of the coating resin material  is preferably set to be within a range of 0.1 times to 10 times the elastic modulus of the resin material forming the tire case . When the elastic modulus of the coating resin material  is equal to or less than 10 times the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material forming the tire case , the crown portion is not excessively hard, and the fittability to a rim is facilitated. When the elastic modulus of the coating resin material  is equal to or higher than 0.1 times the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material forming the tire case , the resin constituting the reinforcing cord layer  is not excessively soft, and the in-plane shear stiffness of the belt is excellent, whereby the cornering power. In the present embodiment, the same material (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. in the present embodiment) as the thermoplastic resin material is used as the coating resin material .","As shown in , the coated cord member B has a substantially trapezoidal cross-sectional shape. In the following description, the top surface (the outer surface in the tire radial direction) of the coated cord member B is designated by reference numeral U, and the bottom surface (the inner surface in the tire radial direction) is designated by reference numeral D. Although a configuration in which the cross-sectional shape of the coated cord member B is substantially trapezoidal is adopted in the present embodiment, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; the cross-sectional shape of the coated cord member B may be any shape other than a shape in which the width increases from the bottom surface D side (the inner side in the tire radial direction) to the top surface U side (the outer side in the tire radial direction).","As shown in , since coated cord members B are arranged with intervals in the circumferential direction, gaps A are formed between adjacent cord members B. Accordingly, the outer circumferential surface of the reinforcing cord layer  has irregularities, and the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of which the outer circumferential portion is formed of the reinforcing cord layer  also has irregularities.","Minute roughening irregularities are uniformly formed on the outer circumferential surface S (including irregularities) of the tire case , and a cushion rubber  is bonded thereon with a bonding agent therebetween. The rubber portion at the inner side in the radial direction of the cushion rubber  has flowed into the roughening irregularities.","A tread  formed of a material, such as rubber, having higher abrasion resistance than the resin material forming the tire case  is bonded onto the cushion rubber  (onto the outer circumferential surface of the cushion rubber ).","The rubber to be used in the tread  (a tread rubber A) is preferably the same kind of rubber as the rubber used for conventional rubber pneumatic tires. A tread formed of another kind of resin material having higher abrasion resistance than that of the resin material forming the tire case  may be used instead of the tread . Similarly to conventional rubber pneumatic tires, the tread  has a tread pattern (not shown in the drawings) formed by plural grooves on the contact surface with a road surface.","A method of producing a tire according to the present embodiment will be described below.","(Frame Forming Step)","First, tire case half parts A are formed in the same way as in Embodiment 1-1, and the tire case half parts are heated and pressurized using a mold for bonding, thereby forming a tire case .","(Reinforcing Cord Member Winding Step)","A tire producing apparatus according to the present embodiment is the same as in Embodiment 1-1. In the cord feeding apparatus  shown in  as described in Embodiment 1-1, a coated cord member B which has a substantially trapezoidal cross-sectional shape, and which is obtained by coating the cord member A with the coating resin material  (a thermoplastic material in the present embodiment), and which is wound around the reel , is used.","First, the temperature of the heater  is increased, and the air around the heater  heated by the heater  is sent to the heating box  by an air current generated by the rotation of the fan . Then, the coated cord member B drawn out from the reel  is fed to the inside of the heating box  of which the inner space is heated with hot air, whereby the reinforcing cord member is heated (for example, to increase the temperature of the outer circumferential surface of the reinforcing cord member B to be equal to or higher than the melting point of the coating resin material ). Here, as a result of the heating of the coated cord member B, the coating resin material  becomes melted or softened.","The coated cord member B passes through the discharge port , and is helically wound, with a constant tension, around the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  rotating in a direction of approaching from the paper surface. At this time, the bottom surface D of the coated cord member B comes into contact with the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . The melted or softened coating resin material  at the contact portion spreads on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , and the coated cord member B is welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . Thereby, the bonding strength between the crown portion  and the coated cord member B is increased.","(Roughening Treatment Step)","Then, in a blasting apparatus not shown in the drawings, a blasting abrasive is shot to the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  while the tire case  is rotated. The blasting abrasive that has been shot collides with the outer circumferential surface S to form minute roughening irregularities with an arithmetic average roughness Ra of 0.05 mm or more on the outer circumferential surface S.","By forming minute roughening irregularities on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  in this manner, the outer circumferential surface S is made hydrophilic, and the wettability of the below-described adhesive is improved.","(Superposing Step)","A bonding agent is applied to the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  that has been subjected to the roughening treatment.","The bonding agent is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, a triazine thiol-based adhesive, a chlorinated rubber-based adhesive, a phenol-based resin adhesive, an isocyanate-based adhesive, a halogenated rubber-based adhesive, a rubber-based adhesive, or the like. The bonding agent is preferably capable of reacting at a temperature (90\u00b0 C. to 140\u00b0 C.) at which the cushion rubber  can be vulcanized.","Anon-vulcanized cushion rubber  is wound, for one revolution, on the outer circumferential surface S to which the bonding agent has been applied, and a bonding agent such as a rubber cement composition is applied onto the cushion rubber . A vulcanized or semi-vulcanized tread rubber A is wound thereon for one revolution, to become to be in the green tire case state.","(Vulcanization Step)","Then, the green tire case is housed in a vulcanization can or a mold, and is vulcanized. In this recess, unvulcanized cushion rubber  flows into the roughening irregularities, which have been formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. Once the vulcanization is completed, an anchor effect is exerted by the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the roughening irregularities, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is increased. That is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is enhanced due to the presence of the cushion rubber .","A tire  is completed by adhering a sealing layer  formed of a soft material softer than the resin material to the bead portion  of the tire case  by using an adhesive or the like.","(Effects)","The tire  according to the present embodiment has excellent heat resistance, excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, excellent tensile strength, and excellent fracture strain since the tire case  is formed of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. In addition, since the structure thereof is simpler than those of conventional rubber tires, the weight thereof is smaller. Therefore, the tire  according to the present embodiment has high abrasion resistance and high durability. The polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer constituting the tire case  has a melting point of 162\u00b0 C. Thus, the tire case half parts A can be sufficiently bonded at, for example, about 250\u00b0 C., and, therefore, energy consumption can be reduced, and the cost required for heating can be reduced. Further, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness to the coated cord member B.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the coated cord member B as described above, the coated cord member B can be made to more tightly contact the tire case  and fixed to the tire case  since the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  can be made smaller than that in a case in which the reinforcing cord A is fixed simply by using the cushion rubber . Accordingly, the incorporation of air mentioned above can effectively be prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling can effectively be suppressed.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord A is a steel cord, the cord member A can easily be separated from the coated cord member B by heating and recovered at the time of disposing of the tire, and, therefore, there is an advantage from the viewpoint of recyclability of the tire . Further, since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with vulcanized rubbers, inclusion of a large amount of polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the reinforcing cord layer  makes it possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. Compared with vulcanized rubbers, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has advantages in terms of high in-plane shear stiffness, excellent steering stability at the time of traveling with the tire, and excellent abrasion resistance.","In the method for producing a tire according to the present embodiment, when the tire case , the cushion rubber , and the tread rubber A are integrated, the bonding properties (adhesion properties) is improved by the anchor effect since the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to the roughening treatment. Further, since the resin material forming the tire case  is ploughed due to collision of the blasting abrasive, the wettability of the bonding agent is improved. Therefore, the bonding agent is retained, in a uniformly applied state, on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , whereby the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","In particular, even in a case in which irregularities are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , a portion surrounding a recess (walls at the recess, the bottom of the recess) is roughened by allowing the blasting abrasive to collide with the portion surrounding the recess (the gap A), whereby the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Since the cushion rubber  is superposed on the roughened area of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber can effectively be ensured.","In the case of vulcanization of the cushion rubber  in the vulcanization step, the cushion rubber  flows into the roughening irregularities that have been formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. Once the vulcanization is completed, an anchor effect is exerted by the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the roughening irregularities, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is enhanced.","In the tire  produced by the method for producing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is ensured. That is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is ensured due to the presence of the cushion rubber . Therefore, separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  and the cushion rubber  in the tire  is suppressed at the time of, for example, traveling.","Since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is formed of the reinforcing cord layer , puncture resistance and cutting resistance are improved, compared with a case in which the outer circumferential portion is formed of a member other than the reinforcing cord layer .","Since the coated cord member B is wound to form the reinforcing cord layer , the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction is improved, creeping of the tire case  (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases with lapse of time under a constant stress) is suppressed, and pressure resistance to air pressure applied from the inner side in the tire radial direction is improved.","Although irregularities are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  in the present embodiment, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed flat may be adopted.","In the tire case , a reinforcing cord layer may be formed by covering, with a coating thermoplastic material, the coated cord member that has been wound on the crown portion of the tire case and bonded thereto. In this case, the coating layer can be formed by ejecting the coating thermoplastic material in the melted or softened state onto the reinforcing cord layer . The coating layer may be formed without using an extruder, by heating a welding sheet into a melted or softened state, and attaching the welding sheet to the surface (the outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer .","Although case divided parts (tire case half parts A) are bonded to form the tire case  in Embodiment 1-2, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire case  may be formed as an integrated body using, for example, a mold.","The tire  according to Embodiment 1-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape.","Although the cushion rubber  is interposed between the tire case  and the tread  in Embodiment 1-2, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the cushion rubber  is not provided may be adopted.","Although a configuration in which the coated cord member B is helically wound on the crown portion  is adopted in Embodiment 1-2, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is wound but discontinuous in the width direction may be adopted.","In Embodiment 1-2, a configuration is adopted in which a thermoplastic material is used as the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B, and in which the coating resin material  is melted or softened by heating, thereby welding the coated cord member B to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . However, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, without heating the coating resin material , may be adopted.","A configuration may be adopted in which the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermosetting resin, and in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, without heating the coated cord member B.","A configuration may be adopted in which the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermosetting resin, and in which the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating a portion of the tire case  at which the coated cord member B is to be disposed to get into a melted or softened state.","A configuration may be adopted in which the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermoplastic material, and in which the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating a portion of the tire case  at which the coated cord member B is to be disposed to get into a melted or softened state as well as heating the coating resin material  to get into a melted or softened state. In a case in which both the tire case  and the coated cord member B are heated to get into a melted or softened state, both materials mix with each other well, thereby increasing the bonding strength. In a case in which each of the resin material that forms the tire case  and the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermoplastic resin material, the thermoplastic resin materials thereof are preferably thermoplastic resin materials of the same kind, and particularly preferably the same thermoplastic material.","The outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  that has been subjected to the roughening treatment may be subjected to corona treatment, plasma treatment or the like so as to activate the outer circumferential surface S and so as to enhance the hydrophilicity, and an adhesive may thereafter be applied thereto.","The sequence employed in the production of the tire  is not limited to the sequence described in Embodiment 1-2, and may be modified, as appropriate.","Although modes for carrying out the first aspect of the invention are described above with reference to embodiments, the embodiments are merely examples, and may be practiced with various modifications within a range that does not depart from the gist of the first aspect. Of course, the protection scope of the first aspect of the invention is not limited to these embodiments.","Although specific modes of the first aspect of the invention are described above with reference to Embodiment 1-1 and Embodiment 1-2, the first aspect of the invention is not limited to the modes described above.","A thermoplastic resin material that includes a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an elastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and that forms a tire frame, and a resin material that forms a reinforcing cord layer in the second aspect of the invention will be first described, and specific embodiments of a tire according to the second aspect of the invention will be then described with reference to the accompanying drawings.","[Thermoplastic Resin Including Polyamide-Based Thermoplastic Elastomer and Other Elastomer]","The tire according to the second aspect of the invention has a circular tire frame formed from a thermoplastic resin material containing at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and another elastomer.","Here, as the \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomers as described in the first aspect of the invention can be used.","The \u201celastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d refers to a thermoplastic resin material formed of a copolymer that includes a polymer constituting a crystalline hard segment having a high melting point or a hard segment having a high cohesive force, and a non-crystalline polymer constituting a soft segment having a low glass transition temperature, in which the polymer constituting the hard segment is a polymer, other than a polyamide having an amide bond (\u2014CONH\u2014) in the main chain, such as a polyurethane, a polystyrene, a polyolefin, a polyester or the like obtained by polymerizing urethane, styrene, olefin, polyester or the like.

Therefore, the same or corresponding figures and members will be described using the same reference characters and figures.","The tire case  in the present embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (UBESTA XPA9055X1 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd., melting point: 162\u00b0 C.) and a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer (ET680 manufactured by BASF Co., Ltd., softening point: 107\u00b0 C.) in a mass ratio of 75:25. The other details are the same as those of the tire according to Embodiment 1-1 described above, and the production method therefor is also the same.","(Effects)","The tire  according to the present embodiment has excellent heat resistance, excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, excellent tensile strength, and excellent fracture strain since the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer. In addition, since the structure is simpler than those of conventional rubber tires, the weight thereof is smaller. Therefore, the tire  according to the present embodiment has high impact resistance, and has high abrasion resistance and high durability. The thermoplastic resin material that constitutes the tire case  and contains the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer has a melting point or a softening point of 200\u00b0 C. or lower. Thus, the tire case half parts A can be sufficiently bonded at, for example, 250\u00b0 C. or lower, and, therefore, energy consumption can be reduced, and the cost required for heating can be reduced.","The thermoplastic resin material containing the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness to the reinforcing cord , and has excellent fixing performance such as welding strength. Therefore, a phenomenon (incorporation of air) in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  can be suppressed in the reinforcing cord winding step. The high adhesiveness and weldability to the reinforcing cord  and suppression of incorporation of air into a region around the reinforcing cord member effectively suppresses movement of the reinforcing cord  at the time a force is applied during traveling. Accordingly, for example, even in a case in which tire component members are disposed on the outer circumference of the tire frame so as to cover the entire reinforcing cord member, the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, whereby separation between the members (including the tire frame), for example, is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In the tire  according to the present embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having higher rigidity than that of the thermoplastic resin material is helically wound on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material in the circumferential direction, puncture resistance, cutting resistance, and rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  are improved. The improved rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  prevents creeping of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","In a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of the tire case  (the cross-section shown in ), at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, and is in close contact with the thermoplastic resin material, as a result of which incorporation of air during production is suppressed, and movement of the reinforcing cord  due to, for example, a force applied at the time of traveling is suppressed. Accordingly, separation between the reinforcing cord , the tire case , and the tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer as described above, the reinforcing cord  can be made to more tightly contact the tire case  and fixed to the tire case  since the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  can be made smaller than that in a case in which the reinforcing cord  is fixed using a cushion rubber. Accordingly, the incorporation of air mentioned above can effectively be prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling can effectively be suppressed.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord  is a steel cord, the reinforcing cord  can easily be separated from the thermoplastic resin material by heating and recovered at the time of disposing of the tire, and, therefore, there is an advantage from the viewpoint of recyclability of the tire . Further, since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with vulcanized rubbers, inclusion of a large amount of polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the reinforcing cord layer  makes it possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. Compared with vulcanized rubbers, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has advantages in terms of high in-plane shear stiffness, excellent steering stability at the time of traveling with the tire, and excellent abrasion resistance.","As shown in , since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is set to be equal to or greater than \u2155 of the diameter D thereof, incorporation of air during production is effectively suppressed, and movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied at the time of traveling is further suppressed.","Since the tread  that contacts a road surface is formed of a rubber material having higher abrasion resistance than that of the thermoplastic resin material constituting the tire case, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Since the annular bead core  formed of a metal material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case  is strongly fixed to the rim , i.e., the tire  is strongly fixed to the rim , similarly to conventional rubber pneumatic tires.","Since the sealing layer  formed of a rubber material having higher sealing ability than the thermoplastic resin material constituting the tire case is disposed in a region of the bead portion  that contacts the rim , the sealing between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Therefore, compared with a case in which sealing is carried out with the rim  and the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. Further, provision of the sealing layer  also improves fittability to a rim.","Although a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated such that the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in a portion that contacts the heated reinforcing cord  is melted or softened is adopted in the embodiment described above, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; a hot air generating apparatus may be used, instead of heating the reinforcing cord , to heat the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, and the reinforcing cord  may thereafter be embedded in the crown portion .","Although the heat source of the cord heating device  includes the heater and the fan in Embodiment 2-1, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated by radiation heat (for example, infrared rays) may be adopted.","Although a configuration in which a region at which the thermoplastic resin material with the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened is forcibly cooled with the second roller  formed of metal is adopted in Embodiment 2-1, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; a configuration in which cold air is directly applied to the region at which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, to forcibly cool and solidify the region at which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened may also be adopted.","Although a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated is adopted in Embodiment 2-1, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as that of the tire case , for example, may be adopted. In this case, by heating the coated thermoplastic resin material along with the reinforcing cord  when the coated reinforcing cord is wound on the crown portion  of the tire case , incorporation of air can effectively be suppressed at the time of embedding the reinforcing cord in the crown portion .","The tire  according to Embodiment 2-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a complete tube shape may be adopted.","Helical winding the reinforcing cord  is easy from the viewpoint of production. However, a method in which the reinforcing cord  is discontinuous in the width direction, for example, may also be contemplated.","Although modes for carrying out the second aspect of the invention are described above with reference to embodiments, the embodiments are merely examples, and may be practiced with various modifications within a range that does not depart from the gist of the second aspect. Of course, the protection scope of the second aspect of the invention is not limited to these embodiments.","A method for producing a tire according to the second aspect of the invention, and a tire according to Embodiment 2-2 will be described below with reference to the drawings. Similarly to Embodiment 2-1, the tire according to the present embodiment has substantially the same cross-sectional shape as those of conventional general rubber pneumatic tires.","The tire according to Embodiment 2-2 is the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 described above, except for the points discussed below. Therefore, the same or corresponding figures and members will be described using the same reference characters and figures.","Similarly to Embodiment 2-1, the tire according to Embodiment 2-2 is configured such that the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (UBESTA XPA9055X1 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd., melting point: 162\u00b0 C.) and a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer (ET680 manufactured by BASF Co., Ltd., softening point: 107\u00b0 C.) in a mass ratio of 75:25. The other details are the same as those of the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 described above, and the production method therefor is also the same.","In the present embodiment, the same material (the mixture of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (UBESTA XPA9055X1 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and the polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer (ET680 manufactured by BASF Co., Ltd.) in a mass ratio of 75:25) as the thermoplastic resin material is used as the coating resin material .","(Effects)","The tire  according to the present embodiment has excellent heat resistance, excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, excellent tensile strength, and excellent fracture strain since the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material containing a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer. In addition, since the structure is simpler than those of conventional rubber tires, the weight thereof is smaller. Therefore, the tire  according to the present embodiment has high impact resistance, and has high abrasion resistance and high durability. In the thermoplastic resin material that constitutes the tire case , the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer having a higher melting point from among the elastomers contained in the thermoplastic resin material has a melting point of 162\u00b0 C. Thus, the tire case half parts A can be sufficiently bonded at, for example, 250\u00b0 C. or lower, and, therefore, energy consumption can be reduced, and the cost required for heating can be reduced. The polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has high adhesiveness to the coated cord member B.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the coated cord member B as described above, the coated cord member B can be made to more tightly contact the tire case  and fixed to the tire case  since the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  can be made smaller than that in a case in which the reinforcing cord A is fixed using the cushion rubber . Accordingly, the incorporation of air mentioned above can effectively be prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling can effectively be suppressed.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord A is a steel cord, the cord member A can easily be separated from the coated cord member B by heating and recovered at the time of disposing of the tire, and, therefore, there is an advantage from the viewpoint of recyclability of the tire . Since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with vulcanized rubbers, inclusion of a large amount of polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the reinforcing cord layer  makes it possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. Compared with vulcanized rubbers, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has advantages in terms of high in-plane shear stiffness, excellent steering stability at the time of traveling with the tire, and excellent abrasion resistance.","In the method for producing a tire according to the present embodiment, when the tire case , the cushion rubber , and the tread rubber A are integrated, the bonding properties (adhesion properties) is improved by the anchor effect since the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to the roughening treatment. Further, since the resin material forming the tire case  is ploughed due to collision of the blasting abrasive, the wettability of the bonding agent is improved. Therefore, the bonding agent is retained, in a uniformly applied state, on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , whereby the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","In particular, even in a case in which irregularities are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , a portion surrounding a recess (walls at the recess, the bottom of the recess) is roughened by allowing the blasting abrasive to collide with the portion surrounding the recess (the gap A), whereby the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Since the cushion rubber  is superposed on the roughened area of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber can effectively be ensured.","In the case of vulcanization of the cushion rubber  in the vulcanization step, the cushion rubber  flows into the roughening irregularities that have been formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. Once the vulcanization is completed, an anchor effect is exerted by the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the roughening irregularities, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is enhanced.","In the tire  produced by the method for producing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is ensured. That is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is ensured due to the presence of the cushion rubber . Therefore, separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  and the cushion rubber  in the tire  is suppressed.","Since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is formed of the reinforcing cord layer , puncture resistance and cutting resistance are improved, compared with a case in which the outer circumferential portion is formed of a member other than the reinforcing cord layer .","Since the coated cord member B is wound to form the reinforcing cord layer , the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction is improved, creeping of the tire case  (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases with lapse of time under a constant stress) is suppressed, and pressure resistance to air pressure applied from the inner side in the tire radial direction is improved.","Although irregularities are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  in the present embodiment, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed flat may be adopted.","In the tire case , a reinforcing cord layer may be formed by covering, with a coating thermoplastic material, the coated cord member that has been wound on the crown portion of the tire case and bonded thereto. In this case, the coating layer can be formed by ejecting the coating thermoplastic material in the melted or softened state onto the reinforcing cord layer . The coating layer may be formed without using an extruder, by heating a welding sheet into a melted or softened state, and attaching the welding sheet to the surface (the outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer .","Although case divided parts (tire case half parts A) are bonded to form the tire case  in Embodiment 2-2, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire case  may be formed as an integrated body using, for example, a mold.","The tire  according to Embodiment 2-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape.","Although the cushion rubber  is interposed between the tire case  and the tread  in Embodiment 2-2, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the cushion rubber  is not provided may be adopted.","Although a configuration in which the coated cord member B is helically wound on the crown portion  is adopted in Embodiment 2-2, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is wound but discontinuous in the width direction may be adopted.","In Embodiment 2-2, a configuration is adopted in which a thermoplastic material is used as the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B, and in which the coating resin material  is melted or softened by heating, thereby welding the coated cord member B to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . However, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, without heating the coating resin material , may be adopted.","A configuration may be adopted in which the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermosetting resin, and in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, without heating the coated cord member B.","A configuration may be adopted in which the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermosetting resin, and in which the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material.

In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating a portion of the tire case  at which the coated cord member B is to be disposed to get into a melted or softened state as well as heating the coating resin material  to get into a melted or softened state. In a case in which both the tire case  and the coated cord member B are heated to get into a melted or softened state, both materials mix with each other well, thereby increasing the bonding strength. In a case in which each of the resin material that forms the tire case  and the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermoplastic material, the thermoplastic materials thereof are preferably thermoplastic materials of the same kind, and particularly the same thermoplastic material.","The outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  that has been subjected to the roughening treatment may be subjected to corona treatment, plasma treatment or the like so as to activate the outer circumferential surface S and so as to enhance the hydrophilicity, and an adhesive may thereafter be applied thereto.","The sequence employed in the production of the tire  is not limited to the sequence specified in Embodiment 2-2, and may be modified, as appropriate.","Although modes for carrying out the second aspect of the invention are described above with reference to embodiments, the embodiments are merely examples, and may be practiced with various modifications within a range that does not depart from the gist of the second aspect. Of course, the protection scope of the second aspect of the invention is not limited to these embodiments.","Although specific modes of the second aspect of the invention are described above with reference to Embodiment 2-1 and Embodiment 2-2, the second aspect of the invention is not limited to the modes described above.","Next, a thermoplastic resin material that constitutes a tire frame in the third aspect of the invention will be described first, and specific embodiments of a tire according to the third aspect of the invention will then be described with reference to the drawings.","[Thermoplastic Resin Material]","The tire according to the third aspect of the invention includes an circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material that includes a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying a thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer or a mixture of a thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying the other elastomer.","As described above, the thermoplastic resin material includes at least 1) a combination of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying a thermoplastic elastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer or 2) a combination of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, a thermoplastic elastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying a thermoplastic elastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer.","The polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the thermoplastic elastomer (other thermoplastic elastomer) other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and the acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying the thermoplastic elastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer will be described below.","The \u201cthermoplastic elastomer\u201d and the \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d are the same as in the first aspect of the invention.","The \u201cthermoplastic elastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d (other thermoplastic elastomer) means a thermoplastic elastomer that does not have an amide bond (\u2014CONH\u2014) in the main chain of a polymer constituting a hard segment among thermoplastic elastomers.

In a case in which the interaction at the phase interface between the sea phase and the island phase is weak, the fluidity of the thermoplastic resin material increases, and excellent injection moldability is exhibited. Since the acid-modified elastomer has an acid-modified site in a molecule, its interaction with the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is stronger as compared with an elastomer that is not acid-modified.","In the sea-island structure, there is a tendency that an increase in the acid value decreases the island phase while a decrease in the acid value enlarges the island phase. An acid value of the acid-modified elastomer within the range described above causes the island phase to be finely dispersed in the thermoplastic resin, thereby remarkably improving the impact resistance of the thermoplastic resin material; further, the melt viscosity of the thermoplastic resin material does not increase excessively, and the injection moldability of the thermoplastic resin material is excellent. Therefore, in the case of forming a tire case using the thermoplastic resin material, the thermoplastic resin needs not be heated to high temperatures, and, therefore, damage to the thermoplastic resin material caused by excessive heating can be reduced.","The island phase of the acid-modified elastomer being finely dispersed in the thermoplastic resin can be confirmed by photographic observation using a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope).","The acid value of the acid-modified elastomer is preferably higher than 0 mg(CHONa)\/g but equal to or less than 20 mg(CHONa)\/g, more preferably higher than 0 mg(CHONa)\/g but equal to or less than 17 mg(CHONa)\/g, and still more preferably higher than 0 mg(CHONa)\/g but equal to or less than 15 mg(CHONa)\/g.","Regarding the acid value of the acid-modified elastomer, in a case in which one acid-modified elastomer is contained in the thermoplastic resin material, the acid value of the acid-modified elastomer is preferably in the range described above; in a case in which two or more acid-modified elastomers are contained in the thermoplastic resin material, the acid value of each acid-modified elastomer is preferably in the range described above.","The ratio (the mass of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer:the total mass of the other thermoplastic elastomer and the acid-modified elastomer) of the mass of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the total mass of the other thermoplastic elastomer and the acid-modified elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material is preferably from 95:5 to 55:45, from the viewpoint of allowing the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer to form the sea phase. The ratio is more preferably 90:10 to 60:40.","The content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer in the thermoplastic resin material in the third aspect of the invention is not particularly limited, but is preferably 55 mass % to 95 mass % and more preferably 60 mass % to 90 mass %, with respect to the total mass of the thermoplastic resin material. When the content of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is 55 mass % to 95 mass % with respect to the total mass of the thermoplastic resin material, the characteristics of the thermoplastic resin material can sufficiently be exerted, and the tensile modulus of elasticity and the fracture properties of the tire can be improved.","The thermoplastic resin material may contain, if desired, various fillers (such as silica, calcium carbonate, and clay) and various additives such as an anti-aging agent, oils, plasticizers, colorants, weather-resistant agents, and reinforcing agents.","The thermoplastic resin material can be obtained by compounding the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the acid-modified elastomer (and, further, the other thermoplastic elastomer in a case in which the thermoplastic resin material contains the other thermoplastic elastomer), adding, if necessary, various additives, and carrying out melt-mixing. The mixing ratio of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, the acid-modified elastomer, and the other thermoplastic elastomer may be the ratio as described above.

When the tensile modulus of elasticity of the thermoplastic resin material is 100 MPa to 1000 MPa, fitting to a rim can be efficiently carried out while maintaining the shape of the tire frame.","In the third aspect of the invention, the tensile strength at yield as defined in JIS K7113:1995 of the thermoplastic resin material is preferably equal to or greater than 5 MPa, more preferably 5 MPa to 20 MPa, and still more preferably 5 MPa to 17 MPa. When the tensile strength at yield of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or greater than 5 MPa, deformation due to a load applied to the tire at the time of traveling or the like can be tolerated.","In the third aspect of the invention, the tensile elongation at yield as defined in JIS K7113:1995 of the thermoplastic resin material is preferably equal to or higher than 10%, more preferably 10% to 70%, and still more preferably 15% to 60%. When the tensile elongation at yield of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or higher than 10%, the elastic region is large, and fittability to a rim can be improved.","In the third aspect of the invention, the tensile elongation at break as defined in JIS K7113:1995 of the thermoplastic resin material is preferably equal to or higher than 50%, more preferably equal to or higher than 100%, still more preferably equal to or higher than 150%, and particularly preferably equal to or higher than 200%. When the tensile elongation at break of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or higher than 50%, fittability to a rim is excellent, and resistance to break at collision can be enhanced.","In the third aspect of the invention, the deflection temperature under load (under a load of 0.45 MPa) as defined in ISO 75-2 or ASTM D648 of the thermoplastic resin material is preferably equal to or higher than 50\u00b0 C., more preferably 50\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C., and still more preferably 50\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C. When the deflection temperature under load of the thermoplastic resin material is equal to or higher than 50\u00b0 C., deformation can be suppressed during a step of vulcanizing a tread or the like.","[Resin Material as Component of Reinforcing Cord Layer]","The tire according to the third aspect of the invention may have a reinforcing cord member which is wound on the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction to form a reinforcing cord layer.","The reinforcing cord layer may be configured to include a resin material. When a resin material is included in the reinforcing cord layer as described above, a difference in hardness between the tire and the reinforcing cord layer can be decreased, and, therefore, the reinforcing cord member can be more tightly adhered and fixed to the tire frame, compared with a case in which the reinforcing cord member is fixed using a cushion rubber. The concept of \u201cresin material\u201d, such as that described above, encompasses thermoplastic resins (including thermoplastic elastomers) as well as thermosetting resins, but does not encompass vulcanized rubbers.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord member is a steel cord, and in which an attempt is made to separate the reinforcing cord member from the cushion rubber at the time of disposal of the tire, vulcanized rubbers are difficult to separate from the reinforcing cord member only by heating; in contrast, resin materials can be separated from the reinforcing cord member only by heating, which is advantageous in terms of recyclability of the tire. Resin materials usually have a loss factor (tan \u03b4) lower than that of vulcanized rubbers. Accordingly, when the reinforcing cord layer contains a large amount of resin material, the rolling properties of the tire can be enhanced. Resin materials, having a higher elastic modulus relative to vulcanized rubbers, are advantageous in that the resin materials have high in-plane shear stiffness, and also provide excellent steering stability and excellent abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire.","Examples of the thermosetting resin which may be used in the reinforcing cord layer include phenol resins, urea resins, melamine resins, epoxy resins, polyamide resins, polyester resins, etc.","Examples of the thermoplastic resin include urethane resins, olefin resins, vinyl chloride resins, polyamide resins, and polyester resins.","The thermoplastic elastomer and the elastic modulus (the tensile modulus of elasticity as defined in JIS K7113) of the resin material used in the reinforcing cord layer are the same as those described in [Resin Material as Component of Reinforcing Cord Layer] in the first aspect of the invention.","A tire according to Embodiment 3-1 of the tire according to the third aspect of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","The tire according to Embodiment 3-1 is the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-1 described above, except for the points discussed below. Therefore, the same or corresponding drawings and members will be described using the same reference characters and figures.","The tire case  according to the present embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material constituted by a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (UBESTA XPA9055X1 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and an \u03b1-olefin-based thermoplastic elastomer (TAFMER MH7010 manufactured by Mitsui Chemicals Inc.), the thermoplastic resin material having an acid value of 1.11 mg-CHONa\/g.","The thermoplastic resin material according to the present embodiment includes a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and an acid-modified elastomer obtained by acid-modifying a thermoplastic elastomer other than polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. In particular, an acid value of the thermoplastic resin material of equal to or greater than 0.1 mg-CHONa\/g but less than 2.2 mg-CHONa\/g results in excellent fluidity of the thermoplastic resin material, provides a melt viscosity that is not excessively high, and therefore provides excellent injection moldability.","The tire case  is not limited to a tire case formed by bonding two members, and may be formed by bonding three or more members. The other details are the same as those of the tire according to Embodiment 1-1, and the production method therefor is also the same.","(Effects)","The tire  according to the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the tire case  has excellent tensile modulus of elasticity and excellent fracture properties, and, since the structure thereof can be simplified, the tire case  has a smaller weight than conventional rubbers. Therefore, the application of the tire  according to the present embodiment to a vehicle enables a decrease in the weight of the vehicle, and reduces fuel consumption.","In particular, when the acid value of the thermoplastic resin material used to form the tire case  is equal to or greater than 0.1 mg-CHONa\/g but less than 2.2 mg-CHONa\/g. the thermoplastic resin material has a sea-island structure in which the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer serves as a sea phase, and in which the acid-modified elastomer, or the acid-modified elastomer and the other (unmodified) thermoplastic elastomer serves as an island phase, and in which the island phase is finely dispersed in the thermoplastic resin material; therefore, the impact resistance, tensile elasticity, and fracture properties of the tire  are improved.","The polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer which is a constituent component of the thermoplastic resin material has high adhesiveness to the reinforcing cord , and has excellent fixing performance such as welding strength. Therefore, a phenomenon (incorporation of air) in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  can be suppressed in the reinforcing cord winding step. The high adhesiveness and weldability to the reinforcing cord  and suppression of incorporation of air into a region around the reinforcing cord member effectively suppresses movement of the reinforcing cord  at the time a force is applied during traveling. Accordingly, for example, even in a case in which tire component members are disposed on the outer circumference of the tire frame so as to cover the entire reinforcing cord member, the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, whereby separation between the members (including the tire frame), for example, is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In the tire  according to the present embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having rigidity higher than that of the thermoplastic resin material is helically wound on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material in the circumferential direction, puncture resistance, cutting resistance, and rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  are improved. The improved rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  prevents creeping of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","In a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of the tire case  (the cross-section shown in ), at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, and is in close contact with the thermoplastic resin material, as a result of which incorporation of air during production is suppressed, and movement of the reinforcing cord  due to, for example, a force applied at the time of traveling is suppressed. Accordingly, separation between of the reinforcing cord , the tire case , and the tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","As shown in , since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is set to be equal to or greater than \u2155 of the diameter D thereof, it incorporation of air during production is effectively suppressed, and movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied thereto at the time of traveling is further suppressed.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the thermoplastic resin material as described above, the reinforcing cord  can be made to more tightly contact the tire case  and fixed to the tire case  since the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  can be made smaller than that in a case in which the reinforcing cord  is fixed using a cushion rubber. Accordingly, the incorporation of air mentioned above can effectively be prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling can effectively be suppressed. In a case in which the reinforcing cord  is a steel cord, the reinforcing cord  can easily be separated from the thermoplastic resin material by heating and recovered at the time of disposing of the tire, and, therefore, there is an advantage from the viewpoint of recyclability of the tire . Further, the resin material usually has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with vulcanized rubbers, inclusion of a large amount of resin material in the reinforcing cord layer makes it possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. Resin materials, having a higher elastic modulus relative to vulcanized rubbers, are advantageous in that the resin materials have high in-plane shear stiffness, and also provide excellent steering stability and excellent abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire.","Since the tread  that contacts a road surface is formed of a rubber material having higher abrasion resistance than that of the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Since the annular bead core  formed of a metal material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case  is strongly fixed to the rim , i.e., the tire  is strongly fixed to the rim , similarly to conventional rubber pneumatic tires.","Since the sealing layer  formed of a rubber material having higher sealing ability than the thermoplastic resin material is disposed in a region of the bead portion  that contacts the rim , sealing between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Therefore, compared with a case in which sealing is carried out with the rim  and the thermoplastic resin material, air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. Further, provision of the sealing layer  also improves fittability to the rim.","Although a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated such that the thermoplastic resin material in a portion that contacts the heated reinforcing cord  is melted or softened is adopted in the embodiment described above, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; a hot air generating device may be used, instead of heating the reinforcing cord , to heat the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, and the reinforcing cord  may thereafter be embedded in the crown portion .","Although the heat source of the cord heating device  includes the heater and the fan in Embodiment 3-1, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated by radiation heat (for example, infrared rays) may be adopted.","Although a configuration in which a region at which the thermoplastic resin material with the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened is forcibly cooled with the second roller  formed of metal is adopted in Embodiment 3-1, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration; a configuration in which cold air is directly applied to the region at which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, to forcibly cool and solidify the region at which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened may also be adopted.","Although a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated is adopted in Embodiment 3-1, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case , for example, may be adopted. In this case, by heating the coated thermoplastic resin material along with the reinforcing cord  when the coated reinforcing cord is wound on the crown portion  of the tire case , incorporation of air can effectively be suppressed at the time of embedding the reinforcing cord in the crown portion .","Helically winding the reinforcing cord  is easy from the viewpoint of production. However, a method in which the reinforcing cord  is discontinuous in the width direction, for example, may also be contemplated.","The tire  according to Embodiment 3-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a complete tube shape may be adopted.","The complete tube-shaped tire may have a configuration in which, for example, three tire frames each having an annular shape are arranged in the tire width direction, as shown in .  is a cross-sectional view of a tire according to another embodiment. As shown in , a tire  includes a tread rubber layer , annular hollow tubes (tire frames)  formed of the same resin material as described in Embodiment 3-1, a belt (reinforcing cord) , and a rim . Three tubes  are arranged in the tire width direction of the tire . The tread rubber layer  in which the belt  is embedded is bonded to the outer circumferential portions of the tubes . The tubes  are fitted to the rim  having recess portions that engage with the tubes . The tire  is not provided with a bead core.","Although modes for carrying out the third aspect of the invention are described above with reference to embodiments, the embodiments are merely examples, and may be practiced with various modifications within a range that does not depart from the gist of the third aspect. Of course, the protection scope of the third aspect of the invention is not limited to these embodiments.","A method for producing a tire according to the third aspect of the invention, and a tire according to Embodiment 3-2 will be described below with reference to the drawings. Similarly to Embodiment 3-1, the tire according to the present embodiment has substantially the same cross-sectional shape as those of conventional general rubber pneumatic tires.","The tire according to Embodiment 3-2 is the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 described above, except for the points discussed below. Therefore, the same or corresponding drawings and members will be described using the same reference characters and figures.","Similarly to Embodiment 3-1, the tire case  according to Embodiment 3-2 is formed of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (UBESTA XPA9055X1 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and an \u03b1-olefin-based thermoplastic elastomer (TAFMER MH7010\u201d manufactured by Mitsui Chemicals Inc.), the thermoplastic resin material having an acid value of 1.11 mg-CHONa\/g. The other details are the same as those of the tire according to Embodiment 1-2, and the production method therefor is also the same.","In the present embodiment, the same material (the mixed material (which is a thermoplastic resin material having an acid value of 1.11 mg-CHONa\/g) of UBESTA XPA9055X1 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. and TAFMER MH7010 manufactured by Mitsui Chemicals Inc.) is used as a coating resin material  in the present embodiment.","(Effects)","The tire  according to the present embodiment has excellent heat resistance, excellent tensile modulus of elasticity, excellent tensile strength, and excellent fracture strain since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material. In addition, since the structure thereof can be simplified, the weight thereof is smaller than those of conventional rubber tires. Therefore, the tire  according to the present embodiment has high abrasion resistance and high durability.","In a case in which the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the coated cord member B, the coated cord member B can be made to more tightly contact the tire case  and fixed to the tire case  since the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  can be made smaller than that in a case in which the reinforcing cord A is fixed using only the cushion rubber . Accordingly, the incorporation of air mentioned above can effectively be prevented, and the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling can effectively be suppressed. In a case in which the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, the cord member A can easily be separated and from the coated cord member B by heating and recovered at the time of disposing of the tire, and, therefore, there is an advantage from the viewpoint of recyclability of the tire . Since resin materials usually have a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) than that of vulcanized rubbers, inclusion of a large amount of resin material in the reinforcing cord layer makes it possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. Resin materials, having a higher elastic modulus relative to vulcanized rubbers, are advantageous in that the resin materials have high in-plane shear stiffness, and also provide excellent steering stability and abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire.","In the method for producing a tire according to the present embodiment, when the tire case , the cushion rubber , and the tread rubber A are integrated, the bonding properties (adhesion properties) is improved by the anchor effect since the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to the roughening treatment. Further, since the resin material forming the tire case  is ploughed due to collision of the blasting abrasive, the wettability of the adhesive is improved. Therefore, the bonding agent is retained, in a uniformly applied state, on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , whereby the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","In particular, even in a case in which irregularities are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , a portion surrounding a recess (walls at the recess, the bottom of the recess) is roughened by allowing the blasting abrasive to collide with the portions surrounding the recess (the gap A), whereby the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be enhanced.","Since the cushion rubber  is superposed on the roughened area of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber can effectively be ensured.","In the case of vulcanization of the cushion rubber  in the vulcanization step, the cushion rubber  flows into the roughening irregularities that have been formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. Once the vulcanization is completed, an anchor effect is exerted by the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the roughening irregularities, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is enhanced.","In the tire  produced by the method for producing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is ensured. That is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is ensured due to the presence of the cushion rubber . Therefore, separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  and the cushion rubber  in the tire  is suppressed at the time of, for example, traveling.","Since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is formed of the reinforcing cord layer , puncture resistance and cutting resistance are improved, compared with a case in which the outer circumferential portion is formed of a member other than the reinforcing cord layer .","Since the coated cord member B is wound to form the reinforcing cord layer , the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction is improved, creeping of the tire case  (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases with lapse of time under a constant stress) is suppressed, and pressure resistance to air pressure applied from the inner side in the tire radial direction is improved.","Although irregularities are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  in the present embodiment, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed flat may be adopted.","In the tire case , a reinforcing cord layer may be formed by covering, with a coating thermoplastic material, the coated cord member that has been wound on the crown portion of the tire case and bonded thereto. In this case, the coating layer can be formed by ejecting the coating thermoplastic material in the melted or softened state onto the reinforcing cord layer . The coating layer may be formed without using an extruder, by heating a welding sheet into a melted or softened state, and attaching the welding sheet to the surface (the outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer .","Although case divided parts A are bonded to form the tire case  in Embodiment 3-2, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire case  may be formed as an integrated body using, for example, a mold.","The tire  according to Embodiment 3-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape (for example, the shape shown in ).","Although the cushion rubber  is interposed between the tire case  and the tread  in Embodiment 3-2, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the cushion rubber  is not provided may be adopted.","Although a configuration in which the coated cord member B is helically wound on the crown portion  is adopted in Embodiment 3-2, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is wound but discontinuous in the width direction may be adopted.","In Embodiment 3-2, a configuration is adopted in which a thermoplastic material is used as the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B, and in which the coating resin material  is melted or softened by heating, thereby welding the coated cord member B to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . However, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, without heating the coating resin material , may be adopted.","A configuration may be adopted in which the coating resin material  forming the coated cord member B is a thermosetting resin, and in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, without heating the coated cord member B.","A configuration may be adopted in which the coating resin material  that forms the coated cord member B is a thermosetting resin, and in which the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material.

Of course, the protection scope of the third aspect of the invention is not limited to these embodiments.","Although specific modes of the third aspect of the invention are described above with reference to Embodiment 3-1 and Embodiment 3-2, the third aspect of the invention is not limited to the modes described above.","A tire of the fourth aspect of the invention includes a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material, and the thermoplastic resin material includes a thermoplastic elastomer including a hard segment and a soft segment in a molecule thereof, and specific needle-shaped crystal grains.","Due to the above described configuration, the tire of the fourth aspect of the invention exhibits high elastic modulus and small rolling resistance.","Here, the \u201celastic modulus\u201d means a tensile modulus of elasticity defined in JIS K7113:1995, as long as it is not specified differently.","The rolling resistance of the tire of the fourth aspect of the invention can be expressed using tan \u03b4, which is exhibited by the thermoplastic resin material forming the tire, as an index. The loss factor (tan \u03b4) of the thermoplastic resin material is considered to correspond to the magnitude of strain generated in the thermoplastic resin material when a stress is applied to the thermoplastic resin material. Therefore, the larger tan \u03b4 of the thermoplastic resin material forming the tire frame means that stain can be more easily generated in the tire when a stress is applied to the tire due to friction between the tire and a road surface at the time of traveling of a vehicle. As the tire generates larger strain, the rolling resistance of the tire becomes larger.","In this description, the \u201closs factor (tan \u03b4)\u201d is a value calculated by a ratio (G\u2033\/G\u2032) between the storage shear elastic modulus (G\u2032) and the loss shear elastic modulus (G\u2033) at 30\u00b0 C., 20 Hz, and 1% of shearing strain, and is a value representing a degree to which a material absorbs energy (converts into heat) when the material is deformed (hereinafter, also referred to as \u201ctan \u03b4\u201d). Since the larger tan \u03b4 causes absorption of more energy, the rolling resistance of the tire increases and consequently serves as a reason of degradation in fuel efficiency of the tire. The tan \u03b4 of the thermoplastic elastomer can be measured by the use of a dynamic viscoelasticity measuring apparatus (Dynamic-Mechanical Analysis: DMA).","The tire frame or the like which is a constituent element of the tire of the fourth aspect of the invention, will be described below and then specific embodiments of the tire of the fourth aspect of the invention, will be then described with reference to the accompanying drawings.","[Tire Frame]","The tire frame in the fourth aspect of the invention is formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a thermoplastic elastomer including a hard segment and a soft segment in a molecule, and specific needle-shaped crystal grains.","(Thermoplastic Resin Material)","The thermoplastic resin material in the fourth aspect of the invention includes at least the thermoplastic elastomer and specific needle-shaped crystal grains and may include other components optionally.","Here, the \u201cthermoplastic resin material\u201d in the fourth aspect of the invention means a material including at least a thermoplastic elastomer and specific needle-shaped crystal grains, and a material including other components in addition to these components also belongs to the thermoplastic resin material.","The \u201cthermoplastic elastomer\u201d in the fourth aspect of the invention means a thermoplastic resin formed of a copolymer having a polymer constituting a crystalline hard segment with a high melting point or a hard segment with a high cohesive force and a polymer constituting a non-crystalline soft segment with a low glass transition temperature in a molecule thereof.","The \u201cthermoplastic resin\u201d in the fourth aspect of the invention does not encompass a vulcanized rubber such as conventional natural rubber, synthetic rubber, or the like.","In general, a thermoplastic elastomer having a high elastic modulus has often a high loss factor (tan \u03b4) and it is thus difficult to form a tire frame with high elasticity and small tan \u03b4.","By forming the tire frame of the tire of the invention according to the fourth aspect with the thermoplastic resin material including the thermoplastic elastomer, and needle-shaped crystal grains, it is possible to achieve high elastic modulus while keeping tan \u03b4 low.

Examples of the additives include a filler, an anti-aging agent, oil, a plasticizer, a colorant, a weather resistant agent, and a reinforcing agent.","The thermoplastic resin material can be prepared as a mixture, for example, by mixing the thermoplastic elastomer, the specific needle-shaped crystal grains, and various additives which are optionally used, and melting and kneading the resultant. The thermoplastic resin material can be used optionally in a pellet shaped.","The tire of the fourth aspect of the invention includes a circular tire frame (hereinafter, appropriately also referred to as a \u201ctire case\u201d) formed of the above-mentioned thermoplastic resin material. The tire frame may be formed of the thermoplastic resin material into a unified body using various forming methods or may be formed by forming a pair of tire case half parts (tire frame pieces) using various forming methods and then bonding the tire case half parts. From the viewpoint of productivity, it is preferable that the tire frame is formed by bonding a pair of half case cases.","[Reinforcing Cord Layer]","The tire of the fourth aspect of the invention may have a reinforcing cord member which is wound on the outer circumferential portion of the tire frame in the circumferential direction to form a reinforcing cord layer. The [Resin Material of Reinforcing Cord Layer] in the fourth aspect of the invention may be the same as the [Resin Material of Reinforcing Cord Layer] in the invention according to the first aspect.","Specific examples of the tire of the fourth aspect of the invention will be described in more detail below with reference to Embodiments 4-1 and 4-2.","A tire according to Embodiment 4-1 of the tire of the fourth aspect of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Here, the tire according to Embodiment 4-1 is the same as described in Embodiment 1-1, except for the following points. Accordingly, the same drawings and members will be described using the same reference numerals and the same drawings.","The tire case  according to this embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material which is a mixture of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9048\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and specific needle-shaped crystal grains (\u201cMOS-HIGE\u201d manufactured by Ube Material Industries Ltd.).","The content of the specific needle-shaped crystal grains in the thermoplastic resin material is 1 mass %.","The tire case  according to this embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a single thermoplastic elastomer and specific needle-shaped crystal grains, but the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration and the portions (such as the side portion , the crown portion , and the bead portion ) of the tire case  may be formed of thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics, similarly to typical conventional rubber pneumatic tires. A reinforcing material (such as fiber, cord, unwoven fabric, and woven fabric which are formed of a polymer material or metal) may be embedded in the tire case  (such as the bead portion , the side portion , and the crown portion ) to reinforce the tire case  with the reinforcing material.","The tire case  according to this embodiment is formed by bonding a pair of tire case half parts (tire frame pieces) A formed of the thermoplastic resin material including a thermoplastic elastomer and specific needle-shaped crystal grains to each other. The tire case half parts A are formed by opposing circular tire case half parts A, in each of which one bead portion , one side portion , and a half-width crown portion  are formed as a unified body by injection molding or the like, having the same shape to each other and bonding both tire case half parts to each other at the tire equatorial plane portion. The tire case  is not limited to bonding two members, but may be formed by bonding three or more members. The others are the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-1 and the production method thereof is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material including a thermoplastic elastomer and specific needle-shaped crystal grains, the loss factor (tan \u03b4) of the tire frame is kept low and the elastic modulus is improved, compared with a case where a thermoplastic resin material including only the thermoplastic elastomer is used. Accordingly, the tire  has a high elastic modulus and has reduced rolling resistance. The tire  also has excellent heat resistance. Since the tire  has a simpler structure than a conventional rubber tire, the weight is smaller. Accordingly, the tire  according to this embodiment has excellent abrasion resistance and durability.","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having rigidity higher than the resin material is wound on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material helically in the circumferential direction, puncture resistance, cutting resistance, and rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  are improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved, it is possible to prevent creeping of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","Since at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material and comes in close contact with the resin material in a cross-sectional view (the cross-section shown in ) taken along the axial direction of the tire case , the air inclusion at the time of production is suppressed and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied thereto at the time of traveling is suppressed. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress abrasion of the reinforcing cord , the tire case , and the tread  and thus to improve durability of the tire .","In this way, when the reinforcing cord layer  is formed to include the resin material, it is possible to reduce the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  and thus to further closely contact and fix the reinforcing cord  with and to the tire case , compared with a case where the reinforcing cord  is fixed merely using the cushion rubber. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively prevent the above-mentioned air inclusion and thus to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling.","When the reinforcing cord  is a steel cord, the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and recovered from the resin material by heating at the time of disposal of the tire and thus it is advantageous in view of recyclability of the tire . The resin material usually has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with a vulcanized rubber. Accordingly, when the reinforcing cord layer  contains a large amount of resin material, it is possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. The resin material is more advantageous in that the resin material has high in-plane shear stiffness and has excellent steering stability and abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire, compared with a vulcanized rubber.","As shown in , since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is set to be equal to or more than \u2155 of the diameter D thereof, it is possible to effectively suppress the air inclusion at the time of production and to further suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied thereto at the time of traveling.","Since the tread  coming in contact with a road surface is formed of a rubber material having abrasion resistance higher than the resin material including first and second thermoplastic elastomers, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is enhanced.","Since the annular bead core  formed of a metal material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case , that is, the tire , is strongly retained in the rim , similarly to a conventional rubber pneumatic tire.","Since the sealing layer  formed of a rubber material having higher sealability than the resin material forming the tire case  is disposed in the part of the bead portion  coming in contact with the rim , the sealability between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Accordingly, compared with a case where the sealing is performed with the rim  and the resin material forming the tire case , air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. By disposing the sealing layer , fittability onto a rim are also improved.","Although it is stated in Embodiment 4-1 that the reinforcing cord  is heated to melt or soften the thermoplastic resin material in the part coming in contact with the heated reinforcing cord , the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  where the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded therein may be heated using a hot air generating device, and then the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion , instead of heating the reinforcing cord .","Although the heater and the fan are adopted as the heat source of the cord heating device  in Embodiment 4-1, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the reinforcing cord  may be directly heated with radiation heat (for example, infrared rays).","Although the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is forcibly cooled with the second roller  formed of metal in Embodiment 4-1, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but cold air may be directly applied to the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material to forcibly cool and solidify the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material.","Although the reinforcing cord  is heated in Embodiment 4-1, for example, the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  may be coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case . In this case, by heating the coated thermoplastic resin material along with the reinforcing cord  when the coated reinforcing cord is wound on the crown portion  of the tire case , it is possible to effectively suppress the incorporation of air at the time of embedding the reinforcing cord in the crown portion .","The helical winding of the reinforcing cord  is easy in production, but it can also be considered that the reinforcing cord  is wound discontinuously in the width direction.","The tire  according to Embodiment 4-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the tire may have a complete tube shape.","In the complete tube-like tire, for example, as shown in , three tire frames having a circular shape may be arranged in the tire width direction.  is a cross-sectional view of a tire according to another embodiment. As shown in , a tire  includes a tread rubber layer , circular hollow tubes (tire frames)  formed of the same resin material as described in Embodiment 4-1, a belt (reinforcing cord) , and a rim . Three tubes  are arranged side by side in the tire width direction of the tire . The tread rubber layer  in which the belt  is embedded is bonded to the outer circumference of the tubes . The tubes  are fitted to the rim  having concave portions engaging with the tubes . The tire  is not provided with a bead core.","While the invention according to the fourth aspect has been described with reference to the embodiments, the embodiments are only an example and can be modified in various forms without departing from the concept thereof. The scope of the fourth aspect of the invention is not limited to the embodiments.","An Embodiment 4-2 of the tire of the fourth aspect of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Here, the tire according to Embodiment 4-2 is the same as described in Embodiment 1-2, except for the following points. Accordingly, the same drawings and members will be described using the same reference numerals and the same drawings.","Similarly to Embodiment 4-1, the tire case  of the tire according to Embodiment 4-2 is formed of a thermoplastic resin material which is a mixture of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9048\u201d made by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and specific needle-shaped crystal grains (\u201cMOS-HIGE\u201d made by Ube Material Industries Ltd.).","The content of the specific needle-shaped crystal grains in the thermoplastic resin material is 1 mass %. The other is the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 and the production method thereof is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material which is a mixture of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and specific needle-shaped crystal grains, the loss factor (tan \u03b4) of the tire frame is kept low and the elastic modulus is improved, compared with a case where only the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used. Accordingly, the tire  has a high elastic modulus and has reduced rolling resistance. The tire  also has excellent heat resistance. Since the tire  has a simpler structure than a conventional rubber tire, the weight is smaller. Accordingly, the tire  according to this embodiment has excellent abrasion resistance and durability.","In the method for producing a tire according to this embodiment, in unifying the tire case , the cushion rubber , and the tread rubber A, the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to a roughening treatment and thus the adhesiveness (bonding properties) is improved by the anchor effect. Since the resin material forming the tire case  is indented due to the collision of the blasting abrasive, the wettability of the adhesive is improved. Accordingly, the adhesive is uniformly applied to the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  and this state is retained, whereby it is possible to secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber .","Particularly, even when unevenness is formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the blasting abrasive is made to collide with the concave portions (the gaps A) to perform the roughening treatment on the peripheries (concave walls, concave bottoms) of the concave portions, whereby it is possible to secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber .","On the other hand, since the cushion rubber  is stacked in the roughened region of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , it is possible to effectively secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber.","When the cushion rubber  is vulcanized in the vulcanization step, the cushion rubber  flows in the roughened unevenness formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. When the vulcanization is completed, an anchor effect is exhibited by the cushion rubber  flowing in the roughened unevenness, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is enhanced.","In the tire  produced by this method for producing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is secured. That is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is secured through the cushion rubber . Accordingly, the abrasion of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  from the cushion rubber  is suppressed.","Since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is formed of the reinforcing cord layer , puncture resistance and cutting resistance are improved, compared with a case where the outer circumferential portion is formed of a member other than the reinforcing cord layer .","Since the coated cord member B is wound to form the reinforcing cord layer , the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction is improved, creeping of the tire case  (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases with the lapse of time under a constant stress) is suppressed and pressure resistance to air pressure from the inside in the tire diameter direction is improved.","When the reinforcing cord layer  is formed to include the coated cord member B, it is possible to reduce the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  and thus to further closely bring and fix the coated cord member B in contact with and to the tire case , compared with a case where the reinforcing cord A is fixed merely using the cushion rubber . Accordingly, it is possible to effectively prevent the above-mentioned incorporation of air and thus to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling.","When the reinforcing cord A is a steel cord, the cord member A can be easily separated and recovered from the coated cord member B by heating at the time of disposal of the tire and thus it is advantageous in view of recyclability of the tire . The resin material has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with a vulcanized rubber.

The resin material is more advantageous in that the resin material has high in-plane shear stiffness and has excellent steering stability and abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire, compared with a vulcanized rubber.","Although unevenness is formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  in this embodiment, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the outer circumferential surface S may be formed to be flat.","In the tire case , the coated cord member wound on and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case may be covered with a coating thermoplastic material to form a reinforcing cord layer. In this case, the melted or softened coating thermoplastic material may be ejected onto the reinforcing cord layer  to form a coating layer. A welding sheet may be heated into a melted or softened state without using an extruder and may be attached to the surface (the outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer  to form a coating layer.","Although the tire case half parts A are bonded to form the tire case  in Embodiment 4-2, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the tire case  may be formed as a unified body using a mold or the like.","The tire  according to Embodiment 4-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape (for example, the shape shown in ).","Although the cushion rubber  is interposed between the tire case  and the tread  in Embodiment 4-2, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the cushion rubber  may not be interposed therebetween.","Although the coated cord member B is helically wound on the crown portion  in Embodiment 4-2, the invention according to the fourth aspect is not limited to this configuration, but the coated cord member B may be wound thereon to be discontinuous in the width direction.","In Embodiment 4-2, a thermoplastic material is used as the coating resin material  forming the coated cord member B, the coating resin material  is melted or softened by heating, and the coated cord member B is welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion .

In general, when the heat resistance of the thermoplastic elastomer is enhanced, the loss factor (tan \u03b4) also increases therewith. However, the PAE\/PPE which is an embodiment of the fifth aspect of the invention can keep the loss factor lower than the thermoplastic elastomer (PAE) and polyamide constituting the hard segment thereof, as indicated by an arrow at the center of FIG. .

Since the tire of the fifth aspect of the invention employs the thermoplastic resin material including the thermoplastic elastomer, the bonding strength between the tire frame pieces is sufficient even in the tire frame welded in the temperature range of 120\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C.

Here, the tire according to Embodiment 5-1 is the same as described in Embodiment 1-1, except for the following points. Accordingly, the same drawings and members will be described using the same reference numerals and the same drawings.","Here, the tire case  according to this embodiment is formed of a mixture including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9048X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. of which the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the hard segment (polyamide 12) is 40\u00b0 C.) and polyphenylene ether (PPE) (\u201cXyron 200H\u201d manufactured by Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation, Tg: 210\u00b0 C.) at a mass ratio (x+y:z) of the soft segment (polyether:z) of the thermoplastic elastomer with respect to the total mass (x+y) of the hard segment (polyamide:x) and the resin (PPE:y) of 72:28. The mass ratio between the hard segment (polyamide 12:x) and the resin (PPE:y) is 48:52.","The tire case  according to this embodiment is formed of a single thermoplastic resin material (a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer+PPE), but the fifth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration and the portions (such as the side portion , the crown portion , and the bead portion ) of the tire case  may be formed of thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics, similarly to typical conventional rubber pneumatic tires. A reinforcing material (such as fiber, cord, unwoven fabric, and woven fabric which are formed of a polymer material or metal) may be embedded in the tire case  (such as the bead portion , the side portion , and the crown portion ) to reinforce the tire case with the reinforcing material.","The tire case  according to this embodiment is formed by bonding a pair of tire case half parts (tire frame pieces) A formed of the resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the PPE, to each other. The tire case A is formed by opposing annular tire case half parts A, in which one bead portion , one side portion , and a half-width crown portion  are formed as a unified body by injection molding or the like, having the same shape to each other and bonding both tire case half parts to each other at the tire equatorial plane portion. The tire case  is not limited to bonding two members, but may be formed by bonding three or more members. The others are the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-1 and the production method thereof is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the PPE, the loss factor (tan \u03b4) of the tire frame is kept low and the elastic modulus is improved, compared with a case where only the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used. Accordingly, the tire  has superior heat resistance and has reduced rolling resistance. Since the tire  has a simpler structure than a conventional rubber tire, the weight is smaller. Accordingly, the tire  according to this embodiment has excellent abrasion resistance and durability.","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having rigidity higher than the resin material is wound on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of a resin material helically in the circumferential direction, puncture resistance, cutting resistance, and rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  are improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved, it is possible to prevent creeping of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","Since at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material and comes in close contact with the resin material in a cross-sectional view (the cross-section shown in ) taken along the axial direction of the tire case , the incorporation of air at the time of production is suppressed and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied thereto at the time of traveling is suppressed. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress abrasion of the reinforcing cord , the tire case , and the tread  and thus to improve durability of the tire .","In this way, when the reinforcing cord layer  is formed to include the resin material, it is possible to reduce the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  and thus to further closely contact and fix the reinforcing cord  with and to the tire case , compared with a case where the reinforcing cord  is fixed merely using the cushion rubber. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively prevent the above-mentioned incorporation of air and thus to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling.","When the reinforcing cord  is a steel cord, the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and recovered from the resin material by heating at the time of disposal of the tire and thus it is advantageous in view of recyclability of the tire . The resin material usually has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with a vulcanized rubber. Accordingly, when the reinforcing cord layer  contains a large amount of resin material, it is possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. The resin material is more advantageous in that the resin material has high in-plane shear stiffness and has excellent steering stability and abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire, compared with a vulcanized rubber.","As shown in , since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is set to be equal to or more than \u2155 of the diameter D thereof, it is possible to effectively suppress the incorporation of air at the time of production and to further suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied thereto at the time of traveling.","Since the tread  coming in contact with a road surface is formed of a rubber material having abrasion resistance higher than the resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the PPE, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is enhanced.","Since the annular bead core  formed of a metal material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case , that is, the tire , is strongly retained in the rim , similarly to a conventional rubber pneumatic tire.","Since the sealing layer  formed of a rubber material having higher sealability than the resin material forming the tire case , is disposed in the part of the bead portion  coming in contact with the rim , the sealability between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Accordingly, compared with a case where the sealing is performed with the rim  and the resin material forming the tire case , air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. By disposing the sealing layer , fittability onto a rim are also improved.","Although it is stated in the above embodiment that the reinforcing cord  is heated to melt or soften the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer+PPE in the part coming in contact with the heated reinforcing cord , the fifth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, may be heated using a hot air generating device, and then the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion , instead of heating the reinforcing cord .","Although the heat source of the cord heating device  includes the heater and the fan in Embodiment 5-1, the fifth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the reinforcing cord  may be directly heated with radiation heat (for example, infrared rays).","Although the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is forcibly cooled with the second roller  formed of metal in Embodiment 5-1, the fifth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but cold air may be directly applied to the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material to forcibly cool and solidify the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material.","Although the reinforcing cord  is heated in Embodiment 5-1, for example, the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  may be coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case . In this case, by heating the coated thermoplastic resin material along with the reinforcing cord  when the coated reinforcing cord is wound on the crown portion  of the tire case , it is possible to effectively suppress the incorporation of air at the time of embedding the reinforcing cord in the crown portion .","The helical winding of the reinforcing cord  is easy in production, but it can also be considered that the reinforcing cord  is wound discontinuously in the width direction.","The tire  according to Embodiment 5-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the fifth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the tire may have a complete tube shape.","In the complete tube-like tire, for example, as shown in , three tire frames having an circular shape may be arranged in the tire width direction.  is a cross-sectional view of a tire according to another embodiment. As shown in , a tire  includes a tread rubber layer , circular hollow tubes (tire frames)  formed of the same resin material as described in Embodiment 5-1, a belt (reinforcing cord) , and a rim . Three tubes  are arranged side by side in the tire width direction of the tire . The tread rubber layer  in which the belt  is embedded is bonded to the outer peripheral portion of the tubes . The tubes  are fitted to the rim  having concave portions engaging with the tubes . The tire  is not provided with a bead core.","While the fifth aspect of the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments, the embodiments are only an example and can be modified in various forms without departing from the concept thereof. The scope of the fifth aspect of the invention is not limited to the embodiments.","A method for producing a tire and Embodiment 5-2 of the tire of the fifth aspect of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Similarly to Embodiment 5-1, the tire according to this embodiment has substantially the same cross-sectional shape as a typical conventional rubber pneumatic tire.","Here, the tire according to Embodiment 5-2 is the same as described in Embodiment 1-2, except for the following points. Accordingly, the same drawings and members will be described using the same reference numerals and the same drawings.","In the tire according to Embodiment 5-2, similarly to Embodiment 5-1, the tire case  is formed of a mixture including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9048X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd. of which the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the hard segment (polyamide 12) is 40\u00b0 C.) and polyphenylene ether (PPE) (\u201cXyron 200H\u201d manufactured by Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation, Tg: 210\u00b0 C.), at a mass ratio (x+y:z) of the soft segment (polyether:z) of the thermoplastic elastomer with respect to the total mass (x+y) of the hard segment (polyamide:x) and the resin (PPE:y) of 72:28. The mass ratio between the hard segment (polyamide 12:x) and the resin (PPE:y) is 48:52. The other is the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 and the production method thereof is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the PPE, the loss factor (tan \u03b4) of the tire frame is kept low and the elastic modulus is improved, compared with a case where only the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used. Accordingly, the tire  has superior heat resistance and has reduced rolling resistance. Since the tire  has a simpler structure than a conventional rubber tire, the weight is smaller. Accordingly, the tire  according to this embodiment has excellent abrasion resistance and durability.","In the method for producing a tire according to this embodiment, in unifying the tire case , the cushion rubber , and the tread rubber A, the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to the roughening treatment and thus the adhesiveness (bonding properties) is improved by the anchor effect. Since the resin material forming the tire case  is indented due to the collision of the blasting abrasive, the wettability of the adhesive is improved. Accordingly, the adhesive is uniformly applied to the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  and this state is retained, whereby it is possible to secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber .","Particularly, even when unevenness is formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the blasting abrasive is made to collide with the concave portions (the gaps A) to perform the roughening treatment on the peripheries (concave walls, concave bottoms) of the concave portions, whereby it is possible to secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber .","On the other hand, since the cushion rubber  is stacked in the roughened region of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , it is possible to effectively secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber.","When the cushion rubber  is vulcanized in the vulcanization step, the cushion rubber  flows in the roughened unevenness formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. When the vulcanization is completed, an anchor effect is exhibited by the cushion rubber  flowing in the roughened unevenness, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is enhanced.","In the tire  produced by this method for producing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is secured. That is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is secured through the cushion rubber . Accordingly, the abrasion of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  from the cushion rubber  is suppressed.","Since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is formed of the reinforcing cord layer , puncture resistance and cutting resistance are improved, compared with a case where the outer circumferential portion is formed of a member other than the reinforcing cord layer .","Since the coated cord member B is wound to form the reinforcing cord layer , the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction is improved, creeping (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases with the lapse of time under a constant stress) is suppressed and pressure resistance to air pressure from the inside in the tire diameter direction is improved.","When the reinforcing cord layer  is formed to include the coated cord member B, it is possible to reduce the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  and thus to further closely bring and fix the coated cord member B in contact with and to the tire case , compared with a case where the reinforcing cord A is fixed merely using the cushion rubber . Accordingly, it is possible to effectively prevent the above-mentioned incorporation of air and thus to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling.","When the reinforcing cord A is a steel cord, the cord member A can be easily separated and recovered from the coated cord member B by heating at the time of disposal of the tire and thus it is advantageous in view of recyclability of the tire . The resin material has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with a vulcanized rubber. Accordingly, when the reinforcing cord layer  contains a large amount of resin material, it is possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. The resin material is more advantageous in that the resin material has high in-plane shear stiffness and has excellent steering stability and abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire, compared with a vulcanized rubber.","Although unevenness is formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  in this embodiment, the fifth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the outer circumferential surface S may be formed to be flat.","In the tire case , the coated cord member wound on and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case may be covered with a coating thermoplastic material to form a reinforcing cord layer.

Therefore, the larger tan \u03b4 of the thermoplastic resin material forming the tire frame means that stain can be more easily generated in the tire when a stress is applied to the tire due to friction between the tire and a road surface at the time of traveling of a vehicle. As the tire generates larger strain, the rolling resistance of the tire becomes larger.","In this description, the \u201closs factor (tan \u03b4)\u201d is a value calculated by a ratio (G\u2033\/G\u2032) between the storage shear elastic modulus (G\u2032) and the loss shear elastic modulus (G\u2033) at 30\u00b0 C., 20 Hz, and 1% of shearing strain and is a value representing a degree to which a material absorbs energy (converts into heat) when the material is deformed (hereinafter, also referred to as \u201ctan \u03b4\u201d). Since the larger tan \u03b4 causes absorption of more energy, the rolling resistance of the tire increases and consequently serves as a reason of degradation in fuel efficiency of the tire.

Here, the tire according to Embodiment 6-1 is the same as described in Embodiment 1-1, except for the following points. Accordingly, the same drawings and members will be described using the same reference numerals and the same drawings.","The tire case  according to this embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material which is a mixture of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and an antistatic material (\u201cELENITE AB-100\u201d manufactured by Takamatsu Oil & Fat Co., Ltd.).

A reinforcing material (such as fiber, cord, unwoven fabric, and woven fabric which are formed of a polymer material or metal) may be embedded in the tire case  (such as the bead portion , the side portion , and the crown portion ) to reinforce the tire case  with the reinforcing material. The other is the same as the tire of according to Embodiment 1-1 and the production method thereof is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the phosphoric acid ester-based ion conductor as the antistatic material, the antistatic performance is excellent and the low tan \u03b4 characteristics (low loss or low heat-emission) are superior, compared with a case where a thermoplastic resin material including only the thermoplastic elastomer is used. Accordingly, the tire  exhibits excellent antistatic performance and has superior rolling resistance. Since the tire  has a simpler structure than a conventional rubber tire, the weight is smaller. Accordingly, the tire  according to this embodiment has excellent abrasion resistance and durability.","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having rigidity higher than the resin material is wound on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material helically in the circumferential direction, puncture resistance, cutting resistance, and rigidity in the circumferential direction are improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved, it is possible to prevent creeping of the tire case  formed of a thermoplastic resin material.","Since at least a part of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  of the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material and comes in close contact with the resin material in a cross-sectional view (the cross-section shown in ) taken along the axial direction of the tire case , the incorporation of air at the time of production is suppressed and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied thereto at the time of traveling is suppressed. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress abrasion of the reinforcing cord , the tire case , and the tread  and thus to improve durability of the tire .","In this way, when the reinforcing cord layer  is formed to include the resin material, it is possible to reduce the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  and thus to further closely contact and fix the reinforcing cord  with and to the tire case , compared with a case where the reinforcing cord  is fixed merely using the cushion rubber. Accordingly, it is possible to effectively prevent the above-mentioned incorporation of air and thus to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling.","When the reinforcing cord  is a steel cord, the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and recovered from the resin material by heating at the time of disposal of the tire and thus it is advantageous in view of recyclability of the tire . The resin material usually has a lower loss factor (tan \u03b4) compared with a vulcanized rubber. Accordingly, when the reinforcing cord layer  contains a large amount of resin material, it is possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. The resin material is more advantageous in that the resin material has high in-plane shear stiffness and has excellent steering stability and abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire, compared with a vulcanized rubber.","As shown in , since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is set to be equal to or more than \u2155 of the diameter D thereof, it is possible to effectively suppress the incorporation of air at the time of production and to further suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied thereto at the time of traveling.","Since the tread  coming in contact with a road surface is formed of a rubber material having abrasion resistance higher than the resin material including first and second thermoplastic elastomers, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is enhanced.","Since the annular bead core  formed of a metal material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case , that is, the tire , is strongly retained in the rim , similarly to a conventional rubber pneumatic tire.","Since the sealing layer  formed of a rubber material having higher sealability than the resin material forming the tire case  is disposed in the part of the bead portion  coming in contact with the rim , the sealability between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Accordingly, compared with a case where the sealing is performed with the rim  and the resin material forming the tire case , air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. By disposing the sealing layer , fittability onto a rim are also improved.","Although it is stated in Embodiment 6-1 that the reinforcing cord  is heated to melt or soften the thermoplastic resin material in the part coming in contact with the heated reinforcing cord , the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  where the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded therein may be heated using a hot air generating device, and then the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion , instead of heating the reinforcing cord .","Although the heater and the fan are adopted as the heat source of the cord heating device  in Embodiment 6-1, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the reinforcing cord  may be directly heated with radiation heat (for example, infrared rays).","Although the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is forcibly cooled with the second roller  formed of metal in Embodiment 6-1, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but cold air may be directly applied to the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material to forcibly cool and solidify the melted or softened portion of the thermoplastic resin material.","Although the reinforcing cord  is heated in Embodiment 6-1, for example, the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  may be coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case . In this case, by heating the coated thermoplastic resin material along with the reinforcing cord  when the coated reinforcing cord is wound on the crown portion  of the tire case , it is possible to effectively suppress the incorporation of air at the time of embedding the reinforcing cord in the crown portion .","The helical winding of the reinforcing cord  is easy in production, but it can also be considered that the reinforcing cord  is wound discontinuously in the width direction.","The tire  according to Embodiment 6-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the tire may have a complete tube shape.","In the complete tube-like tire, for example, as shown in , three tire frames having a circular shape may be arranged in the tire width direction.  is a cross-sectional view of a tire according to another embodiment. As shown in , a tire  includes a tread rubber layer , circular hollow tubes (tire frames) formed of the same resin material as described in Embodiment 6-1, a belt (reinforcing cord) , and a rim . Three tubes  are arranged side by side in the tire width direction of the tire . The tread rubber layer  in which the belt  is embedded is bonded to the outer peripheral portion of the tubes . The tubes  are fitted to the rim  having concave portions engaging with the tubes . The tire  is not provided with a bead core.","While the sixth aspect of the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments, the embodiments are only an example and can be modified in various forms without departing from the concept thereof. The scope of the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to the embodiments.","An Embodiment 6-2 of the tire of the sixth aspect of the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Here, the tire according to Embodiment 6-2 is the same as described in Embodiment 1-2, except for the following points.

The volume resistivity of the tire case  is 2.1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm. The other is the same as the tire according to Embodiment 1-2 and the production method thereof is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  according to this embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the phosphoric acid ester-based ion conductor as the antistatic material, the antistatic performance is excellent and the low tan \u03b4 characteristics (low loss or low heat-emission) are superior, compared with a case where a thermoplastic resin material including only the thermoplastic elastomer is used. Accordingly, the tire  exhibits excellent antistatic performance and has superior low tan \u03b4 characteristics (low loss or low heat-emission). Since the tire  has a simpler structure than a conventional rubber tire, the weight is smaller. Accordingly, the tire  according to this embodiment has excellent abrasion resistance and durability.","In the method for producing a tire according to this embodiment, in unifying the tire case , the cushion rubber , and the tread rubber A, the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to the roughening treatment and thus the adhesiveness (bonding properties) is improved by the anchor effect. Since the resin material forming the tire case  is indented due to the collision of the blasting abrasive, the wettability of the adhesive is improved. Accordingly, the adhesive is uniformly applied to the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  and this state is retained, whereby it is possible to secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber .","Particularly, even when unevenness is formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the blasting abrasive is made to collide with the concave portions (the gaps A) to perform the roughening treatment on the peripheries (concave walls, concave bottoms) of the concave portions, whereby it is possible to secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber .","On the other hand, since the cushion rubber  is stacked in the roughened region of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , it is possible to effectively secure the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber.","When the cushion rubber  is vulcanized in the vulcanization step, the cushion rubber  flows in the roughened unevenness formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. When the vulcanization is completed, an anchor effect is exhibited by the cushion rubber  flowing in the roughened unevenness, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is enhanced.","In the tire  produced by this method for producing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is secured. That is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is secured through the cushion rubber . Accordingly, the abrasion of the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  from the cushion rubber  is suppressed.","Since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is formed of the reinforcing cord layer , puncture resistance and cutting resistance are improved, compared with a case where the outer circumferential portion is formed of a member other than the reinforcing cord layer .","Since the coated cord member B is wound to form the reinforcing cord layer , the rigidity in the circumferential direction of the tire  is improved. Since the rigidity in the circumferential direction is improved, creeping of the tire case  (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases with the lapse of time under a constant stress) is suppressed and pressure resistance to air pressure from the inside in the tire diameter direction is improved.","When the reinforcing cord layer  is formed to include the coated cord member B, it is possible to reduce the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  and thus to further closely bring and fix the coated cord member B in contact with and to the tire case , compared with a case where the reinforcing cord A is fixed merely using the cushion rubber . Accordingly, it is possible to effectively prevent the above-mentioned incorporation of air and thus to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of traveling.","When the reinforcing cord A is a steel cord, the cord member A can be easily separated and recovered from the coated cord member B by heating at the time of disposal of the tire and thus it is advantageous in view of recyclability of the tire . The resin material has a lower loss factor (tan d) compared with a vulcanized rubber. Accordingly, when the reinforcing cord layer  contains a large amount of resin material, it is possible to enhance the rolling properties of the tire. The resin material is more advantageous in that the resin material has high in-plane shear stiffness and has excellent steering stability and abrasion resistance at the time of traveling with the tire, compared with a vulcanized rubber.","Although unevenness is formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  in this embodiment, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the outer circumferential surface S may be formed to be flat.","In the tire case , the coated cord member wound on and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case may be covered with a coating thermoplastic material to form a reinforcing cord layer. In this case, the melted or softened coating thermoplastic material may be ejected onto the reinforcing cord layer  to form a coating layer. A welding sheet may be heated into a melted or softened state without using an extruder and may be attached to the surface (the outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer  to form a coating layer.","Although the tire case half parts A are bonded to form the tire case  in Embodiment 6-2, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the tire case  may be formed as a unified body using a mold or the like.","The tire  according to Embodiment 6-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by fitting the bead portion  to the rim . However, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape (for example, the shape shown in ).","Although the cushion rubber  is interposed between the tire case  and the tread  in Embodiment 6-2, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the cushion rubber  may not be interposed therebetween.","Although the coated cord member B is helically wound on the crown portion  in Embodiment 6-2, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the coated cord member B may be wound thereon to be discontinuous in the width direction.","In Embodiment 6-2, a thermoplastic material is used as the coating resin material  forming the coated cord member B, the coating resin material  is melted or softened by heating, and the coated cord member B is welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . However, the sixth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, but the coated cord member B may be bonded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating the coating resin material .","A thermosetting resin may be used as the coating resin material  forming the coated cord member B, and the coated cord member may be bonded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating the coated cord member B.","A thermosetting resin may be used as the as the coating resin material  forming the coated cord member B and the tire case  may be formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the coated cord member B may be bonded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or a part of the tire case  in which the coated cord member B is embedded may be heated to be in a melted or softened state and the coated cord member B may be welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion .","A thermoplastic resin may be used as the as the coating resin material  forming the coated cord member B and the tire case  may be formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the coated cord member B may be bonded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or a part of the tire case  in which the coated cord member B is embedded may be heated into a melted or softened state, the coating resin material  is heated to be in a melted or softened state, and the coated cord member B may be welded to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion . When both the tire case  and the coated cord member B may be heated to be in a melted or softened state, both are mixed with each other well and thus the bonding strength therebetween is improved. When a thermoplastic resin material is used as the resin material forming the tire case  and a thermoplastic resin material is used as the coating resin material  forming the coated cord member B, the same kind of thermoplastic material, particularly, the same thermoplastic material, is preferably used.","The outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  may be activated to enhance the hydrophilic property by performing a corona process or a plasma process on the outer circumferential surface S having been subjected to the roughening treatment, and then an adhesive may be applied thereto.","The sequence for producing the tire  is not limited to the sequence described in Embodiment 6-2, but may be appropriately changed.","While the sixth aspect of the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments, the embodiments are only an example and can be modified in various forms without departing from the concept thereof.

Here, the tire according to Embodiment 7-1 is the same as the above Embodiment 1-1 except for the following facts. Therefore, the same reference signs and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","The tire case  of the present embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material configured of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a polyamide-based thermoplastic resin (\u201cUBESTA, 3014U\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.). In the embodiment, the tire case  is formed only of the thermoplastic resin material according to the seventh aspect of the invention, but the invention according to the seventh aspect is not limited to this configuration, and, similarly to an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, different thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics may be used in the respective portions (side portion , crown portion , bead portion , and the like) of the tire case . In addition, the tire case  may be reinforced using a reinforcing material (a macromolecular material, metal fabric, cord, non-woven fabric, woven fabric, or the like) by embedding and disposing the reinforcing material in the tire case  (for example, bead portion , side portion , crown portion , and the like).","The tire case  of the embodiment is a pair of mutually-bonded tire case half parts (tire frame pieces) A that are formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the seventh aspect of the invention. The tire case half part A is formed by disposing the circular tire case half parts A, which each have the same shape and have been formed by integrating a bead portion , a side portion  and a half-width crown portion  through injection molding or the like, so as to face each other, and bonding the tire case half parts A at the tire equatorial plane portion.

Other portions are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-1, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material, even when the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material is increased, the tan \u03b4 of the thermoplastic resin material is not easily increased, and the rolling resistance of the tire can be suppressed, furthermore, since the tire structure can be simplified, the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art. Therefore, when the tire  of the embodiment is applied to an automobile, since the rolling resistance is suppressed, and the weight of the tire can be decreased, it is possible to improve the gas mileage of an automobile in which the tire is used.","In addition, when the thermoplastic resin material includes the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, since the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer has a high adhesion to a reinforcing cord , and, furthermore, is excellent in terms of fixing performances, such as weld strength, it is possible to particularly suppress a phenomenon in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  in a reinforcing cord winding process (incorporation of air). When the adhesion and weldability to the reinforcing cord  are high, and, furthermore, air entrance into the periphery of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied or the like while travelling. Thereby, for example, even when a tire-constituting member has been provided so as to cover the entire outer circumferential portion of the tire frame with the reinforcing cord member, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, the separation or the like between the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, in the tire  of the embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having a higher stiffness than the thermoplastic resin material is wound in a spiral shape in the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the puncture resistance, the cutting resistance and the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction are improved. Meanwhile, the improvement of the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction prevents the creeping in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material.","In addition, in the cross-sectional view of the tire case  in the axial direction (the cross section illustrated in ), since at least some of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, and is adhered to the thermoplastic resin material, incorporation of air during manufacturing is suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied or the like while travelling is suppressed. Thereby, the separation or the like of the reinforcing cord , the tire case  and a tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is \u2155 or more of the diameter D as illustrated in , incorporation of air during manufacturing is effectively suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied or the like while travelling is further suppressed.","When a reinforcing cord layer  is configured so as to include the thermoplastic resin material as described above, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to when the reinforcing cord  is fixed using cushion rubber, the reinforcing cord  can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member during travelling.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, since the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and collected from the thermoplastic resin material through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire . In addition, the resin material generally has a low loss coefficient (Tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubber. Therefore, when the reinforcing cord layer includes the resin material much, it is possible to improve the rolling properties of the tire. Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber is advantageous that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and operation feeling or abrasion resistance during tire travelling is also excellent.","In addition, since the tread  that comes into contact with road surfaces is formed using a rubber material that is more abrasion-resistant than the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Furthermore, since a circular bead core  made of a metallic material is embedded in the bead portion , similarly to a pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, the tire case , that is, the tire  is strongly held to a rim .","In addition, furthermore, since a sealing layer  made of a rubber material having higher sealing properties than the thermoplastic resin material is provided in a portion that comes into contact with the rim  of the bead portion , the sealing properties between the tire  and the rim  are improved. Therefore, compared to when the tire is sealed with the rim  using the thermoplastic resin material, the air leakage in the tire is further suppressed. In addition, the rim fitting properties are also improved when the sealing layer  is provided.","The above embodiment employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated, and the thermoplastic resin material in the portion with which the heated reinforcing cord  comes into contact is melted or softened, but the invention according to the seventh aspect is not limited to this configuration, and the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion  after heating the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, using a hot air generating apparatus without heating the reinforcing cord .","In addition, in Embodiment 7-1, a heater and a fan are used as the heat source of a cord heating apparatus , but the invention according to the seventh aspect is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated using radiation heat (for example, infrared rays or the like) may be employed.","Furthermore, Embodiment 7-1 employs a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled using a second metal roller , but the invention according to the seventh aspect is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled and solidified by directly blowing cold air to the portion in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened.","In addition, Embodiment 7-1 employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated; however, for example, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case  may be employed, and, in this case, it is possible to effectively suppress air entrance during embedding in the crown portion  by heating the thermoplastic resin material, which is coated with the reinforcing cord , when winding the coated reinforcing cord around the crown portion  of the tire case .","In addition, the spiral winding of the reinforcing cord  facilitates the manufacturing, but a method, in which the reinforcing cord  is discontinuously formed in the width direction, or the like can be also considered.","The tire  of Embodiment 7-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  in the rim , but the invention according to the seventh aspect is not limited to this configuration, and the tire may have a complete tube shape.","The tire having the complete tube shape may be an aspect in which, for example, three circular-shaped tire frames are disposed in the tire width direction as illustrated in .  is a cross-sectional view of the tire according to other embodiment. As illustrated in , a tire  has a tread rubber layer , circular-shaped hollow tubes (tire frame)  which are formed of the same resin material as in Embodiment 7-1, a belt (reinforcing cord)  and a rim . Three tubes  are disposed in series in the tire width direction of the tire . The tread rubber layer , in which the belt  is embedded, is adhered to the outer circumferential portions of the tubes . In addition, the tubes  are mounted on the rim  having recess portions that engage with the tubes . Meanwhile, the bead core is not provided in the tire .","Thus far, an embodiment of the invention according to the seventh aspect has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the invention according to the seventh aspect is not limited to the above embodiment.","Next, a method of manufacturing the tire according to the seventh aspect of the invention and Embodiment 7-2 of the tire will be described according to the drawings. Similarly to the above Embodiment 7-1, the tire of the present embodiment exhibits almost the same cross-sectional shape as an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art.","Here, the tire according to Embodiment 7-2 is the same as the above Embodiment 1-2 except for the following facts. Therefore, the same reference signs and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","In the tire of Embodiment 7-2, similarly to the above Embodiment 7-1, the tire case  is formed of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a polyamide-based thermoplastic resin (\u201cUBESTA, 3014U\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.). In the tire  of the embodiment, the reinforcing cord layer  that is formed by winding a coated cord member B in the circumferential direction (illustrated in  using a broken line) is superposed on the crown portion  as illustrated in . The reinforcing cord layer  configures the outer circumferential portion of the tire case , and reinforces the stiffness of the crown portion  in the circumferential direction. Meanwhile, the outer circumferential surface of the reinforced cord layer  is included in the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case .","In addition, the elastic modulus of a resin material for coating  is preferably set in a range of 0.1 times to 10 times the elastic modulus of a resin material that forms the tire case . When the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 10 times or less the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the crown portion does not become too hard, and fittability onto a rim are easily achieved. In addition, when the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 0.1 times or more the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the resin that configures the reinforcing cord layer  does not become too soft, and the belt in-plane shear stiffness is excellent whereby the cornering force is improved. Meanwhile, in the embodiment, as the resin material for coating , the same material as the thermoplastic resin material (in the embodiment, a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a polyamide-based thermoplastic resin (\u201cUBESTA, 3014U\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) is used. Other portions are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-2, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material, even when the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material is increased, the tan \u03b4 of the thermoplastic resin material does not easily increase, and the rolling resistance of the tire can be suppressed. Furthermore, since the tire structure can be simplified, the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art. Therefore, since the weight of the tire  of the embodiment can be decreased, it is possible to improve the gas mileage of an automobile in which the tire is used.","In addition, when the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the coated cord member B, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to when the reinforcing cord A is simply fixed using cushion rubber , the coated cord member B can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member while travelling.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, since the cord member A can be easily separated and collected from the coated cord member B through heating at the time of disposition of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire . In addition, the resin material generally has a low loss coefficient (Tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubber. Therefore, when the reinforcing cord layer includes the resin material much, it is possible to improve the rolling properties of the tire. Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber has the advantage that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and operation feeling or abrasion resistance during tire travelling is also excellent.","In the method of manufacturing the tire of the embodiment, when the tire case , the cushion rubber  and a tread rubber A are integrated, since the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been treated to be coarse, the bonding properties (adhesion) is improved due to the anchor effect. In addition, since the resin material that forms the tire case  is dug out by the collision of a blasting abrasive, the wettability of an adhesive is improved. Thereby, a state in which the adhesive is uniformly coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  is held, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Particularly, even when protrusions and recesses are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the peripheries of the recess portions (recess walls and recess bottoms) are treated to be coarse by making the blasting abrasive collide with the recess portions (voids A), and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Meanwhile, since the cushion rubber  is laminated in the coarsening-treated areas on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber can be effectively ensured.","When the cushion rubber  has been vulcanized in a vulcanizing process, the cushion rubber  flows into the coarsened recesses and protrusions formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the coarsening treatment. In addition, when vulcanization is completed, the anchor effect is developed due to the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the coarsened recesses and protrusions so that the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is improved.","In the tire  manufactured using the above method of manufacturing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is ensured, that is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is ensured through the cushion rubber . Thereby, the separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  and the cushion rubber  is suppressed while travelling and the like.","In addition, since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is configured of the reinforcing cord layer , the puncture resistance and the cutting resistance are improved, compared to a tire case having the outer circumferential portion configured of something other than the reinforcing cord layer .","In addition, since the reinforcing cord layer  is formed by winding the coated cord member B, the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction is improved. The improvement of the stiffness in the circumferential direction suppresses creeping (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases over time under a constant stress) in the tire case , and the pressure resistance with respect to the air pressure from the inside in the tire diameter direction is improved.","In the embodiment, the recesses and protrusions are configured on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , but the seventh aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed to be flat may be employed.","In addition, in the tire case , the reinforcing cord layer may be formed such that the coated cord member, which is wound around and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case, is covered with a thermoplastic material for coating. In this case, a coated layer can be formed by discharging a thermoplastic material for coating in a molten or softened state on the reinforcing cord layer . In addition, the coated layer may be formed by heating an adhesive sheet into a molten or softened state without using an extruder, and attaching the adhesive sheet to the surface (outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer .","The above Embodiment 7-2 employs a configuration in which partitioned case bodies (tire case half parts A) are bonded so as to form the tire case , but the seventh aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and the tire case  may be integrally formed using a mold or the like.","The tire  of Embodiment 7-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  in the rim , but the seventh aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape (for example, the shape illustrated in ).","In Embodiment 7-2, the cushion rubber  is disposed between the tire case  and the tread , but the seventh aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the cushion rubber  is not disposed may be employed.","In addition, Embodiment 7-2 employs a configuration in which the coated cord member B is wound around the crown portion  in a spiral shape, but the seventh aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is wound around to be discontinuous in the width direction may be employed.","Embodiment 7-2 employs a configuration in which a thermoplastic material is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the resin material for coating  is heated into a molten or softened state so as to weld the coated cord member B on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , but the seventh aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating the resin material for coating  may be employed.","In addition, a configuration in which a thermosetting resin is used as the resin material for coating  that forms a coated cord member B and the coated cord member B is welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating may be employed.","Furthermore, a configuration in which a thermosetting resin is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B and the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material may be employed. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating the portion provided with the coated cord member B of the tire case  into a molten or softened state.","In addition, furthermore, a configuration in which a thermoplastic material is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord rubber B, and the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating into a molten or softened state the portion of the tire case  at which the coated cord member B is provided, and heating the resin material for coating  into a molten or softened state. Meanwhile, when both the tire case  and the coated cord member B have been heated into a molten or softened state, since both are well mixed, the bonding strength is improved. In addition, when thermoplastic resin materials are used as both the resin material that forms the tire case  and the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, the thermoplastic resin materials are preferably the same kind of thermoplastic materials, particularly, the same thermoplastic material.","In addition, furthermore, an adhesive may be coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , on which the coarsening treatment has been carried out, after the surface of the outer circumferential surface S is activated using a corona treatment, a plasma treatment or the like, thereby increasing hydrophilicity.","In addition, furthermore, the order for manufacturing the tire  is not limited to the order in Embodiment 7-2, and may be appropriately changed.","Thus far, an embodiment according to the seventh aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the invention according to the seventh aspect is not limited to the above embodiment.","Thus far, the specific embodiments of the invention according to the seventh aspect of the invention have been described using Embodiment 7-1 and Embodiment 7-2, but the seventh aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiments.","Next, a resin material as a component of the tire frame according to an eighth aspect of the invention will be described, and, subsequently, a specific embodiment of the tire according to the eighth aspect of the invention will be described using the drawings.","[Resin Material]","The tire according to the eighth aspect of the invention is a tire including at least a circular tire frame formed of a resin material, and the resin material includes at least a thermoplastic elastomer and a resin which is other than the thermoplastic elastomer, has a glass transition temperature of 20\u00b0 C. or lower, and has an elastic modulus larger than the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic elastomer.","An elastic modulus can be obtained in a preferable range, and increase of the rolling resistance of the tire can be suppressed by applying a combination of a thermoplastic elastomer and a resin having a glass transition temperature in the above range, which is other than the thermoplastic elastomer, (the specific resin according to the eighth aspect of the invention) as the resin material that is a component of the circular tire frame that forms the tire.","Hereinafter, the thermoplastic elastomer and the specific resin according to the eighth aspect of the invention will be described.","[Thermoplastic Elastomer]","The \u201cthermoplastic elastomer\u201d refers to a resin material including a hard segment and a soft segment in a molecule thereof as described above, and, in detail, to a resin material which is an elastic macromolecular compound and is formed of a copolymer having a polymer constituting a hard segment that is crystalline and has a high melting point or a hard segment forming a pseudo-crosslink through physical agglomeration and a polymer constituting a soft segment that is non-crystalline and has a low glass transition temperature.

Therefore, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  in the reinforcing cord winding process (incorporation of air). When the adhesion and weldability to the reinforcing cord  are high, and, furthermore, air entrance into the periphery of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied or the like while travelling. Thereby, for example, even when a tire component member has been provided so as to cover the entire outer circumferential portion of the tire frame with the reinforcing cord member, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, the separation or the like of the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, in the tire  of the embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having a higher stiffness than the resin material is wound in a spiral shape in the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the resin material, the puncture resistance, the cutting resistance and the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction is improved. Meanwhile, the improvement of the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction prevents the creeping in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material.","In addition, in the cross-sectional view of the tire case  in the axial direction (the cross section illustrated in ), since at least some of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the resin material, and is adhered to the resin material, incorporation of air during manufacturing is suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied or the like while travelling is suppressed. Thereby, the separation or the like of the reinforcing cord , the tire case  and a tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is \u2155 of the diameter D or more as illustrated in , incorporation of air during manufacturing is effectively suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied or the like while travelling is further suppressed.","In addition, since the tread  that comes into contact with road surfaces is configured of a rubber material that has higher abrasion-resistance than the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Furthermore, since a circular bead core  formed of a metallic material is embedded in the bead portion , similarly to a pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, the tire case , that is, the tire  is strongly held to the rim .","In addition, furthermore, since a sealing layer  made of a rubber material having higher sealing properties than the resin material is provided in a portion that comes into contact with the rim  of the bead portion , the sealing properties between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Therefore, compared to when the tire is sealed with the rim  using the resin material, the air leakage in the tire is further suppressed. In addition, the rim fitting properties is also improved by providing the sealing layer .","The above embodiment employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated, and the resin material in the portion with which the heated reinforcing cord  comes into contact is melted or softened, but the eighth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion  after heating the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, using a hot air generating apparatus without heating the reinforcing cord .","In addition, in Embodiment 8-1, a heater and a fan are used as the heat source of a cord heating device , but the invention according to the eighth aspect is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated using radiation heat (for example, infrared rays or the like) may be employed. In addition, the reinforcing cord-embedded portion may be melted or softened by making the heat source of the hot air generating apparatus, for example, infrared rays converge at the portion at which the reinforcing cord  is embedded.","Furthermore, Embodiment 8-1 employs a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled using the second metal roller , but the eighth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled and solidified by directly blowing cold air to the portion in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened.","In addition, Embodiment 8-1 employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated; however, for example, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case  may be employed, and, in this case, it is possible to effectively suppress incorporation of air during embedding in the crown portion  by heating the thermoplastic resin material, which is coated with the reinforcing cord , when winding the coated reinforcing cord around the crown portion  of the tire case .","The tire  of Embodiment 8-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  in the rim , but the eighth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire may have a complete tube shape.","The tire having the complete tube shape may be an aspect in which, for example, three circular-shaped tire frames are disposed in the tire width direction as illustrated in .  is a cross-sectional view of the tire according to other embodiment.

In addition, since the resin material that forms the tire case  is dug out by the collision of a blasting abrasive, the wettability of a bond is improved. Thereby, a state in which the bond is uniformly coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  is held, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Particularly, even when protrusions and recesses are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the peripheries of the recess portions (recess walls and recess bottoms) are treated to be coarse by making the blasting abrasive collide with the recess portions (voids A), and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Meanwhile, since the cushion rubber  is laminated in the coarsening-treated areas on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be effectively ensured.","When the cushion rubber  has been vulcanized in the vulcanizing process, the cushion rubber  flows into the coarsened recesses and protrusions formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the coarsening treatment. In addition, when vulcanization is completed, the anchor effect is developed due to the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the coarsened recesses and protrusions so that the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is improved.","In the tire  manufactured using the above method of manufacturing a tire, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is ensured, that is, the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  is ensured through the cushion rubber . Thereby, the separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  and the cushion rubber  is suppressed while travelling and the like.","In addition, since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is configured of the reinforcing cord layer , the puncture resistance and the cutting resistance improve compared to a tire case having the outer circumferential portion configured of something other than the reinforcing cord layer .","In addition, since the reinforcing cord layer  is formed by winding the coated cord member B, the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction is improved. The improvement of the stiffness in the circumferential direction suppresses creeping (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases over time under a constant stress) in the tire case , and the pressure resistance with respect to the air pressure from the inside in the tire diameter direction is improved.","In the embodiment, the recesses and protrusions are configured on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , but the invention according to the eighth aspect is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed to be flat may be employed.","In addition, in the tire case , the reinforcing cord layer may be formed by covering the coated cord member, which is wound around and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case, with a thermoplastic material for coating.

Other portions are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-1, and the manufacturing method is the same as well.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the resin material further including the second thermoplastic elastomer in addition to the first thermoplastic elastomer and the specific resin according to the ninth aspect of the invention, the elastic modulus of the tire case  can be controlled, and an increase in the rolling resistance of the tire can be suppressed.","In addition, the resin material has a high adhesion to the reinforcing cord , and, furthermore, is excellent in terms of fixing performances, such as weld strength. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  in the reinforcing cord winding step (incorporation of air). When the adhesion and weldability to the reinforcing cord  are high, and, furthermore, incorporation of air into the periphery of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to, for example, a force applied while travelling. Thereby, for example, even when a tire-constituting member has been provided so as to cover the entire outer circumferential portion of the tire frame with the reinforcing cord member, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, the separation or the like of the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, in the tire  of the embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having a higher stiffness than the resin material is wound in a spiral shape in the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the resin material, the puncture resistance, the cutting resistance and the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction are improved. Meanwhile, the improvement of the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction prevents the creeping in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material.","In addition, in the cross-sectional view of the tire case  in the axial direction (the cross section illustrated in ), since at least some of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the resin material, and is adhered to the resin material, incorporation of air during manufacturing is suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to a force applied or the like while travelling is suppressed. Thereby, the separation or the like of the reinforcing cord , the tire case  and a tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is equal to or greater than \u2155 of the diameter D as illustrated in , incorporation of air during manufacturing is effectively suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  due to input power or the like while travelling is further suppressed.","In addition, since the tread  that comes into contact with road surfaces is constituted of a rubber material that is more abrasion-resistant than the resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Furthermore, since a annular bead core  made of a metallic material is embedded in the bead portion , similarly to a pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, the tire case , that is, the tire  is strongly held to the rim .","In addition, furthermore, since a sealing layer  formed of a rubber material having higher sealing properties than the resin material is provided in a portion that comes into contact with the rim  of the bead portion , the sealing properties between the tire  and the rim  is improved. Therefore, compared to when the tire is sealed with the rim  using the resin material, the air leakage in the tire is further suppressed. In addition, rim fitting properties also are improved when the sealing layer  is provided.","The above embodiment employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated, and the resin material in the portion with which the heated reinforcing cord  comes into contact is melted or softened, but the invention according to the ninth aspect is not limited to this configuration, and the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion  after heating the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, using a hot air generating apparatus without heating the reinforcing cord .","In addition, in Embodiment 9-1, a heater and a fan are used as the heat source of a cord-heating device , but the ninth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated using radiation heat (for example, ultraviolet rays or the like) may be employed.

Similarly to the above Embodiment 9-1, the tire of the present embodiment exhibits almost the same cross-sectional shape as an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art.","Here, the tire according to Embodiment 9-2 is the same as the above Embodiment 1-2 except for the following facts. Therefore, the same reference signs and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","In the tire of Embodiment 9-2, similarly to the above Embodiment 9-1, the tire case  is formed of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (UBESTA, XPA9048 manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.), an acid-modified polyolefin (ADOMER QF551 manufactured by Mitsui Chemicals, Inc., a glass transition temperature \u221213\u00b0 C.) and an olefin-based thermoplastic elastomer including polypropylene (PRIME TPO F-3740 manufactured by Prime Polymer Co., Ltd.) (hereinafter referred to simply as \u201cresin material\u201d in the description of Embodiment 9-2). Other portions are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-2, and the manufacturing method is the same as well.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the resin material further including the above second thermoplastic elastomer resin in addition to the first thermoplastic elastomer and the specific resin according to the ninth aspect of the invention, elastic modulus of the tire case  can be controlled, and an increase in the rolling resistance of the tire can be suppressed.","In the method of manufacturing the tire of the embodiment, when the tire case , a cushion rubber  and a tread rubber A are integrated, since the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been treated to be coarse, the bonding properties (adhesion) is improved due to an anchor effect. In addition, since the resin material that forms the tire case  is dug out by the collision of a blasting abrasive, wettability of a bond is improved. Thereby, a state in which the bond is uniformly coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  is held, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Particularly, even when protrusions and recesses are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the peripheries of the recess portions (recess walls and recess bottoms) are treated to be coarse by making the blasting abrasive collide with the recess portions (voids A), and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Meanwhile, since the cushion rubber  is laminated in the coarsening-treated areas on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be effectively ensured.","When the cushion rubber  has been vulcanized in the vulcanizing step, the cushion rubber  flows into the coarsened recessed and protrusions formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the coarsening treatment. In addition, when vulcanization is completed, anchor effect is developed due to the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the coarsened recesses and protrusions so that the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is improved.","The tire  manufactured using the above method of manufacturing a tire ensures the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber , that is, ensures the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  through the cushion rubber . Thereby, the separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  and the cushion rubber  at travelling and the like is suppressed.","In addition, since the outer circumferential portion of the tire case  is provided with the reinforcing cord layer , the puncture resistance and the cutting resistance are improved compared to a tire case having the outer circumferential portion constituted of something other than the reinforcing cord layer .","In addition, since the reinforcing cord layer  is formed by winding the coated cord member B, the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction is improved. The improvement of the stiffness in the circumferential direction suppresses creeping (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases over time under a constant stress) in the tire case , and the pressure resistance with respect to the air pressure from the inside in the tire diameter direction is improved.","In the embodiment, the recesses and protrusions are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , but the ninth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed to be flat may be employed.","In addition, in the tire case , the reinforcing cord layer may be formed by covering the coated cord member, which is wound around and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case, with a thermoplastic material for coating. In this case, a coated layer can be formed by discharging a thermoplastic material for coating in a molten or softened state on the reinforcing cord layer .

In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating into a molten or softened state the portion at which the coated cord member B of the tire case  is provided.","In addition, furthermore, a configuration in which the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord rubber B is used as a thermoplastic material and the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material.

Meanwhile, when both the tire case  and the coated cord member B have been heated into a molten or softened state, since both are well mixed, the bonding strength is improved. In addition, when thermoplastic resin materials are used as both the resin material that forms the tire case  and the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, the thermoplastic resin materials are preferably the same kind of thermoplastic materials, particularly, the same thermoplastic material.","In addition, furthermore, an adhesive may be coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , on which the coarsening treatment has been carried out, after the surface of the outer circumferential surface S is activated using a corona treatment, a plasma treatment or the like so as to increase the hydrophilicity.","In addition, furthermore, the order for manufacturing the tire  is not limited to the order in Embodiment 9-1, and may be appropriately changed.","Thus far, an embodiment according to the ninth aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the invention according to the ninth aspect is not limited to the above embodiment.","Thus far, the specific aspects of the invention according to the ninth aspect have been described using Embodiment 9-1 and Embodiment 9-2, but the invention according to the ninth aspect is not limited to the above aspects.","Next, a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester thermoplastic elastomer, which constitutes the tire frame in the tenth aspect of the invention, and a resin material as a component of the reinforcing cord layer will be described, and, subsequently, a specific embodiment of the tire of the tenth aspect of the invention will be described using the drawings.","[Thermoplastic Resin]","A tire of the tenth aspect of the invention includes at least a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer.","Here, the \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d refers to a thermoplastic resin material which is made of a copolymer including a polymer that constitutes a crystalline hard segment having a high melting point, and a polymer that constitutes a non-crystalline soft segment having a low glass transition temperature, and which has an amide bond (\u2014CONH\u2014) in the main chain of the polymer that constitutes the hard segment.

The mixing ratio between the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer is based on the ratio described above. The resin obtained through melting and mixing can be used in a pellet shape as necessary.","The tensile modulus of elasticity, which is defined in JIS K7113:1995, of the thermoplastic resin material according to the tenth aspect of the invention is preferably 100 MPa to 1000 MPa, more preferably 100 MPa to 800 MPa, and particularly preferably 100 MPa to 700 MPa.

Therefore, the same reference numerals and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","The tire case  of the present embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9048X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cHYTREL5557\u201d manufactured by Du Pont-Toray Co., Ltd.) at a mass ratio of 75:25. In the present embodiment, the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the tenth aspect of the invention alone, but the tenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and, similarly to an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, other thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics may be used in the respective portions (the side portions , the crown portion , the bead portions , and the like) of the tire case . Other points are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-1, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9048X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cHYTREL5557\u201d manufactured by Du Pont-Toray Co., Ltd.) at a mass ratio of 75:25, thermal resistance, tensile modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and fracture strain are excellent, and the temperature dependency of the tensile yield strength is small. Furthermore, the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art. Therefore, the tire  of the present embodiment is excellent in terms of durability, is not easily influenced by a change in temperature, and exhibits low fuel consumption when used in an automobile.","In addition, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, which is one of the components of the thermoplastic resin material, has high adhesion properties to the reinforcing cord , and, furthermore, is excellent in terms of fixing performances, such as weld strength. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  in the reinforcing cord winding process (incorporation of air). When the adhesion properties and weldability to the reinforcing cord  are high, and, furthermore, incorporation of air into the periphery of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like. Thereby, for example, even when a tire-constituting member has been provided so as to cover the entirety of the reinforcing cord member on the outer circumference of the tire frame, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, the separation or the like of the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, in the tire  of the present embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having a higher stiffness than the thermoplastic resin material is helically wound in the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the puncture resistance, the cutting resistance and the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction are improved. Meanwhile, the improvement of the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction prevents the creeping in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material.","In addition, in the cross-sectional view of the tire case  along the axial direction (the cross section illustrated in ), since at least a portion of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, and is adhered to the thermoplastic resin material, incorporation of air during manufacturing is suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is suppressed. Thereby, the separation or the like of the reinforcing cord , the tire case  and the tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is \u2155 or more of the diameter D as illustrated in , incorporation of air during manufacturing is effectively suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is further suppressed.","When the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the thermoplastic resin material as described above, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to the case when the reinforcing cord  is fixed using cushion rubber, the reinforcing cord  can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, since the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and collected from the thermoplastic resin material through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire . In addition, the resin material generally has a low loss factor (Tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubber. Therefore, when the reinforcing cord layer includes a large amount of the resin material, it is possible to improve the rolling properties of the tire. Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber is advantageous in that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and steering stability and abrasion resistance during driving with the tire are also excellent.","In addition, since the tread  that comes into contact with road surfaces is made of a rubber material that is more abrasion-resistant than the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Furthermore, since an annular bead core  made of a metallic material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case , that is, the tire  is strongly held to the rim  similarly to a pneumatic rubber tire of the related art.","In addition, furthermore, since a sealing layer  made of a rubber material having higher sealing properties than the thermoplastic resin material is provided in a portion, which comes into contact with the rim , of the bead portion , the sealing properties between the tire  and the rim  are improved. Therefore, compared to the case when sealing is carried out between the rim  and the thermoplastic resin material, the air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. In addition, the rim fitting properties are also improved when the sealing layer  is provided.","The above embodiment employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated, and the thermoplastic resin material in the portion with which the heated reinforcing cord  comes into contact is melted or softened, but the tenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion  after heating the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, using a hot air generating apparatus without heating the reinforcing cord .","In addition, in Embodiment 10-1, a heater and a fan are used as the heat source of a cord heating device , but the tenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated using radiation heat (for example, infrared rays or the like) may be employed.","Furthermore, Embodiment 10-1 employs a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled using the second metal roller , but the tenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled and solidified by directly blowing cold air to the portion in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened may be employed.","In addition, Embodiment 10-1 employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated; however, for example, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case  may be employed, and, in this case, it is possible to effectively suppress incorporation of air during embedding in the crown portion  by heating the reinforcing cord  and the coating of the thermoplastic resin material when winding the coated reinforcing cord around the crown portion  of the tire case .","In addition, the helical winding of the reinforcing cord  is easy in the manufacturing, but a method, in which the reinforcing cord  is formed to be discontinuous in the width direction, or the like can be also considered.","The tire  of Embodiment 10-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  on the rim , but the tenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire may have a complete tube shape.","Thus far, an embodiment of the tenth aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the tenth aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","Next, the tire and the method of manufacturing the tire of the tenth aspect of the invention according to Embodiment 10-2 will be described according to the drawings.

Furthermore, since the tire structure can be simplified, the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art. Therefore, the tire  of the present embodiment is excellent in terms of durability, is not easily influenced by a change in temperature, and exhibits low fuel consumption when used in an automobile.","In addition, when the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the coated cord member B, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to the case when the reinforcing cord A is simply fixed using cushion rubber , the coated cord member B can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, since the cord member A can be easily separated and collected from the coated cord member B through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire .

Therefore, the same reference numerals and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","The tire case  of the present embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material made of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a Zn ionomer of an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer (\u201cHIMILAN, 1855Zn\u201d manufactured by Du Pont-Mitsui Polychemicals Co., Ltd.). In the present embodiment, the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the eleventh aspect of the invention alone, but the eleventh aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and, similarly to an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, other thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics may be used in the respective portions (the side portions , the crown portion , the bead portions , and the like) of the tire case . Other points are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-1, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","The tire case  of the present embodiment is a pair of the mutually bonded tire case half parts (tire frame pieces) A that are formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the eleventh aspect of the invention. The tire case is formed by making the circular tire case half parts A having the same shape face each other and bonding the parts at the tire equatorial plane portion, wherein each of the parts is integrally formed by injection molding or the like and includes one bead portion , one side portion  and a half-width crown portion . The thermoplastic resin material according to the eleventh aspect of the invention includes a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the specific copolymer.","Meanwhile, the tire case  is not limited to a tire case formed by bonding two members, and may be formed by bonding three or more members.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the eleventh aspect of the invention, the impact resistance is excellent, and the temperature dependency of the tensile yield strength is suppressed. Furthermore, since the tire structure can be simplified, the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art. Therefore, when the tire  of the present embodiment is applied to an automobile, the durability is excellent, and the tire is unlikely to be deformed due to a change in temperature or the like. In addition, since the weight of the tire can be decreased, it is possible to improve the fuel consumption of an automobile in which the tire is used.","In addition, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, which is one of the components of the thermoplastic resin material, has high adhesion properties to the reinforcing cord , and, furthermore, is excellent in terms of fixing performances, such as weld strength. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  in the reinforcing cord winding process (incorporation of air). When the adhesion properties and weldability to the reinforcing cord  are high, and, furthermore, incorporation of air into the periphery of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like. Thereby, for example, even when a tire-constituting member has been provided so as to cover the entirety of the reinforcing cord member on the outer circumference of the tire frame, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, the separation or the like of the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, in the tire  of the present embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having a higher stiffness than the thermoplastic resin material is helically wound in the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the puncture resistance, the cutting resistance and the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction are improved. Meanwhile, the improvement of the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction prevents the creeping in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material.","In addition, in the cross-sectional view of the tire case  along the axial direction (the cross section illustrated in ), since at least a portion of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, and is adhered to the thermoplastic resin material, incorporation of air during manufacturing is suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is suppressed. Thereby, the separation or the like of the reinforcing cord , the tire case  and the tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is \u2155 or more of the diameter D as illustrated in , incorporation of air during manufacturing is effectively suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is further suppressed.","When the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the thermoplastic resin material as described above, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to the case when the reinforcing cord  is fixed using cushion rubber, the reinforcing cord  can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, since the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and collected from the thermoplastic resin material through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire . In addition, the resin material generally has a low loss factor (Tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubber. Therefore, when the reinforcing cord layer includes a large amount of the resin material, it is possible to improve the rolling properties of the tire. Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber is advantageous in that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and steering stability and abrasion resistance during driving with the tire are also excellent.","In addition, since the tread  that comes into contact with road surfaces is made of a rubber material that is more abrasion-resistant than the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Furthermore, since an annular bead core  made of a metallic material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case , that is, the tire  is strongly held to the rim  similarly to a pneumatic rubber tire of the related art.","In addition, furthermore, since the sealing layer  made of a rubber material having higher sealing properties than the thermoplastic resin material is provided in a portion, which comes into contact with the rim , of the bead portion , the sealing properties between the tire  and the rim  are improved. Therefore, compared to the case when sealing is carried out between the rim  and the thermoplastic resin material, the air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. In addition, the rim fitting properties are also improved when the sealing layer  is provided.","The above embodiment employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated, and the thermoplastic resin material in the portion with which the heated reinforcing cord  comes into contact is melted or softened, but the eleventh aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion  after heating the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, using a hot air generating apparatus without heating the reinforcing cord .","In addition, in Embodiment 11-1, a heater and a fan are used as the heat source of a cord heating device , but the eleventh aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated using radiation heat (for example, infrared rays or the like) may be employed.","Furthermore, Embodiment 11-1 employs a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled using the second metal roller , but the eleventh aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled and solidified by directly blowing cold air to the portion in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened may be employed.","In addition, Embodiment 11-1 employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated; however, for example, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case  may be employed, and, in this case, it is possible to effectively suppress incorporation of air during embedding in the crown portion  by heating the reinforcing cord  and the coating of the thermoplastic resin material when winding the coated reinforcing cord around the crown portion  of the tire case .","In addition, the helical winding of the reinforcing cord  is easy in the manufacturing, but a method, in which the reinforcing cord  is formed to be discontinuous in the width direction, or the like can be also considered.","The tire  of Embodiment 11-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  on the rim , but the eleventh aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire may have a complete tube shape.","The tire having the complete tube shape may be a configuration in which, for example, three tire frames formed into a circular shape are disposed in the tire width direction as illustrated in .  is a cross-sectional view of the tire according to other embodiment. As illustrated in , the tire  has the tread rubber layer , hollow tubes (tire frame)  which are made of the same resin material as in Embodiment 11-1 and are formed into the circular shape, the belt (reinforcing cord)  and the rim . Three tubes  are disposed in series in the tire width direction of the tire . The tread rubber layer , in which the belt  is embedded, is adhered to the outer circumferences of the tubes . In addition, the tubes  are mounted on the rim  having recess portions that engage with the tubes . Meanwhile, the bead core is not provided in the tire .","Thus far, an embodiment of the eleventh aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the eleventh aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","Next, the tire and the method of manufacturing the tire of the eleventh aspect of the invention according to Embodiment 11-2 will be described according to the drawings. Similarly to the above Embodiment 11-1, the tire of the present embodiment exhibits substantially the same cross-sectional shape as an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art. Here, the tire according to Embodiment 11-2 is the same as the above Embodiment 1-2 except for the following points. Therefore, the same reference numerals and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","In the tire of Embodiment 11-2, similarly to the above Embodiment 11-1, the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material made of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a Zn ionomer of an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer (\u201cHIMILAN, 1855Zn\u201d manufactured by Du Pont-Mitsui Polychemicals Co., Ltd.).","In addition, the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is preferably set in a range of 0.1 times to 10 times the elastic modulus of a resin material that forms the tire case . When the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 10 times or less the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the crown portion does not become too hard, and fitting onto a rim can be easily carried out. In addition, when the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 0.1 times or more the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the resin as a component of the reinforcing cord layer  does not become too soft, and the belt in-plane shear stiffness is excellent and the cornering force is improved. Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, as the resin material for coating , the same material as the thermoplastic resin material (in the present embodiment, a thermoplastic resin material made of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and a Zn ionomer of an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer (\u201cHIMILAN, 1855Zn\u201d manufactured by Du Pont-Mitsui Polychemicals Co., Ltd.)) is used. Other points are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-2, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the impact resistance is excellent, and the temperature dependency of the tensile yield strength is suppressed. Therefore, when the tire  of the present embodiment is applied to an automobile, the durability is excellent, and the tire is unlikely to be deformed due to a change in temperature or the like.","Furthermore, since the tire structure can be simplified, the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art. Therefore, since the weight of the tire  of the present embodiment can be decreased, it is possible to improve the fuel consumption of an automobile in which the tire is used.","In addition, when the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the coated cord member B, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to the case when the reinforcing cord A is simply fixed using cushion rubber , the coated cord member B can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, since the cord member A can be easily separated and collected from the coated cord member B through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire .

Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber is advantageous in that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and steering stability and abrasion resistance during driving with the tire are also excellent.","In the method of manufacturing the tire of the present embodiment, when the tire case , the cushion rubber  and a tread rubber A are integrated, since the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to a roughening treatment, the bonding properties (adhesion properties) are improved due to the anchor effect. In addition, since the resin material that forms the tire case  is dug up by the collision of a blasting abrasive, the wettability of a bonding agent is improved. Thereby, a state in which the bonding agent is uniformly coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  is held, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Particularly, even when protrusions and recesses are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the peripheries of the recess portions (recess walls and recess bottoms) are subjected to a roughening treatment by making the blasting abrasive collide with the recess portions (voids A), and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Meanwhile, since the cushion rubber  is laminated in the roughening-treated areas on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber can be effectively ensured.","When the cushion rubber  has been vulcanized in a vulcanizing process, the cushion rubber  flows into the roughened recesses and protrusions formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment.

Therefore, the same reference numerals and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","The tire case  of the present embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material made of a mixed material of a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA, XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.), the specific copolymer (an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer \u201cNUCREL, N035C\u201d manufactured by Du Pont-Mitsui Polychemicals Co., Ltd.) and the specific acid-modified copolymer (an acid-modified product of an ethylene-acrylate ethyl ester copolymer \u201cHPR, AR2011\u201d manufactured by Du Pont-Mitsui Polychemicals Co., Ltd.). In the present embodiment, the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the twelfth aspect of the invention alone, but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and, similarly to an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, other thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics may be used in the respective portions (the side portions , the crown portion , the bead portions , and the like) of the tire case . Other points are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 12, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the twelfth aspect of the invention, the impact resistance and the fracture properties are excellent. Furthermore, since the tire structure can be simplified, the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art. Therefore, when the tire  of the present embodiment is applied to an automobile, the durability is excellent. In addition, since the weight of the tire can be decreased, it is possible to improve the fuel consumption of an automobile in which the tire is used.","In addition, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, which is one of the components of the thermoplastic resin material, has high adhesion properties to the reinforcing cord , and, furthermore, is excellent in terms of fixing performances, such as weld strength. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  in the reinforcing cord winding process (incorporation of air). When the adhesion properties and weldability to the reinforcing cord  are high, and, furthermore, incorporation of air into the periphery of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like. Thereby, for example, even when a tire-constituting member has been provided so as to cover the entirety of the reinforcing cord member on the outer circumference of the tire frame, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, the separation or the like of the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, in the tire  of the present embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having a higher stiffness than the thermoplastic resin material is helically wound in the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the puncture resistance, the cutting resistance and the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction are improved. Meanwhile, the improvement of the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction prevents the creeping in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material.","In addition, in the cross-sectional view of the tire case  along the axial direction (the cross section illustrated in ), since at least a portion of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, and is adhered to the thermoplastic resin material, incorporation of air during manufacturing is suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is suppressed. Thereby, the separation or the like of the reinforcing cord , the tire case  and the tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is \u2155 or more of the diameter D as illustrated in , incorporation of air during manufacturing is effectively suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is further suppressed.","When the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the thermoplastic resin material as described above, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to the case when the reinforcing cord  is fixed using cushion rubber, the reinforcing cord  can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord is a steel cord, since the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and collected from the thermoplastic resin material through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire . In addition, the resin material generally has a low loss factor (Tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubber. Therefore, when the reinforcing cord layer includes a large amount of the resin material, it is possible to improve the rolling properties of the tire. Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber is advantageous in that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and steering stability and abrasion resistance during driving with the tire are also excellent.","In addition, since the tread  that comes into contact with road surfaces is made of a rubber material that is more abrasion-resistant than the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Furthermore, since an annular bead core  made of a metallic material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case , that is, the tire  is strongly held to the rim  similarly to a pneumatic rubber tire of the related art.","In addition, furthermore, since the sealing layer  made of a rubber material having higher sealing properties than the thermoplastic resin material is provided in a portion, which comes into contact with the rim , of the bead portion , the sealing properties between the tire  and the rim  are improved. Therefore, compared to the case when sealing is carried out between the rim  and the thermoplastic resin material, the air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. In addition, the rim fitting properties are also improved when the sealing layer  is provided.","The above embodiment employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated, and the thermoplastic resin material in the portion with which the heated reinforcing cord  comes into contact is melted or softened, but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion  after heating the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, using a hot air generating apparatus without heating the reinforcing cord .","In addition, in Embodiment 12-1, a heater and a fan are used as the heat source of a cord heating device , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated using radiation heat (for example, infrared rays or the like) may be employed.","Furthermore, Embodiment 12-1 employs a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled using the second metal roller , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled and solidified by directly blowing cold air to the portion in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened may be employed.","In addition, Embodiment 12-1 employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated; however, for example, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case  may be employed, and, in this case, it is possible to effectively suppress incorporation of air during embedding in the crown portion  by heating the reinforcing cord  and the coating of the thermoplastic resin material when winding the coated reinforcing cord around the crown portion  of the tire case .","In addition, the helical winding of the reinforcing cord  is easy in the manufacturing, but a method, in which the reinforcing cord  is formed to be discontinuous in the width direction, or the like can be also considered.","The tire  of Embodiment 12-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  on the rim , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire may have a complete tube shape.","The tire having the complete tube shape may be a configuration in which, for example, three tire frames formed into a circular shape are disposed in the tire width direction as illustrated in .  is a cross-sectional view of the tire according to other embodiment. As illustrated in , the tire  has the tread rubber layer , hollow tubes (tire frame)  which are made of the same resin material as in Embodiment 12-1 and are formed into the circular shape, the belt (reinforcing cord)  and the rim . Three tubes  are disposed in series in the tire width direction of the tire . The tread rubber layer , in which the belt  is embedded, is adhered to the outer circumferences of the tubes . In addition, the tubes  are mounted on the rim  having recess portions that engage with the tubes . Meanwhile, the bead core is not provided in the tire .","Thus far, an embodiment of the twelfth aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","Next, the tire and the method of manufacturing the tire of the twelfth aspect of the invention according to Embodiment 12-2 will be described according to the drawings. Similarly to the above Embodiment 12-1, the tire of the present embodiment exhibits substantially the same cross-sectional shape as an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art.

Other points are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 1-2, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","In addition, the elastic modulus of a resin material for coating  is preferably set in a range of 0.1 times to 10 times the elastic modulus of a resin material that forms the tire case . When the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 10 times or less the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the crown portion does not become too hard, and fitting onto a rim can be easily carried out. In addition, when the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 0.1 times or more the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the resin as a component of the reinforcing cord layer  does not become too soft, and the belt in-plane shear stiffness is excellent and the cornering force is improved.

In addition, since the resin material that forms the tire case  is dug up by the collision of a blasting abrasive, the wettability of a bonding agent is improved. Thereby, a state in which the bonding agent is uniformly coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  is held, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Particularly, even when protrusions and recesses are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the peripheries of the recess portions (recess walls and recess bottoms) are subjected to a roughening treatment by making the blasting abrasive collide with the recess portions (voids A), and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Meanwhile, since the cushion rubber  is laminated in the roughening-treated areas on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber can be effectively ensured.","When the cushion rubber  has been vulcanized in a vulcanizing process, the cushion rubber  flows into the roughened recesses and protrusions formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. In addition, when vulcanization is completed, the anchor effect is developed due to the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the roughened recesses and protrusions so that the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is improved.","The tire  manufactured using the above method of manufacturing a tire ensures the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber , that is, ensures the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  through the cushion rubber . Thereby, the separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  and the cushion rubber  is suppressed at the time of driving or the like.","In addition, since the outer circumference of the tire case  is made of the reinforcing cord layer , the puncture resistance and the cutting resistance are improved compared to a case in which the outer circumference is made of something other than the reinforcing cord layer .","In addition, since the reinforcing cord layer  is formed by winding the coated cord member B, the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction is improved. The improvement of the stiffness in the circumferential direction suppresses creeping (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases over time under a constant stress) in the tire case , and the pressure resistance with respect to the air pressure from the inside in the tire radial direction is improved.","In the present embodiment, the recesses and protrusions are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed to be flat may be employed.","In addition, in the tire case , the reinforcing cord layer may be formed by covering the coated cord member, which is wound around and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case, with a thermoplastic material for coating. In this case, a coating layer can be formed by discharging a thermoplastic material for coating in a molten or softened state on the reinforcing cord layer . In addition, the coating layer may be formed by heating a welding sheet into a molten or softened state without using an extruder, and attaching the welding sheet to the surface (outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer .","The above Embodiment 12-2 employs a configuration in which case divided parts (tire case half parts A) are bonded so as to form the tire case , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and the tire case  may be integrally formed using a mold or the like.","The tire  of Embodiment 12-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  on the rim , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape (for example, the shape illustrated in ).","In Embodiment 12-2, the cushion rubber  is disposed between the tire case  and the tread , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the cushion rubber  is not disposed may be employed.","In addition, Embodiment 12-2 employs a configuration in which the coated cord member B is helically wound around the crown portion , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is wound to be discontinuous in the width direction may be employed.","Embodiment 12-2 employs a configuration in which a thermoplastic material is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the resin material for coating  is heated into a molten or softened state so as to weld the coated cord member B on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating the resin material for coating  may be employed.","In addition, a configuration in which a thermosetting resin is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating may be employed.","Furthermore, a configuration in which a thermosetting resin is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material may be employed. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating the portion, which is to be provided with the coated cord member B, of the tire case  into a molten or softened state.","In addition, furthermore, a configuration in which a thermoplastic material is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material may be employed. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating the portion, which is to be provided with the coated cord member B, of the tire case  into a molten or softened state, and heating the resin material for coating  into a molten or softened state. Meanwhile, when both the tire case  and the coated cord member B have been heated into a molten or softened state, since both are well mixed, the bonding strength is improved. In addition, when thermoplastic resin materials are used as both the resin material that forms the tire case  and the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, the thermoplastic resin materials are preferably the same kind of thermoplastic materials, particularly, the same thermoplastic material.","In addition, furthermore, an adhesive may be coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , after the surface of the outer circumferential surface S, on which the roughening treatment has been carried out, is activated using a corona treatment, a plasma treatment or the like so as to increase the hydrophilicity.","In addition, furthermore, the order for manufacturing the tire  is not limited to the order in Embodiment 12-2, and may be appropriately changed.","Thus far, an embodiment of the twelfth aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","Thus far, the specific embodiments according to the twelfth aspect of the invention have been described using Embodiment 12-1 and Embodiment 12-2, but the twelfth aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiments.","Next, a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber that constitutes the tire frame in the thirteenth aspect of the invention, and a resin material as a component of the reinforcing cord layer will be described, and, subsequently, a specific embodiment of the tire of the thirteenth aspect of the invention will be described using the drawings.","[Thermoplastic Resin Material]","The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the invention includes a circular tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material including at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and a rubber.","\u2014Polyamide-Based Thermoplastic Elastomer\u2014","The polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is an elastic macromolecular compound, and refers to a thermoplastic resin material which is made of a copolymer including a polymer that constitutes a crystalline hard segment having a high melting point, and a polymer that constitutes a non-crystalline soft segment having a low glass transition temperature, and which has an amide bond (\u2014CONH\u2014) in the main chain of the polymer that constitutes the hard segment. As the \u201cpolyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d in the present embodiment, the same polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer as in the above first aspect of the invention can be used.","\u2014Rubber\u2014","The \u201crubber\u201d is an elastic macromolecular compound.","As described above, the rubber is distinguished from the thermoplastic elastomer which is a thermoplastic resin material made of a copolymer including a polymer that constitutes a crystalline hard segment having a high melting point, and a polymer that constitutes a non-crystalline soft segment having a low glass transition temperature.","The rubber is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include natural rubber (NR), isoprene rubber (IR), butadiene rubber (BR), styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber (SBR), acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber (NBR), chloroprene rubber (CR), butyl rubber (IIR), halogenated butyl rubber (Br-IIR, Cl-IIR, and the like), ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM), and the like. NIR obtained by substituting all butadiene in the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber with isoprene or NBIR obtained by substituting some of butadiene with isoprene may be used.","Among the above, BR, SBR, NBR, NIR and NBIR are preferable, and BR, SBR, IR and NBR are more preferable from the viewpoint of the easy control of the flexibility of the thermoplastic resin material.","From the viewpoint of increasing the elastic modulus of the rubber, fixing the diameter of dispersed rubber particles, and improving creeping, vulcanized rubber obtained by vulcanizing rubber may be used as the rubber. Rubber may be vulcanized using a known method, and examples of the method include the methods described in JP-A No. 11-048264, JP-A No. 11-029658, JP-A No. 2003-238744, and the like. The rubber is preferably grinded for miniaturization and injected when blended with the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. It is particularly preferable to use dynamic crosslinking in which the rubber is dispersed and crosslinked (vulcanized) while kneading the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber.","The rubber may be vulcanized by, for example, arbitrarily mixing a reinforcing material, such as carbon black, a filler, a vulcanizing agent, a vulcanization accelerator, a fatty acid or a salt thereof, a metallic oxide, a process oil, an age inhibitor, and the like with the rubber, kneading the components using a Banbury mixer, and then heating the components at 120\u00b0 C. to 235\u00b0 C.","As the vulcanizing agent, a known vulcanizing agent, for example, sulfur, an organic peroxide, a resin vulcanizing agent, or the like is used.","As the vulcanization accelerator, a known vulcanization accelerator, for example, aldehyde, ammonia, amine, guanidine, thiourea, thiasol, sulfenamide, thiuram, dithiocarbamate, xanthate, or the like is used.","Examples of the fatty acid include stearic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, lauric acid and the like, and the above may be blended in a salt state, such as zinc stearate.

When the mass ratio between these elastomers is from 95:5 to 50:50, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber can have the characteristics of the rubber while maintaining the characteristics of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer so that the elastic modulus of the tire can be easily controlled while maintaining the weldability between the reinforcing cord member and the tire frame through the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, whereby the durability of the tire is further improved.

Furthermore, it is considered that, due to the interaction between the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the acid-modified portion, the tensile strength is improved, ductile fracture occurs even in the case of fracturing, and brittle fracture or lamellar fracture is not easily caused. The occurrence of ductile fracture, brittle fracture and lamellar fracture can be checked by visually observing the fractured surface of the thermoplastic resin material.","Here, the \u201chigh affinity for rubber\u201d refers to a state in which the molecular skeleton of the rubber and the molecular skeleton of the thermoplastic elastomer are similar so that the rubber is incorporated into the dispersed particles of the thermoplastic elastomer or the thermoplastic elastomer is incorporated into the dispersed particles of the rubber when the thermoplastic elastomer is mixed together with the rubber.","However, not all the thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber in the thermoplastic resin material need to be in the above state, and the thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber in the thermoplastic resin material may be partially in the above state.","For example, when the skeleton that constitutes the main chain of the polymer that constitutes the hard segment or the soft segment in the thermoplastic elastomer is similar to the skeleton that constitutes the main chain of the rubber molecules, the thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber are considered to have high affinities for each other. Specifically, with respect to styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber (SBR), examples of the rubber affinity thermoplastic elastomer include a polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomer (particularly SEBS). In addition, with respect to butadiene rubber (BR) and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM), examples of the rubber affinity thermoplastic elastomer include a polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomer.","In addition, the rubber affinity thermoplastic elastomer is preferably an acid-modified thermoplastic elastomer in which an acid group (for example, a carboxy group) is introduced into some of the thermoplastic elastomer particles. When the rubber affinity thermoplastic elastomer is acid-modified, it is possible to further improve the fine dispersion of the rubber due to the interaction between the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the acid-modified portions in the thermoplastic resin material.","The rubber affinity thermoplastic elastomer is not particularly limited as long as it is a thermoplastic elastomer other than the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and has a high affinity for the rubber, and examples thereof include polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomers, polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomers, polyester-based thermoplastic elastomers, polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomers and the like. Polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomers and styrene-based thermoplastic thermoplastic elastomers are preferable.","Next, polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomers, polystyrene-based thermoplastic elastomers, polyester-based thermoplastic elastomers, and polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomers, which can constitute the rubber affinity thermoplastic elastomer, will be described.","(Polyolefin-Based Thermoplastic Elastomer)","The \u201cpolyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomer\u201d is an elastic macromolecular compound, and refers to a thermoplastic resin material made of a copolymer including a polymer that constitutes a crystalline hard segment having a high melting point, and a polymer that constitutes a non-crystalline soft segment having a low glass transition temperature, in which the polymer that constitutes the hard segment is a polyolefin, such as polypropylene or polyethylene.

When the tensile elongation at break of the resin material is 50% or more, it is possible to improve the fittability onto a rim and avoid fracture due to collision.","The deflection temperature under load (under a load of 0.45 MPa), which is defined in ISO75-2 or ASTM D648, of the thermoplastic resin material according to the thirteenth aspect of the invention is preferably 50\u00b0 C. or more, preferably 50\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C., and still more preferably 50\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C. When the deflection temperature under load of the thermoplastic resin material is 50\u00b0 C. or more, it is possible to suppress deformation of a tire frame even when vulcanization is carried out in the production of a tire.","[The Resin Material as a Component of the Reinforcing Cord Layer]","The tire of the thirteenth aspect of the invention may have the reinforcing cord member which is wound around the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction so as to form the reinforcing cord layer.","The \u201cresin material as a component of the reinforcing cord layer\u201d according to the thirteenth aspect of the invention is the same as the [resin material as a component of the reinforcing cord layer] according to the first aspect of the invention.","Hereinafter, a tire according to Embodiment 13-1 of the tire of the thirteenth aspect of the invention will be described according to the drawings.","Here, the tire according to Embodiment 13-1 is the same as the above Embodiment 13 except for the following points. Therefore, the same reference numerals and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","The tire case  of the present embodiment is formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and butadiene rubber (BR) at a mass ratio of 70:30. In the present embodiment, the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material according to the thirteenth aspect of the invention alone, but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and, similarly to an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art, other thermoplastic resin materials having different characteristics may be used in the respective portions (the side portions , the crown portion , the bead portions , and the like) of the tire case . Other points are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 13, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and butadiene rubber (BR) at a mass ratio of 70:30, the impact resistance, tensile modulus of elasticity and tensile strength are excellent. Therefore, the tire  of the present embodiment is excellent in terms of durability. Furthermore, since the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art, it is possible to decrease the tan \u03b4. Therefore, since the weight of the tire  of the present embodiment can be decreased, and the rolling resistance is also suppressed, it is possible to improve the fuel consumption of an automobile in which the tire is used.","In addition, the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, which is one of the components of the thermoplastic resin material, has high adhesion properties to the reinforcing cord , and, furthermore, is excellent in terms of fixing performances, such as weld strength. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon in which air remains around the reinforcing cord  in the reinforcing cord winding process (incorporation of air). When the adhesion properties and weldability to the reinforcing cord  are high, and, furthermore, incorporation of air into the periphery of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like. Thereby, for example, even when a tire-constituting member has been provided so as to cover the entirety of the reinforcing cord member on the outer circumference of the tire frame, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, the separation or the like of the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, in the tire  of the present embodiment, since the reinforcing cord  having a higher stiffness than the thermoplastic resin material is helically wound in the circumferential direction on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, the puncture resistance, the cutting resistance and the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction are improved. Meanwhile, the improvement of the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction prevents the creeping in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material.","In addition, in the cross-sectional view of the tire case  along the axial direction (the cross section illustrated in ), since at least a portion of the reinforcing cord  is embedded in the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  in the tire case  formed of the thermoplastic resin material, and is adhered to the thermoplastic resin material, incorporation of air during manufacturing is suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is suppressed. Thereby, the separation or the like of the reinforcing cord , the tire case  and the tread  is suppressed, and the durability of the tire  is improved.","In addition, since the depth L of embedding of the reinforcing cord  is \u2155 or more of the diameter D as illustrated in , incorporation of air during manufacturing is effectively suppressed, and the movement of the reinforcing cord  caused by a force applied thereto at the time of driving or the like is further suppressed.","When the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the thermoplastic resin material as described above, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to the case when the reinforcing cord  is fixed using cushion rubber, the reinforcing cord  can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord member is a steel cord, since the reinforcing cord  can be easily separated and collected from the thermoplastic resin material through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire . In addition, the resin material generally has a low loss factor (Tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubber. Therefore, when the reinforcing cord layer includes a large amount of the resin material, it is possible to improve the rolling properties of the tire. Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber is advantageous in that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and steering stability and abrasion resistance during driving with the tire are also excellent.","In addition, since the tread  that comes into contact with road surfaces is made of a rubber material that is more abrasion-resistant than the thermoplastic resin material, the abrasion resistance of the tire  is improved.","Furthermore, since an annular bead core  made of a metallic material is embedded in the bead portion , the tire case , that is, the tire  is strongly held to the rim  similarly to a pneumatic rubber tire of the related art.","In addition, furthermore, since the sealing layer  made of a rubber material having higher sealing properties than the thermoplastic resin material is provided in a portion, which comes into contact with the rim , of the bead portion , the sealing properties between the tire  and the rim  are improved. Therefore, compared to the case when sealing is carried out between the rim  and the thermoplastic resin material, the air leakage from the tire is further suppressed. In addition, the rim fitting properties are also improved when the sealing layer  is provided.","The above embodiment employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated, and the thermoplastic resin material in the portion with which the heated reinforcing cord  comes into contact is melted or softened, but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the reinforcing cord  may be embedded in the crown portion  after heating the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , in which the reinforcing cord  is to be embedded, using a hot air generating apparatus without heating the reinforcing cord .","In addition, in Embodiment 13-1, a heater and a fan are used as the heat source of a cord heating device , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is directly heated using radiation heat (for example, infrared rays or the like) may be employed.","Furthermore, Embodiment 13-1 employs a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material having the reinforcing cord  embedded therein is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled using the second metal roller , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the portion, in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened, is forcibly cooled and solidified by directly blowing cold air to the portion in which the thermoplastic resin material is melted or softened may be employed.","In addition, Embodiment 13-1 employs a configuration in which the reinforcing cord  is heated; however, for example, a configuration in which the outer circumference of the reinforcing cord  is coated with the same thermoplastic resin material as the tire case  may be employed, and, in this case, it is possible to effectively suppress incorporation of air during embedding in the crown portion  by heating the reinforcing cord  and the coating of the thermoplastic resin material when winding the coated reinforcing cord around the crown portion  of the tire case .","In addition, the helical winding of the reinforcing cord  is easy in the manufacturing, but a method, in which the reinforcing cord  is formed to be discontinuous in the width direction, or the like can be also considered.","The tire  of Embodiment 13-1 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  on the rim , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire may have a complete tube shape.","Thus far, an embodiment of the thirteenth aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","Next, the tire and the method of manufacturing the tire of the thirteenth aspect of the invention according to Embodiment 13-2 will be described according to the drawings. Similarly to the above Embodiment 13-1, the tire of the present embodiment exhibits substantially the same cross-sectional shape as an ordinary pneumatic rubber tire of the related art. Here, the tire according to Embodiment 13-2 is the same as the above Embodiment 13 except for the following points. Therefore, the same reference numerals and drawings will be used in the description regarding the same drawings and members.","In the tire of Embodiment 13-2, similarly to the above Embodiment 13-1, the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and butadiene rubber (BR) at a mass ratio of 70:30. Other points are the same as in the tire according to the above Embodiment 13, and the manufacturing method is also the same.","In addition, the elastic modulus of a resin material for coating  is preferably set in a range of 0.1 times to 10 times the elastic modulus of a resin material that forms the tire case . When the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 10 times or less the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the crown portion does not become too hard, and fitting onto a rim can be easily carried out. In addition, when the elastic modulus of the resin material for coating  is 0.1 times or more the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire case , the resin that constitutes the reinforcing cord layer  does not become too soft, and the belt in-plane shear stiffness is excellent and the cornering force is improved. Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, as the resin material for coating , the same material as the thermoplastic resin material (in the present embodiment, a thermoplastic resin material including a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (\u201cUBESTA XPA9055X1\u201d manufactured by Ube Industries, Ltd.) and butadiene rubber (BR) at a mass ratio of 70:30) is used.","(Effects)","In the tire  of the present embodiment, since the tire case  is formed of the thermoplastic resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer and the rubber at a mass ratio of 70:30, the impact resistance is excellent, and, furthermore, the tensile modulus of elasticity and tensile strength are also excellent. Therefore, the tire  of the present embodiment is excellent in terms of durability. Furthermore, since the weight is light compared to rubber of the related art, it is possible to decrease the tan \u03b4. Therefore, since the weight of the tire  of the present embodiment can be decreased, and the rolling resistance is also suppressed, it is possible to improve the fuel consumption of an automobile in which the tire is used.","In addition, when the reinforcing cord layer  is configured to include the coated cord member B, since it is possible to decrease the difference in hardness between the tire case  and the reinforcing cord layer  compared to the case when the reinforcing cord A is simply fixed using cushion rubber , the coated cord member B can be further adhered and fixed to the tire case . Thereby, the above incorporation of air can be effectively prevented, and it is possible to effectively suppress the movement of the reinforcing cord member at the time of driving.","Furthermore, when the reinforcing cord member is a steel cord, since the cord member A can be easily separated and collected from the coated cord member B through heating when disposing of the tire, it is advantageous in terms of the recycling properties of the tire . In addition, the resin material generally has a low loss factor (Tan \u03b4) compared to vulcanized rubber. Therefore, when the reinforcing cord layer includes a large amount of the resin material, it is possible to improve the rolling properties of the tire. Furthermore, the resin material having a relatively high elastic modulus compared to vulcanized rubber is advantageous in that the in-plane shear stiffness is large, and steering stability and abrasion resistance during driving with the tire are also excellent.","In the method of manufacturing the tire of the present embodiment, when the tire case , the cushion rubber  and a tread rubber A are integrated, since the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  has been subjected to a roughening treatment, the bonding properties (adhesion properties) are improved due to the anchor effect. In addition, since the resin material that forms the tire case  is dug up by the collision of a blasting abrasive, the wettability of a bonding agent is improved. Thereby, a state in which the bonding agent is uniformly coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  is held, and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Particularly, even when protrusions and recesses are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the peripheries of the recess portions (recess walls and recess bottoms) are subjected to a roughening treatment by making the blasting abrasive collide with the recess portions (voids A), and the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  can be ensured.","Meanwhile, since the cushion rubber  is laminated in the roughening-treated areas on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber can be effectively ensured.","When the cushion rubber  has been vulcanized in a vulcanizing process, the cushion rubber  flows into the roughened recesses and protrusions formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  through the roughening treatment. In addition, when vulcanization is completed, the anchor effect is developed due to the cushion rubber  that has flowed into the roughened recesses and protrusions so that the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber  is improved.","The tire  manufactured using the above method of manufacturing a tire ensures the bonding strength between the tire case  and the cushion rubber , that is, ensures the bonding strength between the tire case  and the tread  through the cushion rubber . Thereby, the separation between the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case  of the tire  and the cushion rubber  is suppressed at the time of driving or the like.","In addition, since the outer circumference of the tire case  is made of the reinforcing cord layer , the puncture resistance and the cutting resistance are improved compared to a case in which the outer circumference is made of something other than the reinforcing cord layer .","In addition, since the reinforcing cord layer  is formed by winding the coated cord member B, the stiffness of the tire  in the circumferential direction is improved. The improvement of the stiffness in the circumferential direction suppresses creeping (a phenomenon in which the plastic deformation of the tire case  increases over time under a constant stress) in the tire case , and the pressure resistance with respect to the air pressure from the inside in the tire radial direction is improved.","In the present embodiment, the recesses and protrusions are formed on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the outer circumferential surface S is formed to be flat may be employed.","In addition, in the tire case , the reinforcing cord layer may be formed by covering the coated cord member, which is wound around and bonded to the crown portion of the tire case, with a thermoplastic material for coating. In this case, a coating layer can be formed by discharging a thermoplastic material for coating in a molten or softened state on the reinforcing cord layer . In addition, the coating layer may be formed by heating a welding sheet into a molten or softened state without using an extruder, and attaching the welding sheet to the surface (outer circumferential surface) of the reinforcing cord layer .","The above Embodiment 13-2 employs a configuration in which case divided parts (tire case half parts A) are bonded so as to form the tire case , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and the tire case  may be integrally formed using a mold or the like.","The tire  of Embodiment 13-2 is a so-called tubeless tire in which an air chamber is formed between the tire  and the rim  by mounting the bead portion  on the rim , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and the tire  may have, for example, a complete tube shape.","In Embodiment 13-2, the cushion rubber  is disposed between the tire case  and the tread , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the cushion rubber  is not disposed may be employed.","In addition, Embodiment 13-2 employs a configuration in which the coated cord member B is helically wound around the crown portion , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited thereto, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is wound to be discontinuous in the width direction may be employed.","Embodiment 13-2 employs a configuration in which a thermoplastic material is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the resin material for coating  is heated into a molten or softened state so as to weld the coated cord member B on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion , but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to this configuration, and a configuration in which the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating the resin material for coating  may be employed.","In addition, a configuration in which a thermosetting resin is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the coated cord member B is adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like without heating may be employed.","Furthermore, a configuration in which a thermosetting resin is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material may be employed. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating the portion, which is to be provided with the coated cord member B, of the tire case  into a molten or softened state.","In addition, furthermore, a configuration in which a thermoplastic material is used as the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, and the tire case  is formed of a thermoplastic resin material may be employed. In this case, the coated cord member B may be adhered to the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  using an adhesive or the like, or the coated cord member B may be welded on the outer circumferential surface of the crown portion  by heating the portion, which is to be provided with the coated cord member B, of the tire case  into a molten or softened state, and heating the resin material for coating  into a molten or softened state. Meanwhile, when both the tire case  and the coated cord member B have been heated into a molten or softened state, since both are well mixed, the bonding strength is improved. In addition, when thermoplastic resin materials are used as both the resin material that forms the tire case  and the resin material for coating  that forms the coated cord member B, the thermoplastic resin materials are preferably the same kind of thermoplastic materials, particularly, the same thermoplastic material.","In addition, furthermore, an adhesive may be coated on the outer circumferential surface S of the tire case , after the surface of the outer circumferential surface S, on which the roughening treatment has been carried out, is activated using a corona treatment, a plasma treatment or the like so as to increase the hydrophilicity.","In addition, furthermore, the order for manufacturing the tire  is not limited to the order in Embodiment 13-2, and may be appropriately changed.","Thus far, an embodiment of the thirteenth aspect of the invention has been described using the embodiment, but the embodiment is simply an example, and the invention can be carried out with a variety of modifications within the scope of the purport. In addition, it is needless to say that the scope of right of the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiment.","Thus far, the specific embodiments according to the thirteenth aspect of the invention have been described using Embodiment 13-1 and Embodiment 13-2, but the thirteenth aspect of the invention is not limited to the above embodiments.","The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be configured as follows: as described in Embodiment 1-1.","(1-1-1) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be configured so that at least a part of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame formed of the thermoplastic resin material in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame.","When a part of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame as such, a phenomenon in which air remains in the area around the cord during winding of the reinforcing cord member (incorporation of air) may further be suppressed. When incorporation of air into the area around the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, movement of the reinforcing cord member due to, for example, a force applied during running is suppressed. Accordingly, for example, in the case where the tire-constituting member is provided on the outer circumference of the tire frame to cover the entire reinforcing cord member, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, an occurrence of peeling and the like between the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed. Accordingly, durability is enhanced.","(1-1-2) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be provided with a tread formed of a material having higher wear resistance than the thermoplastic resin material on the outer side in the radial direction of the reinforcing cord layer.","By having a configuration in which the tread that comes into contact with the road surface is formed of the material having higher wear resistance than the thermoplastic resin material as such, the wear resistance of the tire may further be enhanced.","(1-1-3) In the tire of the first aspect of the invention, \u2155 or more of the diameter of the reinforcing cord member may be embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame along the circumferential direction in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame.","When \u2155 or more of the diameter of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame, incorporation of air into the area around the reinforcing cord member may be effectively suppressed, and thus movement of the reinforcing cord member due to, for example, a force applied during running may further be suppressed.","(1-1-4) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be configured so that the tire frame includes, on the inner side in the radial direction, a bead portion that comes into contact with a bead seat and a rim flange of a rim, and an annular bead core formed of a metal material is embedded in the bead portion.","By providing the bead portion which is a part for fitting onto the rim in the tire frame, and moreover, by embedding the annular bead core made of the metal material in the bead portion as such, the tire frame (that is, tire) may be firmly held on the rim, similarly to conventional pneumatic tires made of rubber.","(1-1-5) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be provided with a sealing portion made of a material having higher sealing properties (adhesion to the rim) than the thermoplastic resin material, in a part where the bead portion comes into contact with the rim.","By providing the seal portion made of the material having higher sealing properties than the thermoplastic resin material in the part where the tire frame and the rim come into contact with each other as such, adhesion between the tire (the tire frame) and the rim may be enhanced. Accordingly, compared to a case where only the rim and the thermoplastic resin material are used, leakage of air in the tire may further be suppressed. In addition, by providing the sealing portion, fitting onto the rim of the tire may be enhanced.","(1-1-6) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be manufactured according to the manufacturing method that includes: a tire frame piece forming step of forming a tire frame piece for constituting a portion of the circular tire frame, using a thermoplastic resin material including at least a polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer; a tire frame piece bonding step of forming the tire frame by fusing two or more of the tire frame pieces, which make a pair, by applying heat to the bonding surfaces of the tire frame pieces; and a reinforcing cord member winding step of winding the reinforcing cord member around the outer circumference of the tire frame in the circumferential direction to form a reinforcing cord layer.","In the manufacturing method, the tire frame pieces of the circular tire frame may be formed of the thermoplastic resin material including the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer. The melting point of the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer may be set to about 100\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., and thus the fusing step of the tire frame pieces needs not to be performed at, for example, a temperature equal to or higher than 300\u00b0 C. and the fusing step may be performed at a relatively low temperature. Since the fusing step is able to be performed at the relatively low temperature as such, productivity of the tire may be enhanced in terms of energy utilization rate and the like. In addition, when the tire frame pieces in which the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer is used are fused to form the tire frame, the bonding strength between the tire frame pieces is sufficient, and the performance of the frame itself is not deteriorated due to the temperature during fusing. Therefore, durability at the time of driving such as puncture resistance and wear resistance of the manufactured tire may be enhanced.","(1-1-7) The manufacturing method of the tire may be configured so that, in the tire frame piece bonding step, the bonding surface of the tire frame piece is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point (for example, the melting point +10\u00b0 C. to +150\u00b0 C.) of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire frame piece.","When the bonding surface of the divided body is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin material that forms the tire frame piece as such, fusing between the tire frame pieces may be sufficiently performed. Therefore, productivity of the tire may be enhanced while enhancing durability of the tire.","(1-1-8) The manufacturing method of the tire may be configured so that, in the reinforcing cord member winding step, the reinforcing cord member is wound around the outer circumference of the tire frame in a manner such that at least a part of the reinforcing cord member is embedded while melting or softening the outer circumference of the tire frame formed in the tire frame piece bonding step.","By winding the reinforcing cord member around the outer circumference in a manner such that at least a part of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame while melting or softening the outer circumference of the tire frame as such, the at least a part of the reinforcing cord member which is embedded and the melted or softened thermoplastic resin material may be welded. Accordingly, incorporation of air between the outer circumference of the tire frame and the reinforcing cord member in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame may further be suppressed. In addition, when the part in which the reinforcing cord member is embedded is cooled and solidified, the fixed condition of the reinforcing cord member embedded in the tire frame is enhanced.","(1-1-9) The manufacturing method of the tire may be configured so that, in the reinforcing cord member winding step, \u2155 or more of the diameter of the reinforcing cord may be embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame.","When \u2155 or more of the diameter of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame, incorporation of air into the area around the reinforcing cord during manufacturing may be effectively suppressed, and moreover, the embedded reinforcing cord member may become less likely to be caused to come out of the tire frame.","(1-1-10) The manufacturing method of the tire may be configured so that, in the reinforcing cord member winding step, the heated reinforcing cord member is embedded in the tire frame.","By embedding the reinforcing cord member in the tire frame while heating the reinforcing cord member in the reinforcing cord winding step as such, when the heated reinforcing cord member comes into contact with the outer circumference of the tire frame, the contact part is melted or softened.

By cooling the outer circumference of the tire more quickly than natural cooling, deformation of the outer circumference of the tire frame may be suppressed, and movement of the reinforcing cord member may be suppressed.","The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be configured as follows as described in Embodiment 1-2.","(1-2-1) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be configured such that the manufacturing method further includes: the roughening treatment step of performing the roughening treatment on the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame by allowing a particle-shaped blasting abrasive to collide with the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame; and a superposing step of superposing a tire-constituting rubber member on the outer circumferential surface which has been subjected to the roughening treatment, via a bonding agent.","When the roughening treatment step is provided as such, the particle-shaped blasting abrasive collides with the outer circumferential surface of the circular tire frame formed using the thermoplastic resin material that includes the polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer, and thus minute roughened unevenness is formed on the outer circumferential surface. The treatment of forming minute roughened unevenness by allowing the blasting abrasive to collide with the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame is referred to as a roughening treatment. Thereafter, the tire-constituting rubber member is superposed on the outer circumferential surface which has been subjected to the roughening treatment, via the bonding agent. Here, when the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member are integrated into each other, since the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame has been subjected to the roughening treatment, bonding properties (adhesiveness) are enhanced due to the anchor effect. In addition, since the resin material that forms the tire frame is ploughed due to collision of the blasting abrasive, wettability of the outer circumferential surface is enhanced. Accordingly, the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame is held in a state of being uniformly coated with the bonding agent, and thus the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be ensured.","(1-2-2) In the tire of the first aspect of the invention, at least a part of the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame may be an uneven portion, and the uneven portion may be subjected to the roughening treatment in the roughening treatment step.","Even if at least a part of the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame is the uneven portion as such, by allowing the blasting abrasive to collide with the uneven portion, the area around a recess (walls at the recess, the bottom of the recess) is subjected to the roughening treatment, and thus the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be ensured.","(1-2-3) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be configured such that the outer circumference of the tire frame is configured to have a reinforcing layer that constitutes the uneven portion at the outer circumferential surface, and the reinforcing layer may be configured such that a coated cord member formed by coating the reinforcing cord with a resin material of the same kind as or different from the resin material for forming a tire frame is wound in the circumferential direction of the tire frame.","By configuring the outer circumference of the tire frame to have the reinforcing layer formed by winding the coated cord member in the circumferential direction of the tire frame as such, the rigidity of the tire frame in the circumferential direction may be enhanced.","(1-2-4) In the tire of the first aspect of the invention, a thermoplastic resin material may be used as the resin material that is a component of the coated cord member.","By using a thermoplastic material having thermoplasticity as the resin material that is a component of the coated cord member as such, compared to a case of using a thermosetting material as the resin material, the tire is easily manufactured and is easily recycled.","(1-2-5) The tire of the first aspect of the present invention may be configured so that, in the roughening treatment step, an area wider than the area for superposing the tire-constituting rubber member is subjected to the roughening treatment.","When the area wider than the area for superposing the tire-constituting rubber member is subjected to the roughening treatment in the roughening treatment step, the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be reliably ensured.","(1-2-6) The tire of the first aspect of the invention may be configured so that, in the roughening treatment step, the outer circumferential surface is subjected to the roughening treatment to have an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of 0.05 mm or greater.","When the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame is subjected to the roughening treatment to have an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of 0.05 mm or greater in the roughening treatment step as such, in a case where, for example, an unvulcanized or semi-vulcanized tire-constituting rubber member is superposed on the outer circumferential surface which has been subjected to the roughening treatment, via the bonding agent, and is vulcanized, rubber of the tire-constituting rubber member may be caused to flow to the bottom of the roughened uneven portion formed by the roughening treatment.

Accordingly, the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame is held in a state of being uniformly coated with the bonding agent, and thus the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be ensured.","(10-2-2) In the tire of the tenth aspect of the invention, at least a part of the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame may be an uneven portion, and the uneven portion may be subjected to the roughening treatment in the roughening treatment step.","Even if at least a part of the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame is the uneven portion as such, by allowing the blasting abrasive to collide with the uneven portion, the area around a recess (walls at the recess, the bottom of the recess) is subjected to the roughening treatment, and thus the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be ensured.","(10-2-3) In the tire of the tenth aspect of the invention, the outer circumference of the tire frame is configured to have a reinforcing layer that constitutes the uneven portion at the outer circumferential surface, and the reinforcing layer may be configured such that a coated cord member formed by coating the reinforcing cord with a resin material of the same kind as or different from the resin material that forms the tire frame is wound in the circumferential direction of the tire frame.","By configuring the outer circumference of the tire frame to have the reinforcing layer formed by winding the coated cord member in the circumferential direction of the tire frame as such, the rigidity of the tire frame in the circumferential direction may be enhanced.","(10-2-4) The tire of the tenth aspect of the invention may use a thermoplastic resin material as the resin material that is a component of the coated cord member.","By using the thermoplastic material having thermoplasticity as the resin material that is a component of the coated cord member as such, compared to a case of using a thermosetting material as the resin material, the tire is easily manufactured and is easily recycled.","(10-2-5) The tire of the tenth aspect of the invention may be configured so that, in the roughening treatment step, an area wider than the area for superposing the tire-constituting rubber member is subjected to the roughening treatment.","When the area wider than the area for superposing the tire-constituting rubber member is subjected to the roughening treatment in the roughening treatment step, the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be reliably ensured.","(10-2-6) The tire of the tenth aspect of the invention may be configured so that, in the roughening treatment step, the outer circumferential surface is subjected to the roughening treatment to have an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of 0.05 mm or greater.","When the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame is subjected to the roughening treatment to have an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of 0.05 mm or greater in the roughening treatment step as such, in a case where the tire-constituting rubber member, for example, in an unvulcanized or semi-vulcanized state is superposed on the outer circumferential surface which has been subjected to the roughening treatment, via the bonding agent, and is vulcanized, rubber of the tire-constituting rubber member may be caused to flow to the bottom of the roughened uneven portion formed by the roughening treatment. When the rubber of the tire-constituting rubber member flows to the bottom of the roughened uneven portion, a sufficient anchor effect is exhibited between the outer circumferential surface and the tire-constituting rubber member, and the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be enhanced.","(10-2-7) In the tire of the tenth aspect of the invention, a rubber in the unvulcanized or semi-vulcanized state may be used as the tire-constituting rubber member.","In the case where the rubber in the unvulcanized or semi-vulcanized state is used as the tire-constituting rubber member as such, the rubber flows to the roughened uneven portion formed on the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame by the roughening treatment when the tire-constituting rubber member is vulcanized. In addition, when vulcanization is completed, the anchor effect is exhibited by the (vulcanized) rubber that has flowed to the roughened uneven portion, and thus the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be enhanced.","\u201cVulcanized\u201d is referred to as a state in which the degree of vulcanization reaches the degree needed for a final product, and the \u201csemi-vulcanized state\u201d is referred to as a state in which the vulcanization degree is higher than the unvulcanized state but has not reached the degree needed for a final product.","(10-2-8) The tire of the tenth aspect of the invention may be configured to include: a circular tire frame that is formed using the thermoplastic resin material in the tenth aspect of the invention and has the outer circumferential surface which has been subjected to the roughening treatment by allowing a particle-shaped blasting abrasive to collide with the outer circumferential surface; and a tire-constituting rubber member superposed on the outer circumferential surface which has been subjected to the roughening treatment, via the bonding agent.","When the circular tire frame which has been subjected to the roughening treatment is used as such, the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be enhanced by the anchor effect. In addition, since the outer circumferential surface has been subjected to the roughening treatment, excellent wettability of the bonding agent is provided. Accordingly, the bonding agent is held in the state of being uniformly applied onto the outer circumferential surface of the tire frame, the bonding strength between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member is ensured, and thus peeling between the tire frame and the tire-constituting rubber member may be suppressed.","The tire of the eleventh aspect of the invention may be configured as follows as described in the Embodiment 11-1.","(11-1-1) The tire of the eleventh aspect of the invention may be configured so that at least a part of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame formed of a thermoplastic resin material in the present invention in the eleventh aspect in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame.","When a part of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame as such, a phenomenon in which air remains in the area around the cord during winding of the reinforcing cord member (incorporation of air) may further be suppressed. When incorporation of air into the area around the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, movement of the reinforcing cord member due to, for example, a force applied during running is suppressed. Accordingly, for example, in the case where the tire-constituting member is provided on the outer circumference of the tire frame to cover the entire reinforcing cord member, since the movement of the reinforcing cord member is suppressed, an occurrence of peeling and the like between the members (including the tire frame) is suppressed, and durability is enhanced.","(11-1-2) The tire of the eleventh aspect of the invention may be provided with a tread formed of a material having higher wear resistance than the thermoplastic resin material, on the outer side in the radial direction of the reinforcing cord layer.","By having a configuration in which the tread that comes into contact with the road surface is formed of the material having higher wear resistance than the thermoplastic resin material as such, the wear resistance of the tire may further be enhanced.","(11-1-3) In the tire of the eleventh aspect of the invention, \u2155 or more of the diameter of the reinforcing cord member may be embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame along the circumferential direction in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame.","When \u2155 or more of the diameter of the reinforcing cord member is embedded in the outer circumference of the tire frame in the cross-sectional view along the axial direction of the tire frame, incorporation of air into
