Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of hinge mechanisms and in particular to a swivel hinge apparatus for an electronic device.","2. Description of the Related Art","As used in the context herein, the term electronic devices refer to portable communication devices, computers, portable electronic calculators, etc. The term \u2018portable communication device\u2019 (PCD) refers to devices carried and in some cases may perform a type of radio or wireless communication (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, 3G, and\/or 4G. For example, portable communication devices may include a hand-held phone (HHP), cordless telephone (CT2) cellular phone, a digital phone, a personal communications systems (PCS) phone, and a personal digital assistant (PDA) and other similar types devices. For example, smartphones, such as the SAMSUNG GALAXY S, and the SAMSUNG TAB, commercially available from SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., are portable communication devices. Typically, PCDs are sorted into various types according to their shapes. For example, devices (i.e., terminals) are classified based on their shape or operation. For example, terminals may be classified as a bar-type terminal, flip-type terminal, or a folder-type terminal. The bar-type terminal has a single housing shaped like a bar. The flip-type terminal has a flip or cover pivotably mounted to a bar-shaped housing by a hinge unit. The folder-type terminal has a folder coupled to a single bar-shaped housing by a hinge unit in such a manner that the folder can be rotated to fold to or unfold from the housing.","With the miniaturization of communication or receiving devices such as the portable communication devices, portable mini cassettes, MP3 players, radio players, etc., earsets connected to the electronic devices for listening have been widely used to allow the electronic devices to be easily carried.","The earset may also operate as a microphone, which may wired to device or wirelessly connected to the device. For example, a headset including a BLUETOOTH wireless transceiving (transmitting\/receiving) device, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., may operate to receive communications from a portable communication device or transmit communication to the portable communication device. BLUETOOTH technology is a well-known short range wireless communications technology, technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., and need not be discussed in detail herein.","A headset containing the BLUETOOTH technology, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., is advantageous in that it is free from the restrictions of action and movement that exist when the earset is connected to the portable communication device by an electric wire. Moreover, a user can access the Internet and make a call or receive a call without having to access the portable communication device directly, as commands may be issued through the BLUETOOTH wireless protocol, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., to the PCD.","As shown in , a conventional wireless headset  includes a BLUETOOTH module , with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., a microphone portion , a speaker portion , and a hinge apparatus  for rotating the speaker portion . The BLUETOOTH module , with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., includes at least a transceiving device that is adapted for the BLUETOOTH communication protocol, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC.","However, a hinge apparatus  of a conventional portable communication device and a hinge apparatus  of a conventional headset are structured such that a speaker portion  of the communication device and a speaker portion  of the headset  are folded or unfolded merely by being rotated in a vertical direction along the hinge apparatus . As a result, when the speaker portion  is positioned at a user's ear, a microphone portion  may move away from a user's mouth, such that user's sound is not accurately delivered to the partner in a communication mode. Moreover, since the speaker portion  linearly rotates in the vertical direction, the speaker portion  of the communication device and the speaker portion  of the headset  may unintentionally rotate, thus executing the communication mode, or may be closed, thus being suddenly disconnected.","Korean Patent Publication No. 2008-0107876 discloses a bending apparatus of a BLUETOOTH headset, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC. Referring to , a bending apparatus  of a BLUETOOTH headset, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., is structured such that an earphone portion  and a body portion  coupling a left body and a right body are coupled upright, face to face, through inclined surfaces  and , and a pivoting apparatus  is provided in a coupling portion of the earphone portion  and the body portion  to adjust a bending angle of the earphone portion  according to inclinations of the inclined surfaces  and .","However, the conventional bending apparatus  of the BLUETOOTH headset, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., is structured such that the pivoting apparatus  is mounted along the inclined surfaces  and  of the earphone portion  and the body portion . As a result, the pivoting apparatus  is separated along the inclined surfaces  and , thus being difficult to install and reducing an applicable force for retaining the pieces in position, whereby the strength of engagement and assembly processing of a product are difficult and a time for assembly processing also increases.","Therefore, there is a need for an apparatus which assembles a hinge apparatus to an electronic device in a simple and easy way and improves the strength of engagement.","Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a swivel hinge apparatus for an electronic device in which engagement portions of the swivel hinge apparatus are bent to be inclined at a predetermined angle, thereby improving the strength of engagement of the swivel hinge apparatus with respect to the electronic device and facilitating assembly processing.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a swivel hinge apparatus for an electronic device in which a plurality of hinge members are inclined, thereby improving rotation of an element of the product with respect to another element and further improving the strength of engagement of the swivel hinge apparatus.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a swivel hinge apparatus for an electronic device that includes a first housing having a first inclined surface formed thereon and a second housing having a second inclined surface formed thereon, the second housing rotating in a bent manner while facing the first inclined surface.

In this state, the speaker portion  provided in the first housing  is inserted into a user's ear and the microphone portion  provided in the second housing  is brought to close contact with a user's mouth.","Herein, when the second housing  rotates 180 degrees around the hinge axis A, the BLUETOOTH technology, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., is turned on and thus the headset  is used; when the second housing  rotates to the original position, the BLUETOOTH technology is turned off, with BLUETOOTH being a short range wireless communications technology at the 2.4 GHz band, commercially available from the BLUETOOTH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, INC., and thus the headset  does not operate.","As shown in , , , and , to rotate the second housing  to the original position around the hinge axis A, the second hinge member  also rotates around the hinge axis A, together with the stopper groove  of the guide stopper portion . If the second hinge member  rotates to the rotation initial position, the second stopper portion of the stopper groove  leaves the guide cam  and the stopper groove  rotates such that the second stopper portion of the stopper groove  contacts the guide cam  in the rotation initial position, thereby restricting rotation of the second hinge member .","In this state, as shown in , the pair of click grooves  formed in the second hinge member  also rotate again, and the pair of click protrusions  formed on the first hinge member  is inserted into the pair of click grooves  in the rotation initial position of the second hinge member , thus providing a clicking sense.","It will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that the swivel hinge apparatus for an electronic device according to the present invention described above is not limited by the foregoing embodiments and drawings, and various substitutions, modifications, and changes can be made."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other features and advantages of exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
