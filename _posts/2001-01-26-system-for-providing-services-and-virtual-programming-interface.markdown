{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to a system for providing customer requested services, a system for preparing an automatic execution of a test program, a method of monitoring the traffic of data packets in a data network, and a virtual application programming editor.","In order to be able to test, control and\/or monitor the integrity, security and\/or quality of a data system, e.g. a data processing system, a data processing device and\/or a data network, a number of tests, e.g. test software application, have been developed and utilized.","The proprietor or provider of a data system will have to purchase a number of different tests, e.g. software applications, in order to\u2014for instance\u2014be able to achieve a certain degree of security including detection and documentation, and accordingly take action on hacker attacks, cyber vandalism, unauthorized accessing of confidential data on the system, destruction or distortion of data, congestion of data processing, crashing of the data system etc. Different test are normally dedicated to different scopes of the security problem and will have different advantages and flaws in relation to a particular data system and in relation to a particular security aspect.","Further, the development of data systems, e.g. both hardware and software, demands a corresponding development to the test software application. Similarly, weaknesses and security flaws in data systems are discovered ongoing, demanding corresponding updating of current tests.","In consequence, a proprietor or a provider of a data system will have to invest in a number of different test programs, each facilitating said different security checks, in order to obtain a certain degree of security in relation to the data system. Further, the proprietor or provider will have to purchase new versions of said tests, updates and\/or new tests in order to be able to retain the same degree of security. Finally the proprietor or provider will have to allocate labour resources to the task of implementing the tests, updating tests and\/or installing new versions of tests.","Because of the expenses and efforts involved both in purchasing tests\/updates and in running said tests, the efforts involved in the security may lead to a result, which is far from optimal. Therefore a need exists to provide security testing, monitoring and other security related services to data systems, whereby the proprietor or provider of such data systems may obtain such tests etc. in order to be able to check the security level of his\/her system, in order to be able to correct detected flaws\/weaknesses, and in order to be able to retain the security level of the system\/systems and preferably also improve the level of security without having to invest an increased amount of money, labour and effort.","The invention relates to a system for providing customer requested services relating to\u2014for instance\u2014security, monitoring and\/or data acquisition in relation to a data processing device and\/or a data network (Target -Target k) of a customer, wherein\n\n","Hereby the customer or user will have the advantage that it will not be necessary to install\/download special testing software on the data processing equipment in question. Thus, problems in relation to the execution of such testing software as well as problems concerning the acquisition of the test results and the analysis of such results may be avoided. Further, as it often will be advantageously to utilize two or more different types or makes of testing software applications\/systems, the need to invest in a multitude of testing software applications will be avoided by the invention. Similarly, expenses and labour involved in updating such testing software and\/or purchasing new software as the already purchased versions become outdated or obsolete will be avoided.","Thus, the system according to the invention will provide the customer\/customers with a cost efficient system for performing an efficient and contemporary checking of security, quality, vulnerability, information relating to the security etc., e.g. newly discovered weaknesses etc. and similar or related aspects in relation to the data processing equipment of the customer.","Preferably, said one or more selected tests may be selected on the basis of preferences of the customer and\/or on the basis of an analysis of said data processing device and\/or data network of the customer.","Hereby it is achieved that the selected tests, which constitutes a test suite, corresponds to identified, expected and\/or suspected fields of problems, said fields identified by means of the experience of the customer and\/or the experience and in-depth knowledge relating to\u2014for instance\u2014security and testing items of the provider of the system according to the invention.","In a further embodiment, said one or more selected tests may be selected on the basis of results of one or more manually, e.g. operator initiated executions of tests on said data processing device and\/or data network.","Hereby it is achieved that the selection of tests, i.e. the test suite, will be selected on the basis of results reached by performing a set of tests, whereby the results may be observed and analyzed, giving valuable information about which test\/tests to choose in relation to a particular data processing system, equipment and\/or network. Further, the observed results of the manually initiated tests may serve as reference values, which may be utilized in connection with a processing and\/or analysis of results of consecutively performed tests by the system according to the invention.","Advantageously, said one or more tests may be configured to be executed each on predefined points of time and\/or in predefined intervals of time.","Hereby it is achieved that the execution of the selected tests constituting the test suite may be configured to fulfill a wide variety of requirements and\/or to operate under consideration of a wide variety of constraints. For example, certain tests may advantageously be scheduled to be performed on points of time when the data processing equipment is heavily loaded, e.g. to perform connection tests, denial-of-service tests, stress load tests etc., while other tests may advantageously be scheduled to be executed on points of time when demand on the data processing equipment is low, e.g. tests, which may cause the data processing, communication etc. to be interrupted and may cause failure to the data processing equipment and\/or software, which tests preferably may be located on points of time when a breakdown or a slowdown of services may be tolerable and\/or when skilled personnel will be readily available to correct the failure.","In a further embodiment said one or more tests may be configured to be executed each on a regular basis and the frequency of said regular executions may be specified preferably in accordance with customer preferences and\/or on the basis of analysis\/analyses and\/or a reference testing on said data processing device and\/or data network.","Hereby it is achieved that the execution of the selected tests constituting the test suite may each be configured to be repeated with an interval of time corresponding to an estimation and\/or evaluation of the developments, which may take place in relation to the subject of the test\/tests in question. For example, if it is estimated that a denial-of-service is a very critical and\/or probable failure for a data processing system, network equipment etc., then a relatively high frequency for performing such a test may be configured, while a test for a relatively uncritical and\/or relatively seldom occurring failure or condition may be configured to be executed with a relatively low frequency, e.g. once a week, once a fortnight etc.","Advantageously, means may be provided for performing a comparison between data representing one or more results of a test and one or more threshold values and means may be provided for the establishing of an alarm, advice and\/or information message.","Hereby it is achieved that in cases where an abnormal condition is observed and where such an abnormal condition constitutes a certain breach of security and\/or reliability, the customer and\/or a person\/persons specified by the customer may be alerted quickly if not instantaneously, e.g. by e-mail, SMS, FTP, telephone, pager etc.","Said one or more threshold values may be specified by the customer, whereby the establishing and\/or emitting of possible alarms may be designed to fit the needs and\/or preferences of the customer, e.g. the customer may specify a threshold which lies close to actual values for parameters which are very important and\/or vital to the customer and\/or the system\/users of the system in question.","Preferably, said one or more threshold values may be specified on the basis of results of manually initiated executions of one or more tests performed on said data processing device and\/or network.","Hereby it is achieved that the threshold values and thus the alarm\/advice initiating conditions will be specified on realistic terms and whereby it is achieved that the emitting of alarms\/advices will be of considerable advantage to the user\/users.","Said manually initiated executions of one or more tests, e.g. reference tests, performed on said data processing device and\/or network may be performed with regular intervals of time.","Hereby it is achieved that the reference values will be adapted to the conditions changing with time, e.g. as the target data system evolves and as the load on said target system changes. Obviously, some or all of the threshold values need to be amended in consideration of these changes. If not, the alarms\/advices may loose their importance, either because alarms\/advices will be established with a larger frequency, whereby a tendency to ignore these will result, or because alarms\/advices very rarely will be established because the threshold values now are so far away from the actual values that alarm conditions in reality never or very seldom will occur. By this embodiment of the invention these drawbacks will be avoided as the threshold values regularly will be checked and amended, if necessary.","Advantageously, said communication network, by means of which said test suite, monitoring, alerting, documentation and reporting system server (TSMADARS-server) is connectable to said data processing device and\/or data network (Target 1-Target k) may be a secure network facilitating use of said authentication and\/or encryption.","According to a further embodiment, said communication network (), by means of which said data representing results may be accessed, be downloaded and\/or transmitted by\/to the customer may be a secure network facilitating use of authentication and\/or encryption.","Advantageously, said plurality of test applications may comprise tests relating to security testing, quality testing, telecommunication security testing, security information collecting service, security auditing, communication line testing and\/or test laboratory services.","When said one or more selected tests are configured in a test suite file dedicated to each of a one or more customers, said test suite file comprising for each test information relating to a target data system and relating to the execution of said test, an advantageous manner of configuring the selected tests are achieved, facilitating the execution of the test suites.","When said test suite file may comprise one or more links each to a recorded preparation of a software application, said preparation or preparations comprising input actions and\/or operations performed on a graphical user interface, it is achieved that tests etc that comprise a user interface demanding a number of manual operations to be performed e.g. by computer mouse, cursor, keyboard etc, before the test can be executed, may advantageously be prepared for an automatic execution and be executed similar to other test software application in the test suite file.","When said one or more recorded preparations of a software application is\/are dedicated to a particular target system a further preferred embodiment is obtained.","According to a further aspect, the invention relates to a system for preparing an automatic execution of a test software application, said test software application comprising input means for operating said test software application and\/or for specifying and\/or selecting parameters relevant for the execution of said test software application and wherein said input means may be operated by means of computer input means such as a keyboard and\/or a computer mouse, wherein said system comprises\n\n","Hereby it is achieved that manually performed operations such as selection of a graphical button and a subsequent activation by a mouse-click or double-click, an activation of a roll-down-menu and subsequent selection of an item, an activation of a data input field and specification in this field of an input by means of a keyboard etc. may be \u201crecorded\u201d and later simulated for an automatic execution of the same operations, whereby an execution of for example a number of mouse\/cursor\/keyboard operations in the graphical user interface of a software application may be performed in an automatic manner upon an initial start-up command.","Thus it is possible to prepare tests and other security related software applications for an automatic execution involving a test suite file wherein the selected tests are listed in a relatively simple manner, and wherein also software applications requiring a more complex preparation in order to have it running may be inserted. The system according to this aspect of the invention therefore constitutes an important feature in relation to the system for providing customer related services.","Advantageously, said means for indicating a sequential relation between said data may comprise a sequential listing of data stored by said storing means.","Further said data indicative of operations performed on said test software application by means of said computer input means may comprise data indicative of a reference location of a graphical user interface of said test software application and possibly data indicative of a dimensional relationship between said graphical user interface and said computer input means.","The invention relates to a method of monitoring the traffic of data packets in a data network () comprising a number of network units (-), at least one of said network units (-) comprising access control lists (, , , ) defining data traffic rules associated to the network units (-),\n\n","The at least one reference list () reflecting a number of data traffic rules associated to the said network unit (-) may be established manually by e.g. typing, or the list may be established as a common log-file automatically reading all the rules of units of the network into one file.","The monitoring points may e.g. be established by a physical connection to a segment of the network to be monitored.","A warning may e.g. be an alarm or simple a text-indication of the status, which may easily be conceived by a skilled by a system operator.","When at least one reference list () comprises data traffic rules copied from at least one of the access control lists (, , , ) associated to the said network units (-), a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","An advantage of merging the access control lists into a rule list RL is that all established rules or filter functions are compared to the actual data traffic of the network, thereby reducing the risk of overlooking non-intended data traffic.","When the said destination address () comprises an IP-address or generally, addresses related to other types of protocols and where the said source address comprises an IP-address or an address related to other types of protocols, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","Data packet traffic of traditional data networks may thus be monitored and controlled by evaluation of said IP addresses, destination and\/or source addresses, of the data packets.","When the said traffic rules comprises different combinations of forbidden source and destination addresses, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","Preferably, the data traffic rules may also comprise different combinations of forbidden source and destination addresses combined with data content descriptions of the forbidden data packets.","When at least one of the said network units (-) comprising access control lists (, , , ) defining data traffic rules associated to the network units (-)\u2014for instance\u2014comprises a firewall and\/or a network router and\/or a network bridge, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","A typical network unit of the above kind is a firewall, enabling different kinds of protection against unwanted data traffic. Thus, a firewall often represents the connection of a web-server to external users.","When the said monitoring points are established in preferably all identified segment of the network (), a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","When the said reference list () is established for the purpose of simulating the data traffic in the network if at least one of the access control lists (, , , ) of the network units (-) are changed, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","The invention relates to a method of monitoring the traffic of data packets in a data network () comprising a number of network units (-), at least one of said network units (-) comprising access control lists (, , , ) defining data traffic rules associated to the network units (-),\n\n","When the said log-messages are established by different networks units (-) of the network, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","Moreover, the invention relates to a Virtual API editor () according to claim  comprising\n\n","According to the invention a user may establish a virtual input device script reflecting a human realtime operation of a selected application. Such established virtual input device script may then be applied for a batch-running of the selected application, i.e. a chosen software application. The software application may then, so to speak, be operated on a batch basis by virtual input devices.","According to the invention, a batch running of a software application may be established on almost every thinkable software application which may be operated on a computer by means of e.g. a mouse and a keyboard.","Hence, software applications may run according to somewhat primitive virtual input device script in a batch mode even if the software applications contains suitable API. (API: Application Programming Interface).","Further advantageous options within the scope of the invention is that the virtual input device script may function as a user input device log, describing the operation of the computer on a macro-level.","Hence, the log-file may be used for tracking faults in the recorded manual operation of the selected software application, or it may even track if users perform undesired operations of certain software applications even if the software applications contains no log-facilities whatsoever.","When means for executing the said virtual input device script () in such a way the said virtual input device script () results in an execution of the said selected application via the said graphical user interface () associated to the said selected application, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention has been obtained.","Moreover, the invention relates to a method of establishing a virtual API editor () comprising.\n\n","In  a system for providing user requested services is illustrated in a schematically manner. The system, which is in the form of an application service provider (ASP) system, comprises a test suite, monitoring, alerting, documentation and reporting system (TSMADARS) generally designated . This system, e.g. ASP-system, which operates continuously, i.e. 24 hours a day seven days a week, comprises a server or a number of servers generally named TSMADARS-server means and generally designated . Further, the TSMADARS-server means comprises a number of different test software applications, monitoring software applications, supervisory software applications etc. which software applications in the following may be referred to as simply test software applications or tests, although the software applications concerned may have a scope differing from test software applications or have a wider scope than test software applications as such taken in a literal sense.","The system for providing user requested services according to an embodiment of the invention will be in the form of a supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA).","The involved tests are generally designated  and are for reasons of simplicity, which shall be explained later, grouped in a number of groups -in .","The TSMADARS-server means is able to facilitate a number of different services, e.g. categories of tests in order to fulfill requirements of a user or customer requesting a particular service or services -, e.g. categories of tests. Such tests may as illustrated be security tests (SEC) , quality tests (QA) , telecommunication-security tests (TELE) , tests for security risk information (intelligent information collecting service) (SECINFO) , security audits (AUDIT) , communication line tests (COMM) , although other categories of test may be utilized, e.g. test laboratory (LAB) etc.","Some of the test software applications  may be utilized in connection with two or more services, e.g. a particular test may be grouped in both group and , while another may be grouped in groups , and ","The test software applications may operate on the basis of two different principles. Some tests may be performed as purely external test methods, e.g. tests, wherein an influence, an attack, a scanning, a request, a demand, an external logging etc. is directed toward the target network or system, while others may be arranged to operate at least partly inside the target network or system, e.g. where an internal logging is performed, where an allowable data packet, request, command etc. is communicated inside the target network or system in order to check the internal conditions of the target network or system, e.g. whether internal ports are unintentionally open for certain data packets, whether an internal blocking of certain ports are possible, whether certain types of data packets may enter certain parts of the target system unintentionally etc.","The catalogue of tests is designed to comprise both such types of tests and tests operating on both principles simultaneously. The system for providing user requested services according to the invention is thus also designed to facilitate such types of testing in order to provide optimal testing, monitoring, auditing etc. facilities to customers.","An example of a listing of some of the test in the test catalogue and their relation to the services provided is shown in the following table:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0099"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["SERVICE","DESCRIPTION","TESTS"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["SEC","Security tests","Inventory scan"]},{"entry":[{},{},"MibBrowsing"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Portscan"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Vulnarability test"]},{"entry":[{},{},"D.o.S. tests"]},{"entry":[{},{},"BruteForce\/intrusion"]},{"entry":[{},{},"UBA\u2014user behaviour agent (LOG"]},{"entry":[{},{},"files)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"UBA\u2014user behaviour agent"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(Protocol)"]},{"entry":["QA","Quality tests","Ping"]},{"entry":[{},{},"TraceRouting"]},{"entry":[{},{},"GET requests"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Connection test"]},{"entry":[{},{},"STress load test"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Broken links"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Bottlenecks (network traffic"]},{"entry":[{},{},"analyzer)"]},{"entry":["TELE","Tele security tests","War dialing"]},{"entry":[{},{},"BruteForce\/intrusion"]},{"entry":[{},{},"UBA\u2014user behaviour agent (LOG"]},{"entry":[{},{},"files)"]},{"entry":["AUDIT","Security audits","Auditprogram"]},{"entry":["COMM","Communication line","Accessibility"]},{"entry":[{},"tests"]},{"entry":["LAB","Test laboratory","Test environment"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Education"]},{"entry":["SECINFO","Intelligent information","Scanning"]},{"entry":[{},"collecting service","Reports"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Alerts"]},{"entry":["etc.",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Brief descriptions of these tests supplemented with a few examples will be given in the following:","SEC:","Inventory Scan:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":["Mapping of active network units, which responds to Ping (ICMP) requests or which can be identified by means of reverse DNS lookup.","(Example: Machine 212.130.xy.z is HELENA MS NT4 server, SP3).\n\nMibBrowsing (Management Information Base Browsing)\n","Requests on the configurations of network units via active SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) agents.","(Example: SysUpTime=0 days, 3 min, 45 sec)\n\nPortscan\n","Search of active TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) ports of network units.","(Example: TCP port 80 is http, i.e. browser access to the Internet)\n\nVulnarability Test\n","Systematic search of possible weaknesses in the operative systems of network units by means of complex algorithms and informational databases.","(Example: Machine 212.130.xy.z has 1 high risk, 3 medium risks and 1 low risk vulnerabilities)\n\nD.o.S.

Each of these contains a command field , e.g. \u201cPerform\u201d, a field  identifying the software application, e.g. \u201cBBscan.exe\u201d, a field  identifying the time, the software application shall be run for the first time, e.g. \u201c11 Jan. 2001 at 09.00\u201d, a field  indicating the frequency, with which the software application shall be repeated, e.g. \u201cEvery week\u201d and a field  identifying the target, e.g. an address or the like identifying the data processing system and\/or network, for example an IP-address \u201cabc.def.g.h\u201d or an address related to other types of protocols.","After the listing concerning the software applications of the selected test suite the file  contains a number of commands  relating to the processing of the results of the executions of the software applications, e.g. collecting the results, storing the results, updating the test result files of the customer in question etc.","The test suite files - stored on the storing means  will be run under control of the TSMADARS, e.g. controlled by the central control means (CC) , as the control system will cause a sequential scanning of the suite files, identify software applications which at the given point of time must be performed, cause such software applications to be executed and cause subsequent operations such as storing, analyzing of test results and\/or updating of the result database\/databases to be performed.","The test results may preferably via secure transmission means as described above be transmitted to the customer and\/or accessed\/downloaded, e.g. in the form of e-mails, FTP, etc. and\/or the test results may be readily available for viewing and\/or downloading via a preferably secure communication network , e.g. the Internet on a website.","Further, special messages in the form of alarm messages, information messages advice messages, alert messages etc. may be forwarded\/transmitted to the customer (or persons\/addresses\/telephone numbers specified by the customer), when certain reference values and\/or limits, e.g. maximum and\/or minimum values, which values in the following also shall be referred to as thresholds or threshold values, have been reached and\/or exceeded. These threshold values may be user specified and\/or may origin from the initial test runs performed when the test suite has been configured. The alarm messages etc. may be forwarded to user specified addresses, e.g. e-mail addresses, mobile telephone numbers etc, and the messages may be transmitted to more than one person\/address, possibly in a hierarchical system.","The above described manually initiated test runs may be repeated with regular intervals in agreement with the customer in order to detect and\/or evaluate the need to modify the test suite. Accordingly, the test suite may be modified on the basis of such reference tests and\/or on the basis of an analysis of the target system. Similarly, such reference test results may lead to modifications of reference values serving to cause forwarding of alarm\/information messages.","Secure storing of reference test results as well as reference values, e.g. threshold values, serving to define a basis for forwarding of alarm\/information\/advice\/alert messages may be controlled by the central control means . Further, the central control means  may serve to control the preferably secure transmission of such messages on the basis of customer related and\/or specified rules, which may also be stored, preferably in a secure manner, on the storage means . As specified above, the secure transmission may be in the form of an encrypted and authenticated communication, for example by means of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or VPN (Virtual Private Network) or similar.","A customer or user  may in a secure manner as described above access the test results at the service provider (e.g. the application service provider ASP), e.g. at a website hosted by the application service provider, as the customer has been provided with a username and a password. The access may preferably be established using cryptography and authentication (e.g. using digital signature), e.g. using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or Virtual Private Network (VPN) via the Internet or the like. Similarly, information transmitted from the service provider, test data etc. as well as result data transmitted from the target to the service provider may be transmitted using techniques to assure the security, e.g. using cryptography.","In addition to being able to access test results via a communication network, e.g. the Internet or similar means, the customers\/users may be able to inspect the test suite\/suites in accordance with the agreement with the service provider and possibly be able to change certain parameters in the test suite\/suites, for example the frequency of tests, threshold values, host addresses, telephone numbers, in case these have been changed, etc.","The test software applications  used for providing the requested services may be standard test software applications and\/or specially developed software applications, which may be developed for use in relation to a particular data processing system and\/or network and\/or in order to fulfill certain particular requests submitted by a customer or a potential customer.","A number of available standard test software applications may be configured relatively straightforward in the listing constituting a test suite  of a customer, as in relation to these software applications only few pieces of information, for example an IP address or addresses, other types of addresses, telephone number\/numbers, initial starting points of time and possibly a frequency or frequencies of repetition need to be specified in order to have the software application running. As this information can be specified in the command fields contained in the listing, such software applications will immediately be executed when a starting point of time is reached. However before starting a testing or a monitoring software application, it is checked, for example by the central control means (CC)  that the application in question is not running, i.e. that is has finished its previous execution. The central control means  will prohibit the execution of the application in such cases until the application has finished or until the application is scheduled to be initiated again according to the test suite file .","Other software applications may require a more complex and\/or detailed input information, especially in cases where such software applications comprise a graphical user interface with graphical control means such as start buttons, input means for specifying certain values such as for example IP addresses, for selecting certain parameters etc. by use of keyboard, cursor and mouse. In order to be able to execute such software applications automatically, the operations performed on the user interfaces of such software applications in order to achieve an execution of such a software application, the operations, e.g. manually and sequentially performed operations, have to be transformed to a script or the like, which directly may be executed by a computer controlled system. Such a script may then be inserted in or preferably referred to in the customer test suite files - (). For example, instead of indicating a tag in the field  identifying the test software application, a reference to such a script may be inserted instead.","An advantageous feature of the invention and a important part of the system according to the invention, by means of which it is possible to create such customer dedicated scripts, will be described in further detail in the following.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0173"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"When dealing with e.g. security monitoring or quality monitoring of data networks, both with respect to internal monitoring and external monitoring, a basic problem is that no monitoring applications are actually complete enough to perform the test alone, due to the fact that intrusion and cyber vandalism may be performed in numerous ways. New methods see the light of the day every day. Consequently, such monitoring should be performed quite often and the monitoring should be updated to match the behavior of unwanted intruders.","Therefore several types of evaluation software applications should preferably by applied when investigating the security of a network. Moreover, the number of applied software applications may often vary with the different tasks and different versions of the applied applications over time.","Consequently, a monitoring of the data security may imply use of many different software applications in many different setups and the combination of the software applications may vary as well.","A problem of many of the applicable monitoring software applications is that they lack an API (API: Application Programming Interface).

The illustrated network is traditionally linked together by means of network cables and network units  (NU1),  (NU2),  (NU3) and  (NU4) and servers (not shown). The network units comprises different e.g. routers, firewalls or bridges.","The basic elements of the illustrated network a database setup comprising two databases  and . The latter databases  are intended for internal storing of log files.","Moreover, the network comprises a database  associated to a network unit (NU2)  in the form of a so-called firewall. The firewall  is established for providing access to external users  to a database , i.e. web-based database which may be accessed via the Internet . Moreover, the firewall should secure that no one of the Internet based user, e.g. external users , may access the internal part of the network. Typically, the database  should be accessible to both external users  and internal users - as well.","The firewall is configurated by means of an access control list (ACL2) , defining the allowed traffic to and from the unit (NU2) .

Each of the internal users -, the external user \/router  (NU1), the external user \/router  (NU3), the database , and the database  forms a segment.","Basically, the network comprises a number of network units controlling the allowed network traffic in different parts of the network. Nevertheless, practice has revealed that such network units - (NU1-4) sometimes allows unintended traffic. This may be due to different factors such as mis-configuration, bad hardware structures, etc.","Therefore, the invention provides external test on a computer network testing whether intrusion or cyber vandalism is actually possible to non-authorized users. Typically, such as test should make the specific weaknesses clear to the owner of the network and the test should result in different proposals eliminating the discovered weaknesses.","Moreover, the invention provides test facilities testing whether something has actually failed, i.e. if non-authorized data traffic has actually passed the firewalls, etc. Therefore, such test facilities necessitates a testing of the inside traffic of the network, and therefore tests will have to performed by means of security routines established in the internal part of the computer network. The tests may be performed by so-called User Behavior Agents (UBA's). The User Behavior Agents may function in several different ways.","According to a first embodiment of applicable UBA's within the scope of the invention, a Watch User Behavior Agent is established for watching illegal data packets within the computer network, and preferably, the Watch agent should give an advice if illegal packets are detected.","The Watch agent implies a number of measure points, e.g. , ,  and , established within the internal part of the network thought to be secure and free of undesired traffic of data packets .","Preferably, a measuring point should be established in each or at least as many as possible segments of the network in order to track unintended traffic on the network. An example of unintended data traffic may e.g. appear, if a department of the company reconfigures the access control list  of the router  (NU3), e.g. by mistake, thereby opening the network the exterior networks.","Therefore, according to the invention, illegal data packets may be revealed by the watch agent UBA (e.g. located on its own data processing unit having several netcards, one per monitoring point), as data packets coming into the network via the mis-configured router  (NU3) are measured and compared to e.g. the rules or some of the rules of the access control list  (ACL2) associated to the firewall .","An appropriate warning should be raised.","As illustrated in , the tapped data packets  are compared to a rule list  (RL) defining a common description of undesired traffic, i.e. data packets. If the comparison reveals that undesired traffic within the network are actually present, the fact should be brought to the attention of a super-user or the like. E.g. by means of a simple log-file which may be opened from time to time by a super-user or some kind of warning e.g. in the form of a text message to a system operator or securely sent electronically to the TSMADARS-server as part of the testsuite setup.","The rule list  (RL) may e.g. manually typed e.g. for simulation purposes or the rule list RL may, as illustrated in  by copied directly from the access rule lists  (ACL1),  (ACL2),  (ACL3) or  (ACL4) of all or some of the network units  (NU1),  (NU2),  (NU3) and  (NU4).","The advantage of merging the access rule lists  (ACL1),  (ACL2),  (ACL3) or  (ACL4) into a rule list (RL)  is that all established rules or filter functions are compared to the actual data traffic of the network.","The established monitoring and the comparisons may e.g. be used as internal watch-software applications, or it may be applied as an agent stored internally in the network reporting to an external centralized watch company e.g.  being in charge of the monitoring of the security of the company network. The agent may also be located externally at the external centralized watch company, e.g. in , provided that the external connection is secure and obviously, that the watch company is reliable.","The above described monitoring of the internal traffic in the data network should preferably be supported by tests on the firewalls etc. performed for the purpose of monitoring weak points of the interfaces between the external and internal part of the network. So to speak, a reliable security monitoring should preferably dynamically test the network firewalls ability of keeping undesired data traffic out of the internal part of the network as described according to the above-described system of  and the security monitoring should preferably dynamically monitor the data traffic of the internal part of the network in order to discover if undesired traffic has actually entered the internal part of the network. When unwanted traffic is discovered by simple pattern match performed by the UBA's internal algorithm and database system, alerts are securely sent electronically, e.g. e-mailed, to the local system administrator or to the TSMADARS-server.","Moreover, according to the first embodiment of the invention, the UBA may be applied for simulation purposes. If a modification of e.g. the access control list  (ACL2) of the firewall  (NU2) is considered, the modification may be simulated by modification of the reference list, thereby emulating the traffic occurring if the considered change is actually performed.","According to a second embodiment of applicable UBA's within the scope of the invention, a Log User Behavior Agent is established. The Log User Behavior Agent is adapted for checking different log files of the computer network, e.g. firewall logs, servers events logs, database log files, etc. The UBA should check these log files and give a warning if user behavior agent detects if activities or users behave different or deviates from normal expected user behavior.","The log-user behavior agent LUBA, should be able of detecting a track in the above-mentioned log-files unusual behavior, and then map the activities of the user until the user log-out. This may e.g. be done by tracking all the destination addresses for the unit associated to the log-file until it leaves the network. The log-file may according to the illustrated embodiment be established in the database , e.g. by means of the already established measuring points - or in many other suitable ways.","The below example illustrates the meaning of collecting log-messages from e.g. a Tabasco router.

Certain types of deviating behavior should be reported to the network responsible and to the TSMADARS operators.","According to a fourth embodiment of applicable UBA's within the scope of the invention, a Macro-Log User Behavior Agent, MLUBA, is established.","Basically, the MLUBA's operates in the same way as the LUBA's, with the exception that these agents are adapted for detecting whether user behavior is deviating from the expected on a long-term basis. Thus a Macro-Log User Behavior Agent, MLUBA reports if incidents, e.g. detected for example by the Log User Behavior Agents, are repeated over a long period for example in certain patterns."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"THE FIGURES","p":["The invention will be described in further detail with reference to the drawings, of which",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 3-FIG","b":"7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
