App. No. 61\/113,969, filed Nov. 12, 2008, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","1. Technical Field","This application relates to an agent feedback tool and, in particular, to an agent feedback tool comprising an agent feedback program operative to autopopulate one or more editable fields based on a provided agent identifier.","2. Related Art","Providing superb customer service is often a goal for many businesses. On the frontline of these customer-service businesses are agents, such as customer service representatives, salespersons, and technical support individuals. These agents typically communicate first with the customer when a customer contacts a customer-service oriented business for customer service. Hence, a customer-service oriented business has an interest in ensuring that the customer service provided by the agent is of the upmost quality.","Monitoring the customer service provided by agents is often a laborious and time-consuming endeavor. A customer may have any number of issues and an agent may not always provide the appropriate level of service to the customer for any number of reasons. There may be a lack of training, lack of experience, or any other number of issues. It is important to track the agent's performance, yet the varying level of customer service provided by the agent is not always monitored and a customer-service oriented business suffers as a result.","The agent feedback tool assists in the management and review of agent feedback. In one implementation, the agent feedback tool includes an agent profile program, an agent feedback program, a vendor identification program, an agent feedback settings program, an agent reporting program, and an agent summary program. The agent feedback tool programs communicate with an agent feedback database for managing and displaying the agent feedback.","In one implementation, the agent feedback database includes an agent feedback mapping record that has an agent-specific vendor identification entry, an agent-specific location identification entry, an agent identification entry, and an agent-specific agent feedback entry. The agent-specific vendor identification entry stores an agent-specific vendor identifier and the agent-specific location identification entry stores an agent-specific location identifier. The agent identification entry stores an agent identifier and the agent-specific agent feedback entry stores an agent feedback identifier. The agent-specific vendor identifier, the agent-specific location identifier, and the agent feedback identifier may be specific for the agent identified by the agent identifier.","In one implementation, the agent profile program is operable to generate an agent profile graphical user interface that includes an editable agent-specific vendor identification field and an editable agent-specific location identification field. The editable agent-specific vendor identification field receives the previously mentioned agent-specific vendor identifier and the editable agent-specific location identification field receives the agent-specific location identifier. In addition, the agent profile program is operable to populate the agent-specific vendor identification entry with the received agent-specific vendor identifier and populate the agent-specific location identification entry with the received agent-specific location identifier.","The agent feedback tool also includes an agent feedback program. The agent feedback program is operable to display an agent feedback graphical user interface. The agent feedback graphical user interface includes an agent selector entry, an agent-specific vendor identification field, and an agent-specific location identification field. The agent selector entry is configured to accept an agent identifier that identifies an agent.","In one implementation, the agent feedback program autopopulates one or more fields using the agent feedback mapping record. For example, the agent feedback program may reference the agent feedback mapping record using the agent identifier, or any other identifier, to retrieve the agent-specific vendor identifier and the agent-specific location identifier. After retrieving the agent-specific vendor identifier and the agent-specific location identifier, the agent feedback program may then autopopulate the agent-specific vendor identification field with the agent-specific vendor identifier and the agent-specific location identification field with the agent-specific location identifier. The agent feedback program is also operable to accept agent feedback and store a corresponding agent-specific agent feedback identifier in the agent-specific agent feedback entry","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["104","110","102","114","112","112","112","112","112"]},"The clients - may be thin-clients, desktop computers, laptop computers, handheld devices, or any other type of computing client now known or later developed. The clients - may communicate with the agent feedback tool  using a computer program for displaying graphical elements, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer available from the Microsoft Corporation, located in Redmond, Wash. Another type of computer program for displaying graphical elements includes Firefox, available from the Mozilla Corporation, located in Mountain View, Calif. The clients - may also use other types of computer programs such as spreadsheet-based computer programs, document editing computer programs, or any other type of computer program now known or later developed.","The clients - communicate with the agent feedback tool  to manage agents and feedback for the agents. Agents include customer service representatives, call handlers, salesperson, and other types of individual who interact with the customers of an enterprise. Managing agents may include adding personal agent information, removing personal agent information, updating personal agent information, modifying agent information, adding agents, deleting agents, or other type of management. Examples of personal agent information include an agent's name, the agent's vendor or employer, the location of where the agent is employed, the duration of the agent's employment, the name of the agent's supervisor, or other personal agent information. Additional information for an agent is further described with reference to .","Feedback generally describes evaluative information derived from an interaction. In the context of the agent feedback tool , agent feedback describes evaluative information derived from an interaction between an agent and another actor, such as another agent, customer, vendor, or other entity. For example, the feedback for an agent may describe whether the feedback is for a complaint or commendation, a primary issue of the entity that led to the feedback, the cause of the feedback, and details relating to the cause of the feedback. Other types of feedback are also possible.","Managing the feedback may include a number of administrative and\/or personal actions. In the context of administrative actions, managing feedback may include adding, removing, or updating the types or specific descriptions of feedback, and whether the types or specific descriptions of feedback are visible to a user of the agent feedback tool . As discussed with reference to , managing feedback may include managing primary agent feedback and managing secondary agent feedback. Any other level of feedback, such as tertiary or quaternary, is also possible.","In the context of personal actions, managing feedback may include providing, editing, or removing feedback for an agent. The feedback for an agent may also include primary agent feedback and secondary agent feedback. Primary feedback may be top-level feedback and secondary feedback may be feedback that provides additional details regarding a top-level feedback. Other feedback levels, such as tertiary and quaternary feedbacks, are also possible. Managing feedback for an agent may be based on the available, viewable, and\/or selectable feedback.","The agent feedback tool facilitates managing of agents and feedback. In one implementation, the agent feedback tool  includes an input\/output interface , a memory , and a processor . The input\/output interface  receives instructions and communications from the clients - via the network . The input\/output interface  may be any communication interface such as a hardware interface, a software interface, or a combination of hardware and software interfaces. Examples of hardware interfaces include a keyboard, a mouse, a network interface device, an IDE interface, a SATA interface, or any other hardware interface now known or later developed.","The input\/output interface processes input from the clients - and passes the input to the processor . The processor  may be any type of hardware processor, software processor, or a combination of hardware and software processors. The processor  communicates the input to an agent feedback module  stored in a memory . The memory  may also store an agent feedback database .","The input received from the clients - may include database access requests, profile access requests, manage feedback requests, manage agent requests, or any other type of request. The input received from the clients - may also include data, such as a vendor identifier, location identifier, agent identifier, feedback, agent personal information, or any other information. Other types of inputs are also possible.","The agent feedback module  processes the input from the processor . The agent feedback module  may be implemented in hardware or software. In one implementation, the agent feedback module  is implemented using an Internet web site, a Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d)  database, and one or more Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. SQL  is also commercially available from the Microsoft Corporation.","In processing the input, the agent feedback module  may communicate one or more database queries to the agent feedback database . After processing the input from the processor , the agent feedback module  communicates outputs to the processor , which are then communicated to the clients - via the input\/output interface  and network . Outputs from the agent feedback module  may include instructions for displaying a graphical user interfaces, vendor information, location information, agent personal information, agent feedback information, or any other type of output now known or later developed. The outputs may also include instructions for displaying a mapping record, such as an agent feedback mapping record, a vendor identification mapping record, or any other type of mapping record.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 12","FIG. 13","FIG. 12","FIG.

The vendor identification program  facilitates the management of vendor information stored in the vendor identification table . A vendor may be the entity that employs the agent. However, the vendor may also have some other relation to the agent.","The vendor identification table  may include one or more vendor identification mapping records. A vendor mapping record may include a global vendor identification entry and a vendor-specific location identification entry. The global vendor identification entry stores a vendor identifier that identifies a vendor. The global vendor identification entry is global because it may be accessed by one or more programs, such as the agent feedback program  or other programs. The vendor-specific location identification entry stores a vendor-specific location identifier that identifies a location specific to the vendor. For example, the vendor-specific location identifier may identify a geographic location of the vendor, such as where the vendor is headquartered, or the vendor-specific location identifier may identify a location where the vendor operates. The vendor-specific location identifier may identify other locations, such as where the vendor has clients or other contacts. Other locations identified by the vendor-specific location identifier are also possible.
