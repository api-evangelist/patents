{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","p":["This application is the National Stage Entry of International Application No. PCT\/US2003\/040302 filed Dec. 16, 2003, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/433,739, filed Dec. 16, 2002.","The methods, systems, computer readable media and so on described herein relate generally to eye surgery related computer programming and more particularly to updating a corneal ablative algorithm based on correlations between pre-operative measurements and predicted post-operative results as modeled in a parametric model.","More than one million laser refractive surgeries based on a mean population response eye are performed every year to correct myopia. Of the many individuals treated with conventional procedures, about 15% to 50% do not achieve 20\/20 vision due, at least in part, to the relationship of the patient eye to the mean population response eye and the dependence of refractive procedures on the mean population response eye. Additionally, many individuals cannot benefit from corneal ablative techniques because their eyes do not fall within parameters modeled by the mean population response eye. Although a greater percentage of individuals treated with customized or wavefront guided procedures achieve 20\/20 vision than with conventional procedures, visual aberrations are still induced in a significant number of patients, which degrade vision from the planned outcome of a reduction in aberrations over the pre-operative state.","Initial attempts at photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) used a model presented in 1988 by Munnerlyn, et al. The cornea was modeled as two refracting surfaces with a bulk material in between the two refracting surfaces where there was a known index of refraction. In treating myopia, the goal was to increase the anterior radius of curvature, thus decreasing the curvature and thus power of the anterior surface as illustrated in FIG. . A simple geometric formula resulted, which assumed the targeted corneal shape was a function of the ablation profile. This is the \u201cshape subtraction\u201d paradigm, based on a geometric approach to tissue removal and secondary curvature change, where the final corneal shape is assumed to be determined by how much tissue is subtracted by a laser. Essentially, this model treats the cornea as a piece of plastic to be sculpted into an ideal surface shape by laser ablation.","The equations described by Munnerlyn, et al. still serve as a starting point for ablation algorithms. However, PRK, Laser Epithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK), and Laser Assisted in-Situ Keratomileusis (LASEK) fail to consistently produce expected refractive outcomes.","The following presents a simplified summary of methods, systems, and computer readable media employed to customize ablative algorithms based on a parametric model that correlates measurements taken pre-operatively and\/or during surgery with predicted post-operative results to facilitate providing a basic understanding of these items. This summary is not an extensive overview and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the methods, systems, and computer readable media or to delineate the scope of these items. This summary provides a conceptual introduction in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","This application concerns updating an ablative algorithm based on individual measurements taken before and\/or during surgery. The measurements have been correlated with desired predicted post-operative results. Example measurements include, but are not limited to, modulus of elasticity, corneal acoustic response to ultrasonic excitation, pachymetric profile in multiple meridians, pachymetric asymmetry between vertical and horizontal meridians, magnitude of difference in pachymetry between center and periphery, corneal width, anterior chamber angle and depth, corneal curvature profile in multiple meridians, magnitude of astigmatism, difference in astigmatism between center and periphery topographic response to the cutting of a LASIK flap. Example correlations include, but are not limited to, greater peripheral thickness causing greater spherical aberration. For example, measuring peripheral thickness facilitates predicting post-operative spherical aberration, thus a peripheral thickness measurement in the range {a, b} suggests (taking action to increase peripheral ablation, diminishing post-operative spherical aberration).","Over time, the response of a cornea to ablative surgery (e.g., LASEK, PRK, LASIK) has been studied. Of a large number of parameters available to measure a cornea, mathematical techniques identified correlations between certain pre-operative measurements and predicted post-operative results. Thus, customized and customizable corneal ablative systems and methods that benefit from the studies and correlations were developed. The corneal ablative systems and methods depart from conventional ablative techniques that treat the corneal as a piece of plastic and\/or that do not consider individual parameters (e.g., modulus of elasticity). Example parameters for which correlations were made include, but are not limited to, modulus of elasticity, corneal acoustic response to ultrasonic excitation, pachymetric profile in multiple meridians, pachymetric asymmetry between vertical and horizontal meridians, magnitude of difference in pachymetry between center and periphery, corneal width, anterior chamber angle and depth, corneal curvature profile in multiple meridians, magnitude of astigmatism, difference in astigmatism between center and periphery topographic response to the cutting of a LASIK flap. Thus, LASEK, LASIK and\/or PRK procedures can be improved by taking pre-operative measurements of the eye, and choosing and\/or customizing an ablation algorithm based on correlations in a parametric model. In LASIK, in addition to pre-operative measurements, measurements taken during a surgical procedure facilitate further customizing the ablation algorithm.","Example methods, systems, and computer media are now described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to facilitate thoroughly understanding the methods, systems, computer readable media and so on.

Biomechanically, this approximates a 160-micron depth severing of corneal lamellae, similar to an ablation, except no tissue is removed. The amount of corneal flattening produced by the flap cut predicts certain post-operative results. Analyzing topography of the epithelial surface of the cornea, before and after cutting the flap, permits identifying correlations between the topography and certain post-operative results. Thus, this application describes example systems and methods that facilitate updating an ablative algorithm based, at least in part, on correlations associated with corneal measurements taken before and\/or after cutting a LASIK flap.","To facilitate identifying correlations between pre-operative measurements and\/or measurements taken during surgery and predicted post-operative results, and to facilitate building the parametric model, a study was conducted on 2380 patients who received LASIK. The patients had corneal topography measurements taken pre-operatively and post-operatively.","Correlations were also identified by in vitro studies. In one study, fourteen de-epitheliazed eye bank globes from seven donors were subjected in paired control fashion to either broad beam PTK or sham photoablation. Changes in anterior curvature were measured by autokeratometry. Changes in stromal thickness in the vertical meridian were measured using corneal optical section image analysis. The corneal cross section was divided into five regions for analysis, far superior, near superior, central, near inferior, and far inferior. Analysis included evaluating peripheral thickness changes in geometric bias as predictors of curvature change. Geometric bias was defined as either a myopic or a hyperopic bias in the pattern of ablation zone thickness loss in order to investigate shape subtraction theories of hyperopic shift in PTK.","Results of this study demonstrated that photoablation caused reductions in keratometric curvature (\u22126.28+\/\u22123.23 D, p=0.002) relative to untreated paired controls. The mean keratometric shift measured during sham PTK was not significantly different from zero (+0.31+\/\u22120.85 D, p=0.38). In addition to flattening the spherical curvature component, ablated corneas demonstrated higher absolute magnitudes of keratometric cylinder (2.98+\/\u22120.88 D) than controls (0.46+\/\u22121.72 D, p=0.009), indicating a biomechanical component to the induced cylinder. The relative peripheral stromal thickness change, expressed as the mean pair wise difference (PTK-control), was +57.3+\/\u221242.8 \u03bcm (p=0.01) or +8.5+\/\u22125.7% (p=0.1), demonstrating thickening relative to controls. Central curvature shifts were linearly dependent upon regional peripheral stromal thickness changes in ablated and control eyes. Thus, further correlations were identified.","Another in vitro study further examined the relationship between peripheral stromal thickening and central flattening. A paired control human donor eye study (n=20) assessed pre-operative topical glutaraldehyde (GTA) treatment as a technique for inhibiting PTK induced peripheral stromal thickening and for attenuating the acute corneal flattening response. Eyes were individually mounted in a custom holder, inflated to normal intraocular pressure (about 15 mmHg) and de-epithelialized. One cornea of a given donor was immersed in a 15% dextran solution for 40 minutes and transferred to 4% GTA\/dextran for an additional 20 minutes. The fellow control was exposed to 15% dextran for 60 minutes. The eyes were subsequently subjected to (1) sham PTK, a same eye control phase incorporated to account for thinning due to intraoperative dehydration, (2) PTK (5 mm diameter, 100 \u03bcm depth) and (3) a one hour hypo-osmotic soak phase designed to assess the anti-swelling activity of stromal cross-linking. A scanning slit topography system (Orbscan) was employed to acquire triplicate thickness and curvature measurements before and after experimental phases. Cross-linking inhibited peripheral stromal thickening during PTK and postoperative hypo-osmotic immersion. In addition, during PTK, cross-linked corneas demonstrated 36% less hyperopic shift relative to paired controls (p=0.001). The magnitude of this latter effect was linearly dependent upon the magnitude of cross-link mediated suppression of the peripheral thickening response to PTK (r=0.68, p=0.03). Thus, acute hyperopic shifts in a donor model of PTK can be reduced through pre-operative application of a collagen cross-linking reagent. Thus, example systems and methods described herein rely, at least in part, on correlations associated with this study.","A retrospective analysis of a refractive surgery dataset was performed. The purpose of this analysis was two fold. A first purpose was to demonstrate the ability to perform data analysis on a large set of independent parameters extracted from preoperative clinical data. A second purpose was to seek preliminary confirmation of the biomechanical response model by analyzing refractive surgery outcomes and their statistical relationship to preoperative measured parameters, which was hypothesized to likely influence this response. The dataset used for this preliminary study was based upon a database created from an examination of 18 eyes of 9 patients measured preoperatively with an Orbscan II corneal topography system, at one day, one week, one month and three months after receiving LASIK with a Summit Apex Plus excimer laser. Nearly 200 preoperative parameters were calculated based on data extracted from the Orbscan topographies. These pre-operative parameters consisted of indices related to individual corneal geometries such as shape, pachymetry profiles in multiple meridians, white-to-white measurement of corneal size, anterior chamber depth, as well as surface curvature parameters. All 200 parameters were included as independent variables in a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis to determine which were significant predictors of the dependent post-operative outcome parameters. Outcome parameters included visual function parameters, such as spherical equivalent refraction, as well as outcome shape parameters based on a Zernike decomposition of the anterior surface elevation topography, measured at  months post-operatively.","Shown in Table 2 is the outcome of the stepwise regression with Zernike term #12 (Z) from the anterior surface elevation as the dependent outcome variable. Zis the term related to spherical aberration, which has been shown to be significantly increased after refractive surgery. The independent pre-operative parameters in table 2 are ranked based on their partial Rvalue. The strongest pre-operative predictor of post-operative Zin the topographic Zernike decomposition was an index labeled pak90_d. This index represents the difference between the central pachymetry and the peripheral pachymetry in a sector around the 90-degree meridian. This single variable accounts for approximately 66% of the variability in post-operative Z.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Variable","Number","Partial","Model",{},{}]},{"entry":["Step","Entered","Vars In","R-Square","R-Square","F Value","Pr > F"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","pak_90_d","1","0.6626","0.6626","27.49","0.0001"]},{"entry":["2","srax_pak_pr","2","0.1018","0.7644","5.62","0.0339"]},{"entry":["3","osi_ref_pr","3","0.0972","0.8616","8.42","0.0133"]},{"entry":["4","ww","4","0.048","0.9095","5.83","0.0343"]},{"entry":["5","ti_ref_pr","5","0.0307","0.9402","5.14","0.0468"]},{"entry":["6","ti_tan_pr","6","0.0202","0.9605","4.61","0.0603"]},{"entry":["7","tano_0_pr","7","0.0302","0.9907","26","0.0009"]},{"entry":["8","hormwb5_pr","8","0.0062","0.9969","13.95","0.0073"]},{"entry":["9","dsi_ref_pr","9","0.002","0.9989","10.73","0.0169"]},{"entry":["10","acd","10","0.0008","0.9997","11.9","0.0183"]},{"entry":["11","csi_pak_pr","11","0.0003","1","30.8","0.0052"]},{"entry":["12","refo_pr","12","0","1","16.75","0.0264"]},{"entry":["13","hormzc5_pr","13","0","1","36.2","0.0265"]},{"entry":["14","dsi_tan_pr","14","0","1","18578.2","0.0047"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The regression plot of parameter pak90_d (difference between the central pachymetry and the peripheral pachymetry around the 90 degree meridian) and Zernike term #12 is shown in .

Corneal measurements taken following cutting the corneal flap are therefore employed by some example methods and systems. As demonstrated above, the microkeratomic incision for the flap produces changes in the cornea. Since cutting the LASIK flap produces a response that facilitates predicting other responses, a method for customizing a refractive ophthalmic algorithm can include pre-operatively measuring the cornea, cutting the flap, measuring the cornea and\/or the flap, and adjusting an ablation algorithm based on stored correlations between the measurements and predicted post-operative results.","Turning now to , an example parametric model method  for selecting and\/or updating an ablative algorithm is presented. At , a parametric model is accessed. For example, a data base query can be made, a table can be referenced, a data structure can be accessed, a file can be read, and so on. Data retrieved from the parametric model may, for example, identify candidate correlations and thus identify pre-perturbation data of interest to the method .","At , the method  receives a pre-perturbation data concerning a cornea on which a refractive ophthalmic treatment will be performed. The pre-perturbation data can include, but is not limited to, topographic data, pachymetric data, elevation data, corneal thickness data, corneal curvature data, corneal acoustic response and ultrasonic data, wave front data, and intraocular pressure data, where such data are associated with the cornea before it has been perturbed. The pre-perturbation may be associated with one or more correlations.","Thus, the method facilitates updating an ablative algorithm based on individual measurements before surgery. The measurements have been experimentally and statistically correlated with desired post-operative results. Example measurements include, but are not limited to, modulus of elasticity, corneal acoustic response to ultrasonic excitation, pachymetric profile in multiple meridians, pachymetric asymmetry between vertical and horizontal meridians, magnitude of difference in pachymetry between center and periphery, corneal width, anterior chamber angle and depth, corneal curvature profile in multiple meridians, magnitude of astigmatism, difference in astigmatism between center and periphery topographic response to the cutting of a LASIK flap. Example correlations include, but are not limited to, greater peripheral thickness causing greater spherical aberration. For example, measuring peripheral thickness facilitates predicting post-operative spherical aberration, thus a peripheral thickness measurement in the range {a, b} suggests taking action to increase peripheral ablation, diminishing post-operative spherical aberration. The perturbation can be, for example, a corneal incision, a corneal ablation, a LASIK flap cut, peeling the epithelial layer from the cornea, ultrasounds, and so on. In one embodiment, the perturbation causes the severing of corneal lamellae.","Thus, at , the method  receives a post-perturbation data. The post-perturbation data can include, but is not limited to, topographic data, pachymetric data, elevation data, total corneal thickness data, corneal curvature data, wave front data, corneal acoustic response and ultrasonic data, flap thickness data, and intraocular pressure data. The perturbation can be, for example, a corneal incision, a corneal ablation, a LASIK flap cut, an epithelial layer peel, and ultrasounds.","At , an ablative surgical algorithm is updated based, at least in part, on the pre-perturbation data, the post-perturbation data, and one or more correlations between one or more of the pre-perturbation data and a predicted post-operative result, the post-perturbation data and a predicted post-operative results, and\/or the combination of the three.","The example method  thus relies on correlations between pre-perturbation data, post-perturbation data, and predicted post-operative results. For example, a pre-perturbation central flatness measurement, as related to a post-perturbation central flatness measurement may be correlated to a predicted post-operative central flatness result and thus an ablation depth may be updated in the ablation algorithm.","In an extension of method  (not illustrated), additional processing is undertaken. This additional processing includes receiving diagnostic data and selectively updating the parametric model based, at least in part, on the post-perturbation data and\/or the diagnostic data. In this way, the parametric model can be updated over time to become more complete and thus provide even more accurate predictions. The diagnostic data can include, but is not limited to, corneal acoustic response and ultrasonic data, patient satisfaction data, patient visual acuity and visual performance data, patient halo effect and contour sensitivity data, topographic data, pachymetric data, elevation data, total corneal thickness data, corneal curvature data, wave front data, intraocular pressure data, flap thickness data, and refractive data.","In one example, the method  is run on a stand alone computer component that communicates via computer communications with a surgical laser. In another example, the method is run in a computer component located inside a surgical laser apparatus. In yet another example, portions of the method may run on a stand alone computer component while other portions of the method may run in a computer component located inside a surgical laser apparatus, with the two portions of the method communicating via a computer communication.","Turning now to , an example corneal ablative surgical method  is illustrated. The method  includes, at , measuring a first set of corneal measurements. These measurements are taken before any corneal lamellae are severed. The measurements can include, but are not limited to, corneal acoustic response and ultrasound data, topographic data, pachymetric data, elevation data, corneal thickness data, corneal curvature data, wave front data, intraocular pressure data, peripheral stroma thickness data, an age datum, a sex datum, years of contact lens use data, and prior surgical response data and can be acquired by one or more of corneal topography, optical coherence tomography, wave front analysis, ultrasound, and patient interview.","At , based on the data acquired at , a corneal ablative algorithm is selectively updated. For example, portions of the algorithm may be enhanced, other portions may be diminished, some may be added, and others may be deleted. Furthermore, an algorithm may initially be chosen based on the data acquired at , and then the chosen algorithm may be updated. The choice of an algorithm and its selective updating are based, at least in part, on one or more correlations between the data acquired at  and one or more desired post-operative results, where the correlations are stored in a parametric model.","At , the surgical method includes severing one or more corneal lamellae. The severing can occur as the result of, for example, cutting a LASIK flap, corneal scraping, ablation, epithelial peeling, and the like. In another example, where the surgical method is performed by a surgical apparatus and the method  is in operable and\/or data communication with the surgical apparatus, the method  may not include severing the corneal lamellae. Rather, the method  would be confined to performing the algorithm updating based on the measurements and correlations. Thus, rather than being a surgical method, the alternate method would be a surgical support method.","At , measuring a second set of corneal measurements occurs. These measurements are taken after one or more corneal lamellae are severed. The measurements can include, but are not limited to, corneal acoustic response and ultrasound data, topographic data, pachymetric data, elevation data, corneal thickness data, corneal curvature data, wave front data, intraocular pressure data, peripheral stroma thickness data, an age datum, a sex datum, years of contact lens use data, and prior surgical response data and can be acquired by one or more of corneal topography, optical coherence tomography, wave front analysis, ultrasound, and patient interview.","At , the method includes selectively updating the ablation algorithm based on the second set of corneal measurements and one or more correlations between the measurements and post-operative results stored in a parametric model. Additionally, and\/or alternatively, the correlations may relate the first set of corneal measurements and the second set of corneal measurements with desired post-operative results and suggested algorithm updates.","At , the surgical method  includes ablating corneal tissue according to the updated algorithm. In one example, the method  is run on a stand alone computer component that communicates via computer communications with a surgical laser. In another example, the method  is run in a computer component located inside a surgical laser apparatus. In yet another example, portions of the method  may run on a stand alone computer component while other portions of the method may run in a computer component located inside a surgical laser apparatus, with the two portions of the method  communicating via a computer communication. In another example, where the surgery is performed by a person and\/or apparatus in operable and\/or data communication with the method , then the method  may not include , this act being performed by an entity related to but not part of the method. Thus, the method  would be a surgical support method rather than a surgical method.","In an example method, corneal measurements are taken by methods including, but not limited to, corneal topography, optical coherence tomography, ultrasound (including high frequency ultrasound), refraction, and\/or wave front analysis. These measurements are taken before and after the microkeratomic incision for the corneal flap. Ablation algorithm adjustments can thus be made in advance of the ablation in a separate procedure and\/or in real time as an intraoperative adjustment after the perturbation (e.g., cut, ablation) but before the ablation.","Example correlations concern factors including, but not limited to, Young's modulus, age, sex, race, years of contact lens wear, thickness, curvature, and corneal size. For example, corneas of older individuals tend to be stiffer than those of younger individuals. Thus, myopic procedures generally apply less ablation to older corneas to achieve the same level of correction.","Regression analysis between central curvature change and peripheral elevation change from thirty subjects who underwent LASIK procedures demonstrated a positive correlation (R=0.56, p<0.0001) indicating that the greater the increase in elevation outside the ablation zone, the greater the flattening curvature change centrally. Thus, this application describes example systems and methods that are adapted based on pre-operative measurements and\/or measurements taken during a surgical procedure, based, at least in part, on this and\/or other determined correlations. The correlations can be stored, for example, in a parametric model.","In one case study, regression analysis of central curvature versus peripheral stromal thickness was performed. The plots of this analysis are illustrated in . Central curvature has a negative correlation with peripheral thickness, both inferior and superior, meaning the greater the peripheral thickness, the flatter the central curvature.  illustrates a regression analysis of peripheral stromal thickness of the superior region (left) and inferior region (right) against curvature in the central 3 mm region, pre-operatively and at 4 time points post-operatively after PRK in one patient. This demonstrates how central curvature for this patient closely tracked peripheral stromal thickness over time. Thus, the application describes example systems and methods that are customizable based on pre-operative measurements and\/or measurements taken during surgery based, at least in part, on correlations associated with peripheral stromal thickness.","Turning now to , an example corneal ablative algorithm updating method  is illustrated. This example method does not employ measurements taken during surgery. Thus, method  may be employed, for example, in LASEK and PRK. Additionally, it could be employed in LASIK surgery. The method  includes, at , accessing a parametric model that stores one or more correlations between pre-operative measurements and post-operative results, which facilitates retrieving and\/or generating updates to an ablative algorithm. The correlations are associated with suggested adaptations to ablative algorithms. In one example, the correlations are associated with suggestions for choosing an ablative algorithm that may then be customized based on pre-operative measurements.","At , pre-operative data is received. The data can include, but is not limited to, patient visual acuity and visual performance data, corneal acoustic response and ultrasound data, topographic data, pachymetric data, elevation data, corneal thickness data, corneal curvature data, wave front data, intraocular pressure data, peripheral stroma thickness data, an age datum, a sex datum, years of contact lens use data, and a prior surgical response data and can be acquired by one or more of patient questioning, corneal topography, optical coherence tomography, wave front analysis, ultrasound, and patient interview.","At , based on the pre-operative data and one or more correlations relating one or more pieces of pre-operative data and predicted post-operative results, a corneal ablative algorithm can be updated. For example, measuring peripheral thickness facilitates predicting post-operative spherical aberration, thus a peripheral thickness measurement in the range {a, b} suggests taking action to increase peripheral ablation, diminishing post-operative spherical aberration. While a one to one correlation is described, it is to be appreciated that two or more pieces of pre-operative data can be related to one or more predicted post-operative results.","In one example, the method  is complete at . But in another example, the method  includes, at , ablating tissue in accordance with the updated ablative algorithm. In one example, the method  is run on a stand-alone computer component that communicates via computer communications with a surgical laser. In another example, the method  is run in a computer component located inside a surgical laser apparatus. In yet another example, portions of the method  may run on a stand alone computer component while other portions of the method  may run in a computer component located inside a surgical laser apparatus, with the two portions of the method  communicating via a computer communication.","Turning now to , a method  for updating an algorithm is illustrated. The method  does not include performing surgery, rather it concerns updating an algorithm that is employed during surgery. Thus, the method  may be run remotely from the surgery. For example, a surgeon with a laser surgical tool may be located in a remote location (e.g., hospital overseas). The patient can benefit from processing performed remotely (e.g., hospital in U.S.) by method . Thus, the method  and the surgeon and\/or laser surgical tool may be in data communication via computer communications. For example, data packets carrying data and\/or carrier waves carrying computer executable instructions may pass between the method  and the surgeon and\/or laser. Similarly, other example methods and systems described herein may engage in similar data transfer and\/or instruction transfer.","At , the method  access a model  that stores correlations between pre-perturbation data and predicted post-operative results. At , pre-perturbation data is received. Based on the data received, its values, and one or more correlations between the data, its values, and a predicted post-operative result(s), at , an ablative algorithm is updated. For example, the pre-perturbation data may be related to a post-operative result in a manner that suggests that additional ablation in an additional zone should be undertaken. Thus, an ablation algorithm can be suitably updated. For example, an additional record in a database of locations to be ablated could be added, instructions for ablating to a certain depth could be added to an algorithm, timing instructions could be updated, pre-determined, configurable data values and\/or limits could be manipulated, and so on.","At , post-perturbation data is received. Then, at , based on a correlation(s) between the post-perturbation data and predicted post-operative results, the ablative algorithm can be updated again. Additionally, and\/or alternatively, a correlation between pre-perturbation data, post-perturbation data, and a predicted post-operative result can identify algorithm updates.","Those skilled in the art of computer programming, mathematical computer modeling, and\/or data base manipulation and administration will readily appreciate that example systems and methods described herein may be embodied in software and\/or one or more computer components. Thus,  illustrates a computer  that includes a processor , a memory , a disk , input\/output ports , and a network interface  operably connected by a bus .

It is to be appreciated that other computers may also be employed with the systems and methods described herein.","The processor  can be a variety of various processors including dual microprocessor and other multi-processor architectures. The memory  can include volatile memory and\/or non-volatile memory. The non-volatile memory can include, but is not limited to, read only memory (ROM), programmable read only memory (PROM), electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), and the like.

The bus  can be of a variety of types including, but not limited to, a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus or external bus, and\/or a local bus. The local bus can be of varieties including, but not limited to, an industrial standard architecture (ISA) bus, a microchannel architecture (MSA) bus, an extended ISA (EISA) bus, a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus, a universal serial (USB) bus, and a small computer systems interface (SCSI) bus.","The computer  interacts with input\/output devices  via input\/output ports . Input\/output devices  can include, but are not limited to, a keyboard, a microphone, a pointing and selection device, cameras, video cards, displays, and the like. The input\/output ports  can include but are not limited to, serial ports, parallel ports, and USB ports.","The computer  can operate in a network environment and thus is connected to a network  by a network interface . Through the network , the computer  may be logically connected to a remote computer .

During corneal ablative surgery, the methods described herein may be performed on a computer system with which a surgical team member communicates. Data may be input to the computer during the surgical process. The method can then update the algorithm that is employed in subsequent steps of the surgery.","The systems, methods, data structures, models and objects described herein may be stored, for example, on a computer readable media. Media can include, but are not limited to, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a compact disc (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a programmable read only memory (PROM), a disk, a carrier wave, a memory stick, and the like. Thus, an example computer readable medium can store computer executable instructions for the methods claimed herein and equivalents thereof.","Referring now to , an application programming interface (API)  is illustrated providing access to a system  for ablative algorithm updating. The API  can be employed, for example, by programmers  and\/or processes  to gain access to processing performed by the system . For example, a programmer  can write a program to access the system  (e.g., to invoke its operation, to monitor its operation, to access its functionality) where writing a program is facilitated by the presence of the API . Thus, rather than the programmer  having to understand the internals of the system , the programmer's task is simplified by merely having to learn the interface to the system . This facilitates encapsulating the functionality of the system  while exposing that functionality. Similarly, the API  can be employed to provide data values to the system  and\/or retrieve data values from the system .","For example, a process  that retrieves corneal measurements can provide the corneal measurements to the system  and\/or the programmers  via the API  by, for example, using a call provided in the API . Thus, in one example of the API , a set of application program interfaces can be stored on a computer-readable medium. The interfaces can be executed by a computer component to gain access to a system for ablative algorithm updating. Interfaces can include, but are not limited to, a first interface  that facilitates communicating measurement data associated with corneal ablative surgery, a second interface  that facilitates communicating correlation data associated with ablative algorithm updating, and a third interface  that facilitates communicating algorithm updating data and\/or instructions generated from the measurement data and the correlation data by the algorithm updater .","Referring now to , information can be transmitted between various computer components associated with ablative algorithm updating described herein via a data packet .
