title: Relay apparatus, relay method, relay system, and non-transitory computer-readable storage medium
abstract: A relay apparatus detects a request, sent from a communication apparatus, to grant an access authority for a desired resource, sends, in the case where the request to grant the access authority has been detected, an authorization request requesting the granting of the access authority to a server, receives an authorization response, which is a response to the authorization request, from the server, saves the authorization response, generates an authorization relay response based on the authorization response, and sends the authorization relay response to the communication apparatus, wherein in the case where a request to grant the access authority sent from another communication apparatus different from the communication apparatus has been detected, the relay apparatus sends the authorization relay response in response to the request to the other communication apparatus based on the saved authorization response.

A user can upload image content to a photo-sharing service, send messages to friends, or the like by using such communication apparatuses. Normally, a resource server for a photo-sharing service or the like manages access authority for resources such as content, files, and the like on the resource server in tandem with an authorization server (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-39793).","Authorization servers are increasingly using the OAuth protocol to manage (grant) access authority. The authorization code type and the implicit type are examples of authorization types for obtaining an access token according to OAuth. In the case of the authorization code type, first, a communication apparatus obtains, from an authorization server, an access token indicating access authority for a desired resource and a refresh token for refreshing the access token. In the case of the implicit type, first, the communication apparatus obtains the access token from the authorization server. When making a request to obtain the desired resource from a resource server, the communication apparatus issues the request along with the access token obtained from the authorization server. The resource server sends the requested resource to the communication apparatus only in the case where the access token is valid. With the authorization code type, in the case where the access token has expired, the communication apparatus can refresh the access token by providing the refresh token to the authorization server.","The authorization server requires the user's authorization when delegating the user's access authority to the communication apparatus using the OAuth protocol. Normally, the authorization server presents an HTML screen for the user to carry out an operation for granting the access authority, and the user carries out the operation for granting the access authority in a web browser.","However, when the authorization server distributes the same access token to multiple communication apparatuses according the conventional technique, it is assumed that the user will need to carry out the operation for granting access authority using the web browser each time an access token is distributed. In other words, it is necessary for the user to carry out user authentication and operations for granting the access authority the same number of times as there are communication apparatuses. Such operations are complicated for the user.","Having been conceived in light of the aforementioned problems, it is an object of the present invention to lighten the burden of user operations with respect to a process for granting access authority.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a relay apparatus capable of relaying communication between a communication apparatus and a server, which comprises: a detection unit configured to detect a request, sent from the communication apparatus, to grant an access authority for a desired resource; a first sending unit configured to send, in the case where the request to grant the access authority has been detected by the detection unit, an authorization request requesting the granting of the access authority to the server; a receiving unit configured to receive an authorization response, which is a response to the authorization request, from the server; a saving unit configured to save the authorization response received by the receiving unit; a generating unit configured to generate an authorization relay response based on the authorization response; and a second sending unit configured to send the authorization relay response generated by the generating unit to the communication apparatus, wherein in the case where a request to grant the access authority sent from another communication apparatus different from the communication apparatus has been detected, the second sending unit sends the authorization relay response in response to the request to the other communication apparatus based on the authorization response saved by the saving unit.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).","The present embodiment describes a case in which a user  operates a communication apparatus  and starts an authorization process from the communication apparatus .  is a diagram illustrating an example of the configuration of an authorization relay system according to the present embodiment.
