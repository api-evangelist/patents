No. 14\/604,644 filed Jan. 23, 2015, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9,383,172 on Jul. 5, 2016 and assigned Navy Case 103110.","The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to tiles for body armor. In particular, the invention relates to interlocking tiles to provide protection from small arms fire with improved flexibility.","During combat and insurgency patrol, military personnel can be subject to small-arms fire from gun-fired projectile rounds, as well as blast and fragmentation from grenades, designed to attack flesh. Personnel struck by such weapons can suffer serious or even mortal injury. To reduce vulnerability to combatants from such lethal contacts, wearable personnel armor, such as a vest with resistant-fiber mesh, has been developed. Further improvements have integrated high strength intermediary materials to further absorb or deflect kinetic impacts. Such measures have added weight and reduced flexibility for personnel so clad.","Conventional tactical body armor within the United States armed forces consists of small arms protective insert (SAPI) and Enhanced SAPI (ESAPI) ceramic trauma plates. The plates vary in performance where the SAPI plates are capable of defeating M80 ball rounds and the ESAPI is capable of defeating .30 caliber M2AP rounds. The plates are inserted within an interceptor vest which is capable of stopping 9 mm\u00d719 mm handgun bullets. Conventional ESAPI\/SAPI plates are comparatively large and bulky, and additionally limit flexibility of the wearer.","Conventional body armor yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an angled hexagonal tile (AHT) to incorporate as an interleaving arrayed plurality for a personnel armor clothing article. The plurality for the array is adhered onto a liner substrate. The AHT includes a hexagonally-symmetric solid object composed of a homogeneous material. The object includes a geometry that has obverse and reverse planar surfaces parallel to each other and separated by a thickness. Each planar surface has triangularly disposed terminals. Each obverse terminal is angularly offset to an adjacent reverse terminal.","In exemplary embodiments, the terminals on each corresponding planar surface have a length between a vertex at a first terminal and a center-point between second and third terminals. A first triple set of obverse-facing oblique surfaces is disposed between the obverse and reverse planar surfaces. Each obverse-facing oblique surface connects an obverse center-point on the obverse planar surface and a corresponding reverse terminal on the reverse planar surface. A second triple set of reverse-facing oblique surfaces is disposed between the obverse and reverse planar surfaces.","Each reverse-facing oblique surface connects an obverse terminal on the obverse planar surface and a corresponding reverse center-point on the reverse planar surface. A plurality of facets is disposed substantially perpendicular to the planar surfaces. The facets connect between edges of the planar surfaces and adjacent edges of the oblique surfaces. The first and second triple sets of oblique surfaces are disposed to alternate with each other.","In various embodiments, the object is composed of ceramic. In alternate embodiments, the planar surfaces form a contiguous triangular arrangement of hexagons. In other embodiments, these surfaces form a triangular boundary terminated by elongated octagons.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Exemplary embodiments provide an interlocking tile geometry that improves protection of a surface otherwise vulnerable to kinetic collision, such as from bullet impact. Such tiles can be arranged between substrate layers to provide contiguous yet flexible shock-absorbent material in a wearable clothing article, such as in a jacket to protect the wearer's torso. The layers can represent a variety of woven fabrics, such as aramid Kevlar\u00ae and high-modulus polyethylene Spectra\u00ae.","The tile design corresponds to a hexagonally symmetric form to represent an angled hexagonal tile (AHT) geometry. The AHTs provide three advantages including: (a) angled interfaces that reduce interstitial vulnerability from conventional tiles, (b) force distribution enhances multi-impact capability by reduced damage propagation, and (c) adhesion to one surface of the AHTs to a flexible fabric facilitates flexibility with an integrated and contiguous area of body protection from blunt force trauma.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","115","110","100","120","125","120","125"]},"Triple upward-facing oblique rectangular wedges  concatenate alternatingly with counterpart triple downward-facing oblique rectangular wedges .

In particular, flexing constitutes angular separation of the respective constituent tiles  and  from their neighbors. For example for view , striking the aft unit  causes its downward deflection in the \u2212y direction (see rose ). The adjacent units, including 220, 250 and 260, are constrained laterally by their substrate layers (not shown), and thus deflect by tilting, while maintaining protection against subsequent impacts without serious gaps.","Type of AHT deformation depends on composition material. The AHT can be considered to be a homogeneous substantially isotropic material. Ceramic units, such as boron carbide (BC), silicon carbide (SiC) and alumina (AlO), can fracture under high compressive and shear loads. Ceramic material can also include boron carbide derivatives, such as boron carbide nitride, poly(6-cyclooctenyldecaborane) and poly(6-norbornenyldecaborane). Other more ductile materials (e.g., metals) can plastically deform without shattering, but at lower yield strengths than typical for ceramics.","To enable the development of flexible body armor that reduces blunt force trauma from a projectile strike, reduces vulnerabilities from interstitial joints, benefits from decreased weight, and increases multi-hit capability over conventional designs. The force from bullet impact against an angled hexagonal tile matrix is distributed across multiple tiles while still enabling each individual tile to flex. In addition, the angled sides reduce the vulnerabilities of the joining seams, where the angled joints can either deflect or dissipate incident threats.","Based on desire to reduce weight, increase multi-hit capability, and enhance flexibility, the AHT has been designed to satisfy these requirements. The first AHT design modifies geometry relative to the second AHT design, thereby simplifying the production, lowering the cost, and minimizing the number of interface surfaces to improve the transmission of shock waves across each other, instead of the wearer.","The AHT objects can replace the conventional SAPI\/ESAPI plates with the ceramic AHTs, forming equivalent surface area coverage but with fewer gaps for improved bodily protection. Preferably, the ceramic materials are composed of either boron carbide or silicon carbide, and can be manufactured to near theoretical maximum density to provide optimal material properties. Alternative ceramics can be used, including compositions that derive from boron carbide.","The ceramic AHT units are joined together in an array and adhered to a spall liner fabric substrate. After adhesion to the liner, the AHTs  and\/or  can optionally be encapsulated within polyurea foam. This technique is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2012\/0312150, incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The exemplary AHTs can be integrated into the body armor system similar to the current SAPI\/ESAPI plates as inserts. For each exemplary first AHT , the six peripheral faces  and  are angularly disposed in relation to the nominal hexagonal orientation, with each AHT  having three positively angled wedges  and three negatively angled wedges  alternating symmetrically back and forth along the periphery.","The adherence of the reverse surface  to the spall liner inhibits lateral tile movement. In response to kinetic impact, the AHTs  direct force on each neighboring tile through the angled wedges  and , enabling the impact energy to be distributed across all of the AHTs . The angled wedges also reduce the interstitial vulnerability at seams between tiles  by eliminating straight-through points. This similarly applies to the second AHT .","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
