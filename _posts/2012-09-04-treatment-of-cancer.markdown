Continued search and development of more anti-cancer agents to complement or replace existing treatments is clearly desired.","Embodiments of this disclosure are based on the discovery that cholesterol-lowing drugs, statins, have epigenetic modulating adjuvant activities, thereby epigenetically altering the regulation of expression of genes in chromosomes. Specifically, statins inhibit histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and\/or and a histone lysine specific demethylase 2 (LSD2) and bring forth cell death in the human cancer cell. Inhibiting LSD1 and 2 activities specifically affect the methylation states of genes encompassed in chromatins; the methylation level of genes is increased, which leads to alter gene expression. The cell death, apoptosis, which is induced by statins, is not mitigated by mevalonate. Accordingly, inhibiting the activities of LSD1 and\/or LSD2 can be used to induce apoptosis when desired, for example, in cancer and tumor treatment, when there is a desire to kill all cancer cells so as not to select for resistant cancer cells during typical cancer chemotherapy.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, it is the objective of this disclosure to provide additional cancer therapeutics to the existing repertoire of cancer therapies currently available.","In another embodiment, it is also the objective of this disclosure to provide a new use of cholesterol-lowing drugs, e.g., for cancer treatment.","In another embodiment, it is also the objective of this disclosure to provide a new therapeutic to be used in conjunction with existing repertoire of cancer therapies for the prevention of development of chemotherapy resistance cancer.","In one embodiment, the disclosure herein provides a method for treating cancer in a subject comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an epigenetic modulating adjuvant agent in conjunction with at least one chemotherapy, wherein the epigenetic modulating adjuvant agent promotes chemo-protection and reducing chemo-resistance.

Several biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include but are not limited to cell blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Analysis of apoptosis can be performed by any method known in the art and as described in the Example Section, non-limiting examples include cell free apoptotic assay, DNA fragmentation assay, DNA laddering assay, terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Annexin A5 (or annexin V) detection. The DNA can be labeled with propidium iodide or 7-AAD and analysed by flow cytometry.","As used herein, in one embodiment, the term \u201can inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or and a LSD2\u201d refers to any molecule that inhibits the enzymatic activity of LSD1 and\/or and a LSD2. In one embodiment, the enzymatic activity of LSD1\/2 is the demethylation of mono- and di-methylated lysines, specifically histone 3, lysines 4 and 9 (H3K4 and H3K9). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of LSD1\/2 and an inhibitor of such activity can be assayed by any method known in the art, including the method described in the Example Section. For example, the method described by Y. Tsukada and K. I. Nakayama, Cold Spring Harb.

Non-limiting examples include fluvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, mevastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin.","A \u201ccancer\u201d in a subject refers to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer-causing cells, such as uncontrolled proliferation, immortality, metastatic potential, rapid growth and proliferation rate, and certain characteristic morphological features. Often, cancer cells will be in the form of a tumor, but such cells may exist alone within a subject, or may be a non-tumorigenic cancer cell, such as a leukemia cell. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to breast cancer, a melanoma, adrenal gland cancer, biliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, brain or central nervous system cancer, bronchus cancer, blastoma, carcinoma, a chondrosarcoma, cancer of the oral cavity or pharynx, cervical cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, glioblastoma, hepatic carcinoma, hepatoma, kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreas cancer, peripheral nervous system cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, salivary gland cancer, small bowel or appendix cancer, small-cell lung cancer, squamous cell cancer, stomach cancer, testis cancer, thyroid cancer, urinary bladder cancer, uterine or endometrial cancer, and vulval cancer.","As used herein, the term \u201ctumor\u201d means a mass of transformed cells that are characterized by neoplastic uncontrolled cell multiplication and at least in part, by containing angiogenic vasculature. The abnormal neoplastic cell growth is rapid and continues even after the stimuli that initiated the new growth has ceased. The term \u201ctumor\u201d is used broadly to include the tumor parenchymal cells as well as the supporting stroma, including the angiogenic blood vessels that infiltrate the tumor parenchymal cell mass. Although a tumor generally is a malignant tumor, i.e., a cancer having the ability to metastasize (i.e. a metastatic tumor), a tumor also can be nonmalignant (i.e. non-metastatic tumor). Tumors are hallmarks of cancer, a neoplastic disease the natural course of which is fatal. Cancer cells exhibit the properties of invasion and metastasis and are highly anaplastic.","As used herein, the term \u201ccancer therapy\u201d refers to a therapy useful in treating cancer. Examples of anti-cancer therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, e.g., surgery, chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, agents used in radiation therapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, apoptotic agents, anti-tubulin agents, and other agents to treat cancer, such as anti-HER-2 antibodies (e.g., HERCEPTIN\u00ae), anti-CD20 antibodies, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), HER1\/EGFR inhibitor (e.g., erlotinib (TARCEVA\u00ae)), platelet derived growth factor inhibitors (e.g., GLEEVEC\u2122 (Imatinib Mesylate)), a COX-2 inhibitor (e.g., celecoxib), interferons, cytokines, antagonists (e.g., neutralizing antibodies) that bind to one or more of the following targets ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, PDGFR-beta, BlyS, APRIL, BCMA or VEGF receptor(s), TRAIL\/Apo2, and other bioactive and organic chemical agents, etc. Combinations thereof are also contemplated for use with the methods described herein.","In one embodiment, \u201cadministration\u201d and \u201ctreatment,\u201d as it applies to a subject, refers to the contact of an exogenous pharmaceutical, therapeutic, or composition to the subject. In another embodiment, \u201cadministration\u201d and \u201ctreatment,\u201d as it applies to a subject, refers to the contact of an inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or and a LSD2, or a statin to the subject.","In one embodiment, as used herein, the term \u201ctreat\u2019 or treatment\u201d refers to reducing or alleviating at least one adverse clinical symptom associated with cancer, e.g., pain, swelling, low blood count etc. In another embodiment, the term \u201ctreat\u2019 or treatment\u201d refers to slowing or reversing the progression neoplastic uncontrolled cell multiplication, i.e. shrinking existing tumors and\/or halting tumor growth. In another embodiment, the term \u201ctreat\u2019 or treatment\u201d refers to inducing apoptosis in cancer or tumor cells in the subject.","As used herein, the term \u201ca therapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount sufficient to achieve the intended purpose of treating cancer. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or and a LSD2, or a statin or a composition described herein for a method of treating cancer is an amount of sufficient to induce apoptosis of cancer cells of the subject as compared to in the absent of the inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or and a LSD2, or a statin or a composition respectively. In other embodiments, the amount that is safe and sufficient to treat, delay the development of a tumor, and\/or delay further growth of the tumor. In some embodiments, the amount can thus cure or result in amelioration of the symptoms of cancer and tumor growth, slow the course of cancer progression, slow or inhibit a symptom of cancer, slow or inhibit the establishment of secondary symptoms of cancer or inhibit the development of a secondary symptom of the cancer. For example, an effective amount of an inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or and a LSD2, or a statin or a composition described herein can inhibits tumor further growth, cause a reduction in size or even completely halt tumor growth, shrink the sizes of tumor, even complete regression of tumor, and reduce clinical symptoms associated with tumor. An effective amount for treating cancer is an amount of an inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or and a LSD2, or a statin or a composition described herein sufficient to result in a reduction or complete removal of the symptoms of the disorder, disease, or medical condition. An effective amount for treating or ameliorating a disorder, disease, or medical condition is an amount sufficient to result in a reduction or complete removal of the symptoms of the disorder, disease, or medical condition. The effective amount of a given therapeutic agent will vary with factors such as the nature of the agent, the route of administration, the size and species of the animal to receive the therapeutic agent, and the purpose of the administration. Thus, it is not possible or prudent to specify an exact \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d. However, for any given case, an appropriate \u201ceffective amount\u201d can be determined by a skilled artisan according to established methods in the art using only routine experimentation.","Unless otherwise explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.

A growing body of evidence suggests emerging therapeutic roles for statins in cancer [9-13], [14]. It is clear that statins have pleiotropic activities that may influence a number of cellular processes. For example, studies have indicated that by limiting the biosynthesis of mevalonate, statins can inhibit the production of downstream lipid isoprenoid intermediates, such as farnesyl PPi and geranylgeranyl PPi, important substrate precursors of post-translational prenylation for a number of proteins, including Ras, Rho, and Rac small G proteins [15], [16], [17]. As a result, the inhibition of prenylation of these proteins may affect G protein-mediated signaling pathways, which likely in turn regulate inflammatory responsiveness [10]. However, the underlying mechanism(s) for the pleiotropic effects of statins is still largely elusive. This is in part due to difficulties in ascribing all cellular effects to statin-mediated inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and the reduction of downstream isoprenoid intermediates. Some hypotheses regarding the anti-tumor effect of statins have been raised, including that tumor cells may have lipid abnormalities and pro-inflammatory phenotypes [18], [19], [20], [21]. Thus, identifying novel cellular targets (\u201coff-targets\u201d) of statins is critical in further understanding their role in cancer biology and broadening their future clinical applications.","At the same time, there are conflicting data suggesting that statins increased one's risk of developing cancer. Studies have found that use of any statin drug, in any amount, was associated with a significantly increased risk for prostate cancer. In addition, there was an increasing risk that came along with an increasing cumulative dose.","The dynamics of chromatin structure and the modifications of histones, which are coordinated by protein complexes containing multiple enzymatic activities, are fundamental epigenetic events underlying eukaryotic gene regulation. Among the post-translational modifications, methylation of histone proteins was long been considered to be an irreversible modification until recently in 2004 lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), the first and founding member of histone lysine demethylase family were discovered [22].","The first was histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1\/KDM1) which is an flavin-dependent monoamine oxidase which can demethylate mono- and di-methylated lysines, specifically histone 3, lysines 4 and 9 (H3K4 and H3K9). This enzyme cannot demethylate tri-methylated lysines and for a short while it was thought that tri-methylated lysines may indeed be permanent modifications.","In late 2005 the Jumonji domain-containing (JmjC) histone demethylases were discovered which are able to demethylate mono-, di-, or tri-methylated lysines thereby disproving the theory that histone methylation is permanent once and for all. Although this conclusion has since come into question. Two specific JmjC histone demethylases are PHF8 and JHDM1D.","Currently, nearly 30 human lysine demethylases have been identified, and the number is growing. The lysine-specific demethylases (LSDs), LSD1 and LSD2, are homologous to monoamine oxidases and demethylate mono- and dimethyl-lysine residues, respectively [23], [24]. Consistent with the known dual functionality of LSD1 on both gene repression and activation, recent studies have shown that LSD1 plays crucial and versatile roles in controlling chromatin organization, gene regulation, hormone signaling, stem cell differentiation, and embryonic development [25-38]. Recent data have shown that LSD1 plays an important role in carcinogenesis. For example, tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb are regulated by LSD1 ([39]; [40]; LSD1 is required for maintenance of global DNA methylation by regulating DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 ([41]; and overexpression of LSD1 is observed in various types of cancers, including neuroblastoma, prostate, breast and bladder cancers in which they repress transcription of repair pathways [39] and [42]. Additionally, LSD2 is a candidate cancer-related gene located at chromosome 6p22, a genomic region with a high incidence of chromosomal translocations, deletions, or amplifications in multiple cancer types [43]; [44]. Thus, LSD1\/2 are important new targets for the development of specific inhibitors as a new class of anti-tumor drugs.","To date, few existing compounds have been shown to act as LSD1\/2 inhibitors. LSD1-catalyzed histone demethylation occurs through a FAD coenzyme-mediated two-step electron transfer oxidation mechanism [22, 30]. This mechanism is very similar to that involved in amine oxidation by mono or polyamine oxidases [45-47]. Recently, classical monoamine oxidase inhibitors, (MAOI) pygrine (phenelzine) and tranylcypromine, were reported to inhibit LSD1 activity [26, 28, 48-49]. Two recent studies demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 and LSD2 combined with HDAC inhibitors induces apoptotic tumor cell death synergistically in glioblastoma [50] and breast cancer [51]. Thereafter, a few compounds such as tranylcypromine derivatives and analogues have been synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of LSD1 [52]; [53] urea) and LSD2 [54].","The analysis of whether cancer cells from a subject are susceptible to apoptosis induced by an inhibitor of LSD1 and\/or LSD2, or a statin can be performed by any method known in the art or as described in the Example Section.

Large clinical trials have demonstrated that statins have lipid-independent pleiotropic effects, including chemo-preventive effects and adjuvant chemotherapeutic effects in cancer treatment. However, the mechanism(s) of such anti-tumor activity are largely unknown. Recent data have shown histone demethylases LSD1 and LSD2 to play important roles in cancer by affecting gene regulation through chromatin remodeling. Disclosed here for the first time is the discovery that statins inhibit LSD1 and LSD2 in vitro and in vivo, providing a novel epigenetic mechanism relevant to anti-tumor activity. Inhibition of histone demethylase activity by statins in cells results in direct epigenetic profile changes of LSD1\/2-associated genes, and consequent alteration of expression of LSDs target genes. These data indicate that histone demethylases are previously unrecognized cellular targets of statins, and inhibition of LSD1\/2 activity may be an underlying mechanism whereby statins act on the gene expression programs. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the lipid-independent pleiotropic effects of statins and may directly link the action of statins to the epigenetic regulation of functional cancer genome.","Materials and Methods","Peptides, Histones, Antibodies, and Reagents\u2014Synthetic histone peptides with specific modifications as well as antibodies (Ab) that recognize different histone modifications were purchased from Upstate Group, Inc (Lake Placid, N.Y.)

Briefly, after treatment with 1% formaldehyde, cells were harvested and sonicated in the ChIP lysis buffer to produce soluble chromatin with average sizes between 300-1000 bp.

Coordinates of human lysine specific demethylase (Yong Chen et al, PDB code 2HKO) were first truncated to remove the tower and the SWIRM domain and subsequently prepared for docking using the protein preparation wizard. During the preparation step all water molecules were removed, hydrogen atoms were added and the structure was minimized to an RMSD of 0.3 \u212b2. The prepped coordinates together with partial charges were used to calculate a cubic grid box, which extended from the active site pocket allowing ligands up to 20 \u212b in length to be fitted. The full docking set consisted of five statins as well as one thousand compounds from a decoy set. The statin molecules in hydroxy-acid form were prepared and minimized in Ligprep with OPLS-2005 forcefield and subsequently combined with the 1K Drug-Like Ligand Decoys Set (Schr\u00f6dinger LLC).

Demethylation of a dimethyl-K4 histone H3 (H3K4Me2) by LSD1 generates unmodified histone H3 with the net loss of 28 Da, equal to the molecular weight of two CH2. It was previously reported that this loss can be readily detected by mass spectrometry, using synthetic H3K4Me2 peptide as substrate [22]. Based on this MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based demethylase assay, an LSD1 inhibitor screening scheme was developed to test a number of statins for LSD1 inhibitor activity (). Statins were first analyzed whether they could directly inhibit LSD1 H3K4Me2 demethylase activity. As expected, the mock-treated diMeK4H3 peptide (Me2) peaked at a molecular mass of 2864 Da (Me2). Incubation of the same peptide with recombinant LSD1 (rLSD1) enzyme decreased the 2864 Da peak and resulted in the generation of two new peaks, 2850 Da (Me1) and 2836 Da peaks (Me0), corresponding to the two expected demethylation products monoMeK4H3 (Me1) and unmodified histone H3 peptide (Me0), respectively. Addition of 1 mM of fluvastatin (F, FIG. B), lovastatin (L, FIG. B), simvastatin (S, FIG. B), or mevastatin (M, FIG. B) reduced the LSD1-mediated conversion of substrate diMeK4H3 to monoMeK4H3 and unmodified histone H3 (FIG. B-). Tranylcypromine (T, FIG. B), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that was recently shown to inhibit LSD1 activity, inhibited LSD1 activity under the same assay conditions (20, 37-39), thus serving as a positive control for the assay. The extent of inhibition was dependent on the specific statin tested. For example, fluvastatin completely inhibited rLSD1 activity, while the same concentration of mevastatin had less effect. Pravastatin (P, FIG. B) showed no effect on the rLSD1 enzymatic activity. The effectiveness of these statins in inhibiting rLSD1 activity under these experimental conditions was in the order of F>L>S>M>P. Collectively, the results indicate that certain, but not all, statins inhibit histone demethylase LSD1 activity.","Kinetic study of the inhibition of LSD1 by fluvastatin. It was next demonstrated that the inhibition of recombinant LSD1 by statins is dose dependent using the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based assay (). Increasing the concentration of fluvastatin from 0 to 1000 \u03bcM resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of LSD1 activity, as manifested by the decrease in the demethylation products H3K4Me0 and H3K4Me1 and a corresponding increase in the H3K4Me2 substrate (FIG. A-). Similar to fluvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin also inhibited LSD1 activity, although they required higher concentrations to achieve complete inhibition (data not shown).","Further characterization of LSD1 inhibition by statins was performed using fluvastatin, one of the most potent LSD1 inhibitors was tested, using an optimized formaldehyde dehydrogenase FDH-coupled demethylation assay. This is a sensitive and reliable assay that measures the formaldehyde product generated from the LSD1 demethylation reaction (). As demonstrated previously, the assay detects concentrations of formaldehyde ranging from 0.01 nmole up to 5 nmole in a 100 \u03bcl reaction volume by simply measuring O.D. at 340 nm to reflect the amount of NAD\/NADH conversion (16). Importantly, there was a linear correlation between the formaldehyde concentration and NAD\/NADH conversion in the presence of fluvastatin, indicating that these agents () do not interfere with the FDH-demethylase activity assay. As shown in , in the absence of fluvastatin (F0), the addition of rLSD1 enzyme to the FDH-coupled demethylase assay reaction generates an almost linear increase of OD340 value over a period of four minutes. The linearity of the data indicate the steady state of the reaction, and thus, the slope that represents the rate of formaldehyde production can be calculated and converted to the rLSD1 activity (). As the concentration of fluvastatin increased, the slopes of the corresponding reaction curves decreased (), reflecting diminished rLSD1 demethylase activity. While low concentrations of fluvastatin (1-10 \u03bcM) had little effect on rLSD1 demethylase activity, a dramatic decrease in activity was seen at 30 \u03bcM with almost complete inhibition at 100 M (). No product was detected over the period of time monitor in this experiment where the substrate, LSD1 enzyme, or FAD was omitted. In , a dose-response curve was plotted. The ECof fluvastatin in this particular experiment condition is about 25 \u03bcM. Thus, with both MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis and FDH coupled demethylase analysis, fluvastatin was shown to be a LSD1 inhibitor in vitro.","Statins inhibit LSD1 activity on histones and nucleosomes. To ascertain whether statins inhibit LSD1 activity on more relevant substrates, such as core histones and native substrate nucleosomes, another LSD1 demethylase assay using an antibody that specifically recognizes H3K4Me2 on bulk histones and nucleosomes was performed. Consistent with the peptide\/MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay results, fluvastatin inhibited LSD1 demethylase activity on bulk histones in a dose dependent manner (, lane 3-5).","It was next demonstrated that statins inhibit native LSD1 activity on its physiological substrate nucleosome, using the purified TAP-CtBP complex as enzyme source, which contains active endogenous LSD1 and its cofactor CoREST (27, 40-42). As shown in , The CtBP complex was purified from HeLa cells and shown to efficiently demethylate H3K4Me2 on nucleosomes (lane 2) (17, 19). Fluvastatin had a dramatic inhibitory effect on the LSD1 activity when nucleosomes were used as substrate (, lane 4-6). This inhibition was seen at low concentrations with an ICof 0.30 M (, lane 4), and was almost complete at a concentration of 3 uM (lane 6), indicating fluvastatin is even more potent towards the native enzyme. Importantly, the ICof native LSD1 falls into the range of fluvastatin serum concentrations in patients taking this medication (43).","Effect of statins on the expression of LSD1-regulated target genes in vivo. Since LSD1 reduces the extent of H3K4Me2, it was reasoned that inhibition of LSD1 by statins would lead to increased levels of H3K4 dimethylation on the well-characterized LSD1 target gene promoters, SCN2A and synapasin1.1. Thus, to assay for LSD1 activity in vivo, the change of H3K4Me2 state of the LSD1 target promoters after fluvastatin treatment were measured using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. It was show that treatment of HeLa cells with 5 M fluvastatin caused a 30% increase in H3K4Me2 levels on the SCN2A promoter and a 90% increase in H3K4Me2 levels on the synapasin1.1 gene promoter as compared to vehicle alone (, columns 2). Similar increases in H3K4Me2 levels of SCN2A and syn1-1 were observed when LSD1 activity was reduced through the use of LSD1 siRNA (16). Importantly, in the presence of fluvastatin, the levels of LSD1 enzyme bound to the SCN2A and synapasin1.1 promoters did not change, indicating that the increased level of H3K4 dimethylation was due to the inhibition of LSD1 H3K4Me2 demethylase activity and not to changes in association of LSD1 protein with the promoters (, columns 3). These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that statins inhibit LSD1 activity in vivo.","Because LSD1 is a co-repressor silencing transcription of SCN2A and syn1.1, and these transcriptional effects are largely dependent on LSD1's H3K4Me2 demethylase activity, it was hypothesized that statins would increase expression of LSD1-responsive genes. As shown in FIG. B, treatment with fluvastatin (square), lovastatin (circle), and simvastatin (diamond) resulted in significant increases in mRNA levels of SCN2A and syn1.1. The effectiveness of statins in increasing gene expression was in the order of fluvastatin>lovastatin>simvastatin, corresponding to the same order of their inhibitory effect on LSD1 activity in vitro. Pravastatin did not show an effect of on gene expression (), consistent with our finding that pravastatin did not inhibit LSD1 demethylase activity in vitro.","These data strongly indicate that statins inhibit LSD1 repression of gene expression by reducing LSD1 enzymatic activity. If so, increasing the levels of LSD1 protein should saturate the specific statins and overcome their effect on LSD1 target genes. To test this hypothesis, we established a stable HeLa cell line that over-expresses Flag-tagged full-length LSD1 (FgLSD1) at levels roughly 100-fold of that of mock transfected control cells. Transcript levels of the LSD1 target genes, a prototype target syn1.1 and a recently identified target IL-6 (32), were assessed in mock and FgLSD1 over-expressing cells treated with or without fluvastatin, lovastatin or pravastatin. As demonstrated above, fluvastatin and lovastatin caused similar increases in syn1.1 expression in mock control cells, while these effects were markedly blunted in the FgLSD1 cells overexpressing LSD1 (). Again, pravastatin did not affect expression of the LSD1 target genes in either control or LSD1-overexpressed cells. Thus, overexpressing LSD1 overcomes the ability of statins to regulate expression of LSD1 target genes, lending further support to the hypothesis that LSD1 is a specific cellular target of a subtype of statins.","Statins inhibit the demethylase activity of LSD2 toward specific histone mark. By using multiple independent approaches as stated above to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of statins on LSD1, employed similar approach was also to study the statin effect on LSD2 enzymatic activity at biochemical, cellular, and molecular biological levels. As it has been previously reported that the enzymatic activity of LSD2 can be readily detected by Mass Spectrometry, using synthetic H3K4Me2 peptide as substrate [24]. In contrast to LSD1, recombinant LSD2 enzyme can decrease the 2864 Da peak and result in the generation of only one new peak, 2850 Da (Me1) as the expected demethylation products monoMeK4H3 (Me1). No unmodified histone H3 peptide (Me0) was detected (). The data indicated that all the statins except pravastatin have better inhibitory effects than tranylcypromine, which has been reported as an LSD1 inhibitor with LSD2 inhibition function (). Moreover, increasing the concentration of fluvastatin from 0 to 1000 M) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of LSD2 activity, as manifested by the decrease in the demethylation products H3K4Me1 and a corresponding increase in the H3K4Me2 substrate (). LSD2 demethylase assay was also performed using an antibody that specifically recognizes H3K4Me2 on bulk histones. Consistent with the peptide\/MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay results, fluvastatin inhibited LSD2 demethylase activity on bulk histones in a dose-dependent manner (). These data demonstrate that a subset of statins act as inhibitors of the histone demethylase LSD2 in vitro and in vivo, indicating that histone demethylase LSD2 is also a novel cellular target of statins.","Overexpression LSD1 and LSD2 rescue statin-induced cell death in human cancer cells independent of mevalonate biosynthesis pathway. The anti-proliferative effect of statins in Hela cells in vitro was next tested that by treating them with various doses of fluvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin for 24 hours. Fluvastatin and lovastatin induced cell death at concentrations of 2.5-5 \u03bcM. There was no significant cell death with pravastatin treatment at concentrations less than 10 \u03bcM (). Furthermore, by flow cytometry, fluvastatin and lovastatin induced a large subG1 population in POZ cells stably expressed with control vector and the mutant LSD1. In comparison, cells overexpressing LSD1 and CTBP, a cellular repressor complex that contains LSD1, showed a markedly decrease of subG1 population (). LSD1 POZ had two hundred-fold higher expression of LSD1 comparing with the control MOCK and mutant LSD1 POZ cells (data not shown). Consistent with literature, treatment with pravastatin had a smaller effect compared to that of fluvastatin and lovastatin.","A subset of statin molecules fit into the catalytic domain of the LSD1 and inhibit its catalytic activity. To gain insight into the extent to which statin molecules could fit into the catalytic domain of LSD1 and inhibit its catalytic activity, we next explored the relationship between LSD1 protein and statins at the level of atomic structure using a systematic computational docking program, Maestro\/Glide\/Ligprep (Schr\u00f6dinger's computational technology, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC) (). The full docking set, which consisted of the five representative statins used in this study and over one thousand randomly chosen chemical compounds from a decoy set, was used for a no-bias best-fit evaluation. Consistent with our findings, the highest scoring statin was fluvastatin (score of \u221210.17), ranking number 18 among the full docking set. Importantly, in the simulated co-structure of LSD1\/fluvastatin complex, the fluorophenyl group of fluvastatin packs tightly against the FAD portion of the LSD1 demethylase catalytic cavity (), with the fluorine atom (, letter F in insert A\u2032 and green on fluorophenyl group) pointing towards the positively-charged patch created by Lys 661. We also superimposed the fluvastatin molecule into the catalytic cavity of the LSD1 demethylase in the presence of the putative substrate (). This model indicates that by physically occupying the catalytic pocket, statins can prevent the docking and positioning of methylated substrates in the catalytic cavity, thus inhibiting substrate catalysis, and the fluorophenyl group of fluvastatin may be important for its inhibitory effect on LSD1. Taken together, this computer docking and modeling analysis provides a structural rationale for the inhibition of LSD1 by statins.","There is growing awareness from recent clinical data that statins may have anti-tumor effects in various types of cancer. In melanoma, the Air Force\/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS\/TexCAPS) evaluation of the efficacy of lovastatin in preventing coronary events found a significant decreased incidence of new melanomas in the lovastatin group [56]. In addition, the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial [VA-HIT]demonstrated a significant reduction in melanoma with gemfibrozil treatment [57]. A number of translational studies that have investigated the effects of statins on melanoma cells showed them to induce apoptosis, reduce tumor growth, and diminish angiogenesis, [58], [59]. Moreover, statins have been shown to heighten the response to chemotherapy drugs in the B16 mouse model of melanoma [60]. Lung cancer incidence rates in statin users were found to be significantly reduced (55% risk reduction) in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System case control study [12]. Overall, statin use also has been reported was associated with a risk reduction of human cancers of 20% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.96) [61]. However, other studies have shown no anti-cancer benefit for statins. A meta-analysis study including 6662 incident cancers and 2407 cancer deaths showed that statins did not reduce the incidence of cancer (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.97-1.07) or cancer deaths (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93-1.09), and there was no reduction in any individual cancer type [62]. Two studies reported that there were no benefits with statin treatment in breast cancer [63-64], although other clinical and translational\/basic research data support beneficial effects in breast cancer [14], [65]. These conflicting reports underscore the need to better understand the effects of statins in cancer biology.","The current findings indicate an epigenetic mechanism for anti-tumor effects of statins involving inhibition of histone demethylases, which could provide new insights to the conflicting data from clinical trials. First, it is well established that the distribution of histone demethylase expression is tissue-specific, and different cancers have different profiles of histone demethylase expression. From the AFCAPS data, melanoma was the only type of cancer with significant beneficial effect (p<0.004), while all the other types of cancer in that study derived no benefits from the same statin regimen [66]. LSD2 expression was significantly higher in human breast cancer cells (data not shown) MDA231 comparing to MCF7 cell lines (data not shown) and human melanoma cell line WM793 comparing to WM1205 (data not shown). Moreover, LSD2 can be detected in a subset of tumor cells in melanoma by IHC. IHC staining with anti-LSD2 antibody in melanoma tissue sections showed strong positivity in a subset of tumor cells (data not shown). The data in the present study demonstrate breast cancer and melanoma cell lines have different expression levels of LSD2. In addition, to achieve the same efficacy of statin treatment, different cancer cells require different dosages of statins in vitro (). Thus, clinical trials with the same dose of statins should have different efficacies with respect to variations in cancer types with different levels of histone demethylase expressions levels and growth characteristics. Also potentially relevant is the recent proposal that cancer stem cells arise through epigenetic changes [67]. Emerging data have shown cancer stem cells have high expression levels of histone demethylases in various cancers, including lysine demethylase 5 KDM5\/JARID1 in melanoma [68], [69], GASC1 histone demethylase as a driving oncogene in the 9p23-24 amplicon in human breast cancer [70], KDM2b\/JHDM1b in acute myeloid leukemia [71], and KDM6b in Hodgkin's lymphoma [72]. Also, it has been reported that LSD1 overexpression contributes to human carcinogeneses through chromatin regulation in various cancers [42, 73-74] and regulates microenvironment niches for stem cells [75]. Accordingly, different tumors at different stages with different percentages of cancer stem cell populations with different histone demethylase expression profiles will affect efficacy of statin and other chemo-therapy. Moreover, use of LSD1 inhibitors combined with HDAC inhibitors synergistically enhances apoptotic cell death in breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme cells [50-51]. These reports make histone demethylases attractive therapeutic targets in cancer. The current data are consistent with reports in the literature that statins can induce tumor cell apoptosis in HeLa cells and breast cancer and melanoma cells in culture ().","To exclude the possibility that the changes in H3K4Me2 dimethylation and expression of LSD target genes was due to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins, the cultured cancer cells and HeLa cells were supplied with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase catalyzed reaction, to allow the cells to by-pass the requirement for HMG-CoA reductase activity. The addition of mevalonate did not rescue the cell death of cancer cells in breast cancer and melanoma; moreover, mevalonate did not reverse the derepression of the LSD1 target genes by statins (). The data here indicate that the genomic pathway of statins involving histone demethylases as cellular targets plays a critical role in the anti-tumor effect of statins by targeting at cancer stem cells and tumor cells resistant to chemotherapy, while non-genomic HMG-CoA reductase pathway of statins play more important role in lipid-lowing effect of statins.","Different statins have different effects on inhibiting LSD1\/2, and only a subset of statins can inhibit histone demethylases. The data here show that pravastatin cannot inhibit LSD1 and LSD2 by multiple independent experiments in vitro, including mass spec and demethylation assays ( and ). Furthermore, pravastatin did not induce apoptosis in cultured HeLa cells in vivo (). This may provide insight to the results of the two clinical trials showing statins have no benefits in breast cancer patients, since both trials used pravastatin. Thus, the current study of identifying histone demethylase as cellular targets of statins provided insight on the understanding of anti-cancer effect of statins It provides new information to the future better design of clinical trial and potential clinical application of statins in cancer treatment. Moreover, statins as novel LSD inhibitors can be clinically used as adjuvant therapeutic agents to cancer treatment given the few side effects and low cost.","Using multiple independent approaches, it was shown that a subset of statins act as inhibitors of the histone demethylases LSD1 and LSD2, indicating that histone demethylases are cellular targets of statins. Importantly, inactivation of LSD1 by a subset of statins at a cellular level not only results in histone code changes in the LSD1 target genes but also consequently reprograms the expression of the target genes: statins are capable of de-repressing a subsets of neuronal specific genes, such as SCN2A and synapsin 1.1, and pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-6 genes in non-neuronal HeLa cells. Thus, in addition to the well-established lipid-related pathways (non-genomic), the findings here indicate a new pathway (genomic), in which statins inhibit a key enzyme in the epigenetic gene regulation of many important biological functions and pathological processes ().","The miniCoopR assay was performed as previously described (Ceol et al., 2011). Briefly, transgenes were expressed in zebrafish melanocytes in the background of a stably-integrated BRAFV600E transgene and a p53 loss-of-function mutation. The background also contained a mitfa loss-offunction mutation, which blocked melanocyte development. Transgenes were coupled, via the miniCoopR vector, to a rescuing mitfa gene, ensuring that rescued melanocytes also expressed the transgene being tested. Then different type of statins with different doses will be administered to the melanoma forming zebrafish. Then drug effects will be monitored and scored by melanomas formations in zebrasfish. When the animals are sacrificed, tumors will be formalin fixed, embedded and sectioned transversely to be assessed.","The references and patent applications cited herein and throughout the specification are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
