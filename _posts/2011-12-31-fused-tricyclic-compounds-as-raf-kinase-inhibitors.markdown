{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. national stage application of International Application No. PCT\/CN2011\/085146, which was filed on Dec. 31, 2011 with the title \u201cFUSED TRICYCLIC COMPOUNDS AS RAF KINASE INHIBITORS\u201d.","Disclosed herein are fused tricyclic compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one such fused tricyclic compound, processes for the preparation thereof, and the use thereof in therapy. Disclosed herein are certain tricyclic compounds that can be useful for inhibiting Raf kinase and for treating disorders mediated thereby.","The Raf\/MEK\/ERK pathway is of interest for cell survival, growth, proliferation and tumorigenesis (Zebisch et al., Curr Med. Chem. 14(5): 601-623, 2007; Roberts and Der, Oncogene 26 (22): 3291-3310, 2007; Montagut and Settleman, Cancer Lett. 283(2): 125-134, 2009). Stimulation of the Raf\/MEK\/ERK signal transduction pathway may occur after binding of a lig and to the membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase. GTP-bound RAS can be activated, which can subsequently promote the activation of the Raf family proteins (A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf1, formerly known as C-Raf) (Wellbrock et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 5: 875-885, 2004). Mutations in various RAS GTPases and B-Rafkinase in the Raf\/MEK\/ERK signal pathway have been reported to constitutively activate the MAPK pathway, resulting in increased cell division and survival (Bos, Cancer Res. 49: 4682-4689, 1989; Hoshino et al., Oncogene. 18(3): 813-822, 1999). For example, B-Raf mutations are reportedly found in a large percentage of human melanomas and thyroid cancers (Davies et al., Nature 417: 949-954, 2002) (Cohen et al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 95(8): 625-627, 2003; Kimura et al., Cancer Res. 63(7): 1454-1457, 2003; Pollock and Meltzer, Cancer Cell 2: 5-7, 2002). In addition, lower, but still significant frequency of B-Raf mutations have been reported in Barret's adenocarcinoma (Garnett et al., Cancer Cell 6:313-319, 2004; Sommerer et al., Oncogene 23(2): 554-558, 2004), breast cancer (Davies et al., Nature 417: 949-954, 2002), cervical cancer (Moreno-Bueno et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 12(12): 365-3866, 2006), cholangiocarcinoma (Tannapfel et al., Gut. 52(5): 706-712, 2003), glioblastoma (Knobbe et al., Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 108(6): 467-470, 2004), colorectal cancer (Yuen et al., Cancer Res. 62(22): 6451-6455, 2002; Davies et al., Nature 417: 949-954, 2002), gastric cancer (Lee et al., Oncogene 22(44): 6942-6945), lung cancer (Brose et al., Cancer Res. 62(23): 6997-7000, 2002), ovarian cancer (Russell and McCluggage, J. Pathol. 203(2): 617-619, 2004; Davies et al., Nature 417: 949-954, 2002), pancreatic cancer (Ishimura et al., Cancer Lett. 199(2): 169-173, 2003), prostate cancer (Cho et al., Int. J. Cancer. 119(8): 1858-1862, 2006), and hematologic cancers (Garnett and Marais, Cancer Cell 6: 313-319, 2004). These reports suggest that B-Raf is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. B-Raf kinase can represent an excellent target for anticancer therapy based on preclinical target validation, epidemiology and drugability.","Inhibitors of Rafkinases have been discussed for use in disruption of tumor cell growth and hence in the treatment of cancers, e.g. melanoma, colorectal cancer including large intestinal colon carcinoma, histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic and breast carcinoma (Crump, Current Pharmaceutical Design 8: 2243-2248, 2002; Sebastien et al., Current Pharmaceutical Design 8: 2249-2253, 2002), and\/or in the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischemic events, including cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest, stroke and multi-infarct dementia. Inhibitors of Rafkinases have also been discussed for use after cerebral ischemic events such as those resulting from head injury, surgery and\/or during childbirth (York et al., Mol. and Cell. Biol. 20(21): 8069-8083, 2000; Chin et al., Neurochem. 90: 595-608, 2004), as well as in polycystic kidney disease (Nagao et al., Kidney Int. 63(2): 427-437, 2003).","In addition, certain hyperproliferative disorders may be characterized by the over activation of Raf kinase functions, for example, by mutations or over expression of the protein. Accordingly, inhibitors of Raf kinases can be useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, such as cancer.","Small molecule inhibitors of B-Raf kinases are being developed for anticancer therapy. Nexavar\u00ae (sorafenib tosylate) is a multikinase inhibitor, which includes inhibition of B-Raf kinases, and is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Other Raf inhibitors have also been disclosed or have entered clinical trials, for example SB-590885, RAF-265, PLX-4032, GSK2118436 and XL-281.","Other B-Raf inhibitors are also known. See, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006\/0189627, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006\/0281751, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2007\/0049603, International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/002325, International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/002433, International Patent Application Publication WO 03\/068773 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/013896.","Certain nitrogen-containing heteroaryl-substituted aryl bicyclic compounds have been identified as Raf inhibitors. See, for example, International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/067444 and U.S. Patent Application Publication 2010\/0197924.","Certain Rafkinase inhibitors have also been identified.

Where the compounds described herein possess two or more asymmetric centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Enantiomers and diastereomers fall within the broader class of stereoisomers. All such possible stereoisomers as substantially pure resolved enantiomers, racemic mixtures thereof, as well as mixtures of diastereomers are intended to be included. All stereoisomers of the compounds disclosed herein and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are intended to be included. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, reference to one isomer applies to any of the possible isomers. Whenever the isomeric composition is unspecified, all possible isomers are included.","The term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d as used herein means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 35%, such as no more than 30%, further such as no more than 25%, even further such as no more than 20%, by weight of any other stereoisomer(s). In some embodiments, the term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 10%, for example, no more than 5%, such as no more than 1%, by weight of any other stereoiosomer(s).","When compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, unless specified otherwise, such double bonds are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.","Some of the compounds described herein may exist with different points of attachment of hydrogen, referred to as tautomers. For example, compounds including carbonyl \u2014CHC(O)\u2014 groups (keto forms) may undergo tautomerism to form hydroxyl \u2014CH\u2550C(OH)\u2014 groups (enol forms). Both keto and enol forms, individually as well as mixtures thereof, are also intended to be included where applicable.","It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (\u201cSMB\u201d) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., a substantially pure enantiomer, may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., et al. \u201cChromatographic resolution of enantiomers: Selective review.\u201d J.
