{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. provisional application No. 61\/350,083 filed Jun. 1, 2010. The aforementioned provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates generally to so-called compressed URLs or short URLs and, more particularly to systems and methods for embedding message or tracking information within Internet links (Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs) and, in a more limited aspect, to systems and methods that allow encoding and optimization of short URLs that contain one or more tracking identifiers.","The Internet, which started in the late 1960s, is a vast computer network consisting of many smaller networks that spans the entire globe. The Internet has grown exponentially, and millions of worldwide users ranging from individuals to corporations now use permanent and dial-up connections to access the Internet on a daily basis. The computers or networks of computers connected within the Internet, known as \u201chosts,\u201d allow access to databases containing information in nearly every field of expertise and are supported by entities ranging from universities and government to many commercial organizations.","The information on the Internet is made available to the public through \u201cservers.\u201d A server is a computer system running on an Internet host for making available files, documents, or other information contained within that host. An Internet server may distribute information to any computer that requests the files on a host. The computer making such a request is known as the \u201cclient,\u201d which may be an Internet-connected workstation, home personal computer (PC), a software application running on another server, or other types of Internet-connected devices including mobile phones and the like.","The World-Wide Web (Web) is a method of accessing information on the Internet which allows a user to navigate the Internet resources intuitively, without Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other technical knowledge. The Web is made up of hundreds of thousands of interconnected \u201cpages,\u201d or documents, which can be displayed on a computer monitor. The Web pages are provided by hosts running special software called Web servers. Software which runs these Web servers is relatively simple and is available on a wide range of computer platforms including PC's. Equally available is a form of client software, known as a Web \u201cbrowser,\u201d which is used to display Web pages as well as traditional non-Web files on the client system, such as video files or audio files.","Hidden behind certain text, pictures or sounds are connections, known as \u201chyperlinks\u201d or \u201chypertext links\u201d (referred to herein generally as \u201clinks\u201d and, unless specifically stated otherwise, without regard to fine distinctions or nuances in meaning), which point to other pages within the same server or even on other computers within the Internet. For example, links may be visually displayed as words or phrases that may be underlined or displayed in a second color. Each link is directed to a web page by using a special name called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). URLs enable a Web browser to go directly to any file or resource held on any Web server. A user may also specify a known URL by putting it directly into the navigational area of a web browser.","Any document or resource designed to be accessed and over the Web and displayed in a web browser is referred to herein as a web page. Each web page must have an address in a recognized format, i.e., the URL or Uniform Resource Locator, that enables computers all over the world to access it. Each web page has a unique URL. Increasingly, URLs are also being used by other software applications to access data hosted on a particular server. The data returned from these URLs is intended to be accessed and read by other computer programs rather than by web browsers. Resources exposed by a server for the benefit of other software applications are called \u201cWeb services\u201d and are increasingly used to make Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) available to other software applications on the Internet.","The Uniform Resource Locator is a standard way to specify the location of a resource available electronically. A URL specifies all the information necessary to access a given web page or resource. URLs have a very specific syntax and follow a defined format, such as that specified in RFC 1738.","In one aspect, a uniform resource locator (URL) encoding method for embedding message information in a compressed URL includes associating a link identifier with a first URL, the first URL identifying a target web page. A message identifier representative of at least one message parameter is generated and the link identifier and the message identifier are combined using a reversible pairing function to generate a first combined identifier. The first combined identifier is in a first number system base. The first combined identifier is converted to a second combined identifier in a second base number system which is greater than the first base number system. The second URL is then generated using the second combined identifier.","In another aspect, a computer system configured to embed message information in a compressed URL includes a processor and a memory in electronic communication with the processor. Instructions stored in the memory are executable to associate a link identifier with a first URL identifying a target web page; generate a message identifier representative of at least one message parameter; combine the link identifier and the message identifier using a reversible pairing function to generate a first combined identifier in a first base number system; convert the first combined identifier to a second combined identifier in a second base number system greater than the first base number system; and, generate the second URL using the second combined identifier.","In a further aspect, a computer system configured to embed message information in a compressed URL includes means for associating a link identifier with a first URL, the first URL identifying a target web page; means for generating a message identifier representative of at least one message parameter; means for combining the link identifier and the message identifier using a reversible pairing function to generate a first combined identifier, the first combined identifier in a first base number system; means for converting the first combined identifier to a second combined identifier, the second combined identifier in a second base number system which is greater than the first base number system; and, means for generating the second URL using the second combined identifier.","In yet another aspect, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium is provided, comprising executable instructions for associating a link identifier with a first URL, said first URL identifying a target web page; generating a message identifier representative of at least one message parameter; combining said link identifier and said message identifier using a reversible pairing function to generate a first combined identifier, said first combined identifier in a first base number system; converting said first combined identifier to a second combined identifier, said second combined identifier in a second base number system which is greater than the first base number system; and generating the second URL using said second combined identifier.","One advantage of the system and method of the present disclosure is that it requires less storage space than current techniques.","Another advantage of the present system and method resides in its ability to be used for more efficient and effective tracking of recipient-specific and\/or message specific click information for a given long or uncompressed URL that is distributed.","Yet another advantage of the presently disclosed system and method is that it allows for channel distribution information to be available within the unique short URL code.","Still a further advantage of more limited embodiments of the presently disclosed system and method resides in the fact that, it may be used to optimize the number of characters used to be as low as possible by generating and comparing multiple Short URL encoding methods to identify an optimal selection. In such limited embodiments, the present disclosure allows for simultaneously identifying the short URL code as being of the specially encoded format, such that the data representative of the particular encoding method or algorithm employed to generate the Short URL self-contained within the Short URL itself.","Other benefits and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading and understanding of the preferred embodiments.","The systems and methods in accordance with the present disclosure may operate as software that runs on one or more computer information processing systems connected as servers on the Internet. Each physical server consists of a combination of computer hardware and software working together and connected to the Internet via a computer network interface. It will be recognized that the various functional modules, databases, etc., may be implemented on common hardware, such as a single server, or, alternatively, could be implemented on multiple servers linked via a network, such as a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet.","At the hardware level, each system would normally and minimally incorporate a central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), input\/output controllers, hard disk(s), and one or more network communications interface adapters. A typical computer as used in an information processing system is shown in .","Referring to , a computer information processing system  of a type which is operable to embody the present invention is shown.

The computer interface  operates as an input\/output gateway specific to the transportation of data to other computers within the network . The network interface  may interface to any one or more of the Internet, an intranet, a Personal Area Network (PAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a storage area network (SAN), a frame relay connection, an Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) connection, a synchronous optical network (SONET) connection, a digital T1, T3, E1, or E3 line, a Digital Data Service (DDS) connection, a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) connection, an Ethernet connection, an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line, a dial-up port such as a V.90, a V.34 or a V.34bis analog modem connection, a cable modem, an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) connection, a Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) connection, or a Copper Distributed Data Interface (CDDI) connection.

It should be appreciated that modification or reconfiguration of the hardware system of  by one having ordinary skill in the art would not depart from the scope or the spirit of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , which illustrates the software components of a typical computer system capable of hosting the present system, the system in accordance with the present disclosure operates as a component within software that runs on the computer hardware environment of each computer processing system, which may be of the type shown in .","At the software level, each computer system  typically runs an operating system  including drivers for the various hardware components, and one or more applications. Examples of typical operating system software used by such systems would be UNIX, Linux, OS\/X, Microsoft Windows, and similar operating systems, which may be commercially available or custom built.","Application software  would include the web server software that implements Internet\/World Wide Web communication standards and protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or RFC 2068, Javascript Object Notation (JSON) or RFC 4627, and similar established standards. Web server software may include components such as Apache, Internet Information Server, Lightttp, IBM HTTP Server, JRun, and similar servers along with optional add-ons, components, plug-ins, or related modules such as PHP, Perl, Ruby, and the like. The system may host other software applications and components including monitoring applications, database servers such as MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server, administration tools, and other software components that may connect to or run independently of the software components or modules which embody the short URL generation and decoding functions in accordance with this disclosure.","The short URL encoding module  may operate as a functional component within a software application  providing other functionality. The encoding of short URLs in accordance with this teaching may advantageously be employed in connection with message authoring or marketing software , such as JITTERJAM\u00ae software available from JitterGram, Inc., of Bedford, N.H. It will be recognized, however, that the present development could also operate as standalone software application or may be incorporated within application software  used for different purposes.","Referring now to , there appears a typical networked computer environment . Within the networked computer environment  as illustrated in the depicted preferred embodiment, there is shown five main computer systems which are connected to each other via the network  (typically the Internet, although private networks are also contemplated) and which participate in various ways during the execution lifecycle of the present system and method. Those five participants are shown in  and include (1) a Message Authoring Server  which uses the URL encoder\/decoder ; (2) an External Message Delivery System ; (3) one or more Client Computer Systems , PDAs, mobile devices, etc. , cell phones , and so forth; (4) a Redirect Server  which uses the URL encoder\/decoder ; and (5) a Remote Web Site System , which hosts the remote or target web page . It will be recognized, however, that other configurations are possible. For example, the various functionalities or modules of the present system, such as the message authoring server  Short URL encoder (), Short URL decoder (), redirect server , and a database  as shown in  appear as components or functional modules of a computer information handling system  sharing common hardware (such as a server having a hardware configuration as shown generally in ). However, it will be recognized that any one or more components could be remotely located from the other, for example, configured to communicate via the network  and\/or other network connection such as a LAN, WAN, the Internet, an intranet, or other communications interface.","The basic interaction between these systems is more specifically described as follows. The message authoring server  desires to distribute a message containing a link or URL to one or more recipients (e.g., one or more client computer systems , mobile devices or PDAs , cell phones or smart phones , etc.). The URL or link to be included with the message points to the target web page  hosted by the remote web site server . The message authoring server  prepares the message and encodes the URL of the remote web page , as well as other information, as a short URL using the URL encoder\/decoder  in accordance with this disclosure. The message authoring server  then initiates distribution of the message containing the short URL in place of the first URL (e.g., the original long URL) to one or more recipients (e.g., recipients , , and\/or , etc.) using the external message delivery system . The external message delivery system  may be, for example, an email server, an SMS text message or MMS message gateway, a Twitter or Facebook or other social media messaging system, or the like. The external message delivery system  distributes the message and short URL to the recipient's client computer systems () and\/or devices (, ).","Preferably, the short URL is encoded within the message as a hyperlink such that when each recipient reads the message, they have the option to follow the short URL (e.g., by selecting, clicking on, pointing to, touching, etc., the short URL) using their web browser or equivalent to visit the remote web site. In operation, following the short URL does not immediately lead the user's browser to display the remote web site . Instead, the short URL is encoded such that it first directs the user's browser to the redirect server . The redirect server  received the short URL request and utilizes the URL encoder\/decoder  components to decode the embedded information within the Short URL and retrieve information about the URL of the remote web page  from the database . After processing the embedded information contained in the short URL, the redirect server  automatically, and preferably transparently, redirects the user's browser to the appropriate remote web site server  to retrieve the remote web page .","One advantage of the preferred embodiment systems and methods herein is that it allows the tracking of customer click behavior within \u201cshort URLs\u201d distributed over the Internet. The use of short URLs is generally known for the replacement of long URLs that appear within messaging environments that involve limited messages lengths, such as SMS or MMS messages or Twitter messages. Key attributes of short URLs are the need to utilize the minimum possible number of characters within the URL identifying data, such as \u201chttp:\/\/jit.ly\/ABCD.\u201d","It is helpful to understand what is unique about the present development by looking at current techniques used to create short URLs and track short URL click information on the Internet.","A short URL is a special form of Internet URL that utilizes a very small number of characters, making it suitable for use in messaging environments that have limited numbers of text characters, such as Short Message Service (SMS) text messages typical on cell phones, or short messages sent through Twitter and similar services. Increasingly, short URLs are also showing up in higher capacity messaging environments to increase the readability of messages that include URLs. Example services that provide such short URL features include http:\/\/bit.ly, http:\/\/shorturl.com, and http:\/\/tinyurl.com.","In order to work properly, short URL services must track a long URL for each short URL. When a user clicks on the short URL, the short URL service looks up the associated long URL and redirects the user to the longer URL. The user does not know they have been redirected to a longer form of the URL. Typically, the short URL service will also count the number of \u201cclicks\u201d each short URL received, and collect other information.","A typical existing technique for generating a short URL to distribute on the Internet is to assign a long URL a unique ID (such as a numerical ID) and creating a record or association between the long URL and the unique ID within a database. The unique ID may then be encoded using a base numbering system higher than 10. For example, encoding it using the digits A-Z would translate the unique ID from a base 10 number to a base 26 number, thereby reducing the number of digits required to represent the unique ID number. This makes the URL \u201cshort.\u201d Later, when someone clicks on the shortened URL, the high-base number is reconverted to a base 10 number, and the resultant unique ID is used to look up the proper original long URL stored with it, and redirect the user to it.","A primary attribute of existing strategies is they encode each short URL object into one and only one identifier. Meaning, each long URL is associated with a single short URL object or record, and each short URL object is uniquely encoded into one identifier that is distributed over the Internet.","This is represented by the following example:","Consider a long URL: http:\/\/www.example.com\/subpage\/page\/123 ?param=xyz","When this long URL is shortened, a short URL object or record is created of the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Short URL ID","Long URL"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1234 ","http:\/\/www.example.com\/subpage\/page\/123?param=xyz"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"To create the actual short URL to distribute on the Internet, the unique short URL object or record ID value of 1234, which is a base 10 number, may be converted to a higher base number, such as base 26, using a conversion function. A base 26 conversion is possible, for example, by using A-Z as valid characters of a base 26 number format. This would result in a base 26 form of the number being \u201cAUL\u201d where A represents 1*26^2, U represents 21*26^1, and L represents 12*26^0. The sum of these numbers is 1234 in base 10 notation. The number of digits required to represent the short URL object has been reduced from 4 to 3. By increasing the base value beyond 26 (for example by allowing for both capital and small letters, or a base 52 character set), the number of digits can be reduced further.","The present disclosure will describe some exemplary encoding algorithms in greater detail below, which will primarily be described with reference to the presently preferred embodiments employing base 62 conversion, e.g., which allows using a character set consisting of lower case characters a-z, upper case characters A-Z and numerical characters 0-9, that is, a case-sensitive alphanumerical character set. It will be recognized, however, that any base greater than 10 can be employed, including without limitation, base 16 (for example, using standard hexadecimal notation), base 26 (e.g., using a case-insensitive alphabetical character set), base 36 (e.g., using a case-insensitive alphanumerical character set), base 52 (e.g., using a case-sensitive alphabetical character set), and so forth.","Currently, in practice, for each long URL that one might wish to distribute, a new short URL is created, encoded to be as small as possible, and distributed over the Internet. For each long URL, there is one short URL object, and one associated shortened URL identifier created and distributed. Using the existing methods, if one desires to distribute short URLs to multiple recipients, and track each of them independently (for example, to know exactly which recipients clicked on the URL), multiple short URL objects and records must be created, shortened, and distributed. In practice this can be very inefficient when the same long URL is going to be distributed to a known group of recipients, inasmuch as separate short URL objects and identifiers must be created for each recipient, creating potentially thousands or even tens of thousands of short URL records or objects containing the same long URL.","In order to overcome the limitations of existing approaches and methods, the present inventors have developed unique and novel implementations to allow the distribution of short URL links to a virtually unlimited number of recipients while only requiring the creation and storage of a single short URL object or record. An explanation of the presently preferred techniques or methods now follows.","The approach in accordance with this disclosure may utilize one or more encoding methods to build short URLs containing multiple unique identifiers, which may include, for example, a link identifier and one or more additional identifiers. The present disclosure describes three separate embodiments; however, other embodiments are contemplated as well. Briefly, in certain embodiments, the short URL may be encoded by either the first or second embodiment described below. The third embodiment, discussed below, generates short URLs by both the first and second embodiments, compares the result encoded URLs and selects the shortest to arrive at an optimal result. All three embodiments build a unique encoded short URL for every message recipient while requiring the storage of only a single underlying short URL object or record. The use of additional or alternative encoding methods is also contemplated.","The resulting short URL produced by all of the methods in accordance with this disclosure contains all of the unique identifier information in an encoded form, along with a method identifier that specifies the appropriate method to use to decode the short URL and obtain back the original identifiers, including the link ID. Each of the embodiments is now described separately.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a first embodiment Short URL encoding method, wherein the message parameter information to be encoded includes both message recipient information and message transmission channel information. It will be recognized that in alternative embodiments the message parameter to be embedded could be one or the other of message recipient information and message transmission channel information. In other embodiments, one or more additional message parameters which is desired to be tracked could be embedded in place of or in addition to the recipient and channel information.","Still referring to , for each long URL, a unique Link ID  is assigned and associated with the long URL in the database  (see ). Likewise, each recipient (e.g., each recipient in an e-mail list, listsery or other electronic or online content subscribers, and so forth) is assigned a unique Recipient ID . A Channel ID  is assigned to each message channel or medium. Preferably, the Channel ID is a single digit to minimize the length of the resulting Short URL, although it is contemplated that a multiple digit Channel ID could be used, e.g., where the number of channels for distributing messages containing the encoded Short URL will exceed 10. Preferably, the Link ID, Recipient ID, and Channel ID all base 10 integers.","The Channel ID  and the Recipient ID  are combined by the encoder\/decoder module to produce a new value (CCID) . In the simplest embodiment, wherein the recipient ID and channel ID is always known, or, in the case that either or both of the parameters are unknown, some predetermined value for each may be utilized as being representative of \u201cunknown recipient\u201d or \u201cunknown channel\u201d such that the CCID  may be generated by merely appending the channel ID  to the recipient ID  a prespecified location. In the depicted embodiment, the recipient ID  appears on the left and the channel ID  appears on the right, although in alternative embodiments the order could be reversed. As used herein the term \u201cunknown\u201d with respect to a message parameter such as channel ID or recipient ID is intended to include not only the situation where one or both of such values are literally unknown, but also the case where it is simply not desired to embed such information in the Short URL","Referring now to  there is depicted a flow chart outlining an exemplary method or process  for generating the CCID  for embodiments wherein either or both of the recipient ID  and Channel ID are optional or otherwise may be unspecified. At step , it is determined whether the message transmission channel is specified. Again, the message channel may be unspecified for a number of reasons, for example, because it is unknown at the time the Short URL is being generated, because it is not desired to track responses (i.e., Short URL clicks by the recipient) based on channel ID for the particular message, etc. If the channel is not specified at step , the process continues to step  wherein a special character or digit that represents unknown channel is assigned as the value for the Channel ID . If the channel is specified at step , then the process continues to step  wherein the value representative of the message channel for the message that will contain the Short URL is assigned as the value for the Channel ID .","The process  then proceeds to step , wherein it is determined whether the recipient is to be specified. If the recipient is not to be specified at , again either because the recipient is unknown or otherwise not desired to be encoded or tracked, the process proceeds to step  wherein the CCID  is set to equal the Channel ID  and the process ends. Otherwise, if the recipient is to be specified at , the process proceeds to step  and the CCID  is set to the Recipient ID corresponding to the message recipient appended with the Channel ID  (i.e., Recipient ID on the left and the Channel ID on the right, in the embodiment illustrated in ), and the process ends.","It is preferred at step  to omit the Recipient ID in cases when the Recipient is not to be specified, rather than assign some value representative of an \u201cunknown\u201d recipient because it reduces the size of the number being encoded in cases where a Recipient ID is not present. It will be recognized, however, that in alternative embodiments, a special value representative of unknown recipient could be assigned to the Recipient ID if desired. Likewise, the process  could be modified such that a values representative of \u201cunknown\u201d could be assigned to the Recipient ID where the recipient is unknown and the Channel ID omitted from the CCID when the Channel ID is unknown. However, this is less preferred, since it is believed that having an unknown recipient will likely be a more common occurrence than unknown channel, thereby resulting in a smaller number to be encoded, which, in turn, would tend to produce shorter compressed URLs in more cases.","When the encoder\/decoder module  later decodes a Short URL that utilizes a CCID  that has been generated using the process  outlined in , the module  first checks to detect the situation when the Recipient ID  has been left out of the original encoding of the CCID . For example, the encoder\/decoder module  may examine the number of digits in the CCID  after reversing the pairing function described below, e.g., the in the case where the Channel ID  is always a single digit or some other prespecified number of digits or characters.","Referring again to , the Link ID  and the CCID  are combined using a 2:1 encoding algorithm, such as a Cantor Pairing function (see, e.g., http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cantor_pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function) to produce a single new integer value (NID) . The Cantor Pairing function is an example of a function that converts two integer numbers into a single resultant integer number, and allows the process to be later reversed, converting a single integer back into the original two source integers. It is possible to substitute alternative functions that have this capability (such as bit interleaving or others) and use them instead of the Cantor Pairing function.","The NID  is then encoded to a higher base (preferably base 62) version  of the NID by converting from base 10 to the higher base. Optionally, the higher base version  is annotated with an algorithm identifier  (e.g., a special character) to identify the URL as having been encoded using this embodiment to generate the Short URL . Note that this algorithm identifier annotation step is optional (and preferably omitted for the sake of making the Short URL shorter) for any applications wherein this first embodiment is the only encoding method employed. Where the algorithm identifier  is not used, the higher base version  of the NID is used as the Short URL . In the depicted embodiment, the algorithm identifier  (if used) is appended to this higher base version  as a prefix, but could alternatively be appended as a trailing character as well.","Preferably, the algorithm identifier , if used, is selected from a character that is not in the character set used to represent the base 62 (or other higher base) encoded number . However, it is possible that the algorithm identifier digit  could be a character that is a part of the higher base encoding character set, e.g., wherein the algorithm identifier  is always appended at a prespecified position within the encoded short URL , e.g., the leading digit or the trailing digit. Alternatively, the encoding algorithm identifier character  could be appended to the Short URL  at a prespecified position within the Short URL data field using a special character delimiter, although this is less desirable as it increases the length of the Short URL as compared to appending the encoding algorithm identifier directly at a predetermined location within the Short URL.","It will be recognized that the order of the various components as illustrated in  is exemplary only and that other orders can be employed. For example, the order of the Recipient ID  and the Channel ID  could be reversed, the Algorithm Identifier  and the higher base version  of the NID could be reversed, the special algorithm identifier character  could be appended as the trailing character, etc.","The Short URL  is then appended with the protocol (e.g., http:\/\/) and the domain and top-level domain of the redirect server . It will be recognized that a subdomain (e.g., www.) may also may be used, although for the purpose of shortening the URL, a short URL redirect server  will preferably be configured without a subdomain.","Referring now to , there appears a second embodiment Short URL encoding method herein which, while more along the lines of the traditional approach, unlike the prior art approach, also allows the separate encoding of the values for the Recipient ID , the Channel ID  along with the Link ID . In this second embodiment, the Link ID , Channel ID , and Recipient ID  are each individually encoded using a higher base (e.g., preferably base 62 although other bases greater than 10 are contemplated) to yield the respective higher base versions , , and .","The encoder  and then appends the high base Link ID , high base Channel ID , and high base Recipient ID  results using delimiter characters  to create a delimited string . The delimited string  is used in conjunction with the protocol, domain, and top-level domain of the redirect server  to generate a Short URL . It will be recognized that any delimiter character may be employed to generate the delimited string , so long as it is not a part of the character set used to represent the base 62 encoded values , , and .","It will be recognized that in embodiments where the Channel ID  is a single character (such as a base 10 integer less than 10), it is not necessary to encode the Channel ID  since doing so will not result in shortening the Short URL . In such alternative embodiments, the encoding and decoding module  will read the Channel ID  directly from the Short URL  based on its position in the delimited string .","The delimited string  generated in this fashion may optionally have appended thereto a special character prefix (or, alternatively, suffix)  to identify the URL as having been encoded using this second embodiment method. Again, the special character is preferably a character that is not a part of the character set used to represent higher-base encoded numbers, although this is not required in cases where the algorithm identifier is always present as a prespecified position within the Short URL.","Appending the special character  to identify the encoding method or algorithm can be omitted for embodiments that employ this second embodiment as the only encoding method. Alternatively, the encoding algorithm identifier character could be appended to the Short URL at a prespecified position within the Short URL data field using a special character delimiter , although again, this is less preferred as it increases the length of the Short URL as compared to appending the encoding algorithm identifier directly at a predetermined location (e.g., as leading character in the depicted embodiment) within the string . It will be recognized that the order of the various components as shown in  is exemplary and that any other order or arrangement of the various components comprising the Short URL may be employed.","A third embodiment method is an aggregate approach that employs the method for the first and second embodiments detailed above and selects the most effective based on the number of characters in the resultant short URL. In this third embodiment, for example, both of the first and second embodiments described above are used to generate potential short URLs  ( (). These short URLs  and  are then compared based on their size, and whichever resultant Short URL is the shortest (i.e., fewest characters) is selected and used in place of the long URL by the message authoring software in the message distributed to the recipient. In this third embodiment, the algorithm identifier ,  is appended to the corresponding Short URL , , respectively, to identify to the encoder\/decoder module  which method was used to create the selected Short URL.","With each of the embodiments, the encoding process is repeated for each unique recipient and distribution channel of the message, utilizing the same Link ID  value, but successively variable Recipient ID  and Channel ID  values. This results in a unique short URL value (, ) for every designated link\/recipient\/channel combination. Interestingly, it is possible that different individual recipients will receive the same message with a Short URL encoded using different methods.","When a user, e.g., message recipient, clicks on the URL containing a unique short URL, in embodiments such as the third embodiment in which the Short URL ,  may be encoded by a method selected from among multiple algorithms, the encoder\/decoder module  first identifies the method that was used based on the special character  or . The Short URL is then decoded by the encoder\/decoder module , reversing the designated encoding method and any associated calculations to get back the unique original values for each of Link ID , Recipient ID , and Channel ID . These identifiers are then used to record, e.g., in the database  or a separate database or data log  on the computer system , the fact that somebody clicked on the link associated with the Link ID  and identify the recipient to whom the link was originally sent, and the original channel of distribution.","The techniques described here can be further extended to incorporate additional methods for generating a Short URL, wherein each additional method is assigned a unique special Algorithm Identifier (preferably the leading character in the short URL, although other placements within the Short URL are contemplated), which is used by the decoder module  to identify the associated method by which the Short URL was generated for the purpose of reversing the encoding method to reconstitute the Link ID  and associated Recipient ID  and Channel ID . When the number of Short URL encoding methods exceeds the number of available special characters, the scheme can be extended to utilize multiple special characters in succession, e.g., by using two-character or multi-character algorithm identifiers.","The presently disclosed systems and methods may advantageously be used with a marketing application that allows businesses to send messages to customers or consumers (or potential customers or consumers) over one of several or many distribution channels, such as email, SMS message, MMS Message, Twitter, Facebook, and so forth. By using the techniques described here, the marketing application can efficiently and effectively distribute different short URLs to customers or consumers in a much more efficient and effective manner than was previously possible with established techniques. An exemplary lifecycle of using the systems and methods herein is as follows:","1. A marketer wants to distribute content of interest or a marketing message to one or more customers that use different channels (e.g., email, Twitter, Facebook, SMS, MMS, etc) for communication. This content includes one or more Internet URLs (long URLs).","2. Using the authoring software  (see ), the marketer authors its message and the encoding software  generates one or more specially encoded short URLs using one or more of the Short URL encoding embodiments described above.","3. The software, such as the message authoring software  (or the marketing software incorporating or otherwise associated with or used in conjunction with the message authoring software ), then initiates delivery of the messages to the recipients, which messages contain the short URLs in place of long URLs.","4. One or more recipients follow (e.g., click on) the short URL(s) contained within the message they receive. This directs their web browser or mobile device to follow the link to the redirect server , thereby causing the encoder\/decoder module  to be invoked to handle processing of the short URL.","5. In embodiments wherein a Short URL is generated using multiple methods and the shortest one is selected, the software module  recognizes or identifies the particular encoding method used the generate Short URL using the algorithm identifier and decodes the Short URL by reversing the identified encoding method to reproduce the original channel ID , recipient ID , and link ID . In embodiments wherein a single encoding method is used (e.g., either the first or second embodiment encoding method as described above), then the software module  simply decodes the Short URL to reproduce the original channel ID , recipient ID , and link ID . This decoded information, such as Link ID, Channel ID, and Recipient ID in the illustrated preferred embodiment can be logged in the database  or other database, data store, table, file, etc. .","6. The software, e.g., the redirect server , records events associated with knowing that the indicated customer clicked on the identified link and that this link was originally delivered over the indicated channel, e.g., in the database or data store .","7. The redirect server  then retrieves the long URL associated with the Link ID  from the database  and automatically redirects the user to the remote server  to retrieve the target web page  identified by the original long URL.","Some of the presently preferred aspects of the invention are contemplated as follows. In certain aspects, a method and system for encoding a short URL algorithm identifier within a short URL, e.g., as a leading or trailing character or characters, is contemplated. In a further aspect, a method and system for using a plurality of algorithms to generate a plurality of Short URL corresponding to a long URL and then selecting a single Short URL from the plurality based on some predetermined criteria, such as the shortest, is provided. In still another aspect, a method and system for combining link ID, recipient ID, and channel ID data (and\/or any other desired data) within a single short URL is provided. In yet a further aspect, a system and method employing a pairing function, such as a Cantor Pairing function or the like to encode recipient identifier data and link identifier data as a component of a short URL is provided. In still another aspect, a system and method are provided for distributing an unlimited number of different short URLs, all of which are associated a common long URL to a virtually unlimited number of individual recipients and across multiple communication channels, while requiring the storage of the short URL ID\/long URL pair or association only once.","A summary of test results for 14 comparative sample inputs comparing the first, second, and third embodiments as described above are presented in Table 1, below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Link","Recipient","Channel","Embodiment","Embodiment","Embodiment","Embodiment 3 Result"]},{"entry":[{},"ID","ID","ID","1","2","3","URL"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Case 1","2459","55555","3","!0pLddzs","-mn!z!6Tz","!0pLddzs","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!0pLddzs"]},{"entry":["Case 2","555555","55555","3","!4usZoJc","-09Mj!z!6Tz","!4usZoJc","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!4usZoJc"]},{"entry":["Case 3","555555","100","3","!0pzi4iF","-09Mj!z!yF","!0pzi4iF","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!0pzi4iF"]},{"entry":["Case 4","20000","1000","1","!STcuG","-r5D!y!73","!STcuG","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!STcuG"]},{"entry":["Case 5","12345","6789","8","!zhvy51","-zgW!3!yqh","!zhvy51","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!zhvy51"]},{"entry":["Case 6","1234567","6789","8","!6wuQd5m","-rk4c!3!yqh","!6wuQd5m","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!6wuQd5m"]},{"entry":["Case 7","1","2","3","!rg","-y!z!0","!rg","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!rg"]},{"entry":["Case 8","99999","2","3","!rTMwP1","-BZv!z!0","!rTMwP1","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!rTMwP1"]},{"entry":["Case 9","554433","2000","11","!rZGrWSi","-096f!k!M7","!rZGrWSi","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!rZGrWSi"]},{"entry":["Case 10","10000","2000","11","!N1BMjx","-0l8!k!M7","!N1BMjx","http:\/\/jit.ly\/!N1BMjx"]},{"entry":["Case 11","9876543219","3","3","!L2w28Ccs6HA","-4HNU1k!z!z","-4HNU1k!z!z","http:\/\/jit.ly\/-4HNU1k!z!z"]},{"entry":["Case 12","9876543219","0","3","!L2w2g9xE4T7","-4HNU1k!z","-4HNU1k!z","http:\/\/jit.ly\/-4HNU1k!z"]},{"entry":["Case 13","9876543219","1","1","!L2w26p5wLSN","-4HNU1k!y!y","-4HNU1k!y!y","http:\/\/jit.ly\/-4HNU1k!y!y"]},{"entry":["Case 14","987654321","1","1","!DyPVnmnik4","-y1J2Zd!y!y","-y1J2Zd!y!y","http:\/\/jit.ly\/-y1J2Zd!y!y"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Looking at these results, in most typical cases, Embodiment 1 results in short URL values that are from 1-3 characters shorter than Embodiment 2. It is only for certain input data sets, e.g., where the link ID value is in the billion+range that the delimited string Embodiment 2 results in a shorter resultant URL value. And in those cases, it is only shorter in the presence of very low Recipient ID values. Therefore, Embodiment 1 results in a substantial and meaningful reduction in short URL size in most cases. Although embodiments using only a single Short URL encoding method are contemplated, e.g., either a pairing method such as Embodiment 1 or a method using delimiters such as Embodiment 2 (with or without appending an encoding algorithm identifier), in preferred embodiments, Embodiment 3 is employed. Based on the test results above, Embodiment 3 is preferred, wherein Embodiment 1 generates the resulting Short URL in most cases, but wherein Embodiment 2 is left as an optimization for the edge cases. Thus, Embodiment 3 provides the best result (e.g., the shortest URL) being selected in all cases.","In the depicted preferred embodiment described above, the special character \u201c!\u201d was used as the algorithm identifier for Embodiment 1 and the special character \u201c\u2212\u201d was used as the algorithm identifier for Embodiment 2. It will be recognized that, in alternative embodiments where multiple possible short URLs are generated and the shortest one selected, it is also possible to prespecify a \u201cdefault\u201d encoding algorithm, wherein the algorithm identifier character can be omitted for Short URL's generated by this predetermined default algorithm, wherein the Short URL decoder module uses the absence of a special encoding algorithm identification character in the Short URL to determine that the encoding method was the default method. In other embodiments, however, it is also contemplated that a default algorithm identifying character be used in all Short URLs, e.g., to allow the redirect server  to distinguish not only between Short URLs encoded by different methods, but also to distinguish between short URL's and long or non-encoded URLs.","Certain embodiments of the present systems and methods herein can be implemented as sets of instructions resident in the main memory of one or more computer systems. Until required by the computer system, the set of instructions may be stored in another computer readable memory such as a hard disk drive or in a removable memory such as an optical disk for utilization in a DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drive, a magnetic media for utilization in a magnetic media drive, a magneto-optical disk for utilization in a magneto-optical drive, or a memory card for utilization in a card slot.

Modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding of the preceding detailed description.
