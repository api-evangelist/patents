{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, apparatus, and products for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application.","2. Description of Related Art","User interaction with applications running on small devices through a keyboard or stylus has become increasingly limited and cumbersome as those devices have become increasingly smaller. In particular, small handheld devices like mobile phones and PDAs serve many functions and contain sufficient processing power to support user interaction through multimodal access, that is, by interaction in non-voice modes as well as voice mode. Devices which support multimodal access combine multiple user input modes or channels in the same interaction allowing a user to interact with the applications on the device simultaneously through multiple input modes or channels. The methods of input include speech recognition, keyboard, touch screen, stylus, mouse, handwriting, and others. Multimodal input often makes using a small device easier.","Multimodal applications are often formed by sets of markup documents served up by web servers for display on multimodal browsers. A \u2018multimodal browser,\u2019 as the term is used in this specification, generally means a web browser capable of receiving multimodal input and interacting with users with multimodal output, where modes of the multimodal input and output include at least a speech mode. Multimodal browsers typically render web pages written in XHTML+Voice (\u2018X+V\u2019). X+V provides a markup language that enables users to interact with an multimodal application often running on a server through spoken dialog in addition to traditional means of input such as keyboard strokes and mouse pointer action. Visual markup tells a multimodal browser what the user interface is look like and how it is to behave when the user types, points, or clicks. Similarly, voice markup tells a multimodal browser what to do when the user speaks to it. For visual markup, the multimodal browser uses a graphics engine; for voice markup, the multimodal browser uses a speech engine. X+V adds spoken interaction to standard web content by integrating XHTML (eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language) and speech recognition vocabularies supported by VoiceXML. For visual markup, X+V includes the XHTML standard. For voice markup, X+V includes a subset of VoiceXML. For synchronizing the VoiceXML elements with corresponding visual interface elements, X+V uses events. XHTML includes voice modules that support speech synthesis, speech dialogs, command and control, and speech grammars. Voice handlers can be attached to XHTML elements and respond to specific events. Voice interaction features are integrated with XHTML and can consequently be used directly within XHTML content.","In addition to X+V, multimodal applications also may be implemented with Speech Application Tags (\u2018SALT\u2019). SALT is a markup language developed by the Salt Forum. Both X+V and SALT are markup languages for creating applications that use voice input\/speech recognition and voice output\/speech synthesis. Both SALT applications and X+V applications use underlying speech recognition and synthesis technologies or \u2018speech engines\u2019 to do the work of recognizing and generating human speech. As markup languages, both X+V and SALT provide markup-based programming environments for using speech engines in an application's user interface. Both languages have language elements, markup tags, that specify what the speech-recognition engine should listen for and what the synthesis engine should \u201csay.\u201d Whereas X+V combines XHTML, VoiceXML, and the XML Events standard to create multimodal applications, SALT does not provide a standard visual markup language or eventing model. Rather, it is a low-level set of tags for specifying voice interaction that can be embedded into other environments. In addition to X+V and SALT, multimodal applications may be implemented in Java with a Java speech framework, in C++, for example, and with other technologies and in other environments as well.","Currently multimodal application may be used to drive the execution of media content. Often the capability of a multimodal application to drive the execution of media content using speech is limited because artists use many different names over the course of a career, have difficult names to pronounce, have song titles that are difficult to pronounce, or any other reason that the grammar or lexicons of a speech engine do not include grammar rules or pronunciation rules specific to the content of a media file.","Improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application including receiving, by the multimodal browser, a media file having a metadata container; retrieving, by the multimodal browser, from the metadata container a speech artifact related to content stored in the media file for inclusion in the speech engine available to the multimodal browser; determining whether the speech artifact includes a grammar rule or a pronunciation rule; if the speech artifact includes a grammar rule, modifying, by the multimodal browser, the grammar of the speech engine to include the grammar rule; and if the speech artifact includes a pronunciation rule, modifying, by the multimodal browser, the lexicon of the speech engine to include the pronunciation rule.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Exemplary methods, apparatus, and products for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with .  sets forth a network diagram illustrating an exemplary system for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. Improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application in this example is implemented with a multimodal browser () that supports a media player () and a speech engine () operating on a multimodal device () or a speech engine () residing on a voice server (). The system of  includes at least one speech recognition grammar () that specifies words and phrases to be recognized by an automatic speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine () of a speech engine (, ). The multimodal device () supports multiple modes of user interaction with the multimodal application including a voice mode and one or more non-voice modes of user interaction with the multimodal application. The voice mode is represented here with audio output of voice prompts and responses () from the multimodal devices and audio input of speech for recognition () from a user (). Non-voice modes are represented by input\/output devices such as keyboards and display screens on the multimodal devices (). The multimodal application is operatively coupled () to an ASR engine () in a speech engine (). The operative coupling may be implemented with an application programming interface (\u2018API\u2019), a voice service module, or a VOIP connection as explained more detail below.","The system of  operates generally to carry out of improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application by receiving, by the multimodal browser (), a media file () having a metadata container; retrieving, by the multimodal browser (), from the metadata container of the media file () a speech artifact related to content stored in the media file () for inclusion in the speech engine () available to the multimodal browser (); and determining whether the speech artifact () includes a grammar rule or a pronunciation rule. If the speech artifact includes a grammar rule, improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to the example of  includes modifying, by the multimodal browser (), the grammar of the speech engine ( or ) to include the grammar rule. If the speech artifact includes a pronunciation rule, improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to the example of  includes modifying, by the multimodal browser (), the lexicon of the speech engine () to include the pronunciation rule.","A speech artifact is one or more individual speech rules for inclusion in either a grammar or lexicon available to a speech engine used by a multimodal browser for use in executing a multimodal application. Such speech artifacts are often embodied in an XML document. The artifact may be extracted from the XML document and included in a larger grammar defining the words understood by the speech recognition engine or in a lexicon defining the manner in which the words so recognized are pronounced.","A multimodal device is an automated device, that is, automated computing machinery or a computer program running on an automated device, that is capable of accepting from users more than one mode of input, keyboard, mouse, stylus, and so on, including speech input\u2014and also displaying more than one mode of output, graphic, speech, and so on. A multimodal device is generally capable of accepting speech input from a user, digitizing the speech, and providing digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. A multimodal device may be implemented, for example, as a voice-enabled browser on a laptop, a voice browser on a telephone handset, an online game implemented with Java on a personal computer, and with other combinations of hardware and software as may occur to those of skill in the art. Because multimodal applications may be implemented in markup languages (X+V, SALT), object-oriented languages (Java, C++), procedural languages (the C programming language), and in other kinds of computer languages as may occur to those of skill in the art, this specification uses the term \u2018multimodal application\u2019 to refer to any software application, server-oriented or client-oriented, thin client or thick client, that administers more than one mode of input and more than one mode of output, typically including visual and speech modes.","The system of  includes several example multimodal devices:\n\n","Each of the example multimodal devices () in the system of  includes a microphone, an audio amplifier, a digital-to-analog converter, a multimodal browser, and a multimodal application capable of accepting from a user () speech for recognition (), digitizing the speech, and providing the digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. The speech may be digitized according to industry standard codecs, including but not limited to those used for Distributed Speech Recognition as such. Methods for \u2018COding\/DECoding\u2019 speech are referred to as \u2018codecs.\u2019 The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (\u2018ETSI\u2019) provides several codecs for encoding speech for use in DSR, including, for example, the ETSI ES 201 108 DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 050 Advanced DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 211 Extended DSR Front-end Codec, and the ETSI ES 202 212 Extended Advanced DSR Front-end Codec. In standards such as RFC3557 entitled\n\n","As mentioned, a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention is capable of providing speech to a speech engine for recognition. A speech engine is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating or \u2018synthesizing\u2019 human speech. The speech engine implements speech recognition by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a ASR engine, and the speech engine carries out speech synthesis by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine. As shown in , a speech engine () may be installed locally in the multimodal device () itself, or a speech engine () may be installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice server (). A multimodal device that itself contains its own speech engine is said to implement a \u2018thick multimodal client\u2019 or \u2018thick client,\u2019 because the thick multimodal client device itself contains all the functionality needed to carry out speech recognition and speech synthesis\u2014through API calls to speech recognition and speech synthesis modules in the multimodal device itself with no need to send requests for speech recognition across a network and no need to receive synthesized speech across a network from a remote voice server. A multimodal device that does not contain its own speech engine is said to implement a \u2018thin multimodal client\u2019 or simply a \u2018thin client,\u2019 because the thin multimodal client itself contains only a relatively thin layer of multimodal application software that obtains speech recognition and speech synthesis services from a voice server located remotely across a network from the thin client. For ease of explanation, only one () of the multimodal devices () in the system of  is shown with a speech engine (), but readers will recognize that any multimodal device may have a speech engine according to embodiments of the present invention.","A multimodal application () in this example runs in a multimodal browser (). The multimodal client application () may be a set or sequence of X+V or SALT documents that execute on the multimodal browser (). The multimodal browser () of  is supports the execution of a media player () through voice modes and non-voice modes. A media player is automated computing machinery for managing and administering media content in media files such as audio files and video files. Examples of media players that may be modified for use in accordance with the present invention include Music Match\u2122, iTunes\u00ae, Songbird\u2122, and others as will occur to those of skill in the art.","A multimodal application () in this example running in a multimodal browser () provides speech for recognition and text for speech synthesis to a speech engine through a VoiceXML interpreter (, ). A VoiceXML interpreter is a software module of computer program instructions that accepts voice dialog instructions from a multimodal application, typically in the form of a VoiceXML <form> element. The voice dialog instructions include one or more grammars, data input elements, event handlers, and so on, that advise the VoiceXML interpreter how to administer voice input from a user and voice prompts and responses to be presented to a user. The VoiceXML interpreter administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019).","A Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019) drives the interaction between the user and a multimodal application. The FIA is generally responsible for selecting and playing one or more speech prompts, collecting a user input, either a response that fills in one or more input items, or a throwing of some event, and interpreting actions that pertained to the newly filled in input items. The FIA also handles multimodal application initialization, grammar activation and deactivation, entering and leaving forms with matching utterances and many other tasks. The FIA also maintains an internal prompt counter that is increased with each attempt to provoke a response from a user. That is, with each failed attempt to prompt a matching speech response from a user an internal prompt counter is incremented.","As shown in , a VoiceXML interpreter () may be installed locally in the multimodal device () itself, or a VoiceXML interpreter () may be installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice server (). In a thick client architecture, a multimodal device () includes both its own speech engine () and its own VoiceXML interpreter (). The VoiceXML interpreter () exposes an API to the multimodal application () for use in providing speech recognition and speech synthesis for the multimodal application. The multimodal application provides dialog instructions, VoiceXML <form> elements, grammars, input elements, event handlers, and so on, through the API to the VoiceXML interpreter, and the VoiceXML interpreter administers the speech engine on behalf of the multimodal application. In the thick client architecture, VoiceXML dialogs are interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter on the multimodal device. In the thin client architecture, VoiceXML dialogs are interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter on a voice server () located remotely across a data communications network () from the multimodal device running the multimodal application ().","The VoiceXML interpreter provides grammars, speech for recognition, and text prompts for speech synthesis to the speech engine, and the VoiceXML interpreter returns to the multimodal application speech engine output in the form of recognized speech, semantic interpretation results, and digitized speech for voice prompts. In a thin client architecture, the VoiceXML interpreter () is located remotely from the multimodal client device in a voice server (), the API for the VoiceXML interpreter is still implemented in the multimodal device, with the API modified to communicate voice dialog instructions, speech for recognition, and text and voice prompts to and from the VoiceXML interpreter on the voice server. For ease of explanation, only one () of the multimodal devices () in the system of  is shown with a VoiceXML interpreter (), but readers will recognize that any multimodal device may have a VoiceXML interpreter according to embodiments of the present invention. Each of the example multimodal devices () in the system of  may be configured to carry out improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to the present invention. The use of these four example multimodal devices () is for explanation only, not for limitation of the invention. Any automated computing machinery capable of accepting speech from a user, providing the speech digitized to an ASR engine through a VoiceXML interpreter, and receiving and playing speech prompts and responses from the VoiceXML interpreter may be improved to function as a multimodal device for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to the present invention.","The system of  also includes a voice server () which is connected to data communications network () through wireline connection (). The voice server () is a computer that runs a speech engine () that provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning text representing recognized speech. Voice server () also provides speech synthesis, text to speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion, for voice prompts and voice responses () to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java voice applications.","The system of  includes a data communications network () that connects the multimodal devices () and the voice server () for data communications. A data communications network useful for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention is a data communications network composed of a plurality of computers that function as data communications routers connected for data communications with packet switching protocols. Such a data communications network may be implemented with optical connections, wireline connections, or with wireless connections. Such a data communications network may include intranets, internets, local area data communications networks (\u2018LANs\u2019), and wide area data communications networks (\u2018WANs\u2019). Such a data communications network may implement, for example:\n\n","The system of  includes a web server () connected for data communications through wireline connection () to network () and therefore to the multimodal devices (). The web server () may be any server that provides to client devices markup documents that compose multimodal applications. The web server () typically provides such markup documents via a data communications protocol, HTTP, HDTP, WAP, or the like. That is, although the term \u2018web\u2019 is used to described the web server generally in this specification, there is no limitation of data communications between multimodal devices and the web server to HTTP alone.","The markup documents also may be implemented in any markup language that supports non-speech display elements, data entry elements, and speech elements for identifying which speech to recognize and which words to speak, grammars, form elements, and the like, including, for example, X+V and SALT. A multimodal application in a multimodal device then, upon receiving from the web sever () a markup document as part of a multimodal application, may execute speech elements by use of a VoiceXML interpreter () and speech engine () in the multimodal device itself or by use of a VoiceXML interpreter () and speech engine () located remotely from the multimodal device in a voice server ().","The arrangement of the multimodal devices (), the web server (), the voice server (), and the data communications network () making up the exemplary system illustrated in  are for explanation, not for limitation. Data processing systems useful for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to the present invention may include additional servers, routers, other devices, and peer-to-peer architectures, not shown in , as will occur to those of skill in the art. Data communications networks in such data processing systems may support many data communications protocols in addition to those noted above. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms in addition to those illustrated in .","Improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to the present invention according to embodiments of the present invention in a thin client architecture may be implemented with one or more voice servers, computers, that is, automated computing machinery, that provide speech recognition and speech synthesis. For further explanation, therefore,  sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a voice server () for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application for a particular multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. The voice server () of  includes at least one computer processor () or \u2018CPU\u2019 as well as random access memory () (\u2018RAM\u2019) which is connected through a high speed memory bus () and bus adapter () to processor () and to other components of the voice server.","Stored in RAM () is a voice server application (), a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a voice server in a system that is configured for use in improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. Voice server application () provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning speech recognition results, including text representing recognized speech, text for use as variable values in dialogs, and text as string representations of scripts for semantic interpretation. Voice server application () also includes computer program instructions that provide text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java Speech applications.","Voice server application () may be implemented as a web server, implemented in Java, C++, or another language, that supports X+V, SALT, VoiceXML, or other multimodal languages, by providing responses to HTTP requests from X+V clients, SALT clients, Java Speech clients, or other multimodal clients. Voice server application () may, for a further example, be implemented as a Java server that runs on a Java Virtual Machine () and supports a Java voice framework by providing responses to HTTP requests from Java client applications running on multimodal devices. And voice server applications that support embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in other ways as may occur to those of skill in the art, and all such ways are well within the scope of the present invention.","The voice server () in this example includes a speech engine (). The speech engine is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating human speech. The speech engine () includes an automated speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine for speech recognition and a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine for generating speech. The speech engine also includes a grammar (), a lexicon (), and a language-specific acoustic model (). The language-specific acoustic model () is a data structure, a table or database, for example, that associates SFVs with phonemes representing, to the extent that it is practically feasible to do so, all pronunciations of all the words in a human language. The lexicon () is an association of words in text form with phonemes representing pronunciations of each word; the lexicon effectively identifies words that are capable of recognition by an ASR engine. Also stored in RAM () is a Text To Speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) Engine (), a module of computer program instructions that accepts text as input and returns the same text in the form of digitally encoded speech, for use in providing speech as prompts for and responses to users of multimodal systems.","The grammar () communicates to the ASR engine () the words and sequences of words that currently may be recognized. For precise understanding, distinguish the purpose of the grammar and the purpose of the lexicon. The lexicon associates with phonemes all the words that the ASR engine can recognize. The grammar communicates the words currently eligible for recognition. The set of words currently eligible for recognition and the set of words capable of recognition may or may not be the same.","Grammars may be expressed in any format supported by any ASR engine, including, for example, the Java Speech Grammar Format (\u2018JSGF\u2019), the format of the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (\u2018SRGS\u2019), the Augmented Backus-Naur Format (\u2018ABNF\u2019) from the IETF's RFC2234, in the form of a stochastic grammar as described in the W3C's Stochastic Language Models (N-Gram) Specification, and in other grammar formats as may occur to those of skill in the art. Grammars typically operate as elements of dialogs, such as, for example, a VoiceXML <menu> or an X+V<form>. A grammar's definition may be expressed in-line in a dialog. Or the grammar may be implemented externally in a separate grammar document and referenced from with a dialog with a URI. Here is an example of a grammar expressed in JSFG:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0067"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<grammar scope=\u201cdialog\u201d ><![CDATA["]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003#JSGF V1.0;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003grammar command;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<command> = [remind me to] call | phone | telephone"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<name> <when>;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<name> = bob | martha | joe | pete | chris | john | artoush;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<when> = today | this afternoon | tomorrow | next week;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003]]>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/grammar>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In this example, the elements named <command>, <name>, and <when> are rules of the grammar. Rules are a combination of a rulename and an expansion of a rule that advises an ASR engine or a voice interpreter which words presently can be recognized. In this example, expansion includes conjunction and disjunction, and the vertical bars \u2018|\u2019 mean \u2018or.\u2019 An ASR engine or a voice interpreter processes the rules in sequence, first <command>, then <name>, then <when>. The <command> rule accepts for recognition \u2018call\u2019 or \u2018phone\u2019 or \u2018telephone\u2019 plus, that is, in conjunction with, whatever is returned from the <name> rule and the <when> rule.

ASR engine () is a module of computer program instructions, also stored in RAM in this example. In carrying out automated speech recognition, the ASR engine receives speech for recognition in the form of at least one digitized word and uses frequency components of the digitized word to derive a Speech Feature Vector (\u2018SFV\u2019). An SFV may be defined, for example, by the first twelve or thirteen Fourier or frequency domain components of a sample of digitized speech. The ASR engine can use the SFV to infer phonemes for the word from the language-specific acoustic model (). The ASR engine then uses the phonemes to find the word in the lexicon ().","Also stored in RAM is a VoiceXML interpreter (), a module of computer program instructions that processes VoiceXML grammars. VoiceXML input to VoiceXML interpreter () may originate, for example, from VoiceXML clients running remotely on multimodal devices, from X+V clients running remotely on multimodal devices, from SALT clients running on multimodal devices, or from Java client applications running remotely on multimedia devices. In this example, VoiceXML interpreter () interprets and executes VoiceXML segments representing voice dialog instructions received from remote multimedia devices and provided to VoiceXML interpreter () through voice server application ().","A multimodal application () in a thin client architecture may provide voice dialog instructions, VoiceXML segments, VoiceXML <form> elements, and the like, to VoiceXML interpreter () through data communications across a network with multimodal application ().

Examples of communications adapters useful for embodiments of the present invention include modems for wired dial-up communications, Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) adapters for wired data communications network communications, and 802.11 adapters for wireless data communications network communications.","For further explanation,  sets forth a functional block diagram of exemplary apparatus for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application for a particular multimodal application according to the present invention in a thin client architecture according to embodiments of the present invention. The example of  includes a multimodal device () and a voice server () connected for data communication by a VOIP connection () through a data communications network (). A multimodal application () runs on the multimodal device (), and a voice server application () runs on the voice server (). The multimodal client application () may be a set or sequence of X+V or SALT documents that execute on multimodal browser (), a Java voice application that executes on the Java Virtual Machine (), or a multimodal application implemented in other technologies as may occur to those of skill in the art. The example multimodal device of  also includes a sound card (), which is an example of an I\/O adapter specially designed for accepting analog audio signals from a microphone () and converting the audio analog signals to digital form for further processing by a codec ().","In addition to the multimodal sever application (), the voice server () also has installed upon it a speech engine () with an ASR engine (), a grammar (), a lexicon (), a language-specific acoustic model (), and a TTS engine (), as well as a JVM (), and a Voice XML interpreter (). VoiceXML interpreter () interprets and executes VoiceXML dialog instructions received from the multimodal application and provided to VoiceXML interpreter () through voice server application (). VoiceXML input to VoiceXML interpreter () may originate from the multimodal application () implemented as an X+V client running remotely on the multimodal device (). As noted above, the multimedia device application () also may be implemented as a Java client application running remotely on the multimedia device (), a SALT application running remotely on the multimedia device (), and in other ways as may occur to those of skill in the art.","VOIP stands for \u2018Voice Over Internet Protocol,\u2019 a generic term for routing speech over an IP-based data communications network. The speech data flows over a general-purpose packet-switched data communications network, instead of traditional dedicated, circuit-switched voice transmission lines. Protocols used to carry voice signals over the IP data communications network are commonly referred to as \u2018Voice over IP\u2019 or \u2018VOIP\u2019 protocols. VOIP traffic may be deployed on any IP data communications network, including data communications networks lacking a connection to the rest of the Internet, for instance on a private building-wide local area data communications network or \u2018LAN.\u2019","Many protocols are used to effect VOIP. The two most popular types of VOIP are effected with the IETF's Session Initiation Protocol (\u2018SIP\u2019) and the ITU's protocol known as \u2018H.323.\u2019 SIP clients use TCP and UDP port 5060 to connect to SIP servers. SIP itself is used to set up and tear down calls for speech transmission. VOIP with SIP then uses RTP for transmitting the actual encoded speech. Similarly, H.323 is an umbrella recommendation from the standards branch of the International Telecommunications Union that defines protocols to provide audio-visual communication sessions on any packet data communications network.","The apparatus of  operates in a manner that is similar to the operation of the system of  described above. Multimodal application () is a user-level, multimodal, client-side computer program that presents a voice interface to user (), provides audio prompts and responses () and accepts input speech for recognition (). Multimodal application () provides a speech interface through which a user may provide oral speech for recognition through microphone () and have the speech digitized through an audio amplifier () and a coder\/decoder (\u2018codec\u2019) () of a sound card () and provide the digitized speech for recognition to ASR engine (). Multimodal application () then packages the digitized speech in a recognition request message according to a VOIP protocol, and transmits the speech to voice server () through the VOIP connection () on the network ().","Voice server application () provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting dialog instructions, VoiceXML segments, and returning speech recognition results, including text representing recognized speech, text for use as variable values in dialogs, and output from execution of semantic interpretation scripts as well as voice prompts. Voice server application () includes computer program instructions that provide text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java Speech applications.","The voice server application () receives speech for recognition from a user and passes the speech through API calls to VoiceXML interpreter () which in turn uses an ASR engine () for speech recognition. The ASR engine receives digitized speech for recognition, uses frequency components of the digitized speech to derive an SFV, uses the SFV to infer phonemes for the word from the language-specific acoustic model (), and uses the phonemes to find the speech in the lexicon (). The ASR engine then compares speech found as words in the lexicon to words in a grammar () to determine whether words or phrases in speech are recognized by the ASR engine.","A multimodal application () in this example runs in a multimodal browser (). The multimodal browser of  is capable of receiving a media file having a metadata container, retrieving from the metadata container a speech artifact related to content stored in the media file for inclusion in the speech engine available to the multimodal browser, determining whether the speech artifact includes a grammar rule or a pronunciation rule. If the speech artifact includes a grammar rule, the multimodal browser is capable of modifying the grammar of the speech engine to include the grammar rule. If the speech artifact includes a pronunciation rule, the multimodal browser is capable of modifying the lexicon of the speech engine to include the pronunciation rule.","The multimodal application () is operatively coupled to the ASR engine (). In this example, the operative coupling between the multimodal application and the ASR engine () is implemented with a VOIP connection () through a voice services module (), then through the voice server application () and either JVM (), VoiceXML interpreter (), or SALT interpreter (), depending on whether the multimodal application is implemented in X+V, Java, or SALT. The voice services module () is a thin layer of functionality, a module of computer program instructions, that presents an API () for use by an application level program in providing dialog instructions and speech for recognition to a voice server application () and receiving in response voice prompts and other responses. In this example, application level programs are represented by multimodal application (), JVM (), and multimodal browser ().","The voice services module () provides data communications services through the VOIP connection and the voice server application () between the multimodal device () and the VoiceXML interpreter (). The API () is the same API presented to applications by a VoiceXML interpreter when the VoiceXML interpreter is installed on the multimodal device in a thick client architecture ( on ). So from the point of view of an application calling the API (), the application is calling the VoiceXML interpreter directly. The data communications functions of the voice services module () are transparent to applications that call the API (). At the application level, calls to the API () may be issued from the multimodal browser (), which provides an execution environment for the multimodal application () when the multimodal application is implemented with X+V. And calls to the API () may be issued from the JVM (), which provides an execution environment for the multimodal application () when the multimodal application is implemented with Java.","Improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention in thick client architectures is generally implemented with multimodal devices, that is, automated computing machinery or computers. In the system of , for example, all the multimodal devices () are implemented to some extent at least as computers. For further explanation, therefore,  sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a multimodal device () for improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application according to embodiments of the present invention. In a multimodal device implementing a thick client architecture as illustrated in , the multimodal device () has no connection to a remote voice server containing a VoiceXML interpreter and a speech engine. All the components needed for speech synthesis and voice recognition according to embodiments of the present invention are installed or embedded in the multimodal device itself.","The example multimodal device () of  includes several components that are structured and operate similarly as do parallel components of the voice server, having the same drawing reference numbers, as described above with reference to : at least one computer processor (), frontside bus (), RAM (), high speed memory bus (), bus adapter (), video adapter (), video bus (), expansion bus (), communications adapter (), I\/O adapter (), disk drive adapter (), an operating system (), a JVM (), a VoiceXML Interpreter (), a speech engine (), and so on. As in the system of , the speech engine in the multimodal device of  includes an ASR engine (), a grammar (), a lexicon (), a language-dependent acoustic model (), and a TTS engine (). The VoiceXML interpreter () administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019) ().","The speech engine () in this kind of embodiment, a thick client architecture, often is implemented as an embedded module in a small form factor device such as a handheld device, a mobile phone, PDA, and the like. An example of an embedded speech engine useful according to embodiments of the present invention is IBM's Embedded ViaVoice Enterprise. The example multimodal device of  also includes a sound card (), which is an example of an I\/O adapter specially designed for accepting analog audio signals from a microphone () and converting the audio analog signals to digital form for further processing by a codec (). The sound card () is connected to processor () through expansion bus (), bus adapter (), and front side bus ().","Also stored in RAM () in this example is a multimodal application (), a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a multimodal device as an apparatus that supports embodiments of the present invention. The multimodal application () runs with a multimodal browser () and implements speech recognition by accepting speech for recognition from a user and sending the speech for recognition through API calls to the ASR engine (). The multimodal application () and the multimodal browser () implement speech synthesis generally by sending words to be used as prompts for a user to the TTS engine (). As an example of thick client architecture, the multimodal application () in this example does not send speech for recognition across a network to a voice server for recognition, and the multimodal application () in this example does not receive synthesized speech, TTS prompts and responses, across a network from a voice server. All grammar processing, voice recognition, and text to speech conversion in this example is performed in an embedded fashion in the multimodal device () itself.","More particularly, multimodal application () in this example is a user-level, multimodal, client-side computer program that provides a speech interface through which a user may provide oral speech for recognition through microphone (), have the speech digitized through an audio amplifier () and a coder\/decoder (\u2018codec\u2019) () of a sound card () and provide the digitized speech for recognition to ASR engine (). The multimodal application () may be implemented as a set or sequence of X+V documents executing in a multimodal browser () or microbrowser that passes VoiceXML grammars and digitized speech by calls through an API () directly to an embedded VoiceXML interpreter () for processing. The embedded VoiceXML interpreter () may in turn issue requests for speech recognition through API calls directly to the embedded ASR engine (). Multimodal application () also can provide speech synthesis, TTS conversion, by API calls to the embedded TTS engine () for voice prompts and voice responses to user input.","In further exemplary embodiments, the multimodal application () may be implemented as a set or sequence X+V documents or SALT documents executed on a multimodal browser () or microbrowser that issues calls through the VoiceXML API () for speech recognition and speech synthesis services. In addition to X+V, SALT, and Java implementations, multimodal application () may be implemented in other technologies as will occur to those of skill in the art, and all such implementations are well within the scope of the present invention. The multimodal application () is operatively coupled to the ASR engine () through an API (). In this example, the operative coupling between the multimodal application and the ASR engine () is implemented by either JVM (), VoiceXML interpreter (), or SALT interpreter (), depending on whether the multimodal application is implemented in X+V, Java, or SALT. When the multimodal application () is implemented in X+V, the operative coupling is effected through the multimodal browser (), which provides an operating environment and an interpreter for the X+V application, and then through the VoiceXML interpreter, which passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the ASR engine. When the multimodal application () is implemented in Java Speech, the operative coupling is effected through the JVM (), which provides an operating environment for the Java application and passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the ASR engine. When the multimodal application () is implemented in SALT, the operative coupling is effected through the SALT interpreter (), which provides an operating environment and an interpreter for the X+V application and passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the ASR engine.","The multimodal application () in this example, running on a multimodal device () that contains its own VoiceXML interpreter () and its own speech engine () with no network or VOIP connection to a remote voice server containing a remote VoiceXML interpreter or a remote speech engine, is an example of a so-called \u2018thick client architecture,\u2019 so-called because all of the functionality for processing voice mode interactions between a user and the multimodal application\u2014as well as the functionality for speech recognition\u2014is implemented on the multimodal device itself.","The multimodal browser () of  operates generally to carry out improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application by receiving a media file () having a metadata container; retrieving from the metadata container a speech artifact related to content stored in the media file () for inclusion in the speech engine () available to the multimodal browser; determining whether the speech artifact includes a grammar rule or a pronunciation rule; if the speech artifact includes a grammar rule, modifying the grammar () of the speech engine to include the grammar rule; and if the speech artifact includes a pronunciation rule, modifying the lexicon () of the speech engine to include the pronunciation rule.","For further explanation,  sets forth a flow chart illustrating a method of improving speech capabilities of a multimodal application. The method of  is implemented with a multimodal browser () and a speech engine () operating on a multimodal device supporting multiple modes of user interaction with the multimodal application. The modes of user interaction supported by the multimodal device include a voice mode and one or more non-voice modes. The voice mode includes accepting speech input from a user, digitizing the speech, and providing digitized speech to a speech engine available to the multimodal browser for recognition. The non-voice mode includes accepting input from a user through physical user interaction with a user input device for the multimodal device. The multimodal browser comprises a module of automated computing machinery for executing the multimodal application and also supports the execution of a media file player. Such a media file player is capable of playing media files such as audio or video files. Examples of such media files include MPEG 3 (\u2018.mp3\u2019) files, MPEG 4 (\u2018.mp4\u2019) files, Advanced Audio Coding (\u2018AAC\u2019) compressed files, Advances Streaming Format (\u2018ASF\u2019) Files, WAV files, and many others as will occur to those of skill in the art.","The method of  includes receiving (), by the multimodal browser (), a media file () having a metadata container (). A metadata container contains metadata describing the content of the media file. Such content may include, for example, the name of the artist of the song contained in the media file, the name of the album associated with that song, album art, the name of the song contained in the media file, and any other metadata that will occur to those of skill in the art. MPEG media files support a metadata container called ID3 tags. One particular form of the ID3 tag is an ID3v2 tag. ID3v2 tag provides a container for metadata associated with the media file. An ID3v2 tag includes one or more frames supporting the inclusion of text, images, files, and other information. ID3v2 tags are flexible and expandable because parsers that do not support specific functions of an ID3v2 tag will ignore those functions. ID3v2 supports Unicode thereby providing the ability to include extracted text of many different languages. The maximum tag size of an ID3v2 tag is typically 256 megabytes and maximum frame size is typically 16 megabytes.","The method of  includes retrieving (), by the multimodal browser (), from the metadata container () a speech artifact () related to content stored in the media file () for inclusion in the speech engine () available to the multimodal browser (). A speech artifact is one or more individual speech rules for inclusion in either a grammar or lexicon available to a speech engine used by a multimodal browser for use in executing a multimodal application. Such speech artifacts are often embodied in an XML document. The artifact may be extracted from the XML document and included in a larger grammar defining the words understood by the speech recognition engine or in a lexicon defining the manner in which the words so recognized are pronounced.","In the method of , retrieving (), by the multimodal browser (), from the metadata container () a speech artifact () for inclusion in a speech engine () available to the multimodal browser () is carried out by scanning () the metadata container () for a tag identifying the speech artifact (). Scanning the metadata container for a tag identifying the speech artifacts may be carried out by scanning an ID3 container of an MPEG media file for a frame identifying speech artifacts. As mentioned above, ID3v2 tags includes one or more frames supporting the inclusion of text, images, files, and other information. Such ID3 tags may be expanded to include frames for speech artifacts. Such a new frame may identify a grammar rule or a lexicon for inclusion in a speech engine.","The method of  includes determining () whether the speech artifact () includes a grammar rule or a pronunciation rule. Determining () whether the speech artifact () includes a grammar rule or a pronunciation rule may be carried out by identifying a frame in an ID3 tag designating a grammar rule or a pronunciation rule. A grammar rule identifies words and sequences of words that may be recognized by a speech engine in executing a multimodal application. A pronunciation rule identifies an association of words in text form with phonemes representing pronunciations of the words","If the speech artifact includes a grammar rule (), the method of  includes modifying (), by the multimodal browser (), the grammar () of the speech engine () to include the grammar rule (). Modifying (), by the multimodal browser (), the grammar () of the speech engine () to include the grammar rule () may be carried out by calling functions in an API exposed by the speech engine to modify the grammar of the speech engine to include the grammar rule ().","If the speech artifact includes a pronunciation rule (), the method of  includes modifying (), by the multimodal browser (), the lexicon () of the speech engine () to include the pronunciation rule ().
