{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject disclosure generally relates to the sale and distribution of warm food products, and more specifically to efficiently preserving a heated environment for such food products.","By way of background concerning conventional methods for delivering and displaying food products, it is noted that such methods often yield various undesirable characteristics. For instance, although consumers generally prefer purchasing warm food products while they are still warm, such food products often cool down in transit from a production source to a delivery location. To overcome this limitation, some stores attempt to reheat such food products prior to selling them. However, reheating food is often undesirable since consumers generally desire fresh warm food products in which the food's heat is preserved from production.","Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a methodology for delivering and displaying warm food products which overcomes these limitations. To this end, it should be noted that the above-described deficiencies are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.","In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure, various non-limiting aspects are described in connection with delivering and displaying warm food products. In one such aspect, a method to facilitate a delivery of warm food products is provided. The method includes determining a threshold delivery time associated with delivering a warm food product after production, and ascertaining at least one peak period corresponding to a sale of the warm food product at a delivery location. The method further includes loading the warm food product onto a heat-insulated container at a production source proximate to the delivery location, and scheduling a delivery of the warm food product in the heat-insulated container. Within such embodiment, the loading is performed while the warm food product is above a threshold temperature, whereas the delivery is scheduled to arrive at the delivery location from the production source within the threshold delivery time prior to the at least one peak period.","In another aspect, a method to facilitate preserving a heated food environment is provided, which includes receiving a warm food product from a production source, and loading the warm food product onto a heat-insulated display case. For this particular embodiment, the warm food product is received during at least one peak period while the warm food product is above a threshold temperature, and the loading is performed while the warm food product is above the threshold temperature.","In a further aspect, a heat-insulated display case is provided, which includes a housing compartment, and a display door coupled to the housing compartment. Within such embodiment, the display door includes a window, and a seal between the display door and the housing compartment in a closed position is configured to maintain an optimal ambient temperature range within the housing compartment associated with a warm food product.","Other embodiments and various non-limiting examples, scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.","Overview","As discussed in the background, conventional methods for delivering and displaying warm food products yield various undesirable characteristics. The embodiments disclosed herein are directed towards overcoming such limitations by efficiently preserving a warm food product's heat from production. Namely, methods and apparatuses are disclosed which desirably preserve a warm food product's original heat both while the food product is delivered as well as while it is displayed.","Warm Food Product Production and Delivery Embodiments","Various exemplary non-limiting embodiments are now disclosed for producing and delivering warm food products. To this end, it is noted that the embodiments described herein are not intended to be exhaustive, and that one of ordinary skill will appreciate that various undisclosed embodiments also fall within the scope and spirit of the instant invention.","Referring first to , an exemplary environment that facilitates delivering warm food products is provided according to an embodiment. In an aspect, environment  includes a production source , which may deliver warm food products to various locations within a deliverable region  having a threshold delivery radius , as shown. Moreover, for this particular embodiment, each of deliverable location , , and  are within deliverable region , whereas each of undeliverable location  and  are outside deliverable region .","Here, it has been discovered that the scope of deliverable region  will vary depending on the particular type of warm food product. Namely, it has been discovered that certain food types have optimal corresponding ambient temperatures, wherein it is desirable to preserve the optimal ambient temperatures for those food types immediately after production. For instance, it has been discovered that the optimal ambient temperature range for tortillas is between ninety and ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Accordingly, for tortillas, threshold delivery radius  will be the transportation distance for which an optimal ambient temperature range of ninety to ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit can be maintained for such tortillas.","Threshold delivery radius  will thus partly depend on the insulation properties of containers used to transport the warm food product. For instance, it has been discovered that conventional ice chests can preserve a temperature range of ninety to ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit for approximately three hours. However, it has been discovered that other containers can also be used which can preserve a temperature range of ninety to ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit for approximately five hours. Accordingly, for tortillas delivered from a production source to a delivery location via conventional ground methods (e.g., via delivery truck), delivery radius  may vary between twelve and forty miles.","Turning to , illustrated is a system  that facilitates delivering warm food products according to an embodiment. System  and\/or instructions for implementing system  can reside within a computing device, for example. As depicted, system  includes functional blocks that can represent functions implemented by a processor using instructions and\/or data from a computer readable storage medium. System  includes a logical grouping  of electrical components that can act in conjunction. As illustrated, logical grouping  can include an electrical component for determining a threshold delivery time associated with delivering a warm food product after production , as well as an electrical component for ascertaining a peak period corresponding to a sale of the warm food product at a delivery location . Logical grouping  can also include an electrical component for loading the warm food product onto a heat-insulated container while the warm food product is above a threshold temperature . Furthermore, logical grouping  can include an electrical component for scheduling a delivery of the warm food product in the heat-insulated container within the threshold delivery time prior to the peak period . Additionally, system  can include a memory  that retains instructions for executing functions associated with electrical components , , , and . While shown as being external to memory , it is to be understood that electrical components , , , and  can exist within memory .","Referring next to , a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method to facilitate a delivery of warm food products is provided. It should be appreciated that process  includes a series of acts that may be performed within a computing device according to an aspect of the subject specification. For instance, process  may be implemented by employing a processor to execute computer executable instructions stored on a computer readable storage medium to implement the series of acts. In another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium comprising code for causing at least one computer to implement the acts of process  are contemplated.","In an aspect, process  begins with the scheduling of a warm food product delivery at act . Here, it should be appreciated that such scheduling may depend on various factors. For instance, it may be desirable to schedule deliveries so that the warm food product arrives shortly before a store's peak sales period. Scheduling may also take into account logistical issues such as the types of vehicles and containers used to transport the warm food product, since threshold delivery times for preserving optimal ambient temperatures will vary accordingly. Once a delivery has been scheduled, process  continues to act  where the warm food product is produced followed by a packaging of the warm food product at act .","For some embodiments, it is contemplated that smart tags can be utilized to monitor various aspects of the warm food product, wherein such smart tags are attached to a packaging of the warm food product at act . As used herein, smart tags are defined to be electronic tags configured to have communication capabilities with external entities. For instance, a smart tag may be configured as a transponder under a conventional print-coded label, which may include a computer chip, antenna, and bonding wires as an inlay. Within such embodiment, labels may be prepared as a paper roll with the inlays laminated between the rolled carrier and the label media for use in specially designed printer units.","In a particular aspect, it should be noted that smart tags as described herein may be configured utilizing radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that RFID technology uses radio waves to transfer data from an electronic tag, called an RFID tag or label, attached to an object, through a reader for the purpose of identifying and tracking the object. To this end, one of ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate that RFID tags are configured to store information electronically, wherein such tags generally include a small radio frequency (RF) transmitter and receiver. An RFID reader is then used to interrogate the tag by transmitting an encoded radio signal, which the tag receives and responds with its identification information. Here, it should be noted that, rather than using a battery, many RFID tags use the radio energy transmitted by the reader as its energy source. Furthermore, some RFID systems include a method of discriminating between several tags that might be within the range of an RFID reader.","Any or all of the RFID technology aspects described above, in addition to RFID technology aspects generally known in the art, may be implemented in conjunction with the aspects disclosed herein for delivering and displaying warm food products. For instance, a smart tag attached at act  may be configured as an RFID tag to facilitate storing information associated with the warm food product. Such information may, for example, include at least one of a dynamic temperature indication or a dynamic freshness indication, since the warm food product's temperature\/freshness may vary in time. In a particular embodiment, the information associated with the warm food product is a binary representation of whether the warm food product exceeds at least one of a threshold temperature or a threshold freshness. Namely, rather than transmitting detailed temperature\/freshness information, it may be desirable to provide a binary representation indicating whether the warm food product's current temperature\/freshness exceeds a threshold (i.e., fresh\/not fresh, warm\/not warm, etc.).","Once a smart tag has been attached, process  then proceeds to act  where a further production determination is determined. If more units of the warm food product are desired, process  loops back to act  where additional warm food product units are produced. Otherwise, if more units are not desired, process  proceeds to act .","At act , process  determines whether customized instructions for displaying the warm food product are desired. Such instructions may, for example, include instructions associated with displaying the warm food product in a heat-insulated display case, which may be location-specific. Accordingly, if customized instructions are indeed desired, process  may proceed to act  where store attributes for the delivery location are analyzed. For instance, act  may include analyzing commerce traffic patterns at the delivery location, wherein customized display instructions are subsequently generated at act  which include a positioning of the heat-insulated display case in the delivery location based on the commerce traffic patterns (e.g., positioning the heat-insulated display case in \u201chigh\u201d traffic areas).","Any of various other types of display instructions are also contemplated. For example, act  may include distinguishing between a heated shelf life and a non-heated shelf life, wherein the instructions generated at act  include a transfer protocol associated with transferring the warm food product from within the heat-insulated display case to outside the heat-insulated display case. Such protocol may, for instance, identify various triggers for moving the warm food product from within the heat-insulated display case to a shelf outside the heat-insulated display case (e.g., receiving a new shipment of the warm food product, ambient temperature within display case falling below a threshold, etc.).","Once instructions are generated at act , process  proceeds to act  where the warm food product is loaded onto a heat-insulated transportation container. Otherwise, if instructions were not desired, process  may proceed directly to act  from act . Process  then concludes at act  where the warm food product is delivered to the desired delivery location within the heat-insulated container.","Warm Food Product Display Embodiments","Various exemplary non-limiting embodiments are now disclosed for displaying warm food products. To this end, it is noted that the embodiments described herein are not intended to be exhaustive, and that one of ordinary skill will appreciate that various undisclosed embodiments also fall within the scope and spirit of the instant invention.","Referring next to , an exemplary environment that facilitates displaying warm food products is provided according to an embodiment. In an aspect, environment  includes a warm food product production source  and a delivery location , as shown. Within such embodiment, it is contemplated that delivery location  (e.g., a supermarket) will coordinate with warm food product production source  (e.g., a warm food product production plant) to receive a warm food product via heat-insulated container . Moreover, it is contemplated that delivery location  will coordinate with warm food product production source  to strategically receive warm food products just prior to peak sale hours. Warm food product production source  will then schedule production of the warm food product according to the desired delivery time, wherein deliveries are provided via heat-insulated container . Once received, the warm food product is removed from heat-insulated container  and immediately loaded onto a heat-insulated display case, wherein the loading is performed while the warm food product is above a threshold temperature associated with the warm food product.","A flow chart illustrating an exemplary method to facilitate preserving a heated food environment is provided next in . Here, similar to process , it should be appreciated that process  includes a series of acts that may be performed within a computing device according to an aspect of the subject specification. For instance, process  may be implemented by employing a processor to execute computer executable instructions stored on a computer readable storage medium to implement the series of acts. In another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium comprising code for causing at least one computer to implement the acts of process  are contemplated.","In an aspect, process  begins with a delivery location receiving a warm food product at act . As mentioned previously, such deliveries are desirably received via heat-insulated containers (e.g., an ice chest), wherein an optimal ambient temperature for the warm food product is preserved in transit. Once received, the warm food product is then immediately loaded onto a heat-insulated display case at act , wherein an original warmth from production is maintained above a threshold temperature associated with the warm food product (e.g., between ninety to ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit for tortillas).","It is contemplated that it may be desirable to monitor various aspects of the warm food product subsequent to them being loaded for display. For instance, at act  a warm food product count can be monitored. To facilitate such monitoring, a smart tag reader (e.g., an RFID reader) may be configured to monitor smart tags attached to a packaging of warm food products within the heat-insulated display case. By monitoring a warm food product count in such a manner, sale-related metrics may be more easily collected (e.g., peak sale hours, peak sale ambient temperature, peak sale freshness, etc.). Indeed, process  may further utilize smart tag readers to facilitate monitoring a warm food product's freshness at act , as well to facilitate monitoring a warm food product's temperature at act , as shown. Process  may then conclude at act  where appropriate adjustments are performed based on the monitoring of the warm food product. For instance, based on the monitoring, a warm product producer may be notified to adjust future production\/deliveries according to metrics collected at either of act , , and\/or .","Heat-Insulated Display Case Embodiments","Various exemplary non-limiting embodiments are now disclosed for a heat-insulated display case.

In a closed position , it is further contemplated that door  will form a seal  with housing compartment  to facilitate preserving an optimal ambient temperature within housing compartment  for warm food product .","To this end, it should be appreciated that some embodiments may desirably include heat-insulated display cases in which no power is required. For environmental purposes, such designs may be particularly desirable. In fact, it is contemplated that discarded refrigerators may be transformed into the heat-insulated display cases described herein, which would desirably provide a mechanism for recycling such refrigerators. Within such embodiment, a conventional refrigerator door may be replaced with door  for display purposes, which includes transparent display window . Furthermore, since a heat-insulated display case would desirably not require use of a compressor, such compressors may be removed from conventional refrigerators for resale.","In other embodiments, however, it may be desirable to implement designs requiring at least a nominal amount of power. For instance, as illustrated, some embodiments may include light , which may be configured to illuminate and\/or heat housing compartment . A heating system may also be included to ensure that the ambient temperature within housing compartment  remains within an optimal temperature range for warm food product . To further facilitate maintaining an optimal ambient temperature, circulation unit  may also be included, wherein circulation unit  is configured to circulate warm air within housing compartment .","In another aspect, it is contemplated that a computing device  may also be included.

Memory component  can be configured in a number of different configurations, including as random access memory, battery-backed memory, hard disk, magnetic tape, etc. Various features can also be implemented upon memory component , such as compression and automatic back up (e.g., use of a Redundant Array of Independent Drives configuration).","In yet another aspect, display system  includes communication component , which is coupled to processor component  and configured to interface display system  with external entities. Within such embodiment, communication component  may be configured to receive commands from an external entity to perform any of a plurality of tasks. For instance, communication component  may be configured to receive a \u201cpower down\u201d command from a store manager several miles away from the heat-insulated display case. Communication component  may also be configured to transmit data to external entities. For example, communication component  may be configured to notify a store manager (e.g., via e-mail, MMS, SMS, etc.) when the temperature within the display case falls below a threshold temperature.","As illustrated, display system  may also include monitoring component  and alert component . Within such embodiment, monitoring component  may be configured to monitor at least one aspect associated with the warm food product, whereas alert component  may be configured to provide an indication (e.g., a sound, a wireless communication, non-wireless communication, etc.) of the at least one aspect associated with the warm food product. To this end, it should be appreciated that monitoring component  may be configured to monitor warm food product aspects of various types. For instance, monitoring component  may be a smart tag reader configured to read a smart tag. Monitoring component  may also be configured to monitor a housing temperature within a housing compartment, wherein a climate regulating device is configured to automatically regulate the housing temperature to within an optimal ambient temperature range for the warm food product.","In another aspect, display system  includes heat component  and light component . For this embodiment, heat component  is configured to facilitate maintaining an optimal ambient temperature range within a display case's housing compartment, whereas light component  is configured to illuminate the housing compartment (i.e., via a fluorescent light source, LED light source, etc.).
