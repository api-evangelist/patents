The control signal controls the phases of the output signals, and is typically a digital signal. A phase interpolator with a digital control signal produces output signals having discrete phases. Phase interpolators may be used in a variety of systems, such as radio frequency (RF) receivers, and Plesiochronous or Mesochronous communications systems.","A phase interpolator outputs periodical signals based on a set of reference signals and a control signal as its input. Each reference signal has an amplitude and a phase. The control signal controls the phases of the output signals. The functionality of the phase interpolator is to set the phase of an output signal to track the digital control code provided by the control signal at its input. Hereafter, let A denote the amplitude (e.g., as in current in units of amperes (A) or voltage in units of volts (V)) of a signal and \u03c6 denote the phase (in degrees (\u00b0)) of a signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["111","112","113","114","111","112","113","114","111","112","113","114","111","112","113","114","121","122","123","124","121","122","123","124","121","122","123","124"]},"In particular embodiments, each output signal is produced by combining two reference signals, and more specifically, two adjacent reference signals. The term \u201cadjacent\u201d is with respect to the phases of the reference signals. For example, in the case illustrated in , reference signals  and  are adjacent to each other; reference signals  and  are adjacent to each other; reference signals  and  are adjacent to each other; and reference signals  and  are adjacent to each other. However, reference signals  and  are not adjacent to each other; and similarly, reference signals  and  are not adjacent to each other.","In , the four reference signals , , ,  divide the entire phase range P (e.g., 360\u00b0) of the phase interpolator into four equal sections , , , . More specifically, section  covers phases between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0; section  covers phases between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0; section  covers phases between 180\u00b0 and 270\u00b0; and section  covers phases between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. In particular embodiments, an output signal having a phase \u03c6 within section  is produced by combining reference signals  and ; an output signal having a phase \u03c6 within section  is produced by combining reference signals  and ; an output signal having a phase \u03c6 within section  is produced by combining reference signals  and ; and an output signal having a phase \u03c6 within section  is produced by combining reference signals  and .","In an ideal scenario, if the reference signals all have the same amplitude, then all phases (or positions) of each output signal should have equal amplitudes. In addition, the phase differences between every two adjacent phases of the output signal (controlled by the adjacent settings of the digital control code) around the phase range P (e.g., the circle) should be the same. For example, in the case illustrated in , given an output signal set to different phases , , , , . . . , the difference between phase  and phase  should be the same as the difference between phase  and phase , which should be the same as the difference between phase  and phase , and so on. In other words, in an ideal scenario, output signal phases , , , , . . . should be evenly distributed and positioned around the phase range P (e.g., the circle). In addition, for the output signal, the amplitude at phase  should equal to the amplitude at phase , which should equal to the amplitude at phase , which should equal to the amplitude at phase , and so on.","In practice, however, for a specific output signal, its different signal phases produced by a phase interpolator are often less than ideal. In particular embodiments, a phase interpolator may be implemented as electronic or integrated circuits.  illustrates an example circuit implementation of the phase interpolator illustrated in . The four reference signals , , ,  have four fixed amplitudes A, A, A, Aand four fixed phases \u03c6, \u03c6, \u03c6, \u03c6, respectively. To produce an output signal having phases within section , reference signals  and  are turned on, while reference signals  and  are turned off. To produce an output signal having phases within section , reference signals  and  are turned on, while reference signals  and  are turned off. To produce an output signal having phases within section , reference signals  and  are turned on, while reference signals  and  are turned off. To produce an output signal having phases within section , reference signals  and  are turned on, while reference signals  and  are turned off.","In particular embodiments, the control signal is digital, and its value may be represented using, for example, a binary number. The number of bits used to represent the control signal determines how many different phases may be produced by a phase interpolator (i.e., how many different phases an output signal can be set to). The larger number of bits used to represent the control signal, the larger number of different phases can be produced by the phase interpolator, and vice versa. As one example, suppose that the control signal is represented using seven (7) bits. Applying this 7-bit control signal to the phase interpolator illustrated in , the higher two (2) bits may be used to represent the sections, while the lower five (5) bits may be used to represent the phases within each section. More specifically, for the higher two bits that represent the sections, \u201c00\u201d may indicate section  (between 0\u00b0 and) 90\u00b0); \u201c01\u201d may indicate section  (between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0); \u201c10\u201d may indicate section  (between 180\u00b0 and 270\u00b0); and \u201c11\u201d may indicate section  (between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0). The lower five bits are used to represent the phases within each section, and five bits can represent up to 32 (2=32) distinct input values. Thus, with a 7-bit control signal, the phase interpolator can produce up to 128 (4\u00d732=128 or 2=128) different output phases. In other words, a specific output signal can be set to 128 different phases.","In the case illustrated in , the phase range P is 360\u00b0, and each section , , ,  has 90\u00b0. With a 7-bit control signal, in an ideal scenario, the 128 output phases are",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":["360","128"]}},"mi":"\u00b0"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":["90","32"]}},"mi":"\u00b0"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"or"}}},"br":{},"b":"131"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":["90","14"],"mo":"\u00d7"},"mn":"32"}},"mi":"\u00b0"},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"b":"133"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"180","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":["90","16"],"mo":"\u00d7"},"mn":"32"}}},"mi":"\u00b0"},"mo":"."}}}},"As another example, if the control signal is represented by five (5) bits with the higher two bits representing the sections and the lower three bits representing the phases within each section, then, applying this 5-bit control signal to the phase interpolator illustrated in , the phase interpolator can produce up to 32 output signals having phases that are",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":["360","32"]}},"mi":"\u00b0"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":["90","8"]}},"mi":"\u00b0"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"or"}}},"br":{},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":["360","512"]}},"mi":"\u00b0"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":["90","128"]}},"mi":"\u00b0"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"or"}}},"br":{}},"Note that the phase range P of a phase interpolator is not necessarily always 360\u00b0, but may be less than 360\u00b0. For example, a phase interpolator may have a phase range P of only 90\u00b0, as illustrated in , and there may be only two reference signals ,  as input to this phase interpolator. More specifically, reference signal  has a fixed phase of 0\u00b0; and reference signal  has a fixed phase of 90\u00b0. In this case, the phase interpolator outputs signals having phases , , , . . . all between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0.","Moreover, in general, a phase interpolator (e.g., a phase interpolator having a phase range P of 90\u00b0, as illustrated in ) may have two or more reference signals as its input. A phase interpolator with a phase range P of 360\u00b0 may have three or more reference signals as its input. For example,  illustrates a phase interpolator having a phase range P of 360\u00b0 and three reference signals , , . These three reference signals , ,  divide the phase range P (e.g., 360\u00b0) of the phase interpolator into three sections , , . Section  covers 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0; section  covers 120\u00b0 to 240\u00b0; and section  covers 240\u00b0 to 360\u00b0. Output signals having phases within section  (e.g., signal phases , , . . . ) are produced by combining reference signals  and . Output signals having phases within section  are produced by combining reference signals  and . Output signals having phases within section  are produced by combining reference signals  and .","To further explain how an output signal having different phases is produced by combining two adjacent reference signals, consider the implementation illustrated in . Suppose that reference signals , , , and  have equal amplitude and phases \u03c6, \u03c6, \u03c6, \u03c6, respectively. The phase interpolation is performed by mixing (or combining) the reference signals with the weights represented by the values of the corresponding current sources I, I, I, and I, respectively. The values of these currents depend on the digital control code so that for any control code, two of the current sources are turned off so that the corresponding two currents each have value 0, and the values of the remaining two current sources are set to represent the phase that the phase interpolator should produce.","In particular embodiments, to combine two adjacent reference signals to produce an output signal having specific phases located between them, each current source may be given a weight, and the sum of the weights for the two adjacent current sources may be kept constant. The weights of the two adjacent current sources may linearly increase or decrease for the different phases of the output signal located between the two adjacent reference signals. To do so, in some implementations, a delta current \u0394I may be assigned to the least significant bit (LSB) of the digital control code such that as the digital control code increases (or decreases) by 1 LSB, the current source representing the weight of the early reference signal (e.g., I) decreases (or increases) by \u0394I, and the current source representing the weight of the late reference signal (e.g., I) increases (or decreases) by \u0394I. In this way, the total sum of the four weights selected for the four reference signals, respectively, remains equal for all digital control codes.","For example, consider section  illustrated in , where the output signal phases (e.g., phases , , , , . . . ) are produced by combining reference signals  and . As the value of the digital control code increases, the current Iof reference signal  is decreased by \u0394I during each step, while the current Iof reference signal  is increased by \u0394I during each step, causing the phases of an output signal to gradually move away from reference signal  and toward reference signal . Conversely, as the value of the digital control code decreases, the current Iof reference signal  is increased by \u0394I during each step, while the current Iof reference signal  is decreased by \u0394I during each step, causing the phases of the output signal to gradually move towards reference signal  and away from reference signal .","In the implementation illustrated in , the four different currents, I, I, I, and I, represent the four weights assigned to the four reference signals , , , and , respectively, when combining them to produce an output signal with varying phases as a function of the control code provided by the control signal. Note that there are other means to assign different weights to different reference signals (i.e., instead of using current sources), and this disclosure contemplates any applicable means to assign specific weights to specific reference signals. The delta current, \u0394I, represents the relative gain of the weights assigned to the reference signals.","The process may be similarly applied to sections , , , using the corresponding reference signals for each section, to produce output signals within each section.","In practice, using a constant relative gain (e.g., represented as the delta current \u0394I) for the entire phase range P of a phase interpolator to adjust the weights assigned to the reference signals for different output phases often results in varying amplitudes for an output signal at different phases, which, in further buffering and other processing, can cause integral non-linearity (INL) and differential non-linearity (DNL), on top of the inherent INL and DNL due to the process variation and device matching.  illustrates an output signal set at phases , , , , . . . , in practice, produced by the phase interpolator illustrated in  using a constant relative gain (e.g., a constant delta current \u0394I) for the entire phase range P. The different phases , , , , . . . of the output signal have varying and different amplitude levels. For example, those output phases closer to reference signals , , ,  have higher amplitude levels than those output phases farther away from reference signals , , , . In addition, output phases are not evenly and linearly distributed around the phase range. Some adjacent output phases are closer to each other, while other adjacent output phases are farther apart from each other.","To improve the output signals (i.e., their phases and the amplitudes at different phases) produced by a phase interpolator, in particular embodiments, different relative gains are selected for different reference signals. In the case illustrated in , where the relative gain is represented by delta currents, four delta currents \u0394I, \u0394I, \u0394I, \u0394Imay be selected for the four reference signals , , , , respectively. Each delta current, \u0394I, represents the gain of the corresponding weight with respect to the control code.","Moreover, in particular embodiments, as the reference signals divide the phase range P of a phase interpolator into a number of sections, each section is further divided into a number of subsections, and within each subsection, two delta currents are selected for the two adjacent reference signals between which the subsection is located. The two delta currents for each subsection may be independently selected so that different subsections may have different delta currents. In this way, the relative gain for the two selected adjacent reference signals (early and late) with respect to the input control code is chosen in each subsection independent of other subsections. Note that each section may be divided into any number of subsections, and the number of subsections in one section does not necessarily equal to the number of subsections in another section. Moreover, two subsections, either within the same section or in different sections, may or may not cover the same amount of phases.  illustrates a phase interpolator with its phase range P divided into sections and subsections. The phase interpolator illustrated in  is similar to that illustrated in . Its phase range P is 360\u00b0 and there are four reference signals , , ,  dividing the phase range into four sections , , , . Each section , , ,  is further divided into four subsections. For example section  is divided into subsections , , , .","In this case, for subsection , which is located between reference signals  and , a delta current \u0394Iis selected for reference signal , and another delta current \u0394Iis selected for reference signal . Similarly, for subsection , two delta currents \u0394Iand \u0394Iare selected for reference signals  and , respectively. Note that \u0394Imay differ from \u0394I, even though both are delta currents selected for reference signal ; and \u0394Imay differ from \u0394I, even though both are delta currents selected for reference signal . For subsection  within section , which is located between reference signals  and , two delta currents \u0394Iand \u0394Iare selected for reference signals  and , respectively. In the case illustrated in , there are a total of sixteen subsections, and thus, there may be sixteen pairs of delta currents, one for each subsection corresponding to the two adjacent reference signals between which that subsection is located. In particular embodiments, the sixteen pairs of delta currents may differ from each other.","For example, in one subsection, for the control code  (out of 128), a phase interpolator may assign a weight of 1 mA to reference signal , and a weight of 0.3 mA to reference signal . For the control code , the phase interpolator may assign a weight of 0.95 mA to reference signal  and a weight of 0.4 mA to reference signal . The relative gain (i.e., the ratio of the deltas) is 2 because the weight of reference signal  is dropped by 0.05 mA and the weight of reference signal  is increased 0.1 mA. It is these relative gains that are changed as the phases of the output signal progresses from one subsection to another. This is distinctively different from existing methods where this relative gain is always 1 or \u22121, depending on how it is defined (i.e., one reference signal is always increases the same amount as the other reference signal is decreased). In contrast, in particular embodiments, the amount one reference signal is increased may differ from the amount the other reference signal is decreased.","In particular embodiments, given a specific subsection, the two delta currents for the two adjacent reference signals between which the subsection is located may be selected based on experiments. Different values may be selected for the two delta currents to control the currents and phases of the output signals within that subsection. With some implementations, the goal is to approximate the ideal scenario of the output signals illustrated in  (circular phasor diagram). The more subsections created for each section, the finer control of the output signals the phase interpolator may achieve.  illustrates several examples of controlling the phases and amplitudes of an output signal in different subsections by varying the delta currents for each subsection. In this case, again, there are four reference signals, dividing the phase range P of 360\u00b0 into four sections , , , . To simplify the discussion, each section , , ,  is further divided into two subsections. In subsections  and , the amplitudes at different phases of the output signal are closer to a nominal amplitude. In subsections  and , the amplitudes at different phases of the output signal are somewhat greater than the nominal amplitude. In subsections  and , the amplitudes at different phases of the output signal are somewhat less than the nominal amplitude. This may be achieved by selecting different delta currents, and thus selecting different relative gains, for the different subsections. In addition, the relative weights of the two subsections within each section are set to be reciprocal, so that a reasonably good approximation of a circular phase diagram may be achieved with a relatively simple circuit. Typically, but not necessarily, the relative gains (i.e., the ratio of the delta currents) are selected to be equal in the four quadrants. In other words, all relative gains for control codes that differ only in the top two most significant bits (MSBs) are the same. In addition, typically, but not necessarily, the relative gains (i.e., the ratio of the delta currents) are selected to be reciprocal to the relative gains for 1-complementary control codes in each quadrant. In other words, the product of the relative gains of any two control codes in quadrant whose sum equals to the largest code (e.g. code 11111=31 for 5-bit per quadrant) is one.","In some implementations, given a subsection within the phase range P of a phase interpolator that is located between two reference signals (e.g., reference signals i and j), two delta currents (e.g., denoted as \u0394Iand \u0394I) may be determined for the two reference signals i and j, respectively, for the subsection. In particular embodiments, a global delta current (e.g., denoted as \u0394I) may be selected for the phase interpolator (e.g., based on experiments or practical requirements of the phase interpolator). Then, there may be two control values (e.g., denoted as ctrland ctrl) selected for the two reference signals i and j, respectively, such that \u0394I=ctrl\u00d7\u0394I and \u0394I=ctrl\u0394I.
