{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","This Application is a substitute for application Ser. No. 11\/223,316, now abandoned, which was filed on Sep. 12, 2005, of the same title and inventor.","This invention relates to an aerosol sampler, particularly a compact aerosol sampler that is readily portable.","Typically, prior art aerosol collection instruments use filters in which air is drawn therethrough by means of a pump. A pump is used because the pressure drop across a filter rises sharply with particle loading. However, pumps are suitable for moving air across a large pressure drop, though in relatively small amounts.","Also pumps are relatively heavy and noisy and require a relatively large battery pack to power same if one is to have a portable unit.","Because of the weight of the above assembly, it is divided into two units to assist the wear-ability thereof. That is, the collection surface of the sampler is a filter inside a housing clipped, e.g., to the collar of the wearer, while the pump and battery pack are worn on the belt of the wearer and the two units are connected by, e.g., a plastic air hose, as illustrated in  hereof.","Typically the pump box and battery pack weigh a pound or more. Also the pump is relatively loud and rather noticeable if worn indoors, to the discomfort of the wearer.","That is, in prior art air samples, the inlet system is in the breathing zone of the wearer and the pumping system is worn at his waist, which can be for a period of several hours, to the further discomfort of the wearer. For related prior art samplers, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,895 to Baxter and U.S. Pat. No. 6,170,342 to Walter.","There has now been discovered a compact, light weight air sampler that is a one part rather than a two part unit, that is eminently wearable, less conspicuous and comfortable to wear for extended periods as further described below.","Broadly the present invention provides an aerosol sampler comprising,","an aerosol inlet,","an impactor at or below the inlet, the impactor having one or more nozzles therethrough,","a collection layer below the impactor,","a fan and","means to rotate the fan and move aerosol through the sampler, so as to draw airborne particles through the inlet and through one or more nozzles, to impact the particles on the layer for analysis.","In a preferred embodiment, a pre-classifier  is mounted over the inlet  of the sampler , as shown in . The pre-classifier  screens out larger particles from entering such inlet, while the nozzles  of the impactor  below, control the lower limit of the size of particles impacting the collection layer  so as to collect particles on such layer in a desired size range as more fully described below.","In the prior art, pumps are used to compress and move relatively small amounts of fluid across a potentially large pressure drop. Also, pumps require considerably more power to operate than a fan and need a heavy battery assembly.","The present invention employs a fan which is used to move air across a relatively low-pressure drop.","By \u201cfan\u201d as used herein is meant bladed air movers such as fans and blowers, including a series of parallel blades arrayed in a drum or roller shape.","By \u201caerosol\u201d, as used herein, is meant a suspension of fine, solid, liquid particles or pathogens and the like, in air, as smoke, fog or mist.","Referring now to the present invention in detail, aerosol sampler  has fan housing , surmounted by impaction plate , collection layer , impactor  and cap , having inlet , as shown in ,  & .","The impactor  has one or more nozzles  therein, which can each be, e.g., slits 200 microns wide and six centimeters long, for airflow into the air sampler assembly, as indicated in ,  & .","The incoming air is impacted through the nozzles  onto the collection layer , as indicated in FIGS. , & .","The underside of the impacting disk  has several feet or stand-offs  to keep the nozzles  spaced at a distance from the collection layer  and its underlying support, impaction plate , as shown or indicated in . The nozzles preferably have sufficient size, in cross-section, to permit aerosol flow therethrough at low pressure drop.","In between the standoffs  is sufficient space for air to flow, at low-pressure drop, through the passages  in the impaction plate , down to the next stage, as shown or indicated in .","The collection layer  can be a thin flat material suitable for aerosol impaction and subsequent assay. Such layer  is sandwiched between the standoffs  of the impactor  and the impaction plate , as shown in .","As noted above, the impaction plate  has passages  to allow airflow, at low-pressure drop, to the fan housing  below, as shown in .","As to airflow rate, the width and length of the nozzles  are also sized to provide a suitable particle size impaction cut-off to limit the size or size range of the particles impacting on the collection layer , shown in . This size or size range is set by the value of the Stokes no. for the impactor assembly. By Stokes No, as used herein, is meant the ratio of a particle's stopping distance at average nozzle exit velocity to the slit width.","In the fan housing  is the fan , which must support sufficient pressure drop (e.g., at less than 1\u2033 water column) to move air through the sampler assembly at the desired flow rate. By low pressure drop, through the inventive sampler assembly, as used herein, is meant 0.05 to 1 to 5\u2033 or more and preferably 0.1 to 2.0\u2033 water column, to move aerosol therethrough at the desired flow rate.","The impactor , collection layer  and impaction plate , are sandwiched between the cap  (having an air inlet ) and, at the bottom thereof, interior threads , to mate with the exterior threads  of the fan housing , as shown or indicated in . That is, the cap  and the fan housing  thread together, as shown in .","The air sampler assembly is sealed between the impaction plate  and the fan housing  by a grease coating or gasket  as sealant (which is also used as sealant  between cap  and impactor ), while the space between housing threads  &  has a sealant, such as grease or plastic tape, e.g., of Teflon\u2122, , as shown in .","Within the fan housing  and below the fan  is the battery , within the battery case , as is the flow control circuitry, for controlling the RPM of the fan and thus the flow rate of air through the aerosol mini-sampler of the Invention, which fan is activated by the on-off switch , shown in .","The battery is of sufficient capacity to power the fan  for, e.g., up to 8 hours, at an airflow rate of 10 or more liters per minute, although these parameters can also be reduced depending upon the sampling application.","A schematic of the aerosol mini sampler of the invention is shown in  hereof, in which important elements thereof are highlighted, such as the size classifying impactor nozzles  over the collection layer  and a fan , powered by battery , with airflow regulated by the electrical flow controller , as shown.","In a preferred embodiment, the sampler  has, mounted above the inlet , a pre-classifier , e.g., an impactor or a cyclone, to screen out relatively large particles, e.g., over 30 microns (\u03bc) from entering the sampler. An impactor  having nozzles  is mounted at or below the inlet, per , sized to impact particles, e.g., particles larger than 1\u03bc onto the collection layer. Smaller particles do not so impact but go with the air flow to exhaust, e.g., at outlet  of . Therefore, the combined effect of the pre-classifier and the impactor is that particles in a defined size range, e.g., between 1 and 30\u03bc, impact the collection layer. The nozzles  of the impactor can take various shapes such as round, angular, elongated, slits or a combination thereof.","Referring further to the pre-classifier , it has an inlet  with a plate  mounted below, within housing , per . The plate  has optionally, a sticky layer  thereon, to receive and adhere particles above a desired size, while smaller particles flow by. The housing  rests on seals  on cap  over the inlet  of the sampler , as shown in . Thus a desired particle size range can impact the collection layer in the inventive sampler, as described above.","An alternate pre-classifier in the form of a cyclone can be employed, per the invention. As indicated in , a cyclone  is an apparatus in which particles are removed by centrifugal forces in a cyclonic path. Cyclone samplers use a vortical flow inside a cylindrical or conical chamber. Air is introduced tangentially near the top, at inlet , creating a double vortex flow within the cyclone body. The flow spirals down the outer portion of the chamber  and then reverses and spirals up the inner core to the exit tube  (which can feed such flow to the inlet  of the inventive sampler of .) Particles having excessive inertia are unable to follow the air streamlines, and they impact onto the cyclone walls or fall to the grit pot  at the bottom for discard.","A typical sampler of the prior art is shown, in operation, in  in which the air intake component , in the air breathing zone of wearer , is connected by tube , to a heavy package  containing flow pump & battery pack.","In contrast, the aerosol mini sampler  of the present invention is shown in  as a self-contained compact unit without need of a tube connecting to a heavy battery pack per  hereof. Thus in the mini aerosol sampler of the present invention is found a unit that can be worn entirely in the breathing zone of the wearer , which sampler is capable of high airflow rates, e.g., over ten liters per minute, with relatively low power requirements since it is a fan and not a pump. That is, having both the inlet system and the airflow system combined in a single lightweight container is a major convenience. Convenience is important because such samplers are often worn by volunteers for an eight-hour shift, to obtain extensive air samples in the workplace or other environments, for which purpose a heavy and obtrusive pump system of the prior art is not conducive.","Novel features of the present invention include 1) the entire unit, with the, can be worn in the breathing zone of the user, 2) the combination of particle impaction with a fan, to produce a substantial air current in the inventive unit 3) that is a light weight, personal sampler with a flow rate of 10 or more liters per minute for several types of regulatory tests, which tests are presently done with bulky and stationery air samplers, for tests such as source apportionment, radioactive aerosol monitoring, testing for mold and the like and 4) also in the present unit, airflow particles accumulate on a collection layer, the layer is then removed from the inventive unit to be sent for laboratory analysis, while a new collection layer is installed in the inventive unit, for ready reuse.","The air inlet of the sampler the present invention can have an impactor with round, angular or slotted, including slit shaped, intake orifices or nozzles or a combination thereof. As noted previously, such nozzles are preferably of sufficient cross-sectional size for aerosol flow-through at low-pressure drop to permit relatively large flow rates therethrough, which, in turn, influences or limits the size of particles impacting the collection layer. In advance of such inlet there can be mounted, a particle pre-classifier, e.g., an impactor or cyclone system, as noted above, for removing unwanted large particles from the inflow.","With or without such pre-particle removal before the intake of the inventive aerosol sampler, a collection layer is positioned inside such inlet as described above and shown, e.g., as collection layer  in  hereof. As indicated in that figure, the inlet air flows by and around such collection layer or surface, while the airborne particles, of desired size or size range, impact on such layer for collection, removal and later analysis as noted above.","Typical impact or collection layers include fiber filters or membrane filters as well as thin pieces of metal foil or agar for collecting airborne biological samples.","The minimum size of particles that impact on the collection surface is determined largely by the width of the nozzles and the speed of the air flowing through them, such as through slits  in . That is, particles larger than the critical size are collected, the rest pass through the device with the airflow. The faster the air flowing through the slits, the smaller the critical size but the larger the pressure drop in the unit.","Preferred is an aerosol sampler that has a cap, impactor, impaction disk, collection layer, fan and battery and desirably, an attaching means, such as a clip, to provide a sampler that is lightweight. One that can be worn for an extended period of time, e.g., up to 8 hours or more. One that is capable of high flows, e.g., over ten liters per minute in which the particles can be collected onto a variety of collection layers for a variety of assays, including gravimetric management, chemical speciation and the like. As noted, the inventive sampler is preferably worn in the breathing zone of the wearer, i.e., in a sphere having a radius up to 3 ft. from the mouth and nose, with no wind and a radius of more than 3 ft. in a wind.","High flow rate aerosol samplers are needed for sensitive measurements. However the maximum flow rate for a prior art personal or wearable pump sampler, having two components connected by a hose, is about 4 liters per minute (Lpm). As noted above, the inventive fan mini sampler can deliver airflow of over ten liters per minute.","It appears that until now, no one has combined a slit impactor with a fan and a power supply into a self-contained, lightweight and compact unit. But this is what is accomplished by the mini aerosol sampler the present invention which can operate at airflow rates of 10-15 Lpm or more. Thus the inventive sampler can detect very low concentrations of aerosol with a unit that can be worn, e.g., on a lapel of the user, unobtrusively for extended periods.","In another embodiment, a plurality of impactors and collection layers can be arranged sequentially forming a cascade impactor. Such cascade impactors are used to determine the particle size distribution of aerosols. The particle size cut-off for each successive impactor is a smaller size than the preceding impactor and thus the preceding impactor acts as a pre-classifier to the succeeding impactor. A typical sequence of cut-offs in such a cascade impactor is 10\u03bc, 2.5\u03bc and 1\u03bc.","Several commercial applications of the mini aerosol sampler of the invention are seen including:","Sensors for air pollution monitoring or monitoring of air quality, particularly for combustion and factory by-products.","Sensors for allergy confirmation for directly measuring the allergens the patient has been exposed to, instead of diagnoses by injecting patients with a matrix of allergens.","Sensors for personal sampling of respirable particulate matter as used in such fields as industrial hygiene, occupational health, and indoor air quality monitoring, including both residential and industrial monitoring.","Sensors for detecting chemical agents on particulates and bio-aerosol pathogens.","Sensors for detecting respirable radon decay products."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will become more apparent from the following detailed specification and drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
