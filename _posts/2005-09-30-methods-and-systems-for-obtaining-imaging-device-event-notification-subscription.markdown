Imaging devices often take the form of a multi-function peripheral device (MFP) that combines the functions of two or more of the traditionally separated imaging devices. An MFP may combine any number of imaging devices, but typically comprises the functions of a printer, scanner, copier and fax machine.","Some imaging devices may contain computing resources for data storage and processing such as processors, hard disk drives, memory and other devices. As imaging devices add more features and functions, they become more costly and complex.","More complex imaging devices and MFPs may comprise network connectivity to provide communication with other computing devices, such as personal computers, other imaging devices, network servers and other apparatus. This connectivity allows the imaging device to utilize off-board resources that are available on a connected network.","Imaging devices typically have a user input panel with an array of buttons, knobs and other user input devices. Some devices also have a display panel, which can be for display only or can be a touch panel display that enables user input directly on the display.","Devices with touch panel displays or displays with buttons arranged in cooperation with the display can display menu data that may be selected by user input. This menu data is typically driven by an on-board server module within the imaging device.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise systems, methods and devices for interacting with a remote computing device from an imaging device. These embodiments comprise remote computing devices configured to communicate with imaging devices, imaging devices configured to communicate with remote computing devices and systems comprising various combinations of remote computing devices in communication with imaging devices.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for imaging device event notification.","The foregoing and other objectives, features, and advantages of the invention will be more readily understood upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. The figures listed above are expressly incorporated as part of this detailed description.","It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the methods and systems of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the invention but it is merely representative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention.","Elements of embodiments of the present invention may be embodied in hardware, firmware and\/or software. While exemplary embodiments revealed herein may only describe one of these forms, it is to be understood that one skilled in the art would be able to effectuate these elements in any of these forms while resting within the scope of the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise interfaces and architecture that integrate imaging devices with remote computing device applications and environments to provide solutions that may not be possible solely with an imaging device alone. Some embodiments comprise an infrastructure and set of interfaces that allow applications on a network to programmatically control imaging device functions and interact with a user through an imaging device input panel. Software functions that are not practical within the imaging device can be performed on the server but are accessible from the imaging device.","For the purposes of this specification and claims, an imaging device (IDev) may be described as a device that performs an imaging function. Imaging functions comprise scanning, printing, copying, image transmission (sending and receiving), image conversion and other functions. Exemplary imaging devices comprise printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, computing devices that transmit, convert or process images and other devices. An IDev may also perform multiple imaging functions. For example, and not by way of limitation, a multi-function peripheral device (MFP), which typically has the capability to perform a plurality of functions comprising a printer, scanner, copier and\/or a facsimile machine or image transmitter\/receiver, is a type of imaging device. Other MFP imaging devices may comprise other combinations of functions and still qualify as an IDev.","For the purposes of this specification and claims, a remote computing device (RCD) is a device capable of processing data and communicating with other devices through a communications link. An RCD is a remote device because it requires a communications link, such as a network connection, a telephone line, a serial cable or some other wired or wireless link to communicate with other devices such as an imaging device. Some exemplary RCDs are network servers, networked computers and other processing and storage devices that have communications links.","Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . These embodiments comprise an imaging device (IDev)  that may be a multi-function peripheral device (MFP) or a single function device. The imaging device  further comprises a user interface (UI) panel , which may comprise input buttons  and a display device  or may comprise a touch panel system with or without buttons . User input and display may also be performed through a separate UI device , which may be connected to the imaging device  by a communication link , such as a USB connection, a network cable, a wireless connection or some other communications link. UI device  may comprise an input device, such as a keyboard or buttons as well as a display device, which may also be a touch screen panel. UI device  may also comprise an interface for transfer of instructions that are input to the device  from a remote input device. This form of UI device  may comprise memory sticks, USB memory cards and other storage devices that may be configured to store input for transfer to an imaging device.","These embodiments further comprise a remote computing device (RCD)  that is linked to the imaging device  via a communications link , such as a network connection. This network connection may be a typical wired connection or a wireless link.","Embodiments of the present invention may provide menu data from the RCD  to the imaging device UI pane  or remote pane  via the network connection . Once this menu data is fed to the imaging device , an UI pane ,  on the imaging device  may be used to interact with applications that run on the remote computing device . User input received from UI panels ,  may be returned directly to the remote computing device .","A Web Service is a software application identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), whose interfaces and binding are capable of being defined, described and discovered by Extensible Markup Language (XML) artifacts and supports direct interactions with other software applications using XML based messages via Internet-based protocols.","An application on the remote computing device  may use one or more Web Services to control various features in the imaging device , such as enabling, disabling or setting device values or controlling device functions.","Embodiments of the present invention allow network applications running on remote computing devices to interact with the user of the imaging device through the imaging device I\/O panel. These embodiments allow imaging device user interface (UI) control (i.e., touch panel, button\/display) by applications. Some embodiments may also integrate custom display screens or menus with the native imaging device UI. Embodiments may hand off control of imaging device functions between standard operation modes performed on the imaging device in response to user input to an imaging device UI and open systems modes that utilize network resources, such as applications on RCDs, through user input at the imaging device UI.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise network-based applications that have full control over the imaging device UI to display text and graphics in any format. In these embodiments, the application can programmatically display buttons, textboxes, graphics, etc. in any layout desired.","In some embodiments, the UI layout is easy to program using a standard language, such as a markup language. These languages comprise Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Wireless Markup Language (WML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) and other languages.","In some embodiments of the present invention a remote computing device application or server application is able to request a keyboard UI to be displayed on the imaging device display , . In some embodiments, this functionality is available on the imaging device and does not need to be recreated by remote computing device applications. In some embodiments, the remote computing device may define the keyboard prompt and default values. These embodiments may comprise a remote computing device that is able to rename imaging device UI buttons, such as the OK and Cancel buttons as well as define additional buttons.","In some embodiments, menu templates may be served to the imaging device UI by the imaging device itself  or from a remote computing device .","External Authorization Application","Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise a remote computing device application that is registered as the External Authorization server. The External Authorization application may control access to the imaging device and may have top-level control of the UI. UI control may be given to this application in the same manner that control is given to an internal auditor.","In these embodiments, when an imaging device system boots, it checks to see if an External Authorization application is registered. If so, the imaging device is placed in disabled mode and the application is contacted to take control of the UI. If the External Authorization server is not available, an error message may be displayed and the device may remain disabled. The imaging device may periodically try to contact the External Authorization server until it is available. Table 1 below describes what entity has control of the UI, in an exemplary embodiment, when the device is in a disabled state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"UI Control in Disabled State"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Indicator"]},{"entry":["Button Press","UI Control","Lights"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Device boots","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Document Filing","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Image Send","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Copy","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Job Status","Device - standard Job Status screens","Job Status"]},{"entry":["Custom Settings","Device - standard Custom Settings","N\/A"]},{"entry":[{},"screens"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["OS Mode","Not available when device is disabled"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"In embodiments of the present invention, access to the custom UI panels of imaging devices may vary from application to application. Some solutions, such as Document Management integration, may wish to leverage the native Image Send screens, but display some custom UI's to gather additional information about a scan job. Other solutions, like custom printing applications, may be accessed from a separate mode than the native functions.","In order to accommodate the diversified needs of these solutions applications, embodiments may support multiple integration points for UI control. These integration points are based on a user action (\u201ctrigger\u201d) for which applications may register. In some embodiments, applications may be registered with target devices so that the device knows that when \u201ctrigger A\u201d occurs on the front panel to contact \u201cremote computing device B\u201d for instructions. In exemplary embodiments, applications may be integrated with an imaging device at any of several \u201ctrigger\u201d points.","Remote computing devices may be registered to a specific function and contacted when that function's hardware key is pressed (e.g. Image Send) on the imaging device UI. Any UI information provided by the remote computing device may be displayed instead of the standard function screens native to the imaging device. This trigger may be used for applications that wish to replace the existing functions with completely custom UI's, such as an alternative scan solution or a specialized display, such as a \u201cSection 508\u201d compatible screen or other specialized-need interface that may have large buttons or other accommodations.","In some embodiments, each function on the imaging device may have a menu on the touch screen that remote computing devices, such as servers, can register. This enables solutions applications to provide custom content and still use some of the standard functionality provided by the imaging device. When a button assigned to a custom application is selected, a menu will be displayed with the solutions registered to that function. Users may select the desired solution and the remote computing device will be contacted for instructions.","In some embodiments, a stand-alone RCD mode that provides remote computing device application access can be accessed from the job queue portion of the UI that is displayed on every screen. This trigger point may be used for applications that do not fit within one of the standard device functions, such as custom printing solutions on an imaging device. When the RCD menu is selected, a menu will be displayed with the solutions applications registered to the generic RCD mode. Users will select the desired solution and the remote computing device will be contacted for instructions.","Hardware Key Interaction","In some embodiments of the present invention, when an imaging device is enabled, additional hardware keys may be used to manage the device.

Some embodiments also comprise an auto clear setting that can be configured for a given period of time, such as 10 to 240 seconds (or disabled). In these embodiments, when there is no activity for the time configured in auto clear, the device may automatically return to disabled mode and attempt to contact a remote computing device to retake control of the UI.","Error & Jam Notifications","Depending on a particular solution, a remote computing device application may have full or only partial control of the imaging device UI and a particular imaging job. In some embodiments, partial control may include cases where a remote computing device is monitoring clicks, but native modes are responsible for the UI interaction and controlling the job. Partial control may also include cases where the remote computing device application is integrated with a native mode (UI trigger=function custom menu). In these embodiments, the imaging device may handle all error and jam notifications with only a notification sent to the relevant remote computing device application.","For some embodiments, in cases where the remote computing device application has full control over the UI and the job, error and jam notifications may be handled differently depending on the type of error. For recoverable errors, a notification may be sent to the remote computing device application and the application may be responsible for displaying messages and resolving the error. For non-recoverable errors, the imaging device and RCD mode may interact to gracefully handle the error condition (e.g. provide user with instructions for clearing jam).","Control Handoffs","In some embodiments, at different points throughout an imaging job, several applications may need control over an imaging device including, but not limited to, an External Authorization application, a standard RCD application, an imaging device native mode and other applications. The following section describes, for an exemplary embodiment, the various steps in an exemplary job, the entities that may have control during each step, and what type of control may be allowed.","Step 1: User provides credentials to access the device at the device UI. This step may be controlled by a remote computing device, such as an External Authorization application or by Internal Accounting (native mode) in the imaging device itself. At the end of this step, the device is enabled. The External Authorization application may also specify default parameters or disable specific job parameters (e.g. default file format is PDF, but user may change; color mode is set to B\/W and user may not change).","Step 2: User sets parameters for the job using one of the native imaging device modes or a standard RCD application. At the end of this step the user makes an input to initiate the job. When the input is made, an optional notification may be sent to the standard RCD application, which can then change job parameters if desired. An e-mail application is one example of an application that may request notification when the user input is made. A user may use native Image Send screens or other input to select scan options and choose e-mail recipients. A user may then select a custom application button and choose the scan-to-e-mail option from the menu. The e-mail application may then display custom screens for the user to set permissions for the file. Once a user places the original document(s) on the scanner and initiates the process, the e-mail application may capture the destination parameters set by the user and change the target destination to the e-mail application FTP server. The e-mail application may then receive the file, apply the appropriate permissions, and send to the e-mail recipients selected by the user. A remote computing device application may also want to retake control of the UI at this point, if, as in some embodiments, the application generates thumbnails of the scanned images and displays them to the user for verification.","Step 3: Once the job is initiated, the imaging device is responsible for scanning or RIPing the job and spooling it to the HDD. If the imaging device is configured to authorize jobs with an external authorization application, it may send a click report to the application and wait for instructions. The external authorization application may enable the job for sending\/printing, cancel the job, or change job parameters (and then enable). As an example, a rules-based printing application may wish to change job parameters after it receives a click report. Some rules-based printing applications support rules-based printing and scanning that can limit what each user is allowed to do based on the time of day, the destination, or many other parameters. For example, only users in the marketing group may be able to scan high-quality color images. If a user from another group selects color and 600 dpi, a rules-based application may change the parameters to color and 200 dpi. At the end of this step the job should either be authorized or canceled.","Step 4: In some embodiments, this may be an optional step, where the standard RCD application in step 2 may have specified the destination as a HDD for temporary storage. This step may also be used, in some embodiments, by a Java application running on the imaging device. For example, a government office may have a custom encryption application running on the device that takes the scanned document, encrypts it, and then requests the imaging device to send it to the target destination selected by the user in step 2. In some embodiments, it may be beneficial to send a notification to the external authorization application after this step\u2014because the imaging device does not know how long the file will be on the HDD or what the application is going to do with it\u2014and after the send\/print step.","Step 5: In the final step, the file is actually output. In typical embodiments, the file is either sent over the network or printed locally. At the end of this step, a notification that the job was successfully completed should be sent to the external authorization application and optionally, to the standard RCD application.","Device Control and Management API's","The API's may be used to allow a remote computing device application to control access to an imaging device for vend applications and to manage the device from a remote location.","Device Control and Vend API","In some embodiments of the present invention, a Device Control and Vend API allows applications to enable and disable access to the device and track click counts. The Device Control and Vend API may provide an RCD with the following controls:","Enable\/disable device of function\u2014this may allow an RCD to enable or disable access to the device as a whole or by function to enforce individual user privileges.

In embodiments of the present invention that provide some security measures, the following exemplary items are security concerns that may be addressed by the remote computing device interface.","Access to remote computing device interfaces may be limited to valid applications. Embodiments provide extensive access and control of the imaging device, which poses a significant security risk. The interface of these embodiments may be protected from access by attackers, while maintaining ease of setup and use for valid solutions.","Confidential data (user credentials and job data) may be protected during network transfer. User credentials and job data may be secured during network transfer to ensure that it cannot be stolen, an intruder cannot monitor device activity, and a man-in-the-middle attack cannot change messages. Imaging devices may support Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and other connections to ensure data is safe while being communicated between the imaging device and remote computing device applications.","Administrators may have the ability to lock-down imaging device access. For users with strict security policies, administrators may have the ability to disable access by remote computing devices or limit access to specific applications. Administrators may have an option to register the limited applications that they wish to access the imaging device interfaces.","Remote computing device applications may ensure the imaging device is not being \u201cspoofed.\u201d The remote computing device may be able to authenticate an imaging device that it is contract with it to ensure an intruder cannot imitate the imaging device to collect network configuration and password information, monitor file\/folder structures of a document management system, or spoof security settings and DSK status of the imaging device.","A remote computing device may ensure that the server is not being \u201cspoofed.\u201d The imaging device must be able to authenticate all remote computing devices that it is in contact with to ensure that an intruder is not spoofing the remote computing device's IP address. By pretending to be the remote computing device, an intruder could steal user credentials, redirect scanned documents, change device settings or firmware, or bring down the access control system (either to provide access to unauthorized users or initiate a denial of service attack for valid users).","Access control\/vend applications may not be compromised when a remote computing device is unavailable. When the remote computing device is unavailable, it may not be acceptable to provide open access to the device. If the remote computing device is unavailable at startup or becomes unavailable at anytime (e.g. someone disconnects network cable), the imaging device may immediately be disabled and an error message displayed.","An administrator may be able to adjust a security level based on company and application requirements. Security requirements can have a large impact on the time it takes to develop a remote computing device application and the resources required to implement the solution. Users using some embodiments may range from a small business with one imaging device, no IT staff, and a simple scan or print application to a large government office using access control and audit trails to track all device activity. The security measures used to protect imaging device interfaces may be adjustable by the administrator to match the target environment.","The imaging device and remote computing device applications may be able to hand-off user credentials. Users may be prompted to login at multiple points throughout a job. For example, an access control application or accounting application may control total device access, the imaging device may have user authentication enabled for Image Send, and a document management application may require user login before showing a folder list. In many environments, all of these applications will use a common user database. In some embodiments, it is, therefore, desirable for the applications to pass user credentials to each other, so that each one does not have to repeat the authentication process.","Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to .

These notification methods and systems may be used for error reporting and other purposes. Applications may receive these notifications by subscribing to a notification application on an IDev. The IDev may then notify an application when a specific event occurs on the IDev or an associated device.","In some embodiments, subscribing to an event may comprise making a call to an IDev Web Service and identifying an event for which notification is desired. In some embodiments, an application may, additionally, subscribe to an event within the context of a single job or globally (for all jobs). In some exemplary embodiments, an application may expose a web service of its own through which the IDev may send notifications.","In some embodiments, receiving an event notification may comprise implementing a web service through which to receive event notifications. In some embodiments, a web service or another application may be used to subscribe to an event notification process. A web service or another application may also be used to process event data when an event occurs. In some embodiments, an event method may be called any time an event occurs. An event method may also be job-specific wherein it only sends a notification message during a specific job. In some embodiments, an \u201ceventdata\u201d parameter may be used. The eventdata parameter may comprise a structure containing event specific data, such as a job identifier, user credentials, and\/or other data.","In some exemplary embodiments, an application may subscribe to an error notification process that is triggered by an error of some type in the IDev system. In some of these embodiments, this may be described as an ON_SYSTEM_ERROR event. An error condition may be triggered by several factors. In some exemplary embodiments, an error condition may be triggered by an \u201cout of paper\u201d condition which has stopped a print process, or, in the case of a scan job, a \u201cdocument not found\u201d condition in the input tray.","In some exemplary embodiments, which comprise a web service, an event trigger may comprise application-provided configuration data that is syntactically and semantically valid in terms of the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) and overall rules, but is still not valid. For example, a user may configure a fax operation and specify a fax number which is not a valid phone number.","In some embodiments of the present invention, an application or device that wants information relating to IDev activity may request from the IDev a list of events for which the IDev is capable of sending notifications. These events may be related to native functions and\/or applications or may be related to remote applications, which are in communication with the IDev. In some embodiments, a subscribing application may use a SOAP method GetServiceEventElements to obtain a list of event elements for which an IDev notification application is capable of sending notifications. Once the list of available notification events is known, a subscribing application may request a subscription to an event on the list. An IDev notification application may then record the notification request in a notification record and notify the subscribing application if the event occurs.","Some embodiments of the present invention comprise processes that may be implemented as Web Service methods. Some of these processes are referred to by specific names that are used in exemplary embodiments. These names may be related in a syntax using the name followed by a closed set of parentheses (i.e., Event( ), CreateJob( ), Authenticate( )). A description of an exemplary embodiment comprising these methods and their functions and attributes is found in Appendix A.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a notification application may be based on a subscription model, where local or network applications that wish to receive notifications may subscribe in advance to events with a given IDev. In some embodiments, an IDev may implement a subscribers list and manage it. This may be done through a web service. In these embodiments, event notifications may be messages that may be sent to subscribing applications when certain conditions take place on the IDev.","In some embodiments, a purpose of the event notification process may be to allow remote clients to receive information about events that take place on the IDev or an associated device during execution of a specific job. In these embodiments, a job-specific subscription may be requested for which notification only occurs while the specific job is executing. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an IDev notification application may send a Hello( ) SOAP request to a registered application of External Authority (subscribing application) each time a new application is registered with the IDev or each time an application is removed from the list on a given IDev, such as an MFP.","Embodiments may comprise events that an application has subscribed to being associated with a specific job ticket. These \u201cper job ticket\u201dsubscriptions may remain valid for the lifespan of the job ticket. When a particular job ticket instance expires, the subscription associated with it may also expire. This type of subscription may be used by a standard user application. By subscribing to an event on a per-job-ticket basis, the subscriber may be notified about the event within the context of the client's job. Subscription to a per-job-ticket event will expire when the job ticket expires. A per-job-ticket subscription embodiment is a sub-set of the broader job-specific subscription embodiments.","Some embodiments of the present invention may define a notification mechanism to be used for notifying a subscribing application about eligible events that take place on the IDev or an associated application or device. In some embodiments, a notification mechanism may be specified by the subscribing application when a notification request is made or at some time before the actual notification occurs.","Some embodiments of the present invention comprise access control in which a notification application requires credential authentication prior to granting a notification subscription. In these embodiments, a notification request may comprise a user credential or may be followed up with a user credential to authenticate the user. The notification application may process the credential or send it to a remote authentication application for processing. Only when the credential is successfully authenticated will the subscription request be granted. In some embodiments, only certain types of subscription request may require access control and credential authentication. For example, a global subscription request (for all jobs on an IDev) may require authentication while a job-specific subscription request may not require authentication.","In some exemplary embodiments of the present invention, an IDev notification application may run under a secure access mode. In this mode a request from a subscribing application may contain a SOAP header comprising a security element of type SECURITY_SOAPHEADER_TYPE. This element may contain user or account credentials. In some exemplary embodiments the request may comprise some or all of the following XML or SOAP elements:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0222"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u20331.0\u2033 encoding=\u2033utf-8\u2033?>"},{"entry":"<S:Envelope xmlns:S=\u2033http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/12\/soap-envelope\u2033>"},{"entry":"<S:Header>"},{"entry":"<Security>"},{"entry":"<Credentials>"},{"entry":"<account-id>adent<\/account-id>"},{"entry":"<metadata>"},{"entry":"<password>42isgood<\/password>"},{"entry":"<\/metadata>"},{"entry":"<\/Credentials>"},{"entry":"<\/Security>"},{"entry":"<\/S:Header>"},{"entry":"<S:Body>"},{"entry":"<EnableDevice generic=\u201d1.0\u201d xmlns=\u201durn:schemas-sc-jp:mfp:osa-1-1\u201d>"},{"entry":"<acl>"},{"entry":"<mfp-features groupld=\u20331234\u2033>"},{"entry":"<user-info>"},{"entry":"<account-id>fprefect<\/account-id>"},{"entry":"<\/user-info>"},{"entry":"<mfp-feature xsi:type=\u2033MFP_FEATURE_SCAN_TYPE\u2033 allow-use=\u2033on\u2033\/>"},{"entry":"<mfp-feature xsi:type=\u2033MFP_FEATURE_COPY_TYPE\u2033 allow-use=\u2033on\u2033\/>"},{"entry":"<mfp-feature xsi:type=\u2033MFP_FEATURE_PRINT_TYPE\u2033 allow-use=\u2033on\u2033\/>"},{"entry":"<mfp-feature xsi:type=\u2033MFP_FEATURE_FAX_TYPE\u2033 allow-use=\u2033on\u2033\/>"},{"entry":"<mfp-feature xsi:type=\u2033MFP_FEATURE_DOCFILING_TYPE\u2033 allow-use=\u2033on\u2033\/>"},{"entry":"<mfp-feature xsi:type=\u2033MFP_FEATURE_CUSTOM_SETTINGS_TYPE\u2033 allow-use=\u2033off\u2033\/>"},{"entry":"<mfp-feature xsi:type=\u2033MFP_FEATURE_ADMIN_TYPE\u2033 allow-use=\u2033off\u2033\/>"},{"entry":"<\/mfp-features>"},{"entry":"<\/acl>"},{"entry":"<\/EnableDevice>"},{"entry":"<\/S:Body>"},{"entry":"<\/S:Envelope>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0223"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u20331.0\u2033 encoding=\u2033utf-8\u2033?>"},{"entry":"<S:Envelope xmlns:S=\u2033http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/12\/soap-envelope\u2033>"},{"entry":"<S:Body>"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<EnableDeviceResponse generic=\u201d1.0\u201d"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"xmlns=\u201durn:schemas-sc-jp:mfp:osa-1-1\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"<\/S:Body>"},{"entry":"<\/S:Envelope>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In some embodiments of the present invention, account credentials may be provided which may contain information about the user and application, such as the user login name and password.

The IDev may implement the client side of this method, while the application may implement the server side.","In some embodiments, applications with administrator level credentials or other qualifications may be allowed to subscribe to events on a global basis, e.g. without a need to provide a job ticket at time of subscription. This type of subscription may never expire. In these embodiments, events may be fired when a particular condition takes place on the IDev. This type of global subscription may be used by applications such as an accounting application or an external authority application that may subscribe once to certain types of events and may receive notification from the IDev when an actual condition takes place for any job or job ticket executing on the IDev. In these embodiments, subscription to an event may never expire. In some exemplary embodiments, the best time to subscribe to an event on a global basis may be at the time the application discovers an enabled IDev device on the network.","In some embodiments of the present invention, an IDev may be configured to operate under the supervision of an \u201cExternal Authority\u201d application that may have been assigned an exclusive decision-making role. An \u201cExternal Authority\u201d application may monitor or control the processes on the IDev. As such, it may provide system enable or disable decision-making. When an IDev runs under the control of such an application, the IDev features may remain disabled until enabled by the External Authority. The enable signal may come from such an External Authority application when the user account credentials have been positively validated. This type of application may also provide access control features to the IDev and may enable or disable specific features of the IDev based on the credentials submitted. The IDev may be configured to run under the control of only one External Authority application. If configured to operate with an External Authority, the IDev may only execute jobs submitted by that External Authority application or that have been authorized by that External Authority.","In some embodiments of the present invention, an IDev may be configured to operate either as an uncontrolled native IDev, that is, with no \u201cexternal authority,\u201d or to operate under the control of an \u201cexternal authority.\u201d When an IDev operates as an uncontrolled native machine, all of its features may be enabled by default. On the other hand, when an IDev is configured to operate under the control of an External Authority, all of the features may be disabled by default. The External Authority application may then enable specific IDev features based on the user provided credentials.","In some exemplary embodiments, An IDev may provide a configuration page for registering an application that can be accessed only by administrators. An administrator may configure the external authority application to implement at a minimum the following methods of the MFPCoreWS interface: the server side of the Hello( ) method, the server side of the Authenticate( ) method, the server side of the Authorize( ) method, and the client side of the EnableDevice( ) method. An administrator may also configure the external authority application to implement: the client side of the Subscribe( ) method, the server side of the Evento method, and if the external authority application needs to control the operation panel, the client side of the ShowScreen( ) and ShowScreen( ) requests.","In some exemplary embodiments of the present invention, remote applications may subscribe\/unsubscribe to\/from event notifications by sending a Subscribe SOAP request message to the IDev. The \u201caction\u201d parameter in this SOAP request defines the action. If the value of the \u201caction\u201d parameter evaluates to \u201ctrue\u201d then the meaning of this SOAP request is to subscribe to a particular event, otherwise it is an unsubscribe request. In some exemplary embodiments, a remote application may subscribe to an event by sending a Subscribe( ) SOAP request with the action field set to true. To un-subscribe from an event notification, a remote application may send the Subscribe( ) SOAP request again with the action field set to false.","In other embodiments of the present invention, applications, such as an accounting service may subscribe to certain events of interest on a global basis, without specifying a job ticket. By doing so, the overall application interaction with the IDev service may be simplified.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the lifetime of a subscription entry may depend on several factors. The most basic case is when the subscription record is removed from the subscriber list via a specific user request to un-subscribe, as shown earlier. If a subscription request to an event has been made on a per-job basis, then the subscription may expire automatically when the job object itself ceases to exist.","In an exemplary embodiment, a web service method, such as the MFPCoreWS framework, may remove any references in the subscriber's database when a job has been cancelled. If a subscription request to an event has been made on a global basis, the subscription record may never expire. The MFPCoreWS framework will not remove it from the subscriber's database. The only way to remove it from the list may be to specifically request removal of this record to the application that initially subscribed to a given event. Records in the subscriber's database may not be persistent. In this case, when the device powers down all subscription records may be lost and no notifications of that fact will be sent to the original subscribers.","In some embodiments of the present invention an IDev may send event notifications to subscribing applications. These event notifications may comprise notifications triggered by events related to IDev functions, IDev applications and remote applications. Some exemplary events comprise job creation, the beginning of job execution, the end of job execution, job cancellation, job termination, job abortion, user login, user logout and many other events.","In some exemplary embodiments, the IDev may send a ON_JOB_CREATE event notification when a remote application successfully creates a new job using the CreateJob( ) method. The IDev may send a ON_JOB_EXECUTE event when a remote application issues a ExecuteJob( ) request and the job begins executing successfully on the IDev. The IDev may send a ON_JOB_CANCEL event when a remote application issues a CancelJob( ) request. The IDev may send a ON_JOB_CLOSE event when a remote application issues a CloseJob( ) request and the job begins executing successfully on the IDev. The IDev may send a ON_JOB_ABORT event to registered applications when the user terminates a job from the IDV operation panel using the Job Status mode. The IDev may send an ON_JOB_STARTED event to a subscribing application when an operation panel initiated job begins executing on the IDev. The IDev may send an ON_JOB_COMPLETED event when an IDev initiated job stops executing on the IDev for any reason, including successful completion of a job or an error condition that caused the job to stop.","This ON_JOB_COMPLETED event may provides registered subscribers with the reason this job stopped, such as successful completion or an error condition. In addition, the ON_JOB_COMPLETED event may contain job configuration information and the JobResults data structure to provide the IDev resource use details of this job. The IDev may send an ON_USER_LOGOUT event to subscribing applications when a user logs out from the IDev at the operation panel. The sequence that the user executes to log out from the IDev may be specific to the IDev itself. The actual action that causes the user log-out event may be device specific, and as such, is of no concern to the monitoring application. In any case, when the monitoring application receives the ON_USER_LOGOUT event it means that the currently logged-on user session with the IDev has terminated. The IDev may generate this event type when the user executes the log-out sequence on the IDev operation panel or when the session times out. This may be the IDev automatic logout when the user has abandoned the machine.","In some embodiments, an IDev may send a notification when a specific IDev hardware key is pressed. The IDev may send an ON_HKEY_PRESSED event notification to subscribers when a hardware key is pressed. In some embodiments, this may occur when one of the keys of type E_MFP_KEY_ID_TYPE has been pressed by the user on the IDev. This event may be triggered by pressing the KEY_COPY, KEY_IMGSND, KEY_PRINT, KEY_FAX, KEY_DOC_FILING, KEY_JOB_STATUS, KEY_CLEAR_ALL, KEY_SPECIAL_FUNCTIONS, KEY_CUSTOM_SETTINGS, or KEY_PROGRAM keys. The IDev may send an ON_SYSTEM_READY event to subscribing applications when an IDev system component becomes ready for operation. The IDev may also send an ON_SYSTEM_ERROR event to subscribing applications when an internal system error occurs on the IDev such as a paper jam, the IDev is out of paper, and so on. The application may then acquire more specific information about the problem by issuing a GetDeviceStatus( ) request.","In other embodiments of the present invention, an event notification may comprise some information when sent to a subscriber. The information attached to the event notification may be provided by the MFPCoreWS framework inside an <event-data\/>element. This element may have two parts, of which one part may include a Header segment. In some embodiments, the information in this segment may not be event-type specific and may be provided in all event types. In an exemplary embodiment, this segment may contain the following information: account information, which is represented via the <user-info\/>element and the device information that is represented via the <device-info\/>element. These elements may be represented in the following format: <user-info>, <account-id>bplewnia<\/account-id>, <\/user-info><device-info uuid=\u201cSNOF21F359-AB84- 36D 110E6D2F9MNAR-650\u201d >, <serial-number >0F21F359-AB84-36D 110 E6D2F9<\/serial-number>, <modelname>AR-650<\/modelname>, <location>DS Engineering Dept-Japan<\/location>, <mac_address>90: EF:0F:21:2A:36<\/mac_address>, <network_address>1.2.3.4<\/network_address> and <\/device-info>.","Some embodiments of the present invention may include elements with a second event specific segment. In these embodiments the content of this segment may be event type and job-type specific. The information in this segment may be contained within the <details\/> element.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the notification message may be delivered to a subscribing application in more than one way using a variety of mechanisms. In some embodiments, the following transport mechanisms for event message delivery may be used: SOAP, using a notification method, such as the Event( ) method; E-MAIL, where the body of the message will be the notification; HTTP-GET, HTTP_POST, using the HTTP POST mechanism to deliver the event data to subscribers; and RAW 2.0 protocol, a Sharp notification mechanism. An application may designate the event delivery mechanism at the time of subscription.","Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . In these embodiments, an imaging device (IDev)  comprises a user interface , which is capable of receiving user input and displaying data to a user. The user interface  will typically comprise a display, often in the form of a touch panel. The display may be used to display data to a user.

In some embodiments, a database  may be linked to the imaging device  and\/or an RCD , . In some embodiments, an RCD or database  may be connected to an IDev  over a wide area network such as the internet .","Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . These embodiments may comprise a subscribing application , such as an accounting application, which is capable of requesting and receiving a global or job-specific event notification subscription. A subscribing application may be an External Authority Application, which has special privileges and access to restricted notification resources. In some embodiments, the External Authority Application may have access to global notifications that are not job-specific. An External Authority Application may need to submit credentials for authentication before receiving restricted notifications.","Some embodiments may further comprise other remote subscribing applications A & B which may request event notification subscriptions from an imaging device (IDev)  event notification application . These applications A & B may only have access to unrestricted notifications. The external authority application, remote applications and IDev notification application may communicate with each other through means of a network  using SOAP methods or other methods. The external authority application and remote applications may also designate an event notification transport mechanism  which may be used for sending and receiving event notifications and related data. Typical event notification transport mechanisms comprise HTTP Post, e-mail, SOAP messages and other mechanisms.","Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . In these embodiments, a subscribing application may send  a subscription request to an IDev notification application. A subscription request may comprise a subscribing application address and an event type. In some embodiments, a subscription request may also comprise user or application credentials and other data. The IDev notification application may then receive  the subscription request from the subscribing application and record  the subscribing application ID and event identification in a subscription record. The IDev notification application may then configure itself  to notify the subscribing application identified in the subscription request when the event identified in the subscription request occurs.","In further embodiments of the present invention, as illustrated in , a job-specific subscription may be implemented. In these embodiments, a subscribing application may send  a subscription request comprising a subscribing application address, an event type and a job ID to an IDev notification application.

In these embodiments, a subscribing application may send  a simple subscription request to an IDev notification application. The IDev notification application may receive  the simple subscription request and request an event type from the subscribing application. The subscribing application may then send  an event type to the notification application. Upon receiving the event type, the notification application may request  a job ID from the subscribing application. The subscribing application may then supply  a job ID to the notification application. Once the notification application has the subscription request, the event type and the job ID, the notification application may con to send a notification to the subscribing application when the event identified by the event type occurs during the execution of the job identified by the job ID.","Some embodiments of the present invention, illustrated in , comprise an event notification subscription using a specified notification delivery mechanism. In these embodiments, a subscribing application may send  a subscription request with a subscribing application address, an event type and a specified delivery mechanism to an IDev notification application. The IDev notification application may receive  the subscription request with the subscribing application address, event type and specified delivery mechanism from the subscribing application.

The IDev notification application may then configure itself  to notify the subscribing application at the subscribing application address using the specified delivery mechanism when an event described by the event type occurs. In similar embodiments, the subscription request, subscribing application address and specified delivery mechanism may be exchanged through multiple messages.","Other embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . In these embodiments, a subscribing application, such as an accounting application, may discover  an enabled IDev on the network. The subscribing application may then obtain , from the IDev, a list of reportable events that the IDev is capable of identifying for notification purposes. In some embodiments, a subscribing application may detect these reportable events by means other than a list supplied by the IDev, such as by identifying an IDev and searching an external source for specific IDev data. Reportable events may also be determined through detection of IDev capabilities directly through various protocols.","Once reportable events have been identified, a subscribing application may send  a subscription request to the IDev notification application. This subscription request or a related message may comprise a subscribing application address to which notifications may be sent. The subscription request or a related message may also comprise one or more event types selected from the reportable events obtained from the IDev.

The embodiments comprise a core web service framework (CWSF) . CWSF  may comprise a platform for building, deploying and running a web service on an IDev, such as an MFP. Some may provide a standards-based, multi-language execution environment for building distributed network applications. These applications may control processes executing on the IDev.","In some embodiments, a CWSF  may comprise a hardware interface (HWIF)  connecting to IDev hardware . An HWIF  may shield the CWSF  from particular platform hardware specific details. A standardized HWIF  may allow the CWSF  to communicate with multiple IDev hardware devices  meeting the interface standard.","An HWIF module  may provide hardware abstraction of an IDev that hosts a CWSF . An HWIF module  may comprise a set of device-independent APIs that the CWSF  uses to communicate with actual IDev hardware  components. On the other side, an HWIF module  may implement device specific operation that it uses to control the hardware components of a particular platform. In this way, the HWIF  may shield the CWSF  from actual hardware architecture details.","An HWIF module  may also serve as a source of notifications that the CWSF  receives through a through a status monitoring module (SMM) . These notifications may be passed to the CWSF  via the SMM  by means of callback calls. For example, and not by way of limitation, an HWIF module  may act as a source of a Started Notification Callback, which is posted when a device is about to start executing a job. An HWIF  may also be the source of a Completed Notification Callback, which may be posted when a job is completed. An HWIF  may also be the source of a State Change Notification Callback, which may be posted when a job changes its state. An HWIF  may also be the source of a Page Notification Callback, which may be posted when a page is read in or printed.","In some embodiments, a CWSF  may comprise a System Architecture Layer (SAL)  that is responsible for translating high-level application requests into a sequence of requests specific to a job type at the HWIF  level, thereby hiding the complexity from the application. The SAL  may group together a sequence of atomic operations into high-level functions. A SAL  may provide a logical connection to an HWIF module . A SAL  may also register a set of notification callbacks with the HWIF module . When certain conditions occur while a job executes, the SAL  may receive corresponding notification from an HWIF module . A SAL  may also be the source of event notifications. In some embodiments, a SAL  may perform an On_Job_Started notification and\/or an On_Job_Completed notification.","The architecture of some embodiments of the present invention may be based on the concept of a job. Depending on the actual device capabilities and device architecture, more than one job may be in progress on an IDev at the same time. For example, and not by way of limitation, a user may execute a scan job while another client is submitting a print job. At the same time, another user may be receiving a fax message and an administrator may be performing an administrative job on the device. In embodiments of the present invention, all these jobs may execute at the same time because each job is identified by a unique identity that is represented by a job object.","The mechanism within the CWSF  that controls this dynamic job environment may be referred to as a job queue manager (JQM) . A JQM  may manage jobs processed by the system. These jobs may be represented by job objects related to user processes executing on a device. Each job may be represented by a job identifier (job ID) and be associated with job settings, job results and an access control list (ACL). The ACL may comprise detailed information about access to job information by notification subscribers. A JQM  may manage each job object for its entire lifetime. A JQM  may perform functions such as job object creation, job object destruction, managing job settings, keeping track of security data associated with a job's user, keeping track of job state and status and other functions.","A JQM  may also be the source of an event notification. In some embodiments, a JQM  may be the source of an On_Job_Create notification, and On_Job_Execute notification, an On_Job_Close notification, an On_Job_Cancel notification and other notifications.","A JQM  may maintain a job object database  of jobs currently being executed on an IDev or associated hardware or applications. The job object database  may also comprise an execution journal that persists across device power cycles even when other job information may be lost.","In some embodiments, a CWSF  may also comprise a status monitoring module (SMM) . The SSM may monitor the status of a device or a job executing on a device. An SMM  may monitor changes in device and job states. An SMM  may also register a set of notification callbacks with a HWIF module . An SMM  may inform the JQM  or an NM  about job or device state changes or other notifications. An SMM  may be the source of an On_System_Error notification.","In some embodiments, a CWSF  may comprise a notification module (NM) . An NM  may receive event notifications from many different sources within the CWSF . An NM  may receive signals indicating internal IDev events or receive other notifications of events occurring on IDev hardware , on CWSF  modules, on remote applications  or other events. When a notification is received, an NM may communicate with a JQM  to create an event data message. An NM  may also contact a subscriber manager (SM)  to find out whether there are any subscribers interested in receiving notification of an event. If at least one subscriber is found, the NM  may attempt to deliver event notification data to that subscriber. If a subscriber has identified a specific notification method, the NM  may attempt to deliver the notification using a transport protocol designated by the subscriber during a subscription request or at some other time.","Some embodiments of a CWSF  may also comprise a user interface (UI) processor . A UI processor  may interface with an IDev UI panel . A UI processor  may provide UI content to IDev panel  to prompt for user input or inform a user of a condition on the IDev, a CWSF module or a remote application. A UI processor  may also accept user input from an IDev panel  and relay that input to IDev hardware , a CWSF module or a remote application . A UI processor  may enable remote applications  to display application-specific screens using an industry standard markup language, such as XHTML, to define forms. A UI processor may also be the source of event notifications such as an On_Hkey_Pressed notification, an On_User_Logout notification or another notification.","A CWSF  may also comprise a web service module (WSM) . A WSM  may provide a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface for an IDev. Remote applications  may use a WSM  through a set of SOAP interface methods to control IDev hardware  including an IDev UI panel . A remote application  may also access and\/or report to CWSF  modules through the WSM .","In some embodiments, a CWSF  may comprise a subscriber manager module (SMM) . An SMM  may manage a subscriber database  in which subscriber data is maintained for event subscriptions.","Some embodiments of a CWSF  may also comprise a markup language library, such as an XML library . XML library  may comprise a utility code library. XML library  may provide function for managing XML content. These functions may be used for parsing and\/or generating XML data.","A CWSF  may also comprise an event delivery module (EDM) . An EDM  may deliver even notification messages to subscribers. An EDM  may access subscriber preferences, which may be stored in subscriber database  in some embodiments. This subscriber data may be used to select a transport mechanism for notification delivery.","Some embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in . In these exemplary embodiments, remote applications, such as a security application , a \u201chigher authority\u201d application  or other applications  may connect to an IDev  over a communication link, such as a network . In these embodiments, an MFP Core Web Service (CWS)  may expose a SOAP interface to the external applications -. When a remote client application -, makes a SOAP request to the IDev, the CWS  assumes the responsibility of translating the markup language (e.g., XML) data representation of the request into a binary form that can be processed by the device. The CWS  may also translate any binary data returned to the remote clients into a suitable markup language.","In these exemplary embodiments, a CWS  may also assume the responsibility of verifying and validating the input markup language stream that is received from a remote client -. This data validation may be performed according to the rules expressed in a Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) definition document for the SOAP interface. While a CWS  is processing a client SOAP request, it may also return error information serialized as a SOAP fault message.","When executing in secure mode, a CWS  may assume the responsibility of assuring that a request comes from an authorized source and that the user making the request has sufficient rights to make the request. A CWS  may also perform user session management.","The terms and expressions which have been employed in the forgoing specification are used therein as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding equivalence of the features shown and described or portions thereof, it being recognized that the scope of the invention is defined and limited only by the claims which follow."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 15A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 15B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 31"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
