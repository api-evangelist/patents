title: Apparatus for reducing coking in gas turbine bearings
abstract: The bearings of a gas turbine are supplied with a lubricant from a reservoir by a main pump, when the turbine is operating. When the turbine is shut down and rotation ceases, the main pump also shuts down. When this occurs, an auxiliary pump is placed into operation to continue to supply the bearings with the lubricant until such time as the bearings have sufficiently cooled, at which point the auxiliary pump is shut down.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.","Gas turbines, including those used for propelling military vehicles, include two or more opposed bearings which must be continuously lubricated during gas turbine usage. This is accomplished by means of a lubricating system which provides the bearings with a lubricating fluid, such as natural or synthetic oil, to not only lubricate the bearings but to also provide for cooling.","When the gas turbine is shut down after usage, the residual heat from the turbine (which may be hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit) soaks back to the bearings leading to a possible coking condition. Basically, coking is the result of the lubricant becoming an oxidized solid oil deposit on the bearing surface and in the lubricant delivery system that can lead to insufficient lubricant supply to the bearings. This can result in engine seizure and\/or a requirement for a complete engine overhaul, which is undesirable, particularly in tactical combat situations.","Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide apparatus which reduces, or eliminates coking problems in rotating machinery, particularly, in gas turbines which shut down at high temperatures.","Apparatus in accordance with the present invention reduces coking in turbine bearings, such as gas turbine bearings, and includes a lubricant reservoir and a main pump for delivering the lubricant to the bearings when the turbine is operating. The delivery of lubricant is via respective lubricant supply lines and the return of lubricant to the reservoir is via respective lubricant return lines. An auxiliary pump is provided and is operable to continue the supply of lubricant to the bearings after the turbine and main pump have shut down. A control has an input indicative of turbine rotation to turn the auxiliary pump on when turbine rotation has ceased. Temperature sensors are provided to sense lubricant temperature, and these temperature indications are provided to the control which turns off the auxiliary pump when the lubricant temperature has attained a predetermined value.","In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.","In , a rotating gas turbine  is supported by opposed first and second bearings  and , although, more such bearings may be utilized, depending upon turbine size and design.","A lubricating system  is provided in order to supply the bearings with necessary lubrication and cooling during use, and when the gas turbine  shuts down, the lubrication system also shuts down, leading to a possible coking condition, as previously explained. The present invention obviates this problem, and to this end reference is made to , illustrating a preferred embodiment.","A two bearing system is shown by way of illustration and includes first and second bearings positioned in respective bearing housings  and . The apparatus includes the normal lubricant reservoir , and main pump  for supplying the lubricant to the bearings. More particularly, the bearing in housing  is supplied with lubricant from the reservoir  by the path including main pump , fluid line , one-way valve  (the arrow shows fluid flow direction) and fluid line . Lubricant is returned to the reservoir  from housing  via fluid line , for cooling, filtering and recirculation.","In a similar fashion, the bearing in housing  is supplied with lubricant from the reservoir  by the path including main pump , fluid line , one-way valve  and fluid line . Lubricant is returned to the reservoir  from housing  via fluid line , for cooling, filtering and recirculation.","When the gas turbine shuts down, the main pump , which is driven by the turbine through a gearing arrangement, is also shut down. This situation can lead to coking due to the high residual heat encountered by the bearings. Accordingly, the apparatus additionally includes an auxiliary pump  which functions to continuously supply the bearing housings with cooling lubricant after turbine shut down. As opposed to the turbine-driven main pump , the auxiliary pump  is battery operated.","Auxiliary pump , connected to fluid reservoir  by fluid line , supplies lubricant to bearing housing  by the path including fluid line , one-way valve , and fluid line  connecting with fluid line . Return of lubricant from housing  is by the same path  used during turbine usage.","Similarly, auxiliary pump  supplies lubricant to bearing housing  by the path including fluid line , one-way valve , and fluid line  connecting with fluid line . Return of lubricant from housing  is by the same path  used during turbine usage.","Operation of the apparatus may be governed by a control circuit  which is operative to turn on the auxiliary pump  when the gas turbine is shut down and stops rotating. This is accomplished with the provision of rotation sensor  which is coupled to the turbine and provides an output signal to control  when turbine rotation has ceased. Control  turns on auxiliary pump  and maintains it in an on condition to supply cooling lubricant to the bearings.","Once the bearings have cooled down to an acceptable level, the auxiliary pump  may be shut down. In order to accomplish this, the apparatus of  includes first and second temperature sensors  and  connected to measure the temperature, for example, in respective lubricant return lines  and . The temperature sensors provide output signals, indicative of those temperatures, to control  and when the temperature values have reached acceptable levels, control  will shut off auxiliary pump . Thus the arrangement continuously cools the bearings after turbine shut down, to minimize, or prevent coking.","It will be readily seen by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention fulfills the primary object set forth herein. After reading the foregoing specification, one of ordinary skill in the art will be able to effect various changes, substitutions of equivalents and various other aspects of the present invention as broadly disclosed herein. It is therefore intended that the protection granted hereon be limited only by the definition contained in the appended claims and equivalents. Having thus shown and described what is at present considered to be the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it should be noted that the same has been made by way of illustration and not limitation. Accordingly, all modifications, alterations and changes coming within the spirit and scope of the present invention are herein meant to be included."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
