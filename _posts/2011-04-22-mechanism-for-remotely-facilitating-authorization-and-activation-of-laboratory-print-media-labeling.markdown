No. 13\/092687 entitled \u201cMechanism for Labeling Laboratory Print Media\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/092728 entitled \u201cMechanism for Coating Laboratory Media with Photo-Sensitive Material\u201d, which are assigned to the assignee of the present application.","The embodiments of the invention relate generally to media printing and, more specifically, relate to providing a mechanism for remotely facilitating authorization and activation of laboratory print media labeling.","Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) standards dictate that medical or laboratory samples (e.g., histologic specimen, such as microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of plants, animals, and humans) are to be identified and their medical containers (herein referred to as \u201cprint media\u201d, \u201cmedia\u201d, \u201claboratory media\u201d, \u201cmedia containers\u201d, or \u201cmedia supplies\u201d) (e.g., slides, cassettes, test tubes, flasks, etc.) be labeled as soon as a sample enters a medical laboratory in order to identify and track the sample and to reduce any potential errors caused by improper identification of the sample. To address these concerns, special laboratory printers (herein referred to as \u201cprinting devices\u201d or simply as \u201cprinters\u201d) were developed. Laboratory printers are commonly used to print laboratory print media with certain identifying information. Typically, once a print media has been printed with a label, the sample contained on or within the media can be tracked throughout the process within the laboratory. However, due to various laboratory printer-related problems (such as high cost of the printer, and other technology- and non-technology-related limitations), many laboratories offer high cost of printing or, in many cases, are forced to employ hand- or manual-labeling of the media.","To further enhance laboratory efficiency, software applications and systems (e.g., Laboratory Information System (LIS), Laboratory Integration Management Solution or Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), etc.) were developed to be used to reliably identify and track samples as they are introduced into laboratories. LIS refers to a software system that can be used to receive, process, and store information generated by laboratory processes. LIMS refers to a software or database system that is used to integrate laboratory software and instruments, manage laboratory samples, standards, users, etc., in guiding laboratory samples through laboratories based on a set of defined processes or workflows for quality control in testing these samples. Since LIMS can facilitate simultaneous tracking of thousands of samples, there remains the need for accurate identification of each sample and the media that holds it.","For example, problems arise when it is desired that a sample be processed entirely through the LIMS and that the media that contains the sample has a machine-readable label so that the sample's diagnosis time in the laboratory can be improved and reliably tracked. Certain conventional laboratory printers are capable of adding machine-readable labels to media. Although the use of machine-readable labeling may provide some improvement in sample diagnosis time, it can also introduce a new set of problems for laboratories and may not even be capable of being performed in certain laboratories due to, for example, the high cost of adding machine-readable identifiers and\/or the laboratory's inherent limitations (e.g., space limitation). For example, the use of machine-readable labeling may not be employed in most laboratories as the laboratories are being squeezed by lower government budgets and reimbursements and consequently are having to reduce their physical space (that could have been used to hold large printing equipment) in order to allow for more patient capacity. In addition to not having sufficient space for large printers, these laboratories are also becoming averse to high capital costs relating to the existing printer technologies and are looking for ways to reduce costs and be able to pass their operating expenses on to their patients to help improve their bottom line. Further, laboratories are also being driven to reduce their \u201cgreen\u201d footprint by reducing consumables and the power requirements.","There are additional problems associated with the aforementioned conventional laboratory printers. For example, while printer capital acquisition costs are extremely high, these printers also require dedicated computers (e.g., personal computers (PCs)) as printer operators or operating computers to print media labels). Because the conventional printers are not designed like general computing printers and still employ old connectivity technologies, these printers require a computer be dedicated as an operator or operating computer for the sole purpose of printing on a particular type of media. One example of the old connectivity technologies is the 9-Pin Serial interface which has become obsolete on general computing platforms, but it is still being used with these conventional laboratory printers and is, at least partially, responsible for extremely slow printing outputs. Further, as aforementioned, these conventional printers are limited to printing only a single type of media (e.g., a cassette or a slide, but not both). This limitation further complicates the laboratory space limitation situation as it requires laboratories to have multiple printers along with multiple corresponding dedicated operating computers for printing on multiple media types, such as requiring one printer and its corresponding operating computer for printing on cassettes and another printer and its corresponding operating computer for printing on slides. As the deprecated operating systems and components of the host computers age, the costs of the systems continually escalate.","Current laboratory printing technologies for conventional laboratory printers include ink-jet and ribbon printers. One problem with the laboratory ink-jet printers is that they require using a special ink that is ultraviolet (UV) sensitive that can be cured so that any chemicals used in the sample diagnosis process do not accidently remove the printed label from the media. However, each time a UV light bulb (that is required to cure the special ink) goes out (typically, without a warning), it carries the potential to contaminate hundreds of samples and render them unable to be tracked in the LIMS, by way of the uncured UV sensitive ink. Ribbon printers require that a user correctly and cautiously load a ribbon into a ribbon printer without damaging or wasting too much of the ribbon. Further, instead of pre-loading laboratory media into ribbon printers for automatic printing, a user is required to load the media and continue watching the printer ribbon to be sure that the ribbon does not run to the end and stop all media printing processes.","Conventional printers are high in cost, restricted in their ability to print media (such as limited to printing only one particular type of media), limited in their ways of tracking and identifying samples, wasteful in terms of power and physical footprint and in requiring a dedicated operating computer, employ obsolete connectivity technologies, are error-prone, etc.","Embodiments of the invention that provide a mechanism for remotely facilitating labeling laboratory print media are described. In accordance with the embodiments, there are provided methods, apparatus, and systems for remotely facilitating labeling laboratory print media, such as a method of embodiments of the invention includes placing a user request at a computing system serving as a remote computing system. The user request includes print content to remotely facilitate labeling of a laboratory media within a laboratory environment. The laboratory media may include at least one of a media cassette or a media slide to hold one or more laboratory samples. The method may further include communicating the user request from the computing system to a printing device over a network, the printing device representing a local computing system. The method may further include remotely facilitating the printing device to label the laboratory media.","Embodiments of the invention that provide a mechanism for remotely facilitating labeling of laboratory print media are described. A method of embodiments of the invention may include placing a user request at a computing system serving as a remote computing system, with the user request including print content to remotely facilitate labeling of a laboratory media within a laboratory environment. The laboratory media may include at least one of a media cassette or a media slide to hold one or more laboratory samples. The method may further include communicating the user request from the computing system to a printing device over a network, the printing device representing a local computing system. The method may further include remotely facilitating the printing device to label the laboratory media.","Embodiments of the present invention provide for a mechanism for remotely facilitating a print mechanism (e.g., a laser-based printing mechanism having a printer engine) to allow for printing or labeling or imaging of a laboratory print media (e.g., laboratory print media containers, such as cassettes, slides, etc.) that serve as containers for laboratory samples (e.g., histologic specimen, such as microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of plants, animals, and humans). As the requirements and subsequent costs in healthcare continue to grow, the value and use of laboratory printers continue to increase and drive laboratories and doctors to seek additional or alternative ways to improve their revenue streams and improve profitability. One way of increasing revenue is to reduce cost, such as to print only when necessary and only pay for printing needs as demanded by the workloads necessary (e.g., pay-as-you-go, pay-as-needed, etc.). In one embodiment, a remote print authentication mechanism may receive, process, compile, and communicate the necessary information or data for remotely facilitating printing of laboratory media, allowing the users to take advantage of remote computing devices for customized, low-cost, on-demand, and pay-as-you-go printing of laboratory print media. Since technology and printing needs may vary between various users or software applications, such needs may also vary regarding what information is to be printed, how the information is to be handled, how much information needs be processed and printed, how quickly and efficiently the information may be printed, and the like.","In one embodiment, the print authentication mechanism may be employed on a host printing device or computing system (e.g., server printing\/computing system) that employs any number or types of print mechanisms (e.g., laser-based printer, ink-jet printer, ribbon printer, etc.), while a print activation mechanism may be employed on a remote computing system (e.g., remote client computing device, such as a mobile computing device) to access and use the print authentication mechanism on the host printing device to remotely, from the remote computing system, facilitate printing of laboratory print media. In another embodiment, the print authentication mechanism may be employed on a remote computing device, while the print activation mechanism may be employed on the host printing device. In yet another embodiment, the print authentication mechanism and the print activation mechanism may be employed on two separate remote computing systems, while the host printing device may employ one or more print mechanisms that can be accessed and facilitated to print laboratory print media using the print authentication and print activation mechanisms. In yet another embodiment, any combination and number of components and modules of the print authentication and activation mechanisms (as will be described with reference to , A) may be employed on any number and type of computing devices, as desired or necessitated, to allow users to remotely facilitate printing or labeling of laboratory media. Throughout this documents, terms \u201cfacilitating remote printing\u201d and \u201cremotely facilitating printing\u201d are used interchangeably and synonymously.","Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention are provided for identifying specimen samples and their media within a laboratory environment by providing a mechanism for remotely facilitating printing of labels or images on multiple types of media (as opposed to printing a single media type that is a common limitation of the conventional media-printing techniques). In one embodiment, the mechanism may also provide laser-based media labeling (or printing or imaging) that is free of ink, ribbons, and various other conventional laboratory and printer consumables; although, as mentioned throughout this document, embodiments of the invention are applicable to and work with any type or number of printing mechanisms, including ink-jet printers, ribbon printers, etc. Further, embodiments of the present invention provide for media labeling that is faster, more efficient, Eco-Green, and more technologically-mature than the conventional media labeling.","In one embodiment, an integrated system having a printer or printing device having a printer engine is provided for labeling laboratory media at the time the samples contained within them are used or introduced to a laboratory. This labeling of the media includes producing an image on the media such that the image includes a relevant human- and machine-readable image having information (e.g., media-related information, sample-related information, user-related information, etc.) that can be used to identify and track various samples contained within the media during the samples' processing within the laboratory environment. For example, if a laser-based print mechanism is chosen by the user, a media image may be produced by remotely facilitating inducing a visible color change on the media using a laser on the laser-sensitive material on the dedicated surface (e.g., a portion of the print media dedicated to imaging) of the media. For example, and in one embodiment, the print engine provides and manages a laser light source, such as a laser, to generate a laser light beam, a moving reflective device (e.g., mirror), and a fixed media surface coated with light-sensitive material. The light beam may be adapted to activate the light-sensitive labeling layer on the media to produce visible change on the media surface from translucent to opaque to form an image on the print media.","Further, for example, a method, apparatus or system may be provided to include a laboratory print media (e.g., medical slide, histology cassette, etc.) labeling mechanism to move a print media coated with a special laser- or light- or photo- or thermal-sensitive material, sealed from external chemical reactions using a chemical-resistance material coating to print a label or image on the print media at a pre-determined print location of a printer using a light source (e.g., a laser) of the printer to temporarily or permanently imprint or display the image or data by activating the laser-sensitive material on the print media. The mechanism may further include moving the print media from the pre-determined print location to the eject location of the printer for human or robotic retrieval. The printer may include a laser focused on the angle of the print media such that the printing remains directly focused to the coating or the dedicated label surface of the print media. Further, the printed data or image or label is entirely encapsulated within the laser-sensitive material and sealed onto the dedicated label surface of the print media so that the image is proof against accidental removal or damage during subsequent handling or treatment of the laboratory media. The media is then transported onto an eject location of the printing device or apparatus. Further, the printing medium contains a laser-sensitive ink that is sealed in an immiscible coating agent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["100","130","130","100","140","150","160","140","100","150","140","150","100","140","150","160","100","140","150"]},"Printer  serves as a host printing device that includes a base computing\/printing platform  employing hardware and\/or software. Throughout the document, terms \u201cprinter\u201d and \u201cprinting device\u201d are used synonymously and interchangeably. Base platform  includes an operating system  serving as an interface between any hardware or physical resources of the printer  and a user (e.g., an end-user, such as a laboratory technician or assistant, using the printer  to label laboratory media). In some embodiments, the base platform  may further include a processor , memory devices , network devices, printer and other drivers, or the like.

Further, the remote computing system  and the printing device  may be in communication over a network (e.g., Internet) and that a user may access the activation mechanism  on-line using an user Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d or \u201cinterface\u201d) provided through the activation mechanism . For example, the user may access the activation mechanism  using a Web browser (e.g., Chrome\u00ae, Explorer\u00ae, Safari\u00ae, etc.) and\/or through a Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based software application employed on the remote computing system .","In one embodiment, the authentication mechanism  includes, but is not limited to, a communication module , an authentication module , a processing module , a print facilitator , and a compilation module . Similarly, the activation mechanism  contains its own set of components and modules, such as, but not limited to, an analyzer , a selector , and a transmitter . For example, at the remote computing system , a user inputs a set of information using the activation mechanism , such as via a Web browser or a GUI-based application, to remotely order printing of laboratory print media. This information may include the user's choice of a printer, such as the printer , a print mechanism, such as the print mechanism , a number and type of print media (e.g., two cassettes, five slides, etc.) to be printed with an image, content (e.g., specimen name, date of extraction, patient name, user name, etc.) of the image to be printed on the print media, a preferred time or schedule of printing (e.g., print the two cassettes now, but print the five slides according to a set printing schedule, such as one each hour, etc.), or the like. Further, the user may select or, in some cases, even propose a cost of printing or simply use the pay-as-you-go option to take advantage of the lowest cost printing option of all the options available to keep within or at least near the printing budget afforded by the user (e.g., doctor, professor, laboratory technician, etc.) or the user's organization (e.g., hospital, university, another laboratory, etc.).","The information provided by the user is then analyzed by the analyzer . For example, the analyzer  may review the users' printing requests (e.g., preferred printer, time of printing, cost, etc.) and match with any available historical data, e.g., as provided by a storage medium (e.g., database  or another database or storage medium in communication with the remote computing system ), to determine whether the user's requests can be met. If, for example, one or more requests cannot be satisfied (e.g., the user's preferred printer is not available), the analyzer  may propose a response with one or more alternatives (e.g., other available printers similar in type or performance to the one requested by the user), if available, to the user so that the user may choose an alternative option. Once the analyzer  has analyzed the user information, this analyzed user information is then forwarded on to a selector .","The selector , in one embodiment, sorts the various user selections (e.g., requested printer, preferred print mechanism, image to be printed, print media on which the image is to be printed, laboratory location, suggested\/accepted cost, etc.) into a user request so that it can be properly communicated to the print authentication mechanism . In the illustrated embodiment, printer  serves as one or more printers of choice of the user. In other words, the user may choose only a single printer  or several printers including the printer . Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the authentication mechanism  is employed on the printer , but, as previously mentioned, the authentication mechanism  may be employed on any number of printing\/computing devices, including the remote computing device .","The user request is then transmitted to the authentication mechanism , via the transmitter  at the activation mechanism  and a communication module  at the authentication mechanism . An authentication module  of the authentication mechanism  is then used to authenticate and authorize the user request and its aforementioned contents as well as authorize and authenticate some other information that may be contained in or associated with the user request, such as the user profile, the activation mechanism  accessed by the user, the remote computing system  from where the user request was received, the network (e.g., an Intranet) or server (e.g., Web server) over which the request was received, etc. Once the authentication is performed by the authentication module , the user request is forwarded on to a processing module . The processing module  may perform further analysis (e.g., in addition to the analysis performed by the analyzer  at the activation mechanism ) to re-verify user preferences and requests contained within the user request by, for example, matching the content with any available relevant information (e.g., the current printing costs, historic user requests, user print request pattern, etc.) stored at the database .","The processing module  then forwards the processed user request on to a print facilitator  that communicates with or facilitates the print mechanism  to start printing the laboratory print media per the user request. Once the printing is performed, a compilation module  then compiles any number of reports (or datasets) based on the user request and its performance. These reports are then stored at the database  to be accessed and referenced in the future by, for example, the user, the analyzer , the processing module , etc. For example, a report may include a list of user requests, a historical perspective of user requests, a history of printing costs paid by the user, etc. As aforementioned, embodiments of the present invention can work with and are applicable to any number and types of print mechanisms; however, in the illustrated embodiment, as an example and for brevity, simplicity and ease of understanding, a laser-based print mechanism  having a print engine  is used to be shown as preferred by the user.","In one embodiment, the authentication and activation mechanisms ,  may be employed on the same machine, such as the remote computing system . Similarly, in another embodiment, the authentication mechanism  may be employed on the remote computing system , while the activation mechanism  may be employed on another computing system, including the printer . Depending on the employment of the authentication and activation mechanisms ,  on various computing systems, the distribution and\/or employment of their components and modules -, - may also change, including adding or removing or changing one or more modules -, -, as necessitated or desired. For example, the activation mechanism  may include some of the modules - of the authentication mechanism  and vice versa. Further, one or both of the activation and authentication mechanisms ,  be provided as one or more independent or standalone printing software applications and\/or as an upgrade or update to one or more existing printing software applications (e.g., LIS-based software application, etc.), or the like, employed on one or more of the printer , the remote computing system , and\/or one or more other computing\/printing systems, etc.","In one embodiment, the printer engine  is used for identifying laboratory samples (e.g., histology specimen, etc.) and their media containers by providing laser-based labeling of various types of laboratory print media (e.g., cassettes, slides, test tubes, flasks, etc.) that serve as the media containers for the samples. As will be further described with reference to , in one embodiment, printer engine  includes various components and modules of its own, such as, but is not limited to, a communication controller , a printer controller , a laser controller , a laser beam mirror controller , a media load and eject controller , and light source, such as a laser . It is contemplated that the printer engine  may include or be in communication with other computing and printing components, such as processors, memory devices, display devices, drivers, graphics cards, and the like, of its own printer  or other computing systems , to facilitate computing and printing functions and provide the desired capability and connectivity within a laboratory environment.","Further, the printer engine  provides a laser-based imaging of print media that is faster (e.g., prints through parallelization of the printing process), technologically-advanced (e.g., employs laser-based labeling (which is without the use of ink or ribbon) and modern communication and connection capabilities, etc.), more efficient (e.g., low power use, small physical footprint, laser-based printing that stays intact and can be easily tracked throughout laboratory sample processing), relatively inexpensive to purchase, maintain and operate compared to the conventional laboratory printers, and the like.","In one embodiment, the printer engine  facilitates producing laser-based images on the surface of any type of print media such that a laser beam is sufficiently articulated across the entire surface of the media to form an image to be printed on a particular portion of the media surface that is referenced as the dedicated labeling surface and used to a label or image. In the illustrated embodiment, the printer engine  may be facilitated, using the authentication and activation mechanisms , , to receive the user request from the remote computing device , through, for example, the print facilitator , to direct the loading of the user-requested print media, form the requested image on that print media, eject the print media, and communicate any resulting information back to the compilation module  to compile a relevant report to be transmitted back to the user via the computing system . In one embodiment, a user (e.g., an end-user, such as a laboratory technician) may choose to interact directly with the printer  (e.g., using a touch panel of the printer ). For example, the user may choose a direct interaction with the printer  by selecting, for example, a print media option (e.g., label cassette, label slide, etc.) on the touch panel of the printer .","Now referring to , it illustrates the print engine  and its print functionalities according to one embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the user request is received at the print engine  from the print facilitator  of the authentication mechanism . For example and more specifically, a printer controller  of the print engine  receives the user request, via a communication controller , and then forwards, via a media controller bus , the user request to a media load and eject controller  to load the relevant print media (e.g., cassette or slide) into the printer's print staging area that serves as a dedicated area (e.g., slot, tube, hopper, flatbed, etc.) of the printer  to be used to load, hold, and eject a print media. For example, depending on the user's choice of media, one or more cassettes or slides may be loaded into the print staging area by a human being (e.g., a laboratory technician) or machine, such as a robot. Further, an already-loaded media that is being held in the print staging area may be selected for processing as triggered by the media load and eject controller  upon receiving the user request. Any image and\/or media (\u201cimage\/media\u201d) information specific to the print media that is being printed may be provided by the user in the user request, retrieved from the database , and\/or obtained from a storage medium in communication with the remote computing device , or the like. The image\/media information may include any range of data about the media (e.g., the type of media, etc.) that is being labeled and the image (e.g., project name, sample identification, sample type, etc.) that is being printed on the media as well as relevant information about the user (e.g., user name, user title, etc.) and the laboratory (e.g., laboratory name, location, etc.) that are involved in the processing of samples, and the like.","Printer controller  of the print engine  may then send the image\/media information to a laser controller  which then instructs lighting or image device, such as a laser  about when to turn on and off as the laser  is moved across the media surface by reflecting off of, for example, a laser beam mirror being controlled by the laser beam mirror controller . Laser controller  may communicate the instructions to the laser via a laser beam mirror controller  and further via a laser controller bus . Simultaneously, the printer controller  may send the image\/media information of the user request to instruct the laser beam mirror controller  regarding where or which way to move as the laser  is pulsed via the laser controller  so that an image may be printed or \u201clased\u201d onto the dedicated media surface of the print media.","Once the laser beam has been moved and pulsed on and off by the laser  across the entire surface of the media, the image is determined to be created. Once the image has been created, the printer controller  instructs the laser controller  to turn off the laser . Simultaneously, the printer controller  may instruct the laser beam mirror controller  to return to its default or home position so that the laser  can be reset for the next media that is chosen for labeling and loaded into the print staging area. The printer controller  then instructs the media load and eject controller  to eject the current, already processed, media from the print staging area of the printer .","In one embodiment, a laser beam emitted from the laser  may be positioned on the surface of the media using a laser beam positioner that is controlled by the laser beam mirror controller  and may be presented, for example, in the form of a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) mirror. In another embodiment, galvanic actuated mirrors or rotating polygon mirrors may be used to perform the desired functionality. Further, the laser controller  may include an array of functionalities of the laser beam or the laser beam mirror positioner which may be controlled by software to emulate the functionality of printing the image on the media.","Furthermore, in one embodiment, various printing instructions may be loaded into the printer controller  from a suitable printer communications device connected to an external data source, such as the database , via an external communication device interface provided by the communication controller . The on-board printer controller  controls how these external communications devices, including the remote computing system  and the database , are accessed via external communication device interfaces provided by the communication controller  to pass data from these external sources to the printer controller  to control the laser controller  and the aforementioned media printing tasks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","300"]},"Method  begins at block  by having a user (e.g., a laboratory technician, a research assistant, a doctor, a professor, etc.) access a first computing system to facilitate remote printing of laboratory print media. The first computing system may include a client computing device (e.g., a mobile computing device) that employs any combination of a print activation mechanism and\/or a remote print authentication mechanism. The combination refers to various modules and components of the authentication and activation mechanisms (as described with reference to ) that may be provided or downloaded as part of one or more new or updated printing software applications. At block , the user places a user print request for facilitating remote printing. The user request may specify types and number of print media (e.g., cassettes, slides, etc.) that the uses wishes to print using any type and number of printing mechanisms (e.g., laser printing, ink-jet printing, ribbon printing, etc.). The user request may also include other essential information, such as the printing cost the user has authorized (e.g., based on the pay-as-you-go technique), user's preferred method of payment (e.g., credit card, bank account, electronic checks, payment organizations, such as PayPal\u00ae, etc.), content of the image(s) to be printed on the print media, timing of printing (e.g., print immediately, print at a specified future time, print periodically, etc.), and the like.","At block , the user request is analyzed. The user request analysis include reviewing and analyzing the information contained within the user request, as mentioned above. For example, based on the printing mechanisms specified by the user, the process of analyzing seeks the requested printing mechanisms and may respond back to the user (e.g., the requested printing mechanisms found, one or more of the requested printing mechanisms not found, the requested printing mechanisms found but the cost of printing has gone up or down for one or more of the requested printing mechanisms, etc.). The response back (e.g., an analysis report) may allow the user to alter the user request, as desired or necessitated.","At block , the user request is then communicated, over a network, to a second computing system to facilitate printing according to the user request. The second computing system may include one or more computing systems (serving as server\/host or intermediary computing systems) in communication with one or more printing devices having the requested print mechanisms. The second computing system may include one or more printing devices employing the requested print mechanisms. Further, like the first computing system, the second computing system(s) may employ any combination of the activation and authentication mechanisms, where, as aforementioned, the combination refers to various modules and components of the authentication and activation mechanisms and may be provided or downloaded as part of one or more new or updated printing software applications.","At block , the user request is processed at the second computing system.
