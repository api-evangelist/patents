{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","This disclosure relates generally to the field of munitions. More particularly, it pertains to an apparatus and method for loading burster tubes such as the M54 A1 Burster tubes.","Burster tubes are structures that contain an energetic mix and are placed into projectiles that produce\u2014for example\u2014smoke upon detonation. The proper loading of a burster tube is of critical importance to their successful deployment and use.","Such an advance in the art is made according to an aspect of the present disclosure directed to structures and methods for loading burster tubes such as may be used\u2014for example\u2014in 155 mm projectiles.","Viewed from a first aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a burster tube loading assembly comprising a cooling chamber, a plurality of receiving fixtures each including a weep hole, and a distribution fixture having a heating\/cooling manifold\/chamber for preheating the distribution fixture. When a plurality of unloaded burster tubes are positioned within the cooling chamber\u2014each in a respective receiving fixture, the tubes may be continuously and simultaneously loaded with an energetic mixture via the preheated distribution fixture positioned at a top of the chamber. Advantageously, weep holes positioned within the receiving fixture permit any trapped air to escape during loading thereby ensuring a uniform load. Finally, ports disposed along the sides of the cooling chamber permit the selective cooling\/solidification of the energetic mixture after loading portions of the burster tubes thereby ensuring a uniform, solid mix.","Viewed from another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for loading burster tubes. According to this aspect, unloaded burster tubes are positioned within a cooling chamber having a plurality of receiving fixtures with weep holes. A distribution fixture is positioned on a top portion of the cooling chamber such that it is in simultaneous fluid communication with the plurality burster tubes. A liquefied energetic mixture\u2014which may be a polymeric suspension\u2014is flowed onto the distribution fixture from which it is delivered simultaneously and continuously to each of the burster tubes. As the tubes fill with the liquefied mix, any air trapped within the tubes is vented via the weep holes. Depending upon the mix and its properties, coolant may be circulated within the cooling chamber such that the energetic mix is selectively cooled and solidified at various levels of the tubes. In this manner, a uniform solid energetic mix is formed within each of the burster tubes.","The following merely illustrates the principles of the disclosure. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the disclosure and are included within its spirit and scope.","Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.","Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the disclosure, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently-known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure.","Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative structures embodying the principles of the disclosure.","With reference now to , there is shown a schematic cutaway diagram of an exemplary burster tube loading assembly  according to an aspect of the present disclosure. As shown a burster tube loading assembly  according to the present disclosure generally includes a distribution fixture  positioned upon a cooling vessel  which in turn is situated upon base . A number of burster tubes  are shown positioned between\u2014and in fluid communication with\u2014the distribution fixture  and receiving fixtures  positioned upon and generally secured to the base .","As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate and understand, burster tubes  such as those shown in , are tubular structures which contain an energetic material (i.e., pyrotechnic or explosive) . Such burster tubes are generally positioned within a projectile (not shown) and may\u2014for example\u2014produce smoke or other desired pyrotechnic or explosive effect upon detonation\/impact of the projectile.","While not specifically shown in the figure\u2014and in no way limiting to the present disclosure\u2014the energetic mixture may comprise the known composition B-5 which comprises 63% RDX, 34% TNT, 1% Glyceride, and 2% liquid urethane. As may be appreciated by those skilled in the art, completely filling the burster tube  with a mixture  such as B-5 is extremely difficult since a suspension is formed and this suspension tends to separate during loading into the tube . Additionally, since such energetic mixtures are polymeric, they cure\/solidify and therefore it is necessary that the rate\/amount of solidification be controlled such that burster tubes exhibiting desirable fill characteristics are produced. Particularly problematic with prior art methods is the entrapment of air within the solidified energetic mix .","As those skilled in the art will further appreciate, structures and methods according to the present disclosure permit the filling of burster tubes (for example, the ones shown in ) with most any liquefied mixture whose compositional characteristics are to be preserved during and after loading.","With continued reference to , it may be understood that when a number of burster tubes  are positioned within the burster tube loading assembly  and a liquid energetic mix is poured or otherwise continuously deposited upon the top of the distribution fixture , the energetic mix will be continuously and simultaneously distributed via distribution channels  formed within\/upon the distribution fixture  through funnel-shaped conduits  and into the burster tubes . In a preferred embodiment, a displacement cylinder  may be positioned within the cooling cylinder  such that a lesser amount of coolant may be employed.","Shown further in that  is a detailed view of the receiving fixtures  which are fixed to the bottom  of the loading assembly  and which receive an end of the burster tube . As shown in this detailed view, the burster tube  is inserted into the receiving fixture . In a preferred embodiment, the receiving fixture  may be fabricated from Teflon or other suitable material.","When burster tubes are positioned in the loading assembly, the bottoms fit snugly over portions of the receiving fixtures . Each fixture has a weep hole  that allows any air trapped by the inflowing energetic mix to escape before the energetic mix solidifies. As may be readily understood, this helps to prevent large cavities from forming at the base of the filled burster tubes.","Shown further in  are number ports , , and  through the side of the cooling vessel  through which are circulated a coolant. Upon filling the burster tubes, cooling cycle(s) may be initiated such that the solidification of the energetic mix is controlled. As shown in this , the three ports allow the circulation of coolant (i.e., water) at each of three levels corresponding to the height of the port on the side of the cooling vessel . In this manner, the cooling of the loaded burster tubes may be selectively applied to selected portions of the burster tubes.","At this point those skilled in the art will understand that while we have used the term \u201ccoolant\u201d to describe the material and processes employed during and after loading, our disclosure is not so limited to cooling. For example, particular energetic mixtures may require or benefit from the pre-heating of the burster tube before\/during filling. In such circumstances, the \u201ccoolant\u201d may be heated and circulated within the cooling vessel  thereby pre-heating the burster tubes  prior to their loading. Such an operation may advantageously promote the liquidity of the energetic mix and enhance its flow into the tubes.","Continuing with this discussion of pre-heating, it is noted that the distribution fixture  preferably includes a chamber(s)  through which heated coolant may be circulated via ports , . In this manner, the distribution fixture  may likewise be pre-heated through the effect of the circulation of heated coolant through the chamber such that the energetic mix maintains sufficient liquidity to be distributed to the burster tubes via the distribution channels .","Turning now to  is a schematic diagram showing top and rear views of the burster tube loading assembly  situated on a cart  according to an aspect of the present disclosure. Of particular interest in this , is the top view showing the loading assembly , with distribution fixture situated thereupon  showing the distribution channels  and distribution funnel conduits . As may be readily understood from examination of this , when a liquid energetic material is poured into substantially the center of the distribution fixture , it flows down and outward via distribution channels  into distribution conduits . Not explicitly shown in this , is the fact that the burster tubes are positioned directly below and preferably engaged with the distribution conduits  such that the liquid energetic material flows into the burster tubes without any consequential leaking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","200","111","110","120","121","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["110","100","115","116"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["110","100","113","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["110","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["110","121","114","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["110","121","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["120","130","160","122","124","126","128","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["120","100","122","124","126","128"]},"At this point, while we have discussed and described the burster tube loading assembly it is noted that the assembly may be fabricated from a single or a number of materials as appropriate. For example, in a preferred embodiment stainless steel(s) and\/or aluminum may be employed depending upon the materials and temperatures employed while filling the burster tubes. The receiving fixtures may be fabricated from Teflon or other materials which provide suitable chemical properties.","Operationally, burster tubes are positioned into a respective receiving fixture positioned at the bottom of the cooling chamber. As described previously and shown in the drawing, an individual burster tube is inserted into the receiving fixture and sufficiently sealed such that when the liquefied energetic mix is flowed into the tube, no undesirable leakage occurs. As may be appreciated, when a particularly tight seal is required o-rings or other known sealing structures may be employed within the retaining fixture(s) as necessary. As shown in the figures, a preferred embodiment of the positioning of the receiving fixtures is that they are radially positioned along the bottom of the cooling chamber.","Once the burster tubes are so positioned, the distribution fixtures is secured to the top of the cooling chamber. The distribution fixture includes a number of distribution conduits and these conduits are aligned with and engage the top portion of the burster tubes. In the exemplary embodiments shown and described, there are 18 distribution conduits formed in the distribution fixture although those skilled in the art will appreciate that a greater or lesser number of conduits may be fabricated as desired and\/or required.","Accordingly, a liquefied mix\u2014for example B-5 described previously, is poured or otherwise applied to the top of the distribution fixture where it is distributed via distribution channels to the distribution conduits and into the burster tubes. As noted previously, a pre-heated coolant may be circulated through an inner chamber of the distribution fixture such that it maintains a temperature suitable to maintain a desirable liquid characteristic of the energetic mix.","As the liquid energetic mix flows down into the burster tubes, trapped air is vented through the weep holes such that a uniform mix is loaded into the tubes. As the tubes fill with energetic mix, a coolant may be circulated through the cooling cylinder. By selectively controlling the coolant level through the use of the ports on the side of the cooling cylinder, the height of the cooling liquid (preferably water) may be controlled such that portions of the burster tubes are filled and cooled prior to later (higher) portions. In this manner, a uniform energetic mix is controllably filled and solidified in the burster tubes thereby ensuring uniformity in performance."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete understanding of the present disclosure may be realized by reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
