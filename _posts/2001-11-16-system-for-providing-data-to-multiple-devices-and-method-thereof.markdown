{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to providing data and more particularly to providing data to multiple clients.","The market for wireless communications has achieved tremendous growth. Wireless communications offers the potential of reaching virtually every location on the face of the earth. The use of pagers and cellular phones is now commonplace. Wireless communications is also used in personal and business computing. Wireless communications offers networked devices flexibility unavailable using a physically connected network. Untethered from conventional network connections, network users can move almost without restriction. Medical professionals can obtain patient records, real-time vital signs and other reference data at the patient bedside without relying on paper handling or reams of paper charts. Factory floor workers can access part and process specifications without wired network connections, which may be impractical on the factory floor. Warehouse inventories may be carried out and verified using wireless scanners linked to a main database. Multimedia data may be served to various home entertainment devices within a home without a need to install cabling between all of the various home entertainment devices.","Standards for conducting wireless communications between networked devices, such as in a local area network (LAN), are known. The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) offers a standard for multiple carrier communications over wireless LAN systems, IEEE 802.11. IEEE 802.11 includes standard proposals for wireless LAN architectures. Supported architectures include an ad-hoc LAN architecture in which every communicating device on the network is allowed to directly communicate with every other node. In the ad-hoc LAN architecture, there are no fixed nodes on the network and devices may be brought together to form the network \u201con the fly\u201d. One method of maintaining an ad-hoc network includes defining one device as being a network master with other devices representing network slaves. Another supported architecture is the infrastructure in which the network includes fixed network access points. Mobile devices access the network through the network access points, which may be connected to a wired local network.","IEEE 802.11 also imposes several specifications on parameters of both physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers of the network. The PHY layer handles the transmission of data between network nodes or devices and is limited by IEEE 802.11a to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). IEEE 802.11a utilizes the bandwidth allocated in the 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) band. Using OFDM, lower-speed subcarriers are combined to create a single high-speed channel. IEEE 802.11a defines a total of 12 non-overlapping 20 MHz channels. Each of the channels is divided into 64 subcarriers, each approximately 312.5 KHz wide. The subcarriers are transmitted in parallel. Receiving devices process individual signals of the subcarriers, each individual signal representing a fraction of the total data.","Other standards also exist within IEEE 802.11. For example, IEEE 802.11b limits the PHY layer to either direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), frequency-hopping spread spectrum, or infrared (IR) pulse position modulation. Spread spectrum is a method of transmitting data through radio frequency (RF) communications. Spread spectrum is a means of RF transmission in which the data sequence occupies a bandwidth in excess of the minimum bandwidth necessary to send it. Spectrum spreading is accomplished before transmission through the use of a code that is independent of the data sequence. The same code is used in the receiver (operating in synchronism with a transmitter) to despread the received signal so that an original data sequence may be recovered. In direct sequence spread spectrum modulation, the original data sequence is used to modulate a wide-band code. The wide-band code transforms the narrow band, original data sequence into a noise-like wide-band signal. The wide-band signal then undergoes a form of phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. In frequency-hopping spread spectrum, the spectrum associated with a data-modulated carrier is widened by changing the carrier frequency in a pseudo-random manner.","Devices are linked through data channels. A data channel is a frequency band used for transmitting data. Multiple carriers within a data channel may be utilized for transmitting data. Carriers are specific frequencies used to provide a set of data. Each carrier is assigned a constellation. The constellation is a map including various points identifying particular symbols used for transmitting a particular set of bits. The number of bits assigned to a point indicates a number of bits transferred per symbol received. Different carriers may be assigned unique constellations.","IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11b specify a specific MAC layer technology, carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA). CSMA is a protocol used to avoid signals colliding and canceling each other out. When a device or node on the network receives data to be transmitted, the node first \u201clistens\u201d to ensure no other node is transmitting. If the communications channel is clear, the node transmits the data. Otherwise, the node chooses a random \u201cback-off factor\u201d that determines an amount of time the node must wait until it is allowed to access the communications channel. The node decrements a \u201cback-off\u201d counter during periods in which the communications channel is clear. Once the \u201cback-off\u201d counter reaches zero, the node is allowed to attempt a channel access.","While communications standards, such as IEEE 802.11a, allow a single transmitting device to provide data to multiple receiving devices, the quality of data received by some receiving devices may be degraded. One quality of a signal is commonly measured using the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal at the receiving device. Another metric to measure the quality of received data is the bit error rate (BER). As the signal-to-noise ratio becomes too low for a particular data signal, the BER associated with a receiving device may be too high for the receiving device. The signal-to-noise ratio of a signal can be affected by the distance the signal must travel. A receiving device may be located too far from a data transmitter. A signal-to-noise ratio can be dependent on the power of the transmitted signal, assuming a sufficient signal to noise ratio may be output by the data transmitter. The transmission power associated with a data signal transmitted to a particular receiving device may be too low. A signal may also be degraded due to interference from other data transmitters or other radio frequency (RF) radiators. A receiving device with a low signal to noise ratio may request data at a lower bit rate from the data transmitter. More transmission time on the data channel can become reserved for transmitting data to the receiving device with the low signal to noise ratio. Accordingly, other devices may not be able to access the data channel as needed. Furthermore, a transmission data rate for a particular data channel may be inadequate for a high-bandwidth receiving device. The data channel can be configured to transmit data at a maximum data rate, such as according to IEEE 802.11 standard or due to a maximum data rate acceptable by a particular receiving device. A high-bandwidth receiving device may require a large amount of data; however, due to limitations configured into the data channel, the required amount of data may not be accessible to the high-bandwidth receiving device using the data channel. From the above discussion, it should become apparent that an improved method of transmitting data to multiple devices is needed.","At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides for a method of communicating with a plurality of devices. The method includes transmitting a first set of data on a first data channel to a first device. The method also includes transmitting, concurrently with transmitting the first set of data, a second set of data on a second data channel to a second device. The second data channel is different from the first data channel. The method also includes receiving a third set of data on the second data channel from the first device, and a fourth set of data from the second device.","Another embodiment of the present disclosure provides for a method of controlling a transmission of an acknowledgement in a receiving device. The method includes transmitting a first set of data to a first device and a second set of data to a second device, different from the first device. Properties associated with the second set of data are manipulated to control an acknowledgement from the second device of a receipt of the second set of data. The properties are based on the first set of data. For example, in one embodiment, an amount of data associated with the second set of data is smaller than an amount of data associated with the first set of data. A field value associated with the size of the first set of data is provided with the second set of data to ensure an acknowledgement is returned without interfering with a return receipt associated with the first set of data received by the first device.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating a system for communicating with a plurality of devices is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A transmitting device, data source , provides data to devices on a wireless LAN including devices ,  and . Data source  provides portions of data received through a medium  to a first device  using first channel  and to a second device  and a third device  using a second channel . Data returned by the devices ,  and  is returned using the second channel .","In one embodiment, data source  is a master device of a LAN system and is capable of providing data to other devices over a wireless communications link using a communications standard, such as IEEE 802.11. Data source  can use various frequency bands, such as channels  and , as communication links to devices ,  and . Data source  receives data from an external source (not shown), such as through medium . The external source can include a satellite television provider, a digital television provider, an analog television provider, a digital video disk (DVD) player, or an information handling system. In one embodiment, different sets of data received through medium  are to be provided to particular devices, such as devices ,  and .","Data source  is capable of using different channels, such as channels  and , for transmitting the sets of data to the devices ,  and . A channel, such as first channel , can be configured for providing data to a device, such as first device , which can have different transmission needs than devices  and . For example, in one embodiment, first device  receives a signal with a worst signal-to-noise ratio than devices  and  as first device  can be located farther from the data source  than devices  and . A signal-to-noise ratio associated with a data signal received by the first device  may be too low for the first device  to distinguish data on first channel  with an acceptable bit error rate (BER). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data signal, the data source  can modify power within the first data channel  with or without affecting a power associated with the second channel  and data sent to the devices  and . It should be noted that, depending on a transmission standard, while increasing the power used to transmit the data signals to all the devices ,  and  can raise the average power used above a maximum dictated by specification defined by a regulatory body, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Raising only the power of the data signals sent to some of the devices, such as first device , can allow the average power to be kept within specification. More power can be assigned to channels associated with some devices that need more power and less to channels associated with devices that can reliably receive data using less power. Power can be adjusted for each channel or for each portion of a channel associated with a particular device, such as first device . Power can be adjusted to allow the duration of packets sent on first channel  to match the duration of packets sent on second channel , improving channel throughput.","In operation, a greater amount of data may be required by a particular channel, such as first channel , than assigned to another channel, such as second channel . In one embodiment, second device  and third device  are associated with a particular communications standard, such as IEEE 802.11a. Data source  can configure second channel  to operate within IEEE 802.11a standard specifications to accommodate devices  and . Accordingly, the second channel  is limited to a maximum data rate of 6 megabits per second due to a particular standard and environment. In one embodiment, the first device  requires an amount of data to be sent in a period of time in excess of a time used to transmit data at a data rate requested by the second device  over channel . Therefore, the specifications imposed on the second device  or the third device  may inhibit the first channel  from meeting power or data rate requirements of the first device . The disclosure discusses several options so that data source  can configure communication over the first channel  to meet the needs of the first device  without breaking specifications with the second device  or the third device .","Data source  can alter a data rate associated with a channel by adjusting the number of bits per symbol assigned to the carriers within the channel. Data source  can also adjust a channel coding rate used for data on a particular channel. It should be noted that a transmission time for a particular set of data, or data packet, associated with one channel, such as first channel , may be different than a time to transmit a data packet in another channel, such as second channel . A data packet is the set of data represented by a particular set of symbols being sent to a device. While packets may be sent simultaneously, an extended duration of a packet transmitted on a channel, such as second channel , in comparison to a duration of a packet transmitted on another channel, such as first channel , can inhibit a throughput of first channel . Communication on the first channel  can be restricted and first channel  may not be available due to the extended transmission on second channel . Accordingly, corrective measures may need to be enforced to improve channel throughput, as subsequently discussed in reference to ,  and .","Data source  can include various components, such as data controller  and transceiver , for processing data to devices ,  and . Data controller  can be used to read data received over medium , identify a receiving device, such as devices ,  or , or define data packets. As previously discussed, medium  can include data from a variety of data providers. Medium  includes a particular medium or sets of media used to receive sets of data. Medium  can include electrical cabling, RF bands, and fiber optic cabling. Data received over medium  can be partitioned into different sets of data according to different frequency bands associated with different sets of data, different identifiers attached to different sets of data, different media used to receive the different sets of data. In one embodiment, data controller  identifies the different sets of data received through medium .","Data controller  can also identify different receiving devices, such as first device , second device  or third device , associated with the different sets of data. For example, in one embodiment, first device  is a high definition television (HDTV) receiver associated with HDTV data provided through medium . Second device  can include a standard definition television (SDTV) receiver associated with SDTV data received through medium . Third device  can include an information handling system connected to a network remote or node. In one embodiment, identifiers are provided in data packets sent through first channel  or second channel . For example, a first identifier may be provided in a data packet sent to the first device . The first device  can then include the first identifier in data packets sent back to data source . Accordingly, all packets set and received from first device  may include the same identifier. Similarly, data packets sent and received from the second device  may include a second identifier; and, data packets sent and received from the third device  may include a third identifier. The identifiers may be provided through a header associated with transmitted data packets. In one embodiment, data sent to the first device , using the first channel , represents the same data as data sent to the second device , using the second channel . While the data sent to the first device  may represent the same data as the data sent to the second channel , the data sent to the first device  may be sent at a different data rate. Accordingly, the first channel  may be used to represent the same data as second channel  at a different bit rate, allowing devices to use either the first channel  or the second channel , dependent on a quality of signals received by the devices. For example, devices with a low SNR or high BER may select a data channel, first channel  or second channel , with a lower bits per symbol or a lower bit rate.","Data controller  can assign HDTV data received through medium  to first channel  for first device . Data controller  can assign a portion of HDTV data and streaming multimedia data to the second channel  for second device  and third device , respectively. It should be noted that other forms of data can also be received by data controller , through medium . For example, medium  can include multimedia data from a digital video disk (DVD) player or satellite receiver. Data controller may also be used to select particular programs identified in data received through medium . In one embodiment, devices ,  and  return control data for use by data source , through transceiver , to indicate specific programs or channels to be selected from the data provided through medium .","Transceiver  provides data selected by data controller  to first device , second device  or third device . Transceiver  provides data for first device  on first data channel . Transceiver  provides data for second device  on a second data channel . In one embodiment, the data for each device  and  is mixed with a particular frequency to provide data at a unique channel frequency, such as for first data channel  or second data channel . Both the first data channel  and the second data channel  can be sent through a single transmitter using two separate frequency bands. Alternatively, different transmitters can be used for sending each data channel  and . By allowing data source  to configure particular channels to meet the needs of particular devices within a wireless network, an advantage is realized.","Transceiver  includes an initialization module  and a power module  for configuring properties associated with the channels  and . Initialization module  can be used to identify transmission properties, such as data channel signal to noise ratio, received BER, or signal power to determine properties of data received by devices ,  or . For example, control data analyzed by initialization module  can indicate first device  being forced to drop received data packets. Initialization module  can provide a test data packet to first device  and analyze a response, such as an error check or acknowledgement, sent from first device  using transmitter , to determine a current reliability of first channel . Dependent on identified channel reliability, power module  can be used to alter a coding rate or allocate more or less bits per symbol to carriers within channels  and . The assignment of the coding rate or bits per symbol may be made in response to a signal-to-noise ratio associated with a channel characteristic, such as in first channel , or due to particular carriers that may have a lower signal-to-noise ratio than other carriers, within a same channel. To improve channel reliability, initialization module  can adjust a power used by transceiver  to transmit data across first data channel . In one embodiment, initialization module sends control settings to a power module  to adjust the power. In another embodiment, power module  provides data to signals to data controller . Accordingly, data controller  can send control settings to power module  to adjust a current transmission power.","Power module  can be used to adjust a signal, or transmission, power used to send data on first channel  and second channel . A data rate or code rate associated with data packets sent across the channel can also be adjusted by altering a transmission power used on a particular channel, such as first channel . Accordingly, power module  can adjust transmission power to match a duration of time used to transmit a first packet in the first channel  to a duration of time used to transmit a second packet in the second channel , improving channel throughput.","Adjusted transmission powers may reduce transmission problems associated with particular channels  and  or devices ,  and . For example, first device  may have trouble receiving data as a result of a low signal-to-noise ratio. Initialization module  can assign a higher power to first data channel  to improve the signal to noise ratio on first data channel . Accordingly, initialization module  can provide control signals to power module  to increase the power allocated to the first data channel . Initialization module  may also assign less power to a data channel to improve power efficiency. In one embodiment, first data channel  can be found to have an exceptionally high signal to noise ratio. Initialization module  can reduce the power assigned to first data channel  through power module  if the transmission power is greater than needed. The unused power can be assigned to another data channel or may be used to reduce a total power consumed by the data source . Alternatively, power module  can be used to adjust power to individual carriers assigned within the channels  and . Once transmission powers have been altered, data source  can adjust data rates or coding rates associated with the data channels to match the durations of packets transmitted in parallel. As previously discussed, data controller  can also be used to assign the power adjustment using power module  without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, power module  ensures that assigned transmission powers remain within regulatory specifications, such as FCC requirements.","First device  includes a receiver  for receiving data received via first data channel . Receiver  may include hardware or software for processing transmitted data into data usable by first device . Receiver  can de-modulate data transmitted over first data channel . Receiver  can also perform digital signal processing to retrieve data from first data channel . A handler  associated with first device  can be used to handle system settings, such as data rate control. Handler  can also be used to monitor a quality associated with data received through receiver . For example, handler  can provide a report regarding a number of dropped data bytes, an error check, or an acknowledgement, through transmitter . Transmitter  is used to provide data or acknowledgements back to transceiver , using second data channel .","Second device  includes a receiver  for receiving data from second data channel . Handler  can also monitor a quality of data received through receiver . Handler  can also control a transmission of an acknowledgement through transmitter  over second data channel . Similar to the second device , a third device  includes a receiver  for receiving data from second data channel . The third device also includes a handler  for processing acknowledgements and communications protocols. A transmitter  returns to be transmitted by the third channel  to the data source , over the second channel .","It should be noted that data transmitted by first device , data transmitted by second device  and data transmitted by third device  are transmitted across second data channel . However, in one embodiment, transceiver  may not receive all transmit data simultaneously. In such a case, devices ,  and  employ a \u201clisten before talk\u201d transmission rule, in which transmitters ,  and  must \u201clisten\u201d to second channel  before transmitting back data, such as according to CSMA\/CA protocol. While data source  is presented as providing data to three devices ,  and , it should be appreciated that data source  can communicate with more or less devices without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrating a method of transmitting data to a plurality of devices is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, a data source is configured to provide data to both a first device and a second device. In one embodiment, communication with the second device is performed according to a communication standard, such as IEEE 802.11a, while communications with the first device may or may not be compliant with the same standard. To improve communications with the first device, data is transmitted to the first device on a first data channel separate from a second data channel used to transmit data to the second device. However, data returned by both the first device and the second device is sent back on second data channel.","In the subsequently discussed steps, a data source determines a reliability of transmission on a particular channel according to channel properties and an amount of data being transferred on the channel. The reliability can be determined in consideration to a maximum information capacity associated with the channel. Transmissions over a single data channel can be limited by the amount of data or information capacity that can be reliably transmitted across the single data channel. The information capacity theorem describes a relationship between a maximum amount of data that may be transmitted per unit time or information capacity, \u201cC\u201d of a particular channel, a channel bandwidth, \u201cB\u201d, a system scalar based on a desired BER and a modulation scheme being used, \u201c\u03b7\u201d, and a signal to noise ratio, \u201cSNR\u201d. One representation of the information capacity theorem can express channel capacity in bits per second according to the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["B","bits","per"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"log","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mi":["SNR","\u03b7"]}}}},{"mi":"second","mo":"."}]}}}}},"While it may appear that increasing a bandwidth assigned to a particular data channel linearly increases the information capacity for the data channel, allowing the data channel to transmit more data, a closer inspection reveals this is not correct. The signal to noise ratio, \u201cSNR\u201d, is itself expressed in terms of the bandwidth. The greater the assigned bandwidth, the greater an amount of noise exposed to the data channel. A more appropriate form of the information capacity theorem can be expressed to further show the effect of bandwidth, \u201cB\u201d, transmission power, \u201cP\u201d, and standard thermal noise, \u201cN\u201d. Accordingly, the information capacity theorem can also be expressed as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["B","bits","per"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"log","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":["\u03b7","B"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"0"}}}}}},{"mi":"second","mo":"."}]}}}}},"As shown in the revised expression, the noise and bandwidth begin to degrade the information capacity. The channel capacity represents a number of bits per channel that may be reliably received in consideration of the noise allowed in the channel and the transmission power. For a fixed transmission power, the information capacity does not always match an increase in bandwidth. In fact, as the bandwidth is increased past a certain point, further increases in bandwidth do not provide efficient increases in information capacity. More efficient use of power can realized by assigning power to separate data channels to meet a specific information capacity needed by particular devices.","The data source may determine the reliability of data sent to the first device at a current data rate by calculating the capacity of the first data channel, such as is described using the information capacity theorem. In one embodiment, the data source is capable of sending data to both the first device and the second device using the same data channel. However, the first device is unable to adequately receive data at the same settings used to transmit data to the second device. For example, the first device may require a larger amount of data than the second device. Accordingly, a data rate assigned to the first channel for the first device can be configured higher than the second channel for the second device. A number of bits per symbol may be increased to accommodate for the higher data rate.","As an alternative to calculating reliability, the data source can use empirical methods to determine the reliability of data sent to the first device. For example, the data source can send a set of test data packets to the first device to determine how reliably the first device receives the data. The first device can return acknowledgements or an error check to indicate whether the data was adequately received. The data source can use the tested reliability of the data received by the first device to determine whether a dedicated channel, such as the first data channel, would improve communications with the first device. The data source can also determine whether a dedicated channel would improve information capacity associated with the system. The data source can also use the tested reliability to determine settings adjustments for subsequent communications with the first device. Furthermore, the first device can report channel conditions to the data source. The first device may determine channel conditions, such as a received signal to noise ratio or BER, and transmit the channel conditions to the first device.","In step  of , the data source configures a first data channel for transmissions to the first device. However, before the first device can receive data on the first data channel, the data source may need to inform the first device of a frequency, or set of frequencies, associated with the first data channel. The data source can also configure the first data channel for communicating with the first device. For example, the data source can apply a particular transmission power or data rate for data sent across the first data channel. In step , the data source configures a second data channel for communicating with the second device. As discussed with reference to step , the data source may need to coordinate settings associated with the second data channel with the second device. In one embodiment, the second data channel is configured to operate within a communications standard, such as IEEE 802.11. The second data channel is also configured to receive responses from the first and second device. In one embodiment, the second data channel is configured as a \u201clisten before talk\u201d data channel in which devices check to make sure the channel is not currently being used before transmitting data.","In step , it is determined whether or not to modify packet durations. A time to transmit a set of data to the first device is compared to a time to transmit a set of data to the second device. The differences in time are compared to see if they are significantly different. The difference in transmit times may be compared to a timeout period set for an acknowledgement, as can be identified through a specification or standard associated with the first device. If the transmission times differ, problems may arise due to a limited response time used for acknowledgements, as discussed further in reference to .","In step , if the differences in transmission time are significant, a fix may be necessary to allow transmitted packets to have similar durations. In one embodiment, a field is provided with the data sent to the device receiving less data to indicate a delay time. The device with a smaller transmission time may then wait for an amount of time allocated by the delay time. Additionally, a field could be provided to indicate a larger amount of data is being transferred. The receiving device can be forced to wait before trying to provide an acknowledgement, as described subsequently in reference to . Alternatively, the data associated with the smaller transmission time can be padded with null data to allow the transmission time to be congruent with the transmission time of the other set of data, as discussed subsequently in reference to . Alternatively, the data source can alter the data rates used to transmit the sets of data, as discussed subsequently in reference to . The data source can also delay a transmission of a data packet associated with a lower transmission time to allow the data packet to be fully transferred at substantially the same time as a data packet with a greater transmission time.","Alternatively, it may be desired to have a fix performed using the MAC layer. Accordingly, the MAC layer may be configured to adjust a number of bytes assigned per data packet. If the MAC layer detects a time to transmit a data packet in the first data channel is substantially less than a time to transmit a data packet in the second data channel, such as due to differences in the sizes of the data packets, numbers of bits per symbol or data rates assigned to the first data channel and the second data channel, the MAC layer may add more bytes to the data packet in the first data channel. Other methods of allowing the receiving devices to coordinate transmissions of acknowledgements can be performed without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. It should be noted that the data source can also adjust the time window in which it expects an acknowledgement for a particular set of data, allowing the data to respond late.","In step , the data source transmits data to the first device using the first data channel. In step , the data source transmits data to the second device using the second data channel. It should be noted that the data to the second device sent in step  can be transmitted concurrently with at least a portion of the data sent to the first device in step . In step , the data source receives a first acknowledgement on the second data channel. The first acknowledgment is related to a first receiving device that was able to send its acknowledgement of data received in either step  or step . It should be noted that the first acknowledgement may be from either the first device or the second device, and which device sends the acknowledgement is not pertinent to scope of the present disclosure. In step , a second acknowledgement is received on the second channel. The second channel may be related to another device, other than the originating device of the acknowledgement received in step . In one embodiment, the data source determines the next sets of data to be sent to the first device and the second device and the sizes of the data sets are compared, as in step .","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrating a method of identifying transmission time discrepancies is shown, according to one embodiment of the present invention. As different data channels, such as a first data channel and a second data channel, can be configured to transmit data at different data rates or coding rates as well as data packets of different size, the amount of time used to transmit sets of data in each channel may differ. In one embodiment, to improve channel throughput, a fix can be applied to the data sent to the first and second devices, matching transmission times.","In step , the data source receives a first set of data intended for a first device. In step , the data source determines a time to transmit the first set of data using the first channel. The data source can identify the time to transmit based on several parameters configured for the first channel. For example, an assigned data rate or number of bits per symbol used by the first channel and the size of the first set of data can determine the transmission time associated with the first set of data. In step , the data source receives a second set of data. The second set of data is intended for a second device. In step , the data source determines an estimated transmission time associated with the second set of data using parameters associated with the second channel and the size of the second set of data.","In step , the data source matches the transmission times between the two sets of data using their respective channels, the first channel and the second channel. The transmission time may be matched by altering a power, data rate, or coding rate associated with the first or second channel, as discussed subsequently in reference to . The transmission times may be adjusted by adding null data to the set of data with a lower transmission time, as discussed subsequently in reference to , or by providing a virtual data size, as discussed subsequently in reference to . Alternatively, a MAC layer may be configured to add more bytes to the set of data with the lower transmission time. In step , the data source is free to transmit the first set of data to the first device using the first channel. In step , the data source transmits the second set of data to the second device using the second channel.","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrating a method of handling discrepancy in transmission time by increasing a time to transmit a set of data with a lower transmission time is shown, according to one embodiment of the present invention. As previously discussed, the time to transmit a first set of data may be different from the time to transmit a second set of data. As a device may need to wait until a channel transmitting the set of data with a longer transmission time is done before using another channel. Adjustments may need to be made to allow the sets of data to be transferred with congruent transmission times, improving channel throughput.","In step , the channel with a lower transmission time for a particular set of data is identified. In step , it is determined if the number of bits per symbol assigned to carriers of the identified channel can be reduced. The numbers of bits per symbol assigned to carriers of a data channel indicate a number of bits transferred for every symbol sent. If the bits per symbol are reduced, the data rate associated with the channel decreases. Accordingly, by reducing a number of bits per symbol associated with a channel, the transmission time can be increased to match a transmission time in another channel. However, it may need to be determined if the number of assigned bits per symbol is already too low for particular carriers of the data channel. For example, the currently assigned bits per symbol can represent a lower threshold of a standard associated with a receiving device. The receiving device may also require data to be received at the current rate and reducing the number of bits per symbol can force the receiving device to operate with reduced performance.","In step , if it is determined the assigned bits per symbol may not be reduced. Alternative forms of adjusting the transmission time may be attempted, as discussed subsequently in reference to . In step , if the bits per symbol may be reduced, the bits per symbol assigned to carriers of the channel are reduced. The reduced bits per symbol can be assigned to particular channels or only to particular carriers within the channels, as the bits per symbol may be limited to standard specifications on some carriers. Alternatively, a coding rate assigned to particular data channels can also be reduced to effect a change in packet duration. In step , a power assigned to the channel can be adjusted. As a data rate associated with the channel has been reduced, it may be desirable to lower the power assigned to the channel or to a particular carrier within the channel. The de-allocated power can be reallocated to other channels or conserved to reduce an overall power consumed by the data source  ().","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrating a method of increasing a data rate associated with a channel to reduce discrepancies in transmission power is shown, according to one embodiment of the present invention. As previously discussed, differences in a transmission time to transmit a set of data in a first channel and another set of data in a second channel can cause a free channel to be made unavailable. Accordingly, properties associated with the channel sending the data with the greater transmission time can be altered to allow the different transmission times to be more congruent.","In step , the channel with the data associated with the greater transmission time is identified. The greater transmission time can be determined using the size of the set of data to be transmitted and a data rate associated with the data channel. In step , it is determined if the bits per symbol assigned to carriers of the identified channel can be increased. The data channel can be limited to specifications of a communications standard, such as IEEE 802.11. Accordingly, increasing the assigned bits per symbol associated with the channel may increase a data rate associated with the channel above a specified threshold. A receiving device may also be unable to handle data sent at a higher data rate. Furthermore, a power needed to reliably transmit data at the higher data rate may be unavailable. In step , if the bits per symbol cannot be adjusted, other means of adjusting the transmission time are employed, as discussed subsequently in reference to .","In step , the numbers of bits per symbol configured for the identified channel are increased. The number of bits per symbol can be increased for the identified channel or only particular carriers associated with the identified channel. By increasing the number of bits per symbol, a data rate associated with the channel can be increased. Accordingly, the time to transmit the set of data is reduced to be more congruent with the transmission time of a set of data in another data channel. Alternatively, a coding rate associated with the channel having the greater transmission time may be increased.","In step , it is determined if the transmission power associated with the identified channel is adequate. Higher rate signals are more susceptible to channel noise. As the data rate associated with the data channel has been increased, a higher transmission power may be needed. In step , the power assigned to the channel is increased to allow the set of data to be reliably sent at the higher data rate. In step , the settings to the channel are applied and the channel is free to send the set of data.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating a data rate adjustment to handle transmission time discrepancies between concurrently sent data packets is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A data source sends a first set of data, first data packet  to a first device using a first data channel. The data source sends a second set of data, second data packet , concurrently with the first data packet , to a second device using a second data channel. The second data packet  is of a size X bits long, as indicated by a packet size field  provided with the second data packet . In comparison, the first data packet  is of a size less than X bits long, as indicated by a packet size field  provided with the first data packet . In one embodiment both the first device and the second device provide acknowledgements within a predefined period of time after reception of respective data packets  and . As the number of bits associated with the first data packet  is less than the number of bits associated with the second data packet , precautions may need to be taken to ensure the first data packet  is sent within substantially the same amount of time as the second data packet .","In one embodiment, an amount of time used to transmit the bits of the first data packet  to the first device is extended to match an amount of time required to transfer the bits of the second data packet . In one embodiment, a number of bits associated with each symbol of data in the first data packet  transferred to the first device is decreased, in respect to the number of bits per symbol used to transfer the second data packet . By decreasing the number of bits being transferred per symbol, the amount of time to transfer a data symbol associated with the first data packet  is increased. Accordingly, the amount of time to transfer the first data packet  can be made congruent with the amount of time needed to transfer the second data packet . By forcing the first data packet  to be received in an amount of time congruent with the second data packet , acknowledgements associated with the first data packet  and the second data packet  may be received in time, despite the size of the first data packet  being less than the size of the second data packet . An extended use of a data channel for one receiving device can inhibit access to the data channel for another device to provide an acknowledgment, forcing the transmitting device to resend data. Accordingly, a throughput associated with the first channel can be improved if the data packets  and  are substantially congruent.","In one embodiment, it is desired to align symbol boundaries sent as part of the first data packet  with symbol boundaries sent as part of the second data packet . Interference can be generated due to a transmission of a new symbol within a data channel. By transmitting the first data packet  symbol aligned with the second data packet , interference between the adjacent channels, the first data channel and the second data channel, can be reduced. Accordingly, the number of bits per symbol, or the data rate, used to transfer the first data packet  may be adjusted to allow the symbol boundaries in the first data packet  to align with symbol boundaries in the second data packet . The adjustment can be made to allow the data packets  and  to be symbol aligned at the data source or the receiving devices, the first device and the second device.","Furthermore, the number of bits per symbol assigned to the first data packet  or the second data packet  can be altered to allow the time used to transfer the data packets  and  to be slightly different, ensuring acknowledgements associated with the data packets  and  are not attempted at the same time. Accordingly, by allowing the time used to transfer the data packets  and  to be slightly different, the response time for acknowledgements can be adjusted without requiring a delay to be provided to the receiving devices. A coding rate associated with the data channels may also be modified to change the times used to transmit data packets  and . Alternatively, a number of carriers associated with the first channel can be reduced, as discussed in patent application Ser. No. 09\/999,953, entitled \u201cSYSTEM FOR ALLOCATING DATA IN A COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM AND METHOD THEREOF\u201d and filed on Oct. 31, 2001, herein incorporated by reference.","In one embodiment, the data source reduces an amount of power used to transmit the first set of data  to follow a reduction in the number of bits to transmit per transmitted symbol. As previously discussed, the information capacity theorem can be used to show that an increase in power can support a higher channel capacity. The reverse is also true; a lower channel capacity does not need as high an amount of transmission power. Therefore, to make more efficient use of an available power, the data source or a transceiver associated with the data source, can use a lower power if the number of bits transmitted per symbol or unit time in a particular data channel is decreased. In one embodiment, the number of bits transmitted per symbol and the power allocated to a particular data channel are linked. For example, allocating less power to the first data channel can force a transceiver system to allocate fewer bits per symbol being transmitted in the first data channel. Alternatively, a number of bins, or sub-bands, used in a particular data channel, such as the first data channel, can be decreased to transmit less data bits per unit time.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating data fields to correct for differences in transmission time is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A data source sends a first data packet  to a first device using a first data channel. The data source sends a second data packet  to a second device using a second data channel. The first data packet  and the second data packet  are sent concurrently across their respective data channels. The second data packet  represents a set of data X bits long. In comparison, the first data packet  is smaller than the second data packet .","A virtual size field  is provided with the first data packet  to allow the first device to properly time an acknowledgement once the first device has received the first data packet . The first data channel can be made available after the acknowledgment associated with the first data packet , using the virtual size field . For purposes of discussion, data rates associated with the first and second data channels are assumed to be similar. Accordingly, the first data packet , being of a size less than X bits long takes longer to transmit than the second data packet . It should be appreciated that if the data rate of the first data packet is lower than the data rate of the second data packet , the time to transmit the first data packet can actually be greater than the time to transmit the second data packet.","In one embodiment, the data source supports only one set of data being transmitted over the second data channel at one time. For example, while the second data packet  is being sent across the second data channel, the data source cannot receive any other data on the second data channel, including the acknowledgements from the first and second devices. The first and second devices generally only have a particular time window in which to respond to received data by acknowledgement. After that time has passed, the data source ascertains that the data packet was not received. However, the first device can receive first data packet  before the second data packet  has been fully sent across the second data channel. In one embodiment, the data source, the first device and the second device communicate across the second data channel using a \u201clisten before talk\u201d protocol. Accordingly, the first and second device check to make sure no data is being passed on the second data channel before submitting an acknowledgement on the second data channel. The time for the first device to acknowledge the first data packet  may pass before the second data packet is fully passed.","In one embodiment, packet size fields  and  are provided with data packets  and , respectively. Packet size fields  and  indicate a size of respective data packets  and  in terms of bits, allowing each device to know the total size of a data packet being received. In addition to the packet size field , first data packet  includes a virtual packet size . In one embodiment, virtual packet size  provides a packet size similar to the packet size of the second data packet , as indicated by packet size field . The virtual packet size  provides a packet size that the first device can use for timing an acknowledgement response. For example, the virtual packet size  can include the size of the second data packet , X bits. Accordingly, the first device can wait until a time to receive X bits passes before attempting to submit an acknowledgement, allowing the first data channel to be made available for further data transfer.","Alternatively to making the size of first data packet  appear congruent to the size of second data packet , the virtual size  can provide a size slightly different than second data packet , ensuring devices receiving first data packet  and second data packet  do not attempt acknowledgements at the same time. The virtual packet size  can also indicate the time for the first device to wait before submitting the acknowledgement. Alternatively to attaching fields  and  with respective data packets  and , the data source provides a ready to send (RTS) signal indicating the size fields  and  to the first and the second receiving devices, respectively. Accordingly, the RTS signal can be adapted to further include virtual size  in relation to first data packet .","Alternatively, an acknowledgement associated with the longer data packet, second data packet , can be delayed until after an acknowledgement of first data packet . As previously discussed, virtual size  can be used to delay an attempt made by a receiving device to acknowledge a receipt of first data packet  until after a transmission of the second data packet . A virtual size , associated with the second data packet , may delay an acknowledgement associated with the second data packet  until after the acknowledgement associated with the first data packet  has been sent. Accordingly, the acknowledgement associated with the shorter data packet, first data packet , is sent before the acknowledgement associated with the longer data packet, second data packet . It should be noted that other methods discussed herein may be used to allow the transmitted packets to be only slightly different in size, such as by one or more symbols, allowing the acknowledgements to be delayed due to the slight incongruence in packet lengths instead of due to forcing the receiver to delay its acknowledgement, as previously discussed.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating a data packet padded with null data is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A data source sends a first data packet  using a first data channel. The data source sends a second data packet , concurrently with the first data packet , to a second device using a second data channel. The second data packet  is X bits long, as indicated in a packet size field  provided with the second data packet . Usable data in the first data packet  is less than X bits long, as indicated in a packet size field  provided with the first data packet . As previously discussed, the first and the second devices provide an acknowledgement after the reception of respective data packets, first data packet  and second data packet , using the second data channel. For discussion purposes, data rates associated with the first and second channels are assumed to be similar. As previously discussed, while the first data packet  includes less bits than the second data packet , if the first data packet is sent at a lower data rate, the transmission time associated with the first data packet  may be greater than the transmission time associated with the second data packet .","In one embodiment, null data  is added to data packet . The null data  provides padding to the first data packet  to make up a difference in transmission time between the first data packet  and the second data packet . Therefore, the first device is forced to wait until it has received X bits, due to a reception of the usable data of first data packet  with the null data . The null data  provides ample time for the second data packet  to be passed on the second data channel before the first device attempts to send an acknowledgement. In one embodiment, the packet size field  only indicates the size of first data packet , without the null data . Alternatively, the packet size field  can indicate a size of X bits, providing the number of bits including the first data packet  and the null data . Null data  is used to make a size of the first data packet  as received by the first device to appear to be congruent with the size of second data packet .","In one embodiment, null data  includes data values that are not to be processed by the first device. While null data  is described as allowing the first data packet  to match a data size associated with the second data packet , if the data rates associated with the first and second channels are significantly different, the size of first data packet can be adjusted by null data  to a size different than the size of the second data packet  to match the transmission times between the first and second data packets  and , improving throughput and maximizing availability associated with the first and second data channels. By adjusting the amount of time to transmit the first set of data  and the second set of data , acknowledgements associated with receipt of the first and second data packets  and  may be controlled.","While the addition of null data  is discussed, it should be noted that other data may also be added to the first data packet . Furthermore, the MAC layer may be used to apply the extra data to the first data packet . Accordingly, the first data packet  and the second data packet  may be compared to determine whether the times to transmit the data packets  and  are congruent. If the times to transmit the data packets  and  are not congruent, due to either different data rates, but rates, or data packet sizes, the MAC layer may add more bytes to the first data packet  to ensure the transmit times are congruent. Furthermore, it may be desirable to adjust the transmission times associated with the first and second data packets  and  to be slightly different, by one or more symbols, ensuring acknowledgements associated with the first and second data packets  and  timely returned. Accordingly, the return of acknowledgements can be adjusted without requiring a receiving system to initiate a delay before administering an acknowledgement. It should be noted that while an addition of null data  is shown attached to the end of first data packet , null data  may be added at the start of first data packet  or provided within the first data packet , without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","The systems described herein may be part of an information handling system.
