title: Browser plug-in for secure credential submission
abstract: Described is a technology by which a plug-in (e.g., an ActiveXÂ® control) instantiated by a web browser calls functions of a credential service to use a set of credential data (e.g., a card file) for logging into a website. If the credential service determines that a previously used card file for the website exists, a representation of that card file is displayed in the browser, and the data of that card file is used to obtain a token for logging in the user. If not found, an icon is presented instead, by which the user can select a user interface that allows selection of another card file that meets that meet the website's requirements.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Exemplary Operating Environment","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Many websites require user credentials. At the same time, users may have different credentials for different websites and other purposes.","Presenting credentials stored on a computer to a website can cause issues with users. For example, if the credentials are selected and presented to a website entirely outside the browser with which the user is accessing the website, it is often difficult for the user to associate the submission tool with the site. If the credentials are selected and presented within the browser, the user may feel the site already possesses and has access to all of the user's credentials.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of representative concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in any way that would limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Briefly, various aspects of the subject matter described herein are directed towards a technology by which a plug-in (e.g., an ActiveX\u00ae control) instantiated by a web browser calls functions of a credential service, including to determine whether a set of credential metadata (e.g., a card file) matches a website's credential requirements (required \u201cclaims\u201d). If so, the plug-in calls a credential service function obtain a token corresponding to the set of credential data, for providing to the website, e.g., to login the user.","In one aspect, the plug-in displays a representation of the card file, e.g., so that the user recognizes the association between the website and that set of user credentials. If a card file previously used with the website is not found, an icon is presented instead, by which the user can select a user interface that allows selection of another card file that meets the website's requirements.","Other advantages may become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings.","Various aspects of the technology described herein are generally directed towards the presentation of credential data in context of the web page, in a manner that allows submission of the credentials without disclosing credential metadata to the web page. To this end, a browser plug-in (e.g., an ActiveX\u00ae control or NPAPI, Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) handles communication with a credential service to securely obtain a token, while appearing in context on the web page. This isolates the secure data from the web page, yet displays information in the context of the web page that allows the user to choose a credential to submit.","It should be understood that any of the examples herein are non-limiting. As such, the present invention is not limited to any particular embodiments, aspects, concepts, structures, functionalities or examples described herein. Rather, any of the embodiments, aspects, concepts, structures, functionalities or examples described herein are non-limiting, and the present invention may be used in various ways that provide benefits and advantages in computing and networking in general.","Turning to , there is shown a set of components that facilitate secure credential submission via a browser plug-in  of a browser . In one implementation, the browser plug-in is an ActiveX\u00ae control, instantiated via an OBJECT tag in the HTML  of a website  or the like rendered by the browser . The OBJECT tag specifies the nature of the required credential, and the object ID of the ActiveX\u00ae control. On instantiation, as represented in  via the arrow labeled one (1), the browser plug-in  determines how it is to appear to the user from information in the OBJECT tag, e.g., various parameters.","As represented in  via the arrow labeled two (2), the browser plug-in  queries a credential service  (e.g., a CardSpace service) for data to be rendered in the web page. To find such data, the Credential service  accesses (the arrow labeled three (3)) a ledger  corresponding to a card store  to determine whether there is a record of a token being generated as a result a previous visit to the website. Note that the card store contains card files that each contain a set of credential data (data elements) corresponding to some credentials, referred to as \u201cclaims\u201d in one implementation. The card file also contains an icon or other graphical image, and may display its claims.","Note that while this process is underway, a card tile  (e.g., corresponding to a location identified in the parameters) may display a \u201cbusy\u201d graphic or the like, and the plug-in control  does not respond to interaction. When complete, an image (a \u201cselect\u201d card tile or the user's card for the website) appears in place of the busy indicator, as described below.","Two scenarios are thus possible, one in which the ledger  contains no record of a token being generated for this website (or none matching the website's current policy), and one in which a token is found. If there is no record, the plug-in  displays the \u201cselect\u201d card tile that includes an icon. If the user clicks the icon, (or clicks a Login button that may be provided by the website), in response the user is transitioned to a credential user interface , as represented in  by the arrow labeled four (4). Note that the web page can invoke functions including to invoke the credential user interface  for selection as described below.","The credential user interface  searches for card files that contain claims matching the website's requirements. Those that are found are presented to the user, where the user can select one. If none are found, the credential user interface  gives the user an opportunity to create a card.","In the other scenario, the ledger  contains a record of having previously generated a token matching this website\/its policy. In the card tile , the user sees a card containing a representation of the previously-submitted card, e.g., a graphic and the card's claims. Note that when the card is moused over, the card name may be displayed.","The login takes place by generating and releasing a token to the website. Note that the web page can invoke a function that causes a token to be generated. During token generation the site may display its own graphic as a progress indicator. Token generation (e.g., by an issuer service ) is represented in  via the arrows labeled 6 and seven (7);","Selection of a card or finding a previous card may automatically log in the user to the website. Alternatively, the user may click a login button, which generates and releases the token to the site.","Note that because of the API architecture, the credential service is unavailable to script code running in the browser, and the user's credentials cannot be obtained via scripting. Further, no credentials are collected within the browser, and there is no card (claim data) editing within the browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","102","108"]},"Step  represents determining whether a card that matches the website's policy\/claims was found. If so, step  provides the card to the browser plug-in to display the card in the card tile, including its graphic (or a default graphic if none). If not found, the \u201cselect\u201d card, which indicates it is clickable to select a card, is displayed at step . At this time, the card tile is enabled for clicking, and the GetToken( ) interface may be invoked. If the user clicks, (step ), the card store is accessed to find any cards matching the site's claim requirements. If at least one is found (step ), the card or cards are displayed to the user for selection at step ; if not found, step  handles otherwise, e.g., asks the user to create one.","At this point, the process may need user interaction, such as to click on the card in the card tile or to select a card in the credential user interface, as represented by step . A user may also select a \u201clogin\u201d icon or the like provided by the website. Note that a card may be designated in the ledger for automatic submission for this set of policy, which event selection is automatically chosen without needing user interaction.","Step  represents requesting of the token and sending it to the website. Note that this may be accomplished by sending an event to the website, (which the website handles via script), whereby the web page invokes the function to get the token, e.g., GetToken( ), using the card in the card tile, or by asking the credential user interface for the selection. When the function is called, the website is notified that token generation is under way. Note that step  includes waiting for a completed token. It is also feasible to cancel the request, e.g., due to error in token generation or a user cancel at a suitable prompt.","When a token is received, completed, and this is a subsequent submission with no previously un-submitted claims, the token is submitted to the website. Otherwise, a review claims page may be provided, which if it returns YES, submits the token to the website, or if NO (or is canceled), returns to await some user action.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["300","300","300","300"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, and removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.

Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above may also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media, described above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules  and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers herein to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a tablet, or electronic digitizer, , a microphone , a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices not shown in  may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . The monitor  may also be integrated with a touch-screen panel or the like.
