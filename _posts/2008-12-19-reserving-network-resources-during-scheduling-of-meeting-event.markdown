Such meetings often rely on network-based communications, for example video conference, voice conference, etc. A conference system typically relies on provisioning of network resources, at the time of deployment, that are dedicated exclusively to the conference system. The Cisco\u00ae Unified Meetingplace system is a telephone conference system that requires provisioning of network resources, at the time of deployment, that are dedicated exclusively to the Cisco\u00ae Unified Meetingplace system. The Cisco\u00ae TelePresence system is network-based video conference system that also requires provisioning of network resources, at the time of deployment, that are dedicated exclusively to the Cisco\u00ae TelePresence system.","The Cisco\u00ae TelePresence system reserves bandwidth and quality of service from the dedicated network resources at the time a TelePresence conference is initiated. The Cisco\u00ae WebEx Web Conferencing System also reserves bandwidth at the time a web-based conference is initiated. The Cisco\u00ae Unified Meetingplace system, the Cisco\u00ae TelePresence system, and the Cisco\u00ae WebEx Web Conferencing System each are commercially available from Cisco Systems, San Jose, Calif.","In one embodiment, a method comprises receiving a request for scheduling a meeting event between client endpoint devices in an Internet Protocol (IP) based network, the meeting event having a starting time and duration, the meeting event requiring identifiable network resources from the network; determining whether the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event; and selectively reserving the identifiable network resources for the meeting event, from the available network capacity, based on determining the network will have the available network capacity during the meeting event.","In another embodiment, an apparatus comprises a device interface circuit and a processor circuit. The device interface circuit is configured for receiving, in an Internet Protocol (IP) based network, a request for scheduling a meeting event between client endpoint devices in the network. The meeting event has a starting time and duration, and requires identifiable network resources from the network. The processor circuit is configured for determining whether the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event. The processor circuit further is configured for selectively reserving the identifiable network resources for the meeting event, from the available network capacity, based on determining the network will have the available network capacity during the meeting event.","Particular embodiments enable identifiable network resources in a network to be dynamically reserved for a meeting event scheduled between client endpoint devices, at the time that the meeting event is scheduled. The identifiable network resources are dynamically reserved by a meeting server device (i.e., a network resource reservation device) in response to the meeting server device receiving a request for scheduling the meeting event, and based on the meeting server device determining the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event. If the meeting server device determines the network will not have the available network capacity during the meeting event, the meeting server device can send a request for additional network capacity required for the meeting. The meeting server device can reserve the identifiable network resources in response to receiving a reply indicating the additional network capacity will be available for the meeting. Alternately, if the meeting server device determines the additional network capacity required for the meeting event will not be available, the meeting server device can recommend an alternative start time for the meeting event.","The meeting server device also can implement the meeting for the starting time based on deploying the identifiable network resources reserved for the event, for example based on sending commands to router devices or firewall devices in the network for initiation of the meeting event according to the reserved network resources and according to network policies established for the meeting event. The meeting server also can release the identifiable network resources back to the available network capacity, and\/or return the additional network capacity (e.g., having been leased from an Internet Service Provider), in response to confirming the meeting event has ended.","Hence, network resources in a network can be scheduled and reserved according to calendar-based meeting event planning, based on comparing whether provisioned network capacity in the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources required during the meeting event. Further, meeting event planning can include requesting additional network capacity on at least a temporary basis, where the identifiable network resources (and additional network capacity) can be released for reuse (or reclamation) in response to confirming the meeting event has ended.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","1","14","12","1","14","12","34","36","24","38","34","36","1","3","4","34","1","2","3","4","24","12","1","14","12","1","14","32","1","14","40","1","2","3","32"]},"The example network  can include a second autonomous system (\u201cAS\u201d)  and at least one Internet Service Provider (ISP)  that provides a wide-area network (WAN) reachability for the autonomous system (\u201cAS\u201d)  to reach the second autonomous system (\u201cAS\u201d)  and other client endpoint devices (e.g., \u201cC\u201d) . The Internet Service Provider  can be implemented as an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), a competing local exchange carrier (CLEC), a cable television operator providing Internet access, etc. Hence, the network  provides reachability between the client endpoint devices (e.g., C, C, C, C, C, C, and\/or C) .","The Internet Service Provider  can be implemented as an Internet Access provider or a Network Service Provider (i.e., a Tier 1 network). The ISP  provides network access for the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d to a wide area network (e.g., the Internet) by provisioning one or more network access links \u201cL\u201d   to the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d . The network access link \u201cL\u201d  can be implemented as a fractional T1 data link (i.e., less than 1.544 Mb\/s), one or more T1 data links (each T1 data link providing a 1.544 Mb\/s data connection), a T3 data link (i.e., 43.232 Mb\/s, equivalent to 28 T1 data links), or any combination thereof based on a contractual arrangement between the ISP  and the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d . As described below, the network access link \u201cL\u201d  can be provisioned based on connecting multiple physical data links (e.g., T1) to the border router , where only a portion of the connected physical data links are activated by the ISP .","An \u201cAutonomous System\u201d (e.g., \u201cAS\u201d)  refers to a collection of Internet Protocol router devices (e.g., \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d)  under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway protocol (IGP) and common metrics to determine how to route packets within the Autonomous System (e.g. \u201cAS\u201d), and using an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol (e.g., Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to determine how to route packets to other Autonomous Systems (see, e.g., the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC)  at Sec. 1.1). In this example, the router devices \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, \u201cR\u201d  within the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  could exchange routing information according to an interior gateway protocol such as a distance vector routing protocol or a link state routing protocol; in contrast, the border routers \u201cR\u201d and \u201cR\u201d  could exchange routing information with routers in the ISP  according to BGP as described in the IETF RFC 4271.","As illustrated in , the autonomous systems \u201cAS\u201d and \u201cAS\u201d  and the ISP  each include a Network Management System, also referred to as a Network Operations Center (NOC) . Each network management system  is configured for maintaining a corresponding network inventory  of all network equipment that is deployed within the corresponding network  or , including deployed router devices , switching devices (not shown), active network links , server devices  or , etc. Hence, at least a portion of the network inventory  is deployed and assigned by the network management system  as provisioned network capacity  within the corresponding network  or . Hence, the provisioned network capacity  is the maximum capacity that is available for use within the corresponding network (e.g., \u201cAS\u201d) according to its existing configuration (i.e., its existing deployment). As described below with respect to , the provisioned network capacity  can change over time as additional network equipment is added to the network inventory , and\/or as additional network equipment already in the network inventory  is provisioned and deployed in the corresponding autonomous system .","The meeting server device  is an apparatus (i.e., a machine) deployed within the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d . The meeting server  comprises a device interface circuit , a processor circuit , and a memory circuit .","Any of the disclosed circuits of the meeting server device  (including the device interface circuit , the processor circuit , and the memory circuit , and their associated components) can be implemented in multiple forms. Example implementations of the disclosed circuits include hardware logic that is implemented in a logic array such as a programmable logic array (PLA), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or by mask programming of integrated circuits such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Any of these circuits also can be implemented using a software-based executable resource that is executed by a corresponding internal processor circuit such as a microprocessor circuit (not shown), where execution of executable code stored in an internal memory circuit (e.g., within the memory circuit ) causes the processor circuit to store application state variables in processor memory, creating an executable application resource (e.g., an application instance) that performs the operations of the circuit as described herein. Hence, use of the term \u201ccircuit\u201d in this specification refers to both a hardware-based circuit that includes logic for performing the described operations, or a software-based circuit that includes a reserved portion of processor memory for storage of application state data and application variables that are modified by execution of the executable code by a processor circuit. The memory circuit  can be implemented, for example, using a non-volatile memory such as a programmable read only memory (PROM) or an EPROM, and\/or a volatile memory such as a DRAM, etc.","Further, any reference to \u201coutputting a message\u201d or \u201coutputting a packet\u201d (or the like) can be implemented based on creating the message\/packet in the form of a data structure and storing that data structure in a tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus (e.g., in a transmit buffer). Any reference to \u201coutputting a message\u201d or \u201coutputting a packet\u201d (or the like) also can include electrically transmitting (e.g., via wired electric current or wireless electric field, as appropriate) the message\/packet stored in the tangible memory medium to another network node via a communications medium (e.g., a wired or wireless link, as appropriate) (optical transmission also can be used, as appropriate). Similarly, any reference to \u201creceiving a message\u201d or \u201creceiving a packet\u201d (or the like) can be implemented based on the disclosed apparatus detecting the electrical (or optical) transmission of the message\/packet on the communications medium, and storing the detected transmission as a data structure in a tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus (e.g., in a receive buffer). Also note that the memory circuit  can be implemented dynamically by the processor circuit , for example based on memory address assignment and partitioning executed by the processor circuit .","The meeting server device  is configured for responding to a request for scheduling a meeting event between client endpoint devices  based on determining whether the network  (or at least a portion thereof) will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event.  illustrates the meeting server device  reserving identifiable network resources  relative to available network capacity  within the provisioned network capacity . The processor circuit  can reserve the identifiable network resources required for a meeting event \u201cM\u201d  based on determining the network  (or at least a portion of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d ) has the available network capacity  to supply the identifiable network resources relative to the provisioned network capacity  and any other allocated network capacity . As illustrated in , the only allocated network capacity  at event  (coinciding with the start time of the meeting event \u201cM\u201d ) is low priority unreserved network resources  (e.g., low priority e-mail or web browsing traffic). As described below with respect to , the processor circuit  also can request additional network capacity  be added to the provisioned network capacity  in response to receiving a request for scheduling a meeting event: the request for additional network capacity  can be generated by the processor circuit  in response to the processor circuit  determining the network ( or ) requires the additional network capacity  to accommodate a meeting event, for example the concurrent implementing of the meeting events \u201cM\u201d and \u201cM\u201d.","Hence, identifiable network resources can be selectively reserved for a meeting event at the time that the meeting event is scheduled, ensuring guaranteed deployment of bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the meeting event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 3"],"b":["12","46","50","5"]},"The device interface circuit  of the meeting server  is configured for receiving, via the data link \u201cL\u201d  in step , a request for scheduling a meeting event (e.g., \u201cM\u201d)  between client endpoint devices (e.g., C, C, and C)  within the network .","The request for scheduling a meeting event (i.e., \u201cscheduling request\u201d) can be generated by one of the client endpoint devices , regardless of whether the client endpoint device  generating the request is to participate in the meeting event . The scheduling request also can be generated by a processor-based server device in the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  (not shown) that executes a calender server program on behalf of the client endpoint devices , for example the commercially available Microsoft Exchange Server, IBM Lotus Notes, etc.","The scheduling request also can be used to reserve network resources for maintenance. For example, the scheduling request also can be generated by the NOC , for example if service personnel wish to perform network maintenance (e.g., reconfiguration, upgrades, repairs, testing, etc.) on an identified portion of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  (e.g., one or more routers , one or more links , one or more servers , etc.). In this example, the scheduling request generated by the NOC  could explicitly specify one or more network components (e.g., router \u201cR\u201d , link \u201cL\u201d , VPN concentrator , a specific firewall device , etc.).","The scheduling request can specify the start time and duration (and start date if on a different date), and the client endpoint devices  that are to participate in the meeting event . If needed, the scheduling request also can specify meeting type (e.g., video, audio, etc.), whether any data files need to be distributed to meeting participants, etc.; alternately, attributes describing the meeting can be obtained based on the scheduling request providing a reference to another data structure stored in the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  that describes the identifiable network resources that are required for the event.","The processor circuit  of the meeting server device  is configured for responding to the scheduling request received in step  by determining in step  whether the network (e.g., \u201cAS\u201d  or ) will have available network capacity  to supply the network resources required for the meeting event from the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d , the ISP , and\/or the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d . For example, assume the scheduling request is for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  and specifies a meeting time starting at event  of  at 8:00 AM on Dec. 18, 2008, between the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d  deployed exclusively within the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d . The processor circuit  can parse the scheduling request and identify in step  that the requested meeting event \u201cM\u201d  will require Voice over IP connections and limited file transfer capabilities between the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d , implemented for example using 0.5 Mb\/s bandwidth links providing a guaranteed voice quality grade quality of service between the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d . Hence, the processor circuit  can determine that the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  requires 0.5 Mb\/s guaranteed bandwidth and a voice quality grade quality of service for the data links \u201cL\u201d, \u201cL\u201d, \u201cL\u201d, and \u201cL\u201d provided by the router devices \u201cR\u201d and \u201cR\u201d .","The processor circuit  determines in step  whether the network (e.g., \u201cAS\u201d ) will have available network capacity  to supply the identifiable network resources (identified in step ) during the meeting event (e.g., \u201cM\u201d) . For example, the processor circuit  of the meeting server device  can access in step  a data structure  containing network resource records relevant to the duration of the meeting event  (i.e., between events  and  of ). In particular, the processor circuit  can access the provisioned network capacity , illustrated as stored within the tangible data structure  stored in the memory circuit . Alternately, the tangible data structure  can be stored on another tangible storage device (e.g., a network-enabled hard disk drive) reachable by the device interface circuit . The processor circuit  also can access stored data structures  within the data structure , referred to as network meeting overlay files.","Each network meeting overlay file  defines a previously scheduled meeting event overlying the network  based on assignment of identifiable network resources for the corresponding meeting event ; hence, each network meeting overlay file  defines the identifiable network resources that already have been reserved for the corresponding meeting event .","The processor circuit  compares in step  the starting time and duration of the meeting event (e.g., \u201cM\u201d)  specified in the meeting request with the provisioned network capacity  and any other meeting events scheduled for deployment concurrently with the requested meeting event. Assume for example that the scheduling request for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  is the first request received by the meeting server device , and that the only other allocated network capacity  is the unreserved low priority network resources  illustrated in . If the processor circuit  determines in step  that the network  will have available network capacity at the scheduled meeting time to supply the network resources required for the meeting event, the processor circuit  can generate in step  a new network meeting overlay file  that defines the new meeting event overlying the network (e.g., \u201cAS\u201d ), and reserve the identifiable network resources for the meeting event  based on specifying the identifiable network resources  in the new network meeting overlay file . Hence, using the example of the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  requiring 0.5 Mb\/s of network resources, the processor circuit  determines in step  that the relevant allocated network capacity  (for the unreserved network resources ) at event  is 0.05 Mb\/s, that the provisioned network capacity  at event  is 3.75 Mb\/s; hence the available network capacity  at event  after accounting for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d will be 3.20 Mb\/s (i.e., 3.75 Mb\/s minus 0.5 Mb\/s minus 0.05 Mb\/s). Hence, the processor circuit  determines in step  that the available network capacity  of 3.70 Mb\/s at event  will be sufficient to supply the required 0.5 Mb\/s of network resources for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d .","Hence, the processor circuit  reserves the identifiable network resources for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  based on creating in step  the network meeting overlay file , illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["44","44","28","100","1","50","28","44","102","104","28","44","106","46","1","50","20","108","44","28","108","46","1","46","106"],"i":["a","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a ","a "]},"The network policies  specified in the network meeting overlay file can include a meeting reservation priority , client-specific meeting requirements  (e.g., , , and ), plus network device-specific meeting requirements .","The meeting reservation priority  can identify a relative priority of the meeting enabling higher priority meetings (e.g., having a priority value of \u201c5\u201d) to preempt lower priority meetings (e.g., having a priority of \u201c4\u201d or lower).","The client-specific meeting requirements (e.g., ) can specify a file transfer authorization  specifying whether the corresponding client endpoint device (e.g., \u201cC\u201d)  is authorized to transfer data files, for example according to FTP protocol. The file transfer authorization  can specify a maximum file size (e.g., 500 Megabytes (Mb)), permissible file types (identifiable, for example based on MIME encoding, file extension naming such as \u201c.pdf\u201d, \u201c.ppt\u201d, \u201c.txt\u201d, \u201c.wav\u201d, \u201c.mov\u201d), etc.","The network policies  also can specify a bandwidth capacity  for the corresponding client endpoint device (e.g., \u201cC\u201d) , a guaranteed quality of service (QoS) requirement  for the corresponding client endpoint device  (e.g., voice quality grade quality of service required), and\/or network traffic prioritization . The QoS requirement  can refer to implementing prescribed network parameters to minimize quality-adverse effects such as jitter, delay, dropped packets, latency, etc., in order to maintain prescribed quality constraints.","The network traffic prioritization  can identify the respective priorities the respective network traffic types during the meeting event . As illustrated with respect to the network meeting overlay file , voice traffic has the highest priority (\u201c5\u201d), followed by files transferred according to the FTP protocol (\u201c3\u201d or \u201c2\u201d), with instant messaging traffic being assigned the lowest relative priority (\u201c2\u201d or \u201c1\u201d).","The network meeting overlay file also specifies network device-specific meeting requirements , enabling the processor circuit  to implement the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  for the specified starting time  on the specified meeting date . The processor circuit  implements the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  based on sending explicit commands to the network devices (e.g., the router devices \u201cR\u201d and \u201cR\u201d ) in order to guarantee the reserved network resources for the meeting events \u201cM\u201d , described in further detail below with respect to .","Referring to , assume that following the creation of the network meeting overlay file for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  and storage in the data structure  in step , the device interface circuit  of the meeting server device  receives in step  another scheduling request from a client endpoint device  for scheduling a meeting event \u201cM\u201d  having the starting time and duration  of 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on Dec. 18, 2008, illustrated as starting event  and ending event  in . The scheduling request for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  also can specify the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  is between the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d . As illustrated in , the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d and \u201cC\u201d are reachable via the wide-area network , requiring creation of encrypted VPN connections  by the VPN concentrator device  to ensure meeting security in compliance with corporate or regulatory policies.","The processor circuit  identifies the network resources required from the network  for the meeting event (or at least required from the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d ) in step  (e.g., 2.75 Mb\/s required for meeting event \u201cM\u201d ), and accesses in step  the provisioned network capacity data structure  and the network meeting overlay file for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d. In particular, the processor circuit  retrieves the network meeting overlay file based on detecting the meeting events \u201cM\u201d and \u201cM\u201d having concurrent requirements of network capacity between events  and . As described above, the allocated network capacity  as of event  is 0.55 Mb\/s, where 0.5 Mb\/s is reserved for the resources of the meeting event \u201cM\u201d , and 0.05 Mb\/s is allocated for the unassigned network resources . Further, the provisioned network capacity  (e.g., for data link \u201cL\u201d ) from event  to event  is 3.75 Mb\/s (e.g., data link \u201cL\u201d is deployed using 2 T1 lines and one fractional T1 line (0.75 Mb\/s) leased by the NOC  of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  from the ISP ).","As illustrated in , the processor circuit  determines in step  that the available network capacity  during the meeting event \u201cM\u201d starting at event  (e.g., 3.2 Mb\/s) is sufficient to supply the identified network resources that are required for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  (e.g., 2.75 Mb\/s). Hence, the processor circuit  of the meeting server device  reserves in step  the identifiable network resources based on creating a network meeting overlay file , illustrated in , that defines the meeting event \u201cM\u201d overlying the network . Specifically, the network meeting overlay file assigns the identifiable network resources to the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  to guarantee that the network resources are reserved for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d . As illustrated in , the concurrent reservation of the network resources and for the respective meeting events \u201cM\u201d and \u201cM\u201d results in an allocated network capacity  of 3.3 Mb\/s, which is below the provisioned network capacity  between events  and  of 3.75 Mb\/s.","As illustrated in , the network meeting overlay file created by the processor circuit  in step  defines the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  based on reservation and assignment of the identifiable network resources to the meeting event \u201cM\u201d . The network policies  specify bandwidth  and quality of service requirements  in order to guarantee high-quality video teleconferencing (e.g., 1080p-format high-definition television), using for example Cisco\u00ae TelePresence equipment deployed at the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d and \u201cC\u201d . In contrast, the bandwidth  and quality of service requirements  for the client endpoint device \u201cC\u201d  specify a voice grade (e.g., Voice over IP) quality. Further, the network policies  and the network device-specific meeting requirements  identify the VPN connections \u201cVPN\u201d and \u201cVPN\u201d  to be established by the VPN concentrator device , as well as the relevant bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the respective VPN connections .","Hence, the storage of the network meeting overlay file by the processor circuit  into the data structure  enables the processor circuit  to later implement the meeting \u201cM\u201d  based on retrieving the corresponding network meeting overlay file , and deploying the identifiable network resources based on sending the appropriate commands to the network devices , , and .","Following storage of the network meeting overlay files and in the data structure  for the respective meeting events \u201cM\u201d and \u201cM\u201d , assume with respect to  that the device interface circuit  receives in step  a scheduling request from a requesting client endpoint device for a meeting event \u201cM\u201d  between the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d having a start time and duration  of 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM on Dec. 18, 2008, illustrated in  by the start event  and the end event . Following identification of the network resources required from the network  for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  in step  (e.g., 2.25 Mb\/s required at least from link \u201cL\u201d ), the processor circuit  retrieves in step  the provisioned network capacity  (e.g., 3.75 Mb\/s for at least the data link \u201cL\u201d ), and the network meeting overlay file based on detecting the meeting events \u201cM\u201d and \u201cM\u201d having concurrent requirements of network capacity between events  and .","The processor circuit  determines in steps  and  that the available network capacity  (at least for the data link \u201cL\u201d ) prior to the starting event  for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d is the difference between the allocated network capacity  of 2.8 Mb\/s and the provisioned network capacity  of 3.75 Mb\/s, resulting in an available network capacity  (at least on the data link \u201cL\u201d) of 0.95 Mb\/s.

The processor circuit  sends in step  the request for additional network capacity  (e.g., an additional T1 connection for the data link \u201cL\u201d ) to the network management system (NOC)  of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d .","In one embodiment, the request for additional network capacity can be implemented in the form of an automated e-mail message that is sent to a prescribed destination within the NOC , where network provisioning equipment within the NOC  and under the control of network management personnel can negotiate with the NOC of the ISP  for leasing the additional network capacity  for at least the overlapping time interval between the events  and  of .","In another embodiment, the request for additional network capacity can be implemented using network-based application programming interfaces (APIs) executed by the processor circuit , and the NOCs  in the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  and the ISP . In this example, the network provisioning equipment in the NOC  of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  can be configured for automatically responding to the request for additional network capacity , based on automatically sending the request to the NOC  of the ISP .

The NOC  of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  can be configured to grant access to the meeting server device  of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d , for example based on a trusted relationship between the autonomous systems \u201cAS\u201d and \u201cAS\u201d.","If in step  the processor circuit  of the meeting server device  receives (via the device interface circuit ) a reply from the NOC  of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  and\/or the ISP  indicating that the additional network capacity  will not be available, the processor circuit  can generate in step  a meeting response to the requesting client endpoint device recommending an alternate start time for the meeting event, for example based on identifying from the data structure a time where there is available network capacity  to supply the required network resources Hence, a user can be notified at the time the scheduling request is generated if the required network resources are not available.","Assuming in step  that the processor circuit  receives a reply from the NOC  of the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  and\/or the ISP  indicating that the additional network capacity  will be available between the events  and , the processor circuit  can reserve in step  the identified network resources for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  based on creating the network meeting overlay file , illustrated in .","As illustrated in , the network meeting overlay file created by the processor circuit  in step  defines the meeting event \u201cM\u201d  based on reservation and assignment of the identifiable network resources to the meeting event \u201cM\u201d . The network policies  specify bandwidth  and quality of service requirements  in order to guarantee high-quality video teleconferencing (e.g., 1080p-format high-definition television), using for example Cisco\u00ae TelePresence equipment deployed at the client endpoint devices \u201cC\u201d and \u201cC\u201d . The bandwidth  and quality of service requirements  for the client endpoint device \u201cC\u201d  specify a voice grade (e.g., Voice over IP) quality. Further, the network policies  and the network device-specific meeting requirements  identify the VPN connection \u201cVPN\u201d  to be established by the VPN concentrator device , as well as the relevant bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the VPN connections \u201cVPN\u201d .","Hence, the storage of the network meeting overlay file by the processor circuit  into the data structure  enables the processor circuit  to later implement the meeting \u201cM\u201d  based on retrieving the corresponding network meeting overlay file , and deploying the identifiable network resources based on sending the appropriate commands to the network devices , , and .","Hence, the creation and storage of the network meeting overlay files , , and by the processor circuit  guarantees that the required network resources , , and are reserved from the available network capacity , relative to the provisioned network capacity . In addition, the example embodiment demonstrates that the meeting server device  can request the additional network capacity , if needed, in order to increase the available network capacity to a level that is sufficient to supply the identifiable network resources required for a meeting event.

In particular, the processor circuit  can send configuration commands for the meeting event (e.g., \u201cM\u201d)  in step  to the relevant network elements. Example configuration commands include bandwidth reservation commands and quality of service policy commands that are sent to the relevant router devices (e.g., \u201cR\u201d and \u201cR\u201d) , quality of service policy commands and filtering policy commands sent to firewall devices (e.g., implemented within the router devices \u201cR\u201d and \u201cR\u201d).","In the case of implementing the meetings \u201cM\u201d or \u201cM\u201d based on retrieval of the respective network meeting overlay files and , the processor circuit  also can send commands to the VPN concentrator device  prior to the corresponding starting time, enabling the VPN concentrator device  to initiate a secure tunnel connection (e.g., a VPN connection ) with a client endpoint device (e.g., \u201cVPN\u201d for client endpoint device \u201cC\u201d ) or a peer VPN concentrator device  (e.g., \u201cVPN\u201d and \u201cVPN\u201d with VPN concentrator  in the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d) via the peer border routers \u201cR\u201d and \u201cR\u201d . If a client endpoint device (e.g., \u201cC\u201d)  outside the autonomous system \u201cAS\u201d  does not have a VPN resources necessary for VPN creation, the processor circuit  can add to the network meeting overlay file (e.g., ) an instruction for the VPN concentrator  to send a single-use or limited-time use (e.g., can use up to five times) VPN key to the client endpoint device \u201cC\u201d , and to perform a pre-meeting test of the VPN connection \u201cVPN\u201d . Hence, the processor circuit , in response to parsing the network meeting overlay file , can send a command to the VPN concentrator  to ensure all client endpoint devices  invited to the meeting \u201cM\u201d  are properly configured for establishing the required VPN connection .","In addition, security policies and\/or quality of service policies can be sent by the processor circuit  in step  to the appropriate firewall devices  in order to enforce corporate or regulatory policy requirements during the relevant meeting .","The processor circuit  begins execution of the meeting in step  by permitting incoming connections from client endpoint devices  that are invited to the meeting at a prescribed time interval before the start of the meeting (e.g., 10 minutes prior to the start of a meeting ). The incoming connections can be either TCP\/IP connections for a web-based meeting, incoming Voice over IP connections for a voice conference call, and\/or incoming video connections for a video conferencing system. If in step  there are any client endpoint devices  that have not yet established a connection with the meeting server device , the processor circuit  of the meeting server device  can initiate in step  the relevant connections (e.g., web-based, Voice over IP based, or video based) with the remaining client endpoint devices  invited to the meeting  (e.g., 1 minute prior to the start of the meeting), and bridge the connections either before or coincident with the scheduled beginning of the meeting at the prescribed start event (e.g.,  for the meeting event \u201cM\u201d ).","The messaging server device  also can manage the identified network resources  that are assigned for the relevant meeting  as the meeting progresses. For example, if in step  the processor circuit  detects that the meeting ends early, where all the client endpoint devices  have disconnected from the meeting event, the processor circuit  can terminate the meeting by releasing in step  the identified network resources  from the meeting event  back to the available network capacity . The processor circuit  also can output messages in step  to the network devices (e.g., the router devices , the firewall devices , the VPN concentrator device , etc.) to cancel the configuration commands sent in step  for deployment of the meeting; alternately, the configuration commands sent in step  each can include a timer field that specifies a \u201clifetime\u201d for the configuration command.","If in step  the processor circuit  detects that the prescribed meeting time has expired, the processor circuit  can send a query to one or more of the client endpoint devices  invited to the meeting  to determine if extra time is requested to continue the meeting. If extra time is requested, the processor circuit  can add additional time to the meeting in step  for up to a prescribed maximum (e.g., 30 minutes). In response to the processor circuit  confirming in step  that the meeting has ended (e.g., based on detecting all client endpoint devices have disconnected from the meeting event, or based on receiving a terminate instruction from one of the client endpoint devices), the processor circuit  can release the network resources  from the meeting event  back to the available network capacity  for reuse. The release of the network resources  can be implemented based on either deleting the relevant network meeting overlay file , or moving the network meeting overlay file  from the data structure  (used to calculate available network capacity ) to another storage location for archived storage.","According to example embodiments, network resources can be dynamically allocated and reserved for future calendar-based meetings, where the availability of network resources required for a meeting event is compared at the time of scheduling the meeting with available network capacity that will be available at the time of the meeting event. Hence, the behavior of the network can be associated with calendar-based events, where the behavior of the network is based on network resource allocation relative to available network capacity and changing provisioned network capacity as needed to accommodate requirements for network resources.","Although the example embodiments illustrate that the single meeting server device  executes both the resource reservation illustrated in  and the meeting deployment in , a distributed architecture can be implemented where one or more meeting server devices  reserve identifiable network resources for meeting events according to , and another set of one or more meeting server devices  implement the meetings according to .","While the example embodiments in the present disclosure have been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the best mode for carrying out the subject matter specified in the appended claims, it is to be understood that the example embodiments are only illustrative, and are not to restrict the subject matter specified in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the attached drawings, wherein elements having the same reference numeral designations represent like elements throughout and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A","FIG. 1"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
