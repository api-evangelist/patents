Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a technology for controlling a Radio Frequency (RF) head end system and a plurality of TV sets in a limited space such as a hotel or hospital, and more particularly to a method for transmitting a signal to a TV set of a specific room from among a plurality of TV sets installed in respective rooms of a hotel or hospital using a multiple access point control system defined in the following description.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Generally, a broadcast receiver receives a data stream including a broadcast signal, extracts a video and audio data stream corresponding to a user desired channel using service information contained in the received data stream, and outputs the extracted video and audio data stream to a display device.","However, according to the related art, detailed protocols or methods for more effectively transmitting and processing data to each room of a limited space such as a hotel or hospital are not defined yet.","An object of the present invention is to provide a method for providing a local messaging service to each room of a hotel using a digital television (DTV).","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for providing a local messaging service to each room irrespective of physical communication environment of a hotel (e.g. coaxial connection or IP connection environment).","To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method is provided for controlling a digital television (DTV) located in one independent space among a plurality of independent spaces physically separated from one another, wherein the DTV is connected to a management server and includes an Access Point (AP) card, the method including receiving a message file from the management server, wherein the message file includes identification (ID) information of the independent space and primary additional information mapped to the independent space ID information, determining whether the independent space ID information is identical to ID information of a current independent space, displaying the primary additional information when the independent space ID information is identical to the current independent space ID information, transmitting both a request signal for requesting secondary additional information corresponding to the primary additional information a response signal including the independent space ID information to the management server, and displaying the secondary additional information received from the management server.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The detailed description, which will be given below with reference to the accompanying drawings, is intended to explain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, rather than to show the only embodiments that can be implemented according to the present invention.","Prior to describing the present invention, it should be noted that most terms disclosed in the present invention are defined in consideration of functions of the present invention and correspond to general terms well known in the art, and can be differently determined according to intention of those skilled in the art, usual practices, or introduction of new technologies. In some cases, a few terms have been selected by the applicant as necessary and will hereinafter be disclosed in the following description of the present invention. Therefore, it is preferable that the terms defined by the applicant be understood on the basis of their meanings in the present invention.","In accordance with the following embodiments of the present invention, a system for controlling a multiple access point using a multiple access point control system is proposed. For example, the access point may be a part for providing information to each limited physical space, communicating with devices contained in the physical space, and controlling the devices. By means of the multiple access point control system, a specific access point may provide information to a user located in a corresponding physical space. In addition, the devices located in the physical space may communicate with a server located outside of the physical space through the access point.","In addition, the term \u2018physical space\u2019 is separated from a communication space, such as a cell, defined in a wireless field. The cell acting as the communication space is in the range that is affected by radio waves from a specific base station, such that a user equipment (UE) can communicate with a corresponding base station in the above-mentioned range. However, the access point may be a part for controlling and managing a specific physical space or local area (e.g., each room of a hotel or hospital). Although the devices contained in the physical space can communicate with an access point of another physical space, the devices communicate with the access point of the corresponding physical space, and as such a detailed example thereof will hereinafter be described.","The multiple access point control system may transfer the same information to a corresponding physical space through a multiple access point, or may transfer different information to individual physical spaces. The multiple access point control system may control the access point at a remote site such that information suitable for a user of a physical space including the access point can be independently provided. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the server of the multiple access point control system includes a user interface capable of allowing a person who controls the server to easily control the multiple access point.","The access point may be arranged at a specific position of each physical space. In order to easily provide information to the user, the access point may be configured in the form of a card, such that it can be inserted into a television or a set-top box. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the card-type access point designed to be inserted into a television or set-top box may also be abbreviated to an AP. In the case where the AP card is inserted into the television, the user can recognize information to be transmitted through the AP card by viewing the television.","Such a system may be located at a variety of places, for example, a hotel, a hospital, a school, a prison, etc. For convenience of description and better understanding of the present invention, it is assumed that the above-mentioned system is located at a hotel such that the multiple access point and a control system thereof are operated in the hotel. However, the scope and spirit of the present invention are not limited thereto, and the present invention is also applicable to other examples.","In the case of the hotel, a user lodges in the hotel, such that the user can view content such as broadcast content through a TV. If content provided to a user of a room through the TV is pay-per-view content, an accounting system connected to the TV can charge a usage fee to user-viewed content. However, a driving circuit associated with the accounting system is installed in each TV. If there is a need to upgrade a corresponding system, a hotel administrator who uses the related art must upgrade TV systems installed in all rooms, resulting in greater inconvenience of use.","In addition, since administrating all rooms is manually carried out by the hotel administrator, a large hotel having many rooms consumes an unnecessarily long period of time and great cost to manage such rooms.","With the increasing number of guests or lodgers who use wireless communication, there are many cases wherein a wireless communication network is installed in each floor of a hotel. However, there is a difficulty in providing enough bandwidth for all guests of respective floors to easily use the wireless communication network, such that it causes greater inconvenience to a guest or administrator of a hotel.","In the case of an old hotel, a hotel history may be considered to be a brand value of the hotel. In order to provide each room of the hotel with a control system, a communication system, and another system that allows individual services to be executed in all rooms, a large amount of costs are consumed. If the hotel architecture is changed to another to install the above-mentioned systems, the hotel prestige or value may be greatly deteriorated.","Therefore, according to the following embodiments of the present invention, if individual services are provided to users of rooms serving as different physical spaces, and an access point capable of entirely managing the rooms is installed in each room, the following embodiments can solve the above-mentioned problems by controlling only the access point of each room without great modification of a conventional hotel design. A multiple access point control system according to one embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the annexed drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1(","FIG. 1("],"i":["a","b"]},"In accordance with the related art shown in ), if a hotel administrator desires to upgrade a system applied to a TV of each room, the hotel administrator has to manually upgrade TVs of all rooms of the hotel. In other words, as shown in ) illustrating the related art, if a device in any one room is wrongly operated or an empty room is brightly lit, the hotel administrator should directly visit each room so as to correct the incorrect operation of the device or switch off the light of the empty room.","The above-mentioned inconvenience will hereinafter be described in detail from the economic point of view.","Provided that a cost required for upgrading a TV driving circuit of each room once is denoted by \u2018a\u2019, the number of rooms is denoted by \u2018b\u2019, the number of software upgrade times every year is denoted by \u2018c\u2019, and a lifetime of a TV is denoted by \u2018d\u2019, a total cost \u2018a\u00d7b\u00d7c\u00d7d\u2019 is continuously consumed to maintain such a system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1(","i":"b"},"Most hotels include an installation for a Video On Demand (VOD) accounting service for a TV. If an access point card is installed in the TV, each hotel can provide many more services to the user through the access point card. Therefore, a multiple access point control system can be easily installed in the hotel having many physical spaces, and can also be easily managed and maintained by the hotel administrator.","A variety of services can be provided to a user through the TV having the access point card. Exemplary services are as follows. If the user enters the room, a hotel logo is displayed on the TV, and a message including respective user names can be displayed on the TV.","In addition, the hotel notification or the hotel advertisement, etc. can be displayed on the TV, and travel or transportation information can be provided to the user. In addition, user desired information of respective rooms can be separately provided to individual rooms, and a detailed description thereof will hereinafter be described in detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2(","FIG. 2("],"i":["a","b"]},"Referring to ), the hotel administrator asks an external content provider or a system administrator either to manage a server for controlling TVs of respective rooms or to provide content. Accordingly, according to the related art, the content provider or the system administrator controls and manages not only content, that must be provided to the user through the TV, but also an accounting system for the content, and therefore, the TV of each room can provide a pay-per-view service to the user of each room.","According to the related art, if the hotel administrator changes a pay-per-view service to another service, the hotel administrator cannot directly control a detailed description required for the changed service. In the case of changing the system operation, the hotel administrator has difficulty in changing such a system operation under the condition that the hotel administrator sends the external content provider no request. In other words, it is next to impossible for the hotel administrator to change or manipulate services provided to each room independently from the system administrator.","Referring to ), the server of the multiple access point system according to another embodiment of the present invention can allow the hotel administrator to directly provide content to a user of each room, and can also allow the hotel administrator to provide different information to the user. For example, the server for use in the multiple access point control system may have a Web-based editor. The user interface of the multiple access point control system can allow the hotel administrator to conveniently manage respective rooms, such that the hotel administrator can conveniently provide requirements of each room and an individual service that must be provided to each room.","The hotel administrator can edit services provided to each room using the user interface and the Web-based editor, such that individual or common services can be provided to respective rooms. If the hotel administrator edits the Web-based editor, the server of the multiple access point system can easily transmit an additional message to a user of a specific room, or can transmit specific content to the user. A detailed description thereof will hereinafter be described in detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3(","FIGS. 3("],"i":["a","b","c"],"b":"3"},"In the case of most hotels, a cable network is installed in each room as shown in ). The cable network is connected to a set-top box of each room, or provides a VOD service to each room through a VOD server of the hotel.","For example, if the VOD server transmits an IP packet having video content, the IP-to-RF converter converts the IP packet into an RF signal, and transmits the RF signal to the cable network.","In addition, the set-top box or TV of each room receives the RF signal from the VOD server, and displays video content.","Referring to ), if the user of each room desires to use the Internet or a wireless phone using a notebook computer based on wireless communication, it is necessary for each room to include a router connected to the Ethernet network or a wireless communication relay module. However, presently, most hotels include only a cable network and do not include a local area network (LAN) or a wireless communication network, such that high costs are needed to additionally install communication lines.","Recently, some hotels have installed one or two wireless communication relay models in each floor so as to provide a wireless communication service. However, the user of each room may not often acquire a service of a desired bandwidth. As a result, high costs are needed to install an additional wireless communication relay module in all rooms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIGS. 3(","i":["b","c"],"b":"3"},"However, the embodiment of the present invention may be applied to one case in which the hotel environment includes the Coax network and another case in which the hotel environment includes the Ethernet network. If the hotel environment includes the Ethernet network, the hotel server additionally includes the accounting server to charge a usage fee on the VOD viewed by a user who lodges in the hotel.","In addition, from the viewpoint of a protocol layer, if the hotel environment includes the Coax network, Digital Storage Media Command and Control (DSM-CC) is converted into data based on an IP packet, and the IP-packet data is transferred using a cable modem protocol. On the other hand, if the hotel environment includes the Ethernet network, the DSM-CC is transferred as the IP packet.","In the meantime, the access point card may serve as a wireless communication module that transmits radio waves to a notebook computer or wireless phone of a user of each room. The notebook computer or wireless phone used by the user may communicate with an external server through the AP card, the cable network or the router.","The server of the multiple access point control system may provide video content or the like to the user of each room or provide a variety of services suitable for the user to the user of each room.","If the AP card is inserted into the television, the AP card may include middleware to drive a variety of applications provided to the user. In addition, the AP can support the multi-protocol interface, such that it may be used as an access point of the AP wireless communication or may control devices of respective rooms.","The IP-to-RF converter transmits the IP packet over a cable network, and the AP card includes the RF-to-IP converter such that it can provide an Internet-based communication service and a multimedia broadcast service to the user. The AP card includes general-purpose middleware standardized for the application provided to the user. Therefore, the service provided by the hotel administrator can be displayed on the TV regardless of TV functions. The AP card, that enables respective hotels to use different content protection functions so as to charge a usage fee for content, includes an operating system that enables various content protection modules to be implemented with software. Therefore, although respective hotels use different content protection functions, content can be transferred to the user through the same AP card, and a detailed description thereof will hereinafter be described in detail.","In the case of a hotel, a user may request a call service for a specific time from the hotel administrator. In the case of using the multiple access point control system, a reserved message may be transferred to the user through the television.","The AP card may communicate with other devices of each room, and drive the application supported by the multiple protocol interface, such that the user of the room may also control devices of the room through the TV.","The television including the AP card may provide a user interface for enabling the user to control devices of the room. For example, the television including the AP card may display various devices capable of being controlled in each room. The television may display a corresponding room and the positions of devices installed in the corresponding room.","For example, if the AP card communicates with the curtain control device, the user can freely open or close a curtain through the user interface displayed on the TV.","In addition, when adjusting an air-conditioner or a hygrometer, the user does not directly adjust a corresponding device, and can remotely operate the user interface displayed on the TV including the AP card.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Referring to , the entire system according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a back-office , a network infrastructure , devices and applications , etc. The network management server  shown in  carries out functions of the multiple access point control system, and the AP card  carries out functions of the multiple access point.","For example, the back-office  includes a digital headend , a media gateway , a gateway , application servers , a network management server , etc. The back-office  may be used to transmit broadcast data and IP data.

In addition, according to Open Cable Standard, if an emergency alert message is transmitted through Out Of Band (OOB), the emergency alert is compulsorily tuned to a specific channel. However, the above-mentioned methods can be controlled only by a broadcast station, and are unable to provide different message services to individual rooms of a hotel or the like. One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for solving the problems of the related art. Specifically, a management server and a DTV under the coaxial communication environment and the IP communication environment according to the embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail. For example, the management server may be a server that is managed by a hotel or the like.","First of all, the management server and the DTV for use in a hotel under a coaxial communication environment according to one embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail.","Under the condition that a DTV located in one independent space among a plurality of independent spaces physically separated from each other is connected to the management server through coaxial connection, the management server encodes a Transport Stream (TS) packet, multiplexes the encoded TS packet and a general broadcast signal, and transmits the multiplexed TS packet and the general broadcast signal to the DTV. However, a header of the TS packet includes at least one of ID information of the independent space, text data to be displayed, location information of the message file, and a display time period for which the text data is displayed.","Further, the message file may be configured in a XML format. For example, the message file includes at least one of information about the total number of messages contained in the message file, information for identifying whether or not displayed text data is repeated, a type of the text data, information about a location where the text data is displayed, color information of the text data, and transparency information of a background where the text data is displayed.","In the meantime, under the condition that a DTV located in one independent space among a plurality of independent spaces physically separated from each other is connected to the management server via a coaxial line, the DTV receives a TS packet, and decodes the TS packet. If ID information of the independent space defined in the TS packet header is identical to pre-stored ID information of the independent space including the DTV, the DTV extracts the message file using the location information of the message file, and stores the extracted message file. However, a header of the TS packet includes at least one of ID information of the independent space, text data to be displayed, location information of the message file, and a display time period for which the text data is displayed.","Further, the DTV determines whether a current time reaches a target time at which the text data should be displayed using the time period information. If the current time reaches the target time, the DTV displays the text data.","Therefore, according to the above-mentioned method, the differential local messaging service can be provided to individual rooms of a hotel under a coaxial communication environment.","Next, the management server and the DTV for use in a hotel under an IP communication environment according to one embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail.","Under the condition that a DTV located in one independent space among a plurality of independent spaces physically separated from each other is connected to the management server through IP connection, the management server generates a message file including an Application Programming Interfaces (API) command and a parameter related to a display condition, and gains access to an IP address of a DTV to which the generated message file is to be transmitted. If the management server has successfully accessed to the IP address of the DTV, it transmits the generated message file to the DTV of the accessed IP address, and receives information for identifying whether the message file is successfully processed from the DTV.","Further, the message file may be configured in a XML format. For example, the message file may correspond to a command signal for displaying text data defined in the message file. The parameter related to the display condition includes at least one of information about the total number of messages contained in the message file, information for identifying whether or not displayed text data is repeated, a type of the text data, information about a location where the text data is displayed, color information of the text data, and transparency information of a background where the text data is displayed.","In the meantime, under the condition that a DTV located in one independent space among a plurality of independent spaces physically separated from each other is connected to the management server through IP connection, the DTV receives a message file including an API command and a parameter related to a display condition, and parses the received message file. If the API command contained in the parsed message file corresponds to a command signal for displaying the text data defined in the message file, the DTV displays the text data in response to the parameter, and feeds back specific information for identifying the success or failure of processing the message file to the management server.","Further, the specific information for identification is designed to include at least one of an IP address of the DTV and a DTV ID mapped to the IP address.","Therefore, according to the above-mentioned method, the differential local messaging service can be provided to individual rooms of a hotel under an IP communication environment.","The message file according to one embodiment of the present invention can be newly defined as shown in . Individual attributes shown in  will hereinafter be described in detail.","If the message is added, deleted, or changed, the value of 1 is added to the \u2018message_Ver\u2019 attribute, resulting in \u2018message_Ver attribute+1\u2019, such that \u2018message_Ver attribute+1\u2019 is newly distributed to each DTV. When each DTV reads the message file and the \u2018message_Ver\u2019 attribute is increased, the DTV reads a conventional message and newly receives a corresponding message.","The \u2018message_No\u2019 attribute means the total number of messages.","Attributes from the \u2018message_Items\u2019 attribute describes one message.","Content means displayed text data.","If the \u2018additionalInfo\u2019 attribute receives a key signal corresponding to the \u2018Enter\u2019 button among a plurality of buttons of the remote controller, it is connected to an information page of a corresponding ID from among several information pages present in a conventional DTV or STB. For example, the \u2018additionalInfo\u2019 attribute is linked to any of information pages (e.g., weather information page, restaurant menu page, etc.) generally used in a hotel environment or the like, such that the guest can immediately access a corresponding page while the message file is displayed.","The \u2018startTime\u2019 attribute means, for example, a time in 24-hour format, and the \u2018startDate\u2019 attribute means a date.","The \u2018repeat\u2019 attribute determines establishment of repetition on a basis of the \u2018StartTime\u2019 attribute, and \u2018repeatType\u2019 attribute determines the type of repetition, for example, everyday, Monday\u02dcFriday, Monday\u02dcSaturday, etc. If the \u2018repeat\u2019 attribute is disabled, this attribute is meaningless. At a time point at which a specific message begins to be displayed, the \u2018repeat==0 (non repeating)\u2019 message is deleted from an EEPROM, and \u2018repeat==1 (repeating)\u2019 message changes the \u2018startDate\u2019 attribute to another on the basis of the \u2018repeatType\u2019 condition. For example, if it is assumed that the \u2018repeatType\u2019 field indicates the range of Monday\u02dcFriday and a date of today is October 16(Friday), the \u2018startDate\u2019 attribute is changed to October 19(Monday) and is overwritten in an EEPROM.","The \u2018messageType\u2019 attribute may display a unique message. For example, the welcome message may display not only a predetermined audio\/video stream but also content. The fire alarm message may inform the guest of where an emergency exit or a shelter is. If a predetermined period of time has elapsed, the fire alarm message is switched off. For another example, the \u2018messageType\u2019 attribute may also indicate a general message as a default.","The \u2018exposureSeconds\u2019 attribute may indicate an exposure time in seconds. A corresponding message is continuously displayed during the time defined in the exposureSeconds attribute, is continuously displayed until it is replaced with a new message, or is continuously displayed until a user or guest turns off this message.","The \u2018position\u2019 attribute may indicate an exposure location of a message.","The \u2018letterColor\u2019 attribute may determine an RGB-based color of a letter, and the \u2018BGColor\u2019 attribute may determine an RGB-based color of a background.","The \u2018alpha\u2019 attribute may determine transparenc.","A method for allowing the management server of a hotel or the like to manage the message file shown in  will hereinafter be described in detail.","The management server receives messages through various user interfaces (e.g., web interface and the like), and stores the received messages in a format of a meta data\/script file.","One message file includes at least one message, and the management server may delete unnecessary messages using the time threading scheme. For example, the management server may manage (N+1) messages, where N is the total number of DTVs present in each room of a hotel or the like (that is, N is the number of messages different in individual DTVs), and the value of 1 means one common message.","In case of such messages different in individual DTVs, each message file is entitled to as \u2018message[serial number or room number].xml\u2019, such that it is prevented that a DTV having a different serial number or a different room number gains access to the above message file. If the above-mentioned message design is applied to the embodiment of the present invention, a message capable of being displayed only on a DTV of a specific room can be easily designed, and an identifier is added to a file name, so that an amount of load required for implementing the local messaging service environment of the present invention can be greatly reduced.","Meanwhile, differently from , it is possible to generate an API-based message file as shown in  or .","Particularly,  shows an exemplary case in which an \u2018BannerAttribute\u2019 information displayed on the screen of a DTV located in each room of the hotel is written in Java.","For example, the Xlet application determines attributes of a banner, such that it can generate \u2018BannerAttribute\u2019 information shown in . In addition, the Xlet application registers the generated \u2018BannerAttribute\u2019 information. Further, the \u2018BannerManager\u2019 attribute (e.g., hotel server, management server, etc.) may directly construct a banner image displayed on the display screen according to the generated \u2018BannerAttribute\u2019 information. For this purpose, the \u2018BannerAttribute\u2019 information may be implemented in a Java class.","The \u2018BannerManager\u2019 attribute receives the generated \u2018BannerAttribute\u2019 information from the Xlet application, such that it changes a status of a banner displayed on the display screen. For this purpose, the The \u2018BannerManager\u2019 attribute may include a plurality of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).","In more detail, the \u2018BannerManager\u2019 attribute may include a status control API (setBanner) for controlling the output of the banner in response to a command received from the Xlet application and a status information API (getBanner) for indicating a current output status.","For example, there are four banner states, each of which is displayed by the above-mentioned status information API (getBanner). In more detail, the four banner states are a Not Ready state, a Ready state, an In Progress state, and a Pause state. The Not Ready state means that a banner image is not prepared yet. The Ready state means that a banner image is prepared but not yet displayed. The In-Progress state means that a banner image is displayed on the display screen. The Pause state means that displaying of a banner image is stopped.","If a user desires to display such a display image on the display screen, the application calls the BannerManager in which manner attribute information is registered, and the called BannerManager constructs a banner image using the registered banner attribute information.","For example, the Xlet application may transmit a showMessage command to the BannerManager, such that the BannerManager may display a banner image on the display screen using banner attribute information defined in the BannerAttribute field.","As described above, the hotel management server according to one embodiment of the present invention may configure a message file provided to each room in an XML format (shown in ) or an API format (shown in  or ).","Referring to , under a coaxial communication environment of a hotel or the like, a method for allowing the management server to transmit a message file to a DTV and a method for allowing a DTV to receive\/process the message file will hereinafter be described in detail.","A hotel administrator configures a message file to be transmitted to each room in an XML format using the web interface , and transmits the XML-format message file to the file system  of the management server .","The encoder  of the management server  encodes the received XML file and thus configures a TS packet. However, a header of the TS packet may include the message file name, the \u2018Message_Ver\u2019 attribute (shown in ), an attribute of a pointer-to-actual message file, and an attribute of a pointer-to-end message file. The attribute of each of the pointer-to-actual message file and the pointer-to-end message file may designate an actual position of a message file in a stream.","The transmitter  transmits the TS packet as a carousel stream. The modulator  modulates the received carousel stream into a Radio Frequency (RF) data stream. The multiplexer  multiplexes the RF data stream and a general broadcast signal (e.g., an RF A\/V stream), and transmits the multiplexed result to a DTV of each room of the hotel.","The tuner  of the DTV  receives the encoded TS packet from the multiplexer . The decoder  analyzes the header of the TS packet. If the ID information of the independent space defined in the TS packet is identical to pre stored ID information of an independent space including the DTV, the XML parser  extracts the message file using the location information of the message file.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a first case (1) in which the message file is either a common message or a file for accurately designating a serial number and a DTV ID of a corresponding DTV, and\/or in a second case (2) in which the \u2018Message_Ver\u2019 attribute value is higher than an attribute value of a current message file, the system according to the embodiment of the present invention extracts a message file from a stream using the pointer-to-actual message file and the pointer-to-end-of-message file attribute, and transmits the extracted message file to the XML parser.","The XML parser  extracts information stored in the message file, and stores the extracted information in the file system . The display unit  displays text data of the message file when the StartTime\/date condition is satisfied.","Referring to , under an IP communication environment of a hotel or the like, a method for allowing the management server to transmit a message file to a DTV and a method for allowing a DTV to receive\/process the message file will hereinafter be described in detail.","The file system  of the management server  of the hotel or the like generates an XML file including an API command and a parameter related to a display condition. The CPU  gains access to an IP address of a DTV  serving as a destination of the generated message file, using the LAN device .","If the above-mentioned access was successful, the generated message file is transmitted to the LAN device  of the DTV  of the accessed IP address. In addition, the management server  receives ID information for identifying the success or failure of processing the message file through the LAN devices  and .","The DTV  receives a message file including an API command and a parameter related to a display condition through the LAN device . The XML parser  parses the received message file. If the API command contained in the parsed message file corresponds to a command signal for displaying the text data defined in the message file, the display unit  displays the text data in response to the parameter, and feeds back specific information for identifying the success or failure of processing the message file to the management server through the LAN device .","In other words, under the IP communication environment, the management server can manage and control respective DTVs in real time using the API call scheme. The management server can determine whether to display all messages and control display times of all the messages, such that an amount of data to be transmitted to each DTV is reduced and the DTV need not store the message file therein.","The system for use in the IP communication environment transmits XML information in the same manner as a command such that it can control the displaying of one message of each DTV, differently from the coaxial communication environment in which each DTV receives and maintains a raw message file. In addition, the system for use in the IP communication environment need not designate an ID of a target ID, and may gain directly access to an IP address of a corresponding DTV and transmit a message file (e.g., XML file).","However, the message file includes, for example, an API command and parameters related to a display condition. The API command may correspond to a command signal for displaying text data defined in the message file. The parameter related to the display condition includes at least one of information about the total number of messages contained in the message file, information for identifying whether or not displayed text data is repeated, a type of the text data, information about a location where the text data is displayed, color information of the text data, and transparency information of a background where the text data is displayed.","In the meantime, if the DTV  receives the message file from the management server , it extracts the API command, i.e., a command signal for displaying text data defined in the above-mentioned message file, and displays messages in response to the aforementioned parameters in real time. The DTV  may transmit a response signal to the management server .","The response signal may include ID information for identifying the success or failure of processing the above-mentioned message file. For example, the ID information may be 1) at least one of an IP address and a DTV ID mapped to the IP address, 2) content of text data, or 3) information indicating the success (OK) or failure (NG) of displaying the text data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0209"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 20","FIG. 14","FIG. 21","FIG. 22","FIGS. 19 to 22"]},"Under the condition that a management server is connected to a DTV located in one independent space among a plurality of independent spaces physically separated from one another, the DTV including the AP card receives the message file shown in  or the message file shown in  or  from the management server. However, the management server may be managed by a hotel or the like. The message file may include ID information of the independent space and primary additional information mapped to the ID information of the independent space.","Further, the ID information of the independent space may correspond to, for example, an ID of each room belonging to one hotel. For example, the primary additional information may include at least one of hotel advertisement information, neighbor map information, restaurant information, event information reserved in the hotel, and information about hotel facilities.","Therefore, the hotel server can provide primary additional information customized for a guest of each room to a DTV of the room, such that the DTV can display the display image as shown in . Alternatively, if a guest of each room enters the corresponding room, the welcome message shown in  may also be displayed on the DTV.","In contrast, a system according to yet another embodiment of the present invention firstly determines whether the independent space ID information contained in the message file is identical to ID information of a current independent space, instead of unconditionally parsing and displaying the above-mentioned primary additional information. If the independent space ID information contained in the message file and the current independent space ID information are identical to each other, the primary additional information is displayed. Therefore, the hotel management server can provide various data services to individual rooms, and increase the protection of guest privacy.","Furthermore, the DTV according to the present invention transmits a request signal for requesting secondary additional information corresponding to the first additional information and a response signal including the above-mentioned independent space ID information to the management server. The DTV displays the secondary additional information received from the management server as shown in . Although  shows only secondary additional information corresponding to the restaurant item as an example of the above-mentioned primary additional information, the DTV according to the present invention may also transmit a request signal for requesting secondary additional information corresponding to other items (e.g., neighbor map, event, and hotel facility items) and a response signal including the above-mentioned independent space ID information to the management server, and the management server may provide the secondary additional information to the DTV in response to the request signal and the independent space ID information. Subsequently, the management server may also provide not only a signal for requesting third additional information related to secondary additional information, but also another signal for requesting third additional information related to a response signal including the independent space ID information to the DTV corresponding to the independent space ID information. For example, although not shown in the drawing, if the guest of the hotel room selects the Chinese Food item, names and locations (addresses) of the principal Chinese restaurants may be provided to the DTV. Moreover, as well as information about the neighbor map, event, and hotel facilities, transportation and weather information may be further added to the DTV.","When the hotel management server provides additional information to a DTV of each room and receives a response signal from each room of the hotel, the hotel management server stores ID information of each room. As a result, the hotel management server can also process different request signals from several rooms. Therefore, the interactive service can be achieved between the DTV located in each room of the hotel and the management server, the management server need not initially transmit heavy data to all DTVs of the hotel, and can provide more detailed information related to guest-requested information to the guest. Technically, the AP card contained in the DTV is designed to convert data of cable modem type into data of IP type.","Therefore, the system according to the embodiment of the present invention provides the messaging interface between the DTV of each room of the hotel and the management server, such that the hotel administrator or hotelier can differentially provide various messages to respective rooms.","Regardless of a physical communication environment of the hotel (e.g., coaxial communication environment or IP communication environment), the system according to the embodiment of the present invention can implement the local messaging service in the hotel. Furthermore, the welcome message may be automatically transmitted to each guest through the PMS server or the like, or a function for providing information about food menus to the guest may be easily added to the system. In addition, the system may interoperate with a GEM broadcast system, such that it can recognize detailed information about the corresponding message using the GEM application.","In the meantime, the product invention and the process invention have been disclosed in the present invention, and the product invention may be complementary to the process invention as necessary.","The method disclosed in the present invention may be implemented in the form of program commands executable by a variety of computer means, and recorded on a computer-readable recording medium.","The computer-readable recording medium may include program commands, data files, data structures, etc. individually or in combination.
