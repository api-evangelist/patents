title: Resolving metadata matched to media content
abstract: Managing a plurality of states of metadata. Each of the states stores one or more items of metadata that have been automatically matched and obtained for media content (e.g., for rendering by a media player). The invention resolves the matched metadata by selectively applying some or all of the matched metadata items without user intervention (e.g., based on a user-specified threshold). In one embodiment, the invention selectively applies some or all of the matched metadata items based on a trustworthiness rating associated with the metadata match. The invention displays the remaining metadata items to the user for review and acceptance or rejection.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of metadata for media content. In particular, embodiments of this invention relate to accepting or rejecting metadata matched to media content.","Due to recent advances in technology, computer users are now able to enjoy many features that provide an improved user experience, such as playing various media and multimedia content on their personal or laptop computers. For example, most computers today are able to play compact discs (CDs) so users can listen to their favorite musical artists while working on their computers. Many computers are also equipped with digital versatile disc (DVD) drives enabling users to watch movies.","In some multimedia environments, a computer has access to a computer-readable medium storing compressed media files such as Moving Picture Experts Group audio layer-3 (MP3) files and WINDOWS MEDIA technologies audio (WMA) and video files. The computer typically organizes the media files into playlists when the compressed media files are played on the computer. The files may be organized according to metadata or other property data associated with the media content. Metadata for a digital media file such as an audio file includes general information pertaining to the media file itself. This information is typically stored within the file. For example, an audio file may have metadata tags for the song title, song artist, album title, and a rating. For example, in the case of audio media files, the files may be organized by album, artist, genre, date, or some user-specified selection and ordering. A user easily navigates through this organization using menus and graphical displays to render the desired media files.","However, some media files lack metadata or have metadata that needs to be updated. The organization of such media files without sufficient metadata is limited. Some existing systems request metadata for audio content. However, these existing systems fail to obtain metadata for media content in a way that is compelling to users while not being overly intrusive. There is a need for a metadata service that automatically, without user intervention and in the background, updates all of the media content of the user as specified by the user regardless of the quality of the metadata currently in the file storing the media content. Existing systems further fail to provide the user with the same metadata experience when inserting any computer-readable medium storing content. The quality of the metadata is important because selecting music can be the bulk of the work in listening to music (e.g., users often listen to the radio because someone else has taken on the burden of selecting the music), particularly when users have access to large music collections (e.g., digital formats, P2P, etc.).","Accordingly, a system for resolving metadata matched to media content is desired to address one or more of these and other disadvantages.","Embodiments of the invention include managing a plurality of states of metadata. Each of the states includes one or more items of metadata that have been automatically matched and obtained for media content (e.g., for rendering by a media player). The invention resolves the matched metadata by selectively applying some or all of the matched metadata items without user intervention (e.g., based on a user-specified threshold). For example, the invention selectively applies some or all of the matched metadata based on a trustworthiness rating associated with the metadata match. The invention replaces each item of metadata associated with one state with a corresponding item of the obtained metadata associated with another state. The replaced metadata items are stored in a history data structure for future use. For example, a user may request to \u201cundo\u201d a change to metadata for an item of media content and return to a previously stored state. The invention displays the unapplied metadata items to the user for review and acceptance or rejection. The invention enables the user to accept the displayed metadata items or search for alternative metadata for the media content. The invention improves the metadata experience for the user.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a method processes data in a media player. The method includes generating a request for metadata from a metadata provider. The requested metadata is associated with media content adapted for rendering by the media player. The method also includes receiving return metadata from the metadata provider in response to the request for metadata and receiving a trustworthiness rating corresponding to the return metadata.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method manages a plurality of metadata states. Each metadata state includes one or more items of metadata associated with media content rendered by a media player. The method includes receiving a request from a user to replace one metadata state with another metadata state. The method also includes replacing each set of metadata items associated with the one metadata state with a corresponding set of metadata items associated with the other metadata state in response to the received request.","In accordance with still another aspect of the invention, a system includes one or more computer-readable media that have computer-executable components for managing one or more items of metadata associated with media content rendered by a media player. The components include a communications component for receiving metadata associated with the media content. The communications component further receives a trustworthiness rating associated with the received metadata. The system also includes an authoring module for selectively applying the received metadata to the media content based on a trustworthiness rating received via the communications component.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a method updates metadata in a computer system having a user interface including a display and being responsive to a user interface selection device. The method includes receiving metadata that corresponds to media content from a metadata provider and displaying the received metadata to the user on the display. The method also includes receiving a selection request from the user via the user interface selection device. The selection request specifies acceptance or rejection of the displayed metadata. The method also includes performing an action on the displayed metadata in response to the received selection request.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a user interface enables a user to select one of a plurality of values associated with a metadata item. The metadata item is associated with media content. The user interface includes one or more data fields. Each data field displays a metadata value associated with the metadata item. The user interface also includes a selection field for receiving a command from a user. The command selects one or more of the metadata values from the data fields for association with the metadata item and storage with the media content. The user interface also includes a query field for receiving a search term from the user. The search term describes the media content and enables determination of another metadata value relevant to the media item based on the received search term.","In accordance with still another aspect of the invention, a computer-readable medium stores a data structure representing a media content file. The data structure includes a data field storing media content for rendering by a media player. The data structure also includes a history field that stores a plurality of metadata states for the media content. Each metadata state includes one or more items of metadata associated with the media content.","Alternatively, the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","In an embodiment, the invention includes processing metadata received from a metadata provider for an item of media content. The invention includes resolving the metadata by determining whether the received metadata should be associated with the item of media content. The invention prompts a user to accept or reject the received metadata. Alternatively or in addition, the invention determines whether to prompt the user based on a trustworthiness rating received from the metadata provider and associated with the media content. The trustworthiness rating represents a quality metric describing the confidence placed in matching the metadata to the media content. An item of metadata for media content includes an identifier (e.g., \u201cSong Title\u201d) and\/or a value (e.g., \u201cSong A\u201d) specific to the media content. For example, the items of metadata may be delineated by an identifier or the items may simply comprise a series of values concatenated in a specific order.","Media Environment","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrates an exemplary multimedia environment in which the invention may be used. A system  has one or more computers  coupled to one or more devices providing media content including audio data, video data, and\/or image data. For example, the devices may include a compact disc (CD) , a camcorder , or a camera . The computer  accesses the media content as input and can render or store the media content as a digital media file to a computer-readable medium .","In one embodiment, the computer  stores media content on a computer-readable medium  for use by a media player program associated with a consumer electronic device . The consumer electronic device  includes any suitable rendering filter or media player or device that is configured to render digital media so that the user can experience the content that is embodied on the medium . For example, suitable media player applications include a CD media player and a DVD media player.","Media players, consumer electronic devices , or the like may be organized according to the capabilities of the media player. Each media player has a media type that identifies the type of media that the media player is capable of rendering. For example, the media type (also referred to as a playlist summary type, a menu summary type, or the like) includes one or more of the following: audio, video, and still image. Some media players include audio-only players such as portable CD players, car receivers, and DVD players. Other media players further include audio and still image capable players including portable and set-top DVD players optionally capable of rendering images with audio simultaneously. Other media players further include audio, still image, and video capable players. Exemplary consumer electronic devices  include, but are not limited to, the following: a portable CD player, a Moving Picture Experts Group audio layer-3 (MP3) player, an audio system in an automobile, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, or the like.","One aspect of the present invention enables the user or, particularly, enables a media player program executing on computing device  or client, to access, retrieve, and display for the user, so-called metadata. Those skilled in the art are familiar with metadata, which is simply information about data. In the context of the present invention, metadata includes information related to specific content of a digital media file being played on the media player. Basic metadata includes a title, composer, performer, genre, a description of content, and the like. Extended metadata includes cover art, performer biographies, reviews, related performers, where to buy similar items, upcoming concerts, ticket sales, URLs to other related experiences including purchase opportunities, and the like.","The user of consumer electronic device  inserts a computer-readable medium storing a digital media file into computer , or otherwise causes the content of the digital media file to be experienced. In the embodiment of , metadata provider  matches metadata to the specific media content that is being experienced by the user. Metadata provider  then returns the metadata to computer .","In the examples herein, the media content of the digital media file is described in the context of content embodied on a CD or a DVD. It is to be appreciated and understood that the media content may be embodied on any suitable media, including digital files downloaded to memory accessible by computer , and that the specific examples described herein are given to further understanding of the inventive principles. For convenience, a digital media file refers to one or more files representing, for example, a single song track or a collection of tracks such as would be found on an audio CD. The media content may include, without limitation, specially encoded media content in the form of an encoded media file.","In one embodiment, an exemplary consumer electronic device  or media player includes or has access to one or more computer-readable media having computer-executable components for reconciling metadata automatically matched to media content. The media content is stored in a file on a computer-readable medium. In one example, the metadata is available from a metadata provider  via a data communication network . The computer  and metadata provider  are coupled to the data communication network . While the network  includes the Internet in one example, the teachings of the invention may be applied to any data communication network. Further, the invention may be described in terms of computer  acting as a client (e.g., media player software) requesting and receiving metadata from metadata provider  acting as a server as shown in . However, it is contemplated by the inventors that the invention is operable in other network systems. That is, the invention is not limited to a client\/server network system illustrated in . For example, the invention may be applicable in a peer-to-peer network system.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the components are shown to execute on consumer device  for simplicity. It is to be understood that any of the components may execute on the consumer device , computer , or any other computing device (e.g., remote from the user or device ) or combination thereof. The components are further described below with reference to  and . The components include a communications component , an authoring module , a user interface component , and a rollback module . As described in greater detail herein, the communications component  receives metadata associated with the media content from the metadata provider . The communications component  further receives a trustworthiness rating associated with the received metadata from the metadata provider . As described above, the communications component  may execute on computer  to communicate with metadata provider  via the network . As metadata automatically matched to media content is received by the communications component , the authoring module  selectively applies the received metadata to the media content based on the received trustworthiness rating. The user interface component  displays, to the user for review based on the received trustworthiness rating, the items of metadata received via the communications component . The rollback module  maintains a history data structure in the file storing the received metadata.","Those skilled in the art will note that the invention software may be implemented with any number and organization of components or modules. That is, the invention is not limited to the specific configuration of components , , , and . Further, those skilled in the art will note that the invention may include a user interface such as the media player executing on consumer electronic device  or may lack a user interface (e.g., perform metadata resolution silently in the background independent of a media player).","Metadata Reconciliation","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates a reconciliation protocol for resolving metadata according to the invention. The invention software (e.g., executing in a media player) requests metadata for media content from a metadata provider. A metadata provider includes any source that provides metadata or other property data including, but not limited to, a human operator, a local cache, a media library, or a remote server. Metadata includes, but is not limited to, at least one of the following: an album title, an artist name, a song title, a genre, a composer name, a track number, a studio, a director, and a rating. In one embodiment, the requests are generated automatically by a media player attempting to obtain metadata silently in the background (e.g., without explicit user acceptance or validation). In another embodiment, the metadata is continuously delivered via a metadata broadcast channel (e.g., using push technology) such that the invention software has access (e.g., locally) to updated metadata for all media content.","In one example, when performing automatic metadata fetching on a large number of tracks of a compact disc, the invention processes the tracks in a specific order to raise the perceived speed at which the metadata is being updated. The order favors tracks having identifiers (e.g., WMContentID or a table of contents value) over those tracks lacking identifiers. That is, the media player generates metadata requests for tracks having identifiers, then generates requests for the remaining tracks as the requests lacking identifiers result in slower, more server intensive metadata matching (e.g., via \u201cfuzzy\u201d matching algorithms). In addition, foreground operations take precedence over the background processing to further improve the perceived speed of the metadata update process. For example, when a user inserts a CD or DVD, plays a song, or views a given folder in the library while the background queue is filled with work, the metadata is requested with high priority.","The metadata provider identifies metadata matched to the media content, determines the identified metadata to be relevant to the media content, and sends the matched metadata to the invention software. The invention software receives the matched metadata from the metadata provider at . In response to the received metadata, the invention software reconciles the received metadata by performing various actions based on a trustworthiness rating or other confidence rating associated with the received metadata. The various actions include updating the media files, renaming the files, and organizing directory structures. For example, if the trustworthiness rating indicates a high degree of confidence with the metadata match at , the received metadata is automatically applied (e.g., stored with) the media content at  without user intervention.","The invention applies the metadata in part by managing a plurality of states of metadata via a history data structure. The history data structure stores at least one metadata state for the item of media content (e.g., in the file storing the media content). Each of the metadata states includes one or more items of metadata associated with the item of media content. The invention software retrieves previous states of metadata as needed. For example, if the received trustworthiness rating indicates a low degree of confidence with the metadata match at , the user is prompted to review and accept or reject the received metadata. The invention software displays the received items of metadata to the user for review at  and prompts the user to review and\/or accept the received metadata. In another embodiment, the invention software displays metadata items to the user for review in response to a request from the user to edit the metadata associated with a particular item of media content.","The invention software receives a selection request from the user at . If the user indicates acceptance of the received metadata via the selection request at , the invention software updates the history data structure and stores the received metadata with the media content at . If the user indicates rejection of the received metadata at , the invention software provides other options to the user at  that are described with reference to  below. For example, the user may request that the invention software replace the received metadata with previously received metadata stored in the history data structure. That is, the invention software replaces each item of metadata associated with one metadata state with a corresponding item of metadata from another metadata state stored in the history data structure. If the suggested metadata had already been stored with the media content, the invention software performs a \u201croll back\u201d or otherwise removes the match resulting from the automated metadata operation.","For example, the song \u201cSongA.MP3\u201d is matched to metadata including the song title \u201cSong A\u201d and the artist name \u201cArtist A.\u201d At a later time, the user changes the song title to \u201cSong A\u2014Live in St. Louis\u201d by matching it to another compact disc. The user then determines that the subsequent song title update was incorrect. With the invention software, the user may \u201cundo\u201d the most recent change and restore the previous song title without a full \u201croll back\u201d to a state of the media content lacking any metadata. It is contemplated by the inventors that the metadata states may be stored in any number of data structures including a single history data structure as illustrated in .","The invention maintains a metadata tag such as \u201cWMRollbackMetadata\u201d in the history data structure stored in the media file. When replacing an existing metadata state with an updated metadata state, the invention software stores the existing metadata state in the history data structure with the WMRollbackMetadata tag to enable future access (e.g., a future \u201cundo\u201d operation) to the replaced metadata state. If the WMRollbackMetadata tag does not exist, the invention software creates the tag and populates the history data structure with the existing metadata state. In one embodiment, the WMRollbackMetadata tag stores any number of previous metadata states and\/or the current metadata state. At any point in time (e.g., not dependent on a database), the user may \u201cundo\u201d any or all changes made to the current metadata state by accessing the data stored by the WMRollbackMetadata tag.","Those skilled in the art will note that the WMRollbackMetadata tag may be implemented in any number of ways, some of which are known in the art. In one embodiment, the invention stores the WMRollbackMetadata tag data along with other tag data in binary form in a persisted property data structure.","One or more computer-readable media have computer-executable instructions for performing the method illustrated in .","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a user interface  for selecting metadata for association with media content. The user interface  displays existing metadata and updated metadata for the user to accept, reject, or edit the displayed metadata. In an embodiment in which user intervention is desired, the invention updates metadata in a computer system having the user interface  including a display and being responsive to a user interface selection device. The user interface  may also include a display device. The invention software receives metadata corresponding to media content from the metadata provider and displays the received metadata to the user on the display in the user interface . The invention software further receives a selection request from the user via the user interface selection device specifying acceptance or rejection of the displayed metadata. For example, the user selects an \u201caccept\u201d button to accept or approve the displayed metadata for storage and association with a particular item of media content. Rejection of the received metadata includes, but is not limited to, a request from the user to reject the displayed metadata, search for alternative metadata, edit some or all of the received metadata, restore previously received metadata, and\/or cancel the metadata operation. For example, the user selects an \u201cedit\u201d button in the user interface to manually enter track, album, artist, and genre information about a specific track. Further, the user selects a \u201csearch\u201d button in the user interface to refine the search for metadata and submit the refined search to obtain other metadata.","The invention software performs an action on the received metadata in response to the received selection request. Performing the action includes, but is not limited to, storing the received metadata with the media content, storing the received metadata in a cache, and discarding the received metadata. In particular, the user interface  enables the user to select one of a plurality of values associated with a metadata item. The user interface  includes one or more data fields. Each of the data fields displays a metadata value associated with the metadata item. The user interface  also includes a selection field. The selection field receives a command from the user. The command selects one or more of the metadata values from the data fields for association with the metadata item and storage with the media content. The selection field includes a plurality of checkboxes each associated with one of the data fields, a button which indicates acceptance of the selected metadata value, or any other user interface element for indicating the command. For example, the selection field receives a command from the user to edit the displayed metadata values. The user interface  further includes a rating field displaying a trustworthiness rating associated with the metadata value for each of the data fields. The user interface  also includes a query field for receiving a search term from the user. The search term describes the media content and enables determination of another metadata value relevant to the media item based on the received search term. For example, the search term may include an artist name or album title or a portion thereof. The invention software sends the search term to the metadata provider. The metadata provider searches for additional metadata values based on the search term, and delivers the additional metadata values to the invention software for display in user interface .","In one embodiment, the invention displays \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d metadata to the user in the user interface . The user selects \u201cok\u201d to revert to the \u201cbefore\u201d metadata if an error is detected in the \u201cafter\u201d metadata. The \u201cbefore\u201d metadata is stored in the media content file itself. In this manner, the undo or revert operation may be performed subsequently (e.g., on a different computer) as the \u201cbefore\u201d metadata is encapsulated with the file storing the media content. Alternatively, or in addition, the user interface provides an \u201cedit\u201d element enabling the user to accept some of the metadata items and to edit or reject other metadata items. Further, the invention generates a popup window or other window element for receiving edits to the metadata from the user. Those skilled in the art will note that the user interface  in  is exemplary. It is contemplated by the inventors that the user interface  of the invention may display a plurality of metadata states for selection by the user (not shown).","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of invention software for resolving metadata matched to media content based on a trustworthiness rating associated with the match. Some users specifically want to be notified of any suggested changes in metadata prior to the changes being applied. After the user approves the changes, the changes are made. The invention software responds to a \u201cquality\u201d metric or other rating (e.g., a trustworthiness rating) on metadata matches. Based on the trustworthiness rating, the invention decides when to ask the user to manually accept a proposed change or perform any other action. Further, the invention software alternatively receives a plurality of trustworthiness ratings and collectively displays the received plurality of trustworthiness ratings to the user. In this manner, the user is bothered only when necessary.","In particular, the invention software generates a request for metadata from the metadata provider at  and receives return metadata from the metadata provider in response to the request for metadata at . In addition, the invention software receives a trustworthiness rating corresponding to the return metadata at . The received trustworthiness rating represents a degree of relevance of the return metadata to the media content. In one form, the received trustworthiness rating includes a percentage (e.g., similar to ranked search results from a search engine) or qualifying language. Based on the received trustworthiness rating, the invention software performs actions automatically, in the background, based on the threshold defined by the user (see ). The actions include, but are not limited to, storing the return metadata with the media content (e.g., the rating indicates a high degree of relevance), storing the received trustworthiness rating with the media content, or prompting the user to accept the return metadata (e.g., the rating indicates a low degree of relevance). That is, if the received trustworthiness rating indicates that the return metadata matches the media content, the invention software stores the return metadata with the media content without intervention from the user. If the received trustworthiness rating indicates that the return metadata may not match the media content, the invention software prompts the user to review and accept or reject the return metadata at . In general, the invention software operates to perform as many metadata updates as possible without user intervention if authorized by the user to do so.","One or more computer-readable media have computer-executable instructions for performing the method illustrated in .","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a user interface  for specifying rules for automatic disposition of received metadata. The user sets an option that defines a threshold and the associated behavior for that threshold. The user interface  includes a reconciliation field for displaying one or more reconciliation rules for selection by the user. Each of the reconciliation rules specifies an action to perform in response to the trustworthiness rating displayed in the rating field of the user interface  of .","In one embodiment, the threshold levels may be associated with the criteria used to identify the metadata. For example, if an identifier was used to match the metadata to the media content, the invention software may silently update the media content file without user intervention as such matching has a high degree of confidence. If a compact disc table of contents (TOC) value was used to match the metadata, the invention software also silently updates the media content file but also tags the metadata as having a lower degree of confidence. If other means were used to match the metadata (e.g., fuzzy means such as enhanced text matching), the invention software either prompts the user for each item of metadata or batches several items for display to the user (e.g., during startup or during regular intervals).","In one example, a TOC value takes the form of a physical identifier for a compact disc identifying the specific digital media file based on the offsets of each track on the disc. The TOC, defined by a well-known specification referred to as the Red Book, identifies an audio CD based absolute times for the start of each track. The TOC, found in the CD's lead-in area, is expected to be the same for all like-entitled CDs published from the same source.","Referring next to , a block diagram illustrates an exemplary computer-readable medium  storing a data structure representing a media content file according to the invention. The data structure includes a data field storing media content  for rendering by a media player. The data structure also includes a history field such as a history data structure  storing a plurality of metadata states  for the media content  such as metadata state #1 through metadata state #N. Each of the metadata states  includes one or more items of metadata associated with the media content .","In one embodiment, the history data structure  defines an empty metadata state for the media content . The invention software enables the user to remove all metadata from the media content  by replacing each item of metadata comprises replacing each item of metadata associated with the one state with a null value from the empty metadata state in response to a single command from the user.","For example, the history data structure  stores an existing metadata state, an updated metadata state, and\/or an empty metadata state in which each of the items of metadata has a null value associated therewith. In one embodiment, state #1 in the exemplary history data structure  of  represents a state of the media content  lacking any metadata (e.g., as represented by the WMRollbackMetadata tag discussed previously).","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["130","130","130","132","134","136","134","132","136"]},"The computer  typically has at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media, which include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, may be any available medium that can be accessed by computer . By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. For example, computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to store the desired information and that can be accessed by computer .

Those skilled in the art are familiar with the modulated data signal, which has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. Wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media, such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media, are examples of communication media. Combinations of the any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of removable and\/or non-removable, volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory.

These and other input devices are connected to processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a Universal Serial Bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor , computers often include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as a printer and speakers, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface (not shown).","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer .
