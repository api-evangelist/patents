The metal used here may be gold, silver, copper, or aluminum, with silver being generally used as a wiring material. Ink with silver, which usually contains silver metal dispersed in a dispersion solvent, is patterned on an interconnection substrate, and silver metal in the ink is sintered to form wiring. It is known that, when used as an electrically conductive material, silver metal is required to be sintered at a lower temperature, making use of melting point depression caused by the fine size of the dispersed silver metal particles. Fine metal nanoparticles of a nanoscale are raising expectations as a material sintering at a low temperature.","On the other hand, silver metal particles of such a fine size as to cause melting point depression are prone to contact and aggregate with each other, and a dispersant is required in the ink for preventing such aggregation. However, sintering the silver metal particles in the ink containing a dispersant may result in residual impurities originated from the dispersant. It is thus usually desired to remove the impurities by a high-temperature treatment or the like.","A general method of preparing silver nanoparticles includes, for example, reducing a silver salt composed of an inorganic acid and silver, such as silver nitrate, in the presence of a dispersant. With this method, however, a residual acid component originated from the silver salt may result, and high-temperature treatment is required for removal of the dispersant.","A method of forming silver metal with a silver salt containing an organic acid, instead of the inorganic acid, has also been reported. The organic silver proposed is, for example, silver salt of long-chain carboxylic acid, which is thermally decomposed or reduced in the presence of an alkylamine (Patent Publications 1 to 5). To the silver nanoparticles prepared from any organic silver, carboxylic acid or silver carboxylate is adhered, which is nonvolatile and thermally decomposed at higher temperatures. Thus in order to obtain a silver element, such as silver film or line, of excel lent electrical conductivity, heat-treatment at not lower than 200\u00b0 C. for a prolonged period of time may be required.","There have recently been made active attempts to form silver metal on a transparent resin substrate. A transparent resin substrate generally has a lower softening point compared to glass or the like, and thus a silver-forming material sintering at low temperatures is desired which realizes formation of silver metal through heating at not higher than 150\u00b0 C. Sintering at low temperatures calls for removal at low temperatures of the dispersant adhered on the silver nanoparticles. Further, for the production of a durable metal-resin substrate, strong bond is required between the transparent resin substrate and the silver element.","As means for low temperature sintering, there has been proposed a method of mixing silver oxalate and amine to produce silver nanoparticles of silver oxalate-amine complex having a thermal decomposition temperature of 110\u00b0 C. (Patent Publication 6). The silver nanoparticles obtained by this method provide a silver element, such as a metal film having good electrical conductivity, through sintering at not higher than 150\u00b0 C., but this publication discloses nothing about durability, including adhesivity, of the obtained silver element. It is assumed that pure silver element obtained by such a mechanism of action to leave no residual organic substance in the resulting film has poor adhesivity to a substrate.","On the other hand, as means for improving adhesivity or strength of a silver element, there has been reported to use a composition wherein an organic polymer having a urethane group and a diol group is hybridized with an inorganic material (Patent Publication 7). However, with an organic polymer, which will remain as a resistive component in the resulting electrically conductive film, electrical conductivity comparable to bulk silver is hard to be achieved.","Patent Publication 1: JP 2005-60824-A","Patent Publication 2: JP 2007-84879-A","Patent Publication 3: WO 2004\/012884","Patent Publication 4: JP 2004-27347-A","Patent Publication 5: JP 2009-185390-A","Patent Publication 6: JP 2010-265543-A","Patent Publication 7: WO 2007\/148684","It is an object of the present invention to provide silver nanoparticles having excellent dispersion stability in a solvent, and capable of forming on a substrate a silver element, such as a silver film or line, having excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity through heating even at a lower temperature for a short time, as well as a method for preparing the same and a dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticle. It is also an object of the present invent ion to provide use of the silver nanoparticles or the dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticle for the formation on a substrate of a silver element, such as a silver film or line, having excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a substrate having a silver element, such as a silver film or line, formed thereon, with excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity, as well as a method for producing the substrate having a silver element formed thereon.","According to the present invention, there is provided silver nanoparticles obtained by reduction treatment (treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment) of a silver-containing composition comprising:","silver compound (A) represented by formula (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"13.63mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09496069-20161115-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"amine compound (B) having a primary amino group; and","polymer (C) obtained by polymerization of a monomer composition comprising diol (meth)acrylate compound (c1) having a urethane bond represented by formula (2):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0024"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"38.95mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09496069-20161115-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sub":["1 ","2 ","2","n"]},"wherein a content of said amine compound (B) is 1 to 50 mole equivalent of silver elements in said silver compound (A), and a content of said polymer (C) is 0.1 to 0.9 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of silver elements in said silver compound (A).","According to the present invention, there is also provided a method for preparing silver nanoparticles comprising reduction treatment (treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment) of a silver-containing composition comprising: the silver compound (A) represented by the formula (1); the amine compound (B) having a primary amino group; and the polymer (C); wherein a content of said amine compound (B) is 1 to 50 mole equivalent of silver elements in said silver compound (A), and a content of said polymer (C) is 0.1 to 0.9 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of silver elements in said silver compound (A).","According to the present invention, there is further provided a dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles comprising the silver nanoparticles and a solvent (sometimes referred to as a present dispersion liquid hereinbelow).","According to the present invention, there is also provided a substrate having a silver element formed thereon by applying the present dispersion liquid on a substrate, followed by heating.","The silver nanoparticles according to the present invention, which have been obtained by reduction treatment (treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment) of a silver-containing composition containing the silver compound (A), the amine compound (B), and the polymer (C) at a particular ratio, are excellent in dispersion stability in a solvent. The dispersion liquid according to the present invention, which contains the silver nanoparticles and a solvent, is capable of forming on a substrate a silver element, such as a silver film or line, with excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity at a lower temperature of not higher than 150\u00b0 C. Further, sintering at a lower temperature of not higher than 150\u00b0 C., the dispersion liquid of the present invention is capable of forming a silver element on a resin substrate of a low heat resistance. The silver element thus obtained, which exhibits the properties similar to those of bulk silver, maybe expected to be applied not only to wiring materials making use of its electrical conductivity, but also to various fields, including reflective or antibacterial materials.","The present invention will now be explained in detail.","The silver nanoparticles according to the present invention is obtained by the method of the present invention including reduction treatment of a silver-containing composition containing silver compound (A) represented by the formula (1), amine compound (B) having a primary amino group, and particular polymer (C) at a particular ratio.","The silver compound (A) is silver acetonedicarboxylate, and is usually in the form of powder. The silver compound (A) is low in solubility in a solvent and cannot undergo reduction reaction in a homogeneous system, so that stably dispersible nanoparticles are hard to result. However, by combining the silver compound (A) with the amine compound (B) having a primary amino group, the silver compound (A) dissolves to proceed with the reduction reaction in a homogeneous system. Further, the organic structure acetonedicarboxylic acid of the silver compound (A) decomposes into a volatile compound in the reaction system to leave silver only, so that the resulting silver nanoparticles contain no residual nonvolatile carboxylic acid, which allows formation of a silver element, such as a silver metal film or line, through heat treatment at not higher than 150\u00b0 C.","Thus the silver nanoparticles according to the present invention may be used in the formation on a substrate of a silver element, such as a silver film or line, with excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity.","In the silver-containing composition, the content of the amine compound (B) is 1 to 50 mole equivalent of the silver elements in the silver compound (A). At less than 1 mole equivalent, a homogeneous solution cannot be prepared and precipitation is prone to form in the reduction. Over 50 mole equivalent, effects commensurate with the content cannot be achieved.","The amine compound (B) is not particularly limited as long as it has in its structure a primary amino group, which is easy to be coordinated in the silver compound (A). Examples of the amine compound (B) may include 1-butylamine, 1-amylamine, 1-hexylamine, 1-heptylamine, 1-octylamine, 1-nonylamine, 1-decylamine, 1-undecylamine, 1-dodecylamine, 1-tridecylamine, 1-tetradecylamine, 1-pentadecylamine, 1-hexadecylamine, 1-octadecylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine, isobutylamine, isoamylamine, sec-butylamine, tert-butylamine, tert-amylamine, allylamine, oleylamine, benzylamine, 2-phenethylamine, 3-methoxypropylamine, 3-ethoxypropylamine, 3-isopropoxypropylamine, 3-butoxypropylamine, 2-ethylhexyloxypropylamine, 3-decyloxypropylamine, dibutylaminopropylamine, dimethylaminopropylamine, diethylaminopropylamine, and diisopropylaminoethylamine. One or a mixture of two or more of these may be used.","For the purpose of rendering the silver nanoparticles of the present invention particularly excellent in low temperature sintering, the amine compound (B) preferably has a structure which facilitates its removal from the film upon sintering, such as 1-butylamine, 1-amylamine, 1-hexylamine, 1-heptylamine, 1-octylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine, isobutylamine, isoamylamine, sec-butylamine, tert-butylamine, tert-amylamine, allylamine, 3-methoxypropylamine, 3-ethoxypropylamine, 3-isopropoxypropylamine, dimethylaminopropylamine, diethylaminopropylamine, and diisopropylaminoethylamine. One or a mixture of two or more of these may be used.","For the purpose of rendering the silver nanoparticles of the present invention particularly excellent in stability in a solvent, the amine compound (B) preferably has a structure with a side chain which causes steric repulsion, such as 1-decylamine, 1-undecylamine, 1-dodecylamine, 1-tridecylamine, 1-tetradecylamine, 1-pentadecylamine, 1-hexadecylamine, 1-octadecylamine, oleylamine, 2-ethylhexyloxypropylamine, 3-decyloxypropylamine, and dibutylaminopropylamine. One or a mixture of two or more of these may be used.","For the purpose of imparting both the low-temperature sintering and dispersion stability in a solvent to the silver nanoparticles of the present invention, two or more of the amine compound (B) may be used together at an arbitrary ratio, which may suitably be selected according to the desired low-temperature sintering and dispersion stability.","The polymer (C) is a copolymer obtained by polymerization of a monomer composition containing diol (meth)acrylate compound (c1) having a urethane bond represented by the formula (2) (sometimes referred to as monomer (c1) hereinbelow), and at least one monomer (c2) selected from (meth)acrylate monomers, acrylamide monomers, vinyl monomers, vinyl ether monomers, or monomers having an epoxy group.","The polymer (C) has a polar urethane group and two hydroxyl groups (a diol group) structurally derived from the monomer (c1). Each of the urethane and hydroxyl groups alone does not have a very strong interaction with silver, but as the three groups are arranged adjacent to each other, the polymer (C) may efficiently be adsorbed on the surfaces of the silver nanoparticles due to the coordination of the three groups, and may have improved dispersion stability due to the steric repulsion of the remaining polymer chain. When the silver nanoparticles of the present invention are prepared into a dispersion liquid, and applied to and heated on a substrate, the polymer (C) is desorbed from the surfaces of the silver nanoparticles, and will not interfere with the silver element formation. Further, the polymer (C) having been desorbed from the nanoparticle surfaces is directed toward the interface to tightly adhere the resulting silver element, such as a silver metal film or line, to the substrate.","In the formula (2) representing the monomer (c1), Ris a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, with a methyl group being preferred for easy molecular weight regulation.

At less than 20% in molar ratio of the monomer (c1), the adsorption efficiency to the resulting silver nanoparticles may be low to lower the dispersion stability. At over 90% in molar ratio of the monomer (c1), the resulting polymer (C) may associate together to lower the affinity to and thus the dispersion stability in a solvent.","The molecular weight of the polymer (C) in weight average molecular weight is preferably 5000 to 50000, more preferably 7000 to 40000. At less than 5000, the molecule is too small, and the dispersion stability in a solvent due to the steric repulsion may not be improved sufficiently. At over 50000, the polymer (C) may associate together to lower the affinity to and thus the dispersion stability in a solvent.","The polymer (C) may be prepared, for example, by radical polymerization, such as conventional solution, bulk, emulsion, or suspension polymerization of the monomer composition in an atmosphere of or substituted with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or helium, as necessary. The polymerization temperature is usually 0 to 100\u00b0 C., and the duration of the polymerization is usually 1 to 48 hours.","The polymerization may be effected in the presence of a polymerization initiator. Examples of the polymerization initiator may include 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 4,4\u2032-azobis(4-cyanovaleic acid), 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-(5-methyl-2-imidazoline-2-yl)propane) dihydrochloride, 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-(2-imidazoline-2-yl)propane) dihydrochloride, 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutylamide dihydrate, ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, benzoyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, t-butylperoxy-2-ethylhexanoate, t-butyl peroxypivalate, t-butyl peroxydiisobutyrate, lauroyl peroxide, azobisisobutylonitrile, 2,2\u2032-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), t-butyl peroxyneodecanoate (trade name \u201cPerbutyl ND\u201d, manufactured by NOF CORPORATION), and mixtures thereof.

The obtained polymer may be purified by common purification, such as re-precipitation, dialysis, or ultrafiltration.","In the preparation of the silver nanoparticles of the present invention, a solvent may suitably be used for the purpose of regulating the silver concentration or the generation speed of the silver nanoparticles. The amount of the solvent is not particularly limited, and is preferably less than 3000 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the silver compound (A) in view of the productivity and the environmental burden.","The solvent is not particularly limited as long as the silver nanoparticles are dispersed therein, and a single or a mixture of solvents may be used according to the purpose. Examples of the solvent may include methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, tert-amylalcohol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, ethylene glycol, butoxyethanol, methoxyethanol, ethoxyethanol, ethyl carbitol, ethyl carbitol acetate, butyl carbitol, butyl carbitol acetate, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monopropyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, and dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether; alcohols, such as terpineol; ethers, such as acetoxymethoxy propane, phenylglycidyl ether, and ethylene glycol glycidyl; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and \u03b3-butyrolactone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, and isobutyronitrile; aromatics, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene; and water.","In the silver-containing composition, the content of the polymer (C) is 0.1 to 0.9 parts by mass, preferably 0.2 to 0.7 parts by mass, with respect to 100 parts by mass of the silver elements in the silver compound (A). At less than 0.1 parts by mass, the silver nanoparticles, though generated, have low dispersion stability in a solvent, and are prone to precipitation. In addition, the adhesion between the substrate and the silver element obtained by heat-treatment of the dispersion liquid of the present invention is insufficient. At over 0.9 parts by mass, the polymer (C) acts as an aggregating agent to cause precipitation.","In the preparation of the silver-containing composition, the order of mixing the silver compound (A), the amine compound (B), and the polymer (C) is not particularly limited.","The silver nanoparticles according to the present invention may be obtained by the method of the present invention including reduction treatment (treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment) of the silver-containing composition.","The heat treatment may be pyrolytic reduction of a silver compound-amine complex. The heating temperature is preferably not lower than 50\u00b0 C., more preferably 70 to 200\u00b0 C. The treatment time is preferably 5 to 120 minutes.

At less than 1.0 mole equivalent, the amount of the reducing agent is not sufficient, which causes retardation of the silver nanoparticle generation, whereas at over 5.0 mole equivalent, the silver nanoparticles are generated too quickly, which causes aggregation and possible precipitation.","The manner of adding the reducing agent is not particularly limited, and may be adjusted according to its reducing power. A reducing agent with a high reducing power may be diluted and added slowly, which results in stably-dispersed silver nanoparticles without precipitation. A mild reducing agent may be added at a time, or the reaction may proceed by heating. The treatment with a reducing agent may usually be carried out at about room temperature.","After the completion of addition of the reducing agent, the reduction reaction is terminated, and the resulting liquid may preferably be stirred further for promoting coordination to the generated silver nanoparticles. Here, the manner and duration of the stirring are not particularly limited.","The silver nanoparticles of the present invention has a mean volume diameter of usually 1 to 100 nm, and a silver content of usually not less than 90 mass %.","The silver nanoparticles of the present invention may suitably be used, particularly as an electrically conductive material, for forming an excellent silver element, such as a silver metal film or line, through heat treatment.
