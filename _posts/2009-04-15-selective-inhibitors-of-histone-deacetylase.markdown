HDAC-mediated deacetylation of chromatin-bound histones regulates the expression of a variety of genes throughout the genome. Importantly, HDACs have been linked to cancer, as well as other health conditions. To date, eleven major HDAC isoforms have been described (HDACs 1-11). HDACs are categorized into two classes. Class I HDACs include HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8 and HDAC11. Class II HDACs include HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9 and HDAC10. Small molecule HDAC inhibitors that are isoform-selective are useful as therapeutic agents with reduced toxicity and as tools for probing the biology of the HDAC isoforms.","In one aspect provided herein are 1,2-disubstituted-1H-benzimidazole-6-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide compounds, 1,3-disubstituted-indole-6-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide compounds, 1,3-disubstituted-azaindole-6-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide compounds, substituted-1H-pyrrole-2-yl-N-hydroxyacrylamide compounds, and other selective HDAC8 inhibitors, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxides, pharmaceutically active metabolites, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof, which selectively inhibit HDAC8 activity and are used to treat mammals where inhibition of HDAC8 activity would provide benefit.

Acetylation of histone proteins occurs on lysine residues near the N-termini of these proteins. In conjunction with other modifications of histone proteins and DNA, the acetylation state of histones determines whether the chromatin is in a condensed, transcriptionally silent state or in a form more accessible to the transcription machinery of the cell. In general, hyperacetylation of histone proteins is associated with transcriptional activation of genes. The steady-state histone acetylation level arises from the opposing action of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes.","Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine \u03b5-amino groups near the N-termini of histones. This reaction promotes the condensation of chromatin, leading to repression of transcription.","HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) modify gene expression positively or negatively in a cell- and gene-specific manner. HDIs increase the accumulation of acetylated histones, directly influencing chromatin structure and, thereby, the relationship of the nucleosome to gene promoter elements.","Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes modulate gene expression through the deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues on histone proteins. They operate in biological systems as part of multiprotein corepressor complexes. Histone deacetylases have been grouped into three classes. Class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) are zinc containing hydrolase enzymes. The division of the proteins into classes I and II is based on protein size, sequence similarity, and organization of the protein domains.","Members of class I are related to the yeast RPD3 gene product. Class I HDACs include: HDAC1; HDAC2; HDAC3; HDAC8; HDAC11.","HDAC8 is a 377 residue, 42 kDa protein localized to the nucleus of a wide array of tissues, as well as several human tumor cell lines. The wild-type form of full length HDAC8 is described in GenBank Accession Number NP 060956; Buggy, J. J. et al., 350 (Pt 1), 199-205 (2000). The HDAC8 structure was solved with four different hydroxamate inhibitors bound (Somoza et al., 2004, 12, 1325)","Class II are homologues of the yeast HDA1 protein, and include: HDAC4; HDAC5; HDAC6; HDAC7; HDAC9; HDAC10.","Class II HDACs have been further subdivided into classes IIa (HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9) and IIb (HDACs 6 and 10).","The third class of deacetylases consists of the members of the Sir2 family of enzymes. These enzymes have histone deacetylase activity but are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to the class I and class II proteins. They are (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) NAD-dependent and unlike class I HDACs and class II HDACs, they do not contain a catalytic zinc site.","In the cell, HDAC proteins are recruited as part of multicomponent repressor complexes. Several HDAC containing complexes have been characterized, including the N-CoR\/SMRT, Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST complexes. Within these complexes, HDACs 1 and 2 typically interact with the mSin3, Mi-2, or CoREST proteins. HDAC3 and the class IIa HDACs have been shown to interact with SMRT and the related N-CoR protein. A large number of transcription factors have been shown to bind to one of the corepressor complexes as a means of regulating transcription. The recruitment of HDACs by DNA-binding proteins allows histone deacetylation to be directed toward specific regions of the chromatin in order to promote targeted transcriptional repression.","HDAC proteins are promising therapeutic targets on account of their involvement in regulating genes involved in cell cycle progression and control. Inhibition of HDACs has been shown to upregulate genes, including p21WAF\/CIP1, p27, p53, and cyclin E, and to down-regulate genes such as cyclin A and cyclin D. Growth inhibition in several lines of cancer cells has been observed upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors, and in vivo studies have shown that some of these inhibitors are efficacious in slowing tumor growth. The biological activity of each of the HDAC isozymes is determined by a combination of the intrinsic activity of the enzyme and the effects of cofactor binding on reactivity and substrate recognition (Schultz et al., 2004, 43, 11083-11091).","Non-selective HDAC inhibitors inhibit the deacetylase activity of most, if not all, of the HDACs with equal potency. The mechanisms of the anticancer effects of SAHA, a non-selective HDAC inhibitor, are not completely understood, and likely result from both altered gene expression and altered function of proteins regulating cell proliferation and cell death pathways. Non-selective HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA, induce the accumulation of acetylated histone proteins and non histone proteins. Non-histone proteins that are acetylated include, but are not limited to:","Bcl-6 (Oncoprotein); LEF\/TCF (Lymphoid enhancer factor); P53 (Tumor suppressor); Ku70 (Autoantigen with multiple function, including DNA repair); H1F-1\u03b1 (angiogenesis); GATA-1 (Transcription factor); WRN (Werner helicase); E2F-1 (Transcription factor); Smad7 (Transcription factor); Rb (Tumor suppressor); TFIIF (Transcription machinery); c-Jun (Transcription factor); \u03b1-Tubulin (Structural protein); HMGI(Y) (Chromatin structure); ACTR (Nuclear receptor coactivator); Androgen Receptor (Signal transduction); EKLF (Erythroid kruppel-like factor); YY-1 (Transcription factor); NF-\u03baB (RelA) (Transcription factor); MyoD (Transcription factor); Importin a7 (Nuclear pore protein); Hsp90 (Chaperone protein); THEE (Transcription machinery); b-Catenin (Signaltransduction); TFJB (Transcription factor).","Genes whose transcription is altered by histone deacetylase inhibitors include:","1) Genes that are induced by HDAC inhibitors: Cell cycle (p1 and cyclin E); Proapoptotic (Bak, BAX, CD95, and its ligand gelsolin, GADD45\u03b2, p53, Apaf-1 DFF45a, Bim, BAD, TRAIL, DR5, Fas and its ligand, and Caspase 9, -8 and -3); Redox Components (Thioredoxin-binding protein-1, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin and methallothionein 1 L); Chromatin structure (Histone HB); Retinoic acid pathway (RAR\u03b2).","2) Genes that are repressed by HDAC inhibitors: Cell cycle (Cyclin D1 and A, and thymidylate synthase); Antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, c-FLIP, survivin, XIAP); Angiogenic factor (Vascular endothelial growth factor and HIF-Loc); Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IFN-g and IL-1b and -6); Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-controlled genes (STAT5).","HDAC enzymes or isoforms appear to be involved in many different types of cancer. Inhibition of HDACs with HDAC inhibitors results in multiple and desirable anti-cancer effects such as, but not limited to, (i) the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, (ii) the induction of apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells, (iii) cell cycle regulation, (iv) the induction of tumour suppressor genes, and (v) the blocking of tumour angiogenesis (development of new tumour blood vessels). These multiple effects provided by HDAC inhibitors provide a method of treating cancer.","Interest in histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) as targets for pharmaceutical development has centered on the role of HDACs in regulating genes associated with cell-cycle progression and the development and progression of cancer (Kramer et. al. 12, 294-300, (2001)). Several studies have shown that treatment of various cell lines with HDAC inhibitors leads to hyper acetylation of histone proteins and cell-cycle arrest in late Gphase or at the G\/M transition. Genes involved in the cell cycle that have been shown to be up regulated by HDAC inhibitors include p21, p27, p53 and cyclin E. Cyclin A and cyclin D have been reported to be down regulated by HDAC inhibitors. In tumor cell lines, several studies have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors lead to growth inhibition, growth arrest, terminal differentiation and\/or apoptosis. In vivo studies have demonstrated growth inhibition of tumors and a reduction in tumor metastasis as a result of treatment with HDAC inhibitors.","The clearest link between abnormal HDAC activity and cancer occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this condition, a chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor RAR\u03b1 with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) proteins. Both PML-RAR\u03b1 and PLZF-RAR\u03b1 promote the progression of leukemia by repressing retinoic acid-regulated genes through the abnormal recruitment of SMRT-mSin3-HDAC complex (Lin et. al. 391, 811-814 (1998)); Grignani et al. 391, 815-818 (1998)). Whereas the PML-RAR\u03b1 form of the disease is treatable with retinoic acid, the PLZF-RAR\u03b1 form is resistant to this treatment. For a patient with the retinoic acid-resistant form of the disease, the addition of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate to the dosing regimen led to complete clinical and cytogenic remission (Warren et al. 90, 1621-1625, (1998)). HDACs have also been associated with Huntington's disease (Steffan, et al., 413:739-744, \u201cHistone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration in \u201d).","In general, almost all of the inhibitors targeting HDACs are broad spectrum compounds, inhibiting all of the HDAC isoforms with equal potency. These broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors cause the induction of differentiation, growth arrest and\/or apoptosis in a large number of tumor cell lines in vitro.","Clinical administration of broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors (pan HDAC inhibitors) has been associated with many dose limiting toxicities. These include thrombocytopenia, and other hematological toxicities, QTc prolongation and other cardiac toxicities, nausea, fever, fatigue, and anorexia (For example, see 2003, 9(10), 3578-3588; 2002, 8(7), 2142-2148; and 2005, 46, Abs 3978). Selective HDAC inhibitors that selectively inhibit only one HDAC isoform, as opposed to a pan-selective inhibitor, is expected to produce a drug with an improved toxicity profile.","Adverse effects in humans have been reported in several clinical trials using pan-HDAC inhibitors. Originally designed for oncological applications, such toxicities might not be crucial when taking into consideration their therapeutic effects and the high mortality rate of cancer.","Described herein are selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds. Compounds described herein selectively inhibit HDAC8 over other HDAC isoforms (e.g. HDACs 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, and 11).","As described herein, HDAC8 is expressed primarily in delta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas; in small intestinal epithelial cells; and in neuroendocrine cells. Of note, delta cells express and secrete somatostatin, a peptide hormone that inhibits the secretion of insulin and growth hormone. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that HDAC8 activity drives the expression of somatostatin in delta cells. Thus, inhibiting HDAC8 activity is expected to decrease somatostatin expression and secretion from delta cells, and consequently increase systemic insulin and growth hormone levels.","Described herein are methods for inhibiting somatostatin expression in a subject by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Further, described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from an insulin deficiency or a growth hormone deficiency by administering a selective HDAC8 inhibitor to the subject.","T-Cell Lymphomas or Leukemias","HDAC8 is expressed at unusually high levels in tumor cell lines, e.g., Jurkat, HuT78, K562, PC3, and OVCR-3. In fact, as described herein, inhibiting HDAC8 activity decreases proliferation of T-cell derived tumor cells (e.g., Jurkat cells) by apoptosis. In contrast, HDAC8 inhibition does not affect the proliferation of either non-cancerous cells (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells) or tumor cell lines other than T-cell derived lines. Thus, selective HDAC8 inhibitors are useful for slowing or arresting the progression of T-cell derived cancers with lessened or no toxicity to non-cancerous cells.","Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein were screened against tumor cell lines in vitro, and were found to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from T-cell lymphomas or leukemias. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Unlike broad spectrum inhibitors, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein do not cause detectable histone or tubulin acetylation, but lead to a dose dependent decrease in HDAC8 protein levels in treated cells. Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein activated caspases 3, 8 and 9, showing that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptic pathways were involved; accordingly, apoptosis was blocked completely by pan-caspase inhibitors but only partially by inhibitors of specific caspases. Thus, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein are of benefit in the treatment of T-cell lymphomas and leukemias.","Described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T-cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition. Also described herein are methods for treating a subject suffering from a T-cell lymphoma by administering to the subject a population of autologous T-cells that have been exposed to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition ex vivo.","In some embodiments, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds and compositions thereof are used to treat a subject suffering from a T-cell lymphoma, e.g., a peripheral T-cell lymphoma, a lymphoblastic lymphoma, a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or an adult T-cell lymphoma.","In some embodiments, the T-cell lymphoma treatment method includes administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition.","In other embodiments, the T-cell lymphoma treatment includes administering, in addition to a selective HDAC8 inhibitor pharmaceutical composition, one or more additional anti-cancer agents described herein in any combination.","The methods described herein include administering a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vivo by a therapeutically effective amount. In some embodiments, cells derived from a subject to be treated (i.e. autologous cells) are exposed, ex vivo, to a pharmaceutical composition containing a selective HDAC8 inhibitor composition in a quantity sufficient to decrease HDAC8 deacetylase activity in vitro.","In one embodiment, T-cells from a donor subject suffering a T-cell lymphoma are cultured and expanded, ex vivo, in the presence of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor at a concentration that is effective for selectively killing transformed T-cells. Afterwards, the expanded T-cell population, free of transformed T-cells, are introduced into the donor subject. T-cell culture, in vitro expansion, and in vivo transfer is described in, e.g., Porter et al. (2006), 107(4):1325-1331; Rapoport et al. (2005), 1230-1237; Laport et al. (2003), 102(6):2004-2013.","Cytokine-Modulated Health Conditions","In some embodiments, a subject is administered a therapeutically effective amount of a selective HDAC8 inhibitor to decrease secretion of one or more inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2).","In some embodiments a selective HDAC8 inhibitor compound is administered to a subject to decrease the systemic levels of one or more inflammatory cytokines including, e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, or MIP-1a.","As described herein, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein reduce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including but not limited to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2). Thus, HDAC8 is the HDAC enzyme involved in cytokine secretion. The use of selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds provides a method of reducing cytokine secretion with reduced toxicity, due to the selective inhibition of one HDAC isoform (vs. the use of pan-HDAC inhibitors that inhibit all of the HDAC isoforms).","Selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit, in a dose dependent fashion, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and\/or ATP stimulated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 from purified human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as from the monocyte cell line THP-1. In some embodiments, the ECfor inhibition ranges from about 0.5 micromolar to about 5 micromolar.","The production and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 is via a non-classical pathway of protein secretion, involving potassium efflux, the autocatalytic processing of procaspase-1, the cleavage by active caspase-1 of the IL-1\u03b2 precursor, the influx of calcium ions, and the activation of specific phospholipases including PLA-2. In some embodiments, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds described herein inhibit one or more steps in this secretory pathway.","As described herein, selective HDAC8 inhibitors are used to treat diseases or conditions that are mediated or linked to IL-\u03b2 secretion and activity. In certain autoimmune diseases or conditions, IL-1\u03b2 is contributes to the signs and symptoms of the diseases or conditions (for examples of such Burger et al., & , Vol. 20, No. 5, pp. 879-896, 2006; Dayer et al., 2001, 13:170-176; Abramson et al., 2002; 41; 972-980); selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds are used to treat such diseases or conditions. As described herein, selective HDAC8 inhibitor compounds are used to inhibit IL-1\u03b2 secretion and thus find utility in the treatment of diseases or conditions that are linked to IL-1\u03b2 secretion and activity, which include, but are not limited to, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, gout, pseudogout, juvenile arthritis, Still's disease, Ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), hemochromatosis, hepatitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), HIDS (hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome), TRAPS (TNF-alpha receptor associated periodic fever syndrome), inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, recurrent fever, anemia, leukocytosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myalgia; Adult Still's disease, Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Lupus arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS), Blau syndrome, FCAS, MWS, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS); Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS); neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID); chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA); cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS); pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome (PAPA).","In further embodiments, the methods described herein are used to treat an inflammatory disease, which includes, but is not limited to asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, blepharitis, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, bursitis, cervicitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, colitis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, dacryoadenitis, dermatitis, dermatomyositis, encephalitis, endocarditis, endometritis, enteritis, enterocolitis, epicondylitis, epididymitis, fasciitis, fibrositis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, laryngitis, mastitis, meningitis, myelitis myocarditis, myositis, nephritis, oophoritis, orchitis, osteitis, otitis, pancreatitis, parotitis, pericarditis, peritonitis, pharyngitis, pleuritis, phlebitis, pneumonitis, pneumonia, proctitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis, rhinitis, salpingitis, sinusitis, stomatitis, synovitis, tendonitis, tonsillitis, uveitis, vaginitis, vasculitis, and vulvitis.","In yet other embodiments, the methods described herein are used to treat an inflammatory skin condition. Inflammatory skin conditions are those conditions of the skin in which inflammatory cells (e.g., polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes) infiltrate the skin with no overt or known infectious etiology. Symptoms of inflammatory skin conditions generally include erythema (redness), edema (swelling), pain, pruritus, increased surface temperature and loss of function. As used herein, inflammatory skin conditions include, but are not limited to, allergic contact dermatitis, urticarial dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema and related conditions, insect bites, erythroderma, mycosis fungoides and related conditions, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema multiforme, rosacea, onychomycosis, and acne and related conditions, but excluding psoriasis and its related conditions.","In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to treat an autoimmune disease, which includes, but is not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, Still's disease, juvenile arthritis, lupus, diabetes, myasthenia gravis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Ord's thyroiditis, Graves' disease Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Addison's disease, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, ankylosing spondylitisis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, aplastic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, coeliac disease, Goodpasture's syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, optic neuritis, scleroderma, primary biliary cirrhosis, Reiter's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Wegener's granulomatosis, psoriasis, alopecia universalis, Beh\u00e7et's disease, chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, neuromyotonia, scleroderma, and vulvodynia.","In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to treat heteroimmune conditions or diseases, which include, but are not limited to graft versus host disease, transplantation, transfusion, anaphylaxis, allergies (e.g., allergies to plant pollens, latex, drugs, foods, insect poisons, animal hair, animal dander, dust mites, or cockroach calyx), type I hypersensitivity, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.","Chronic inflammation in patients has been linked to cancer development (Coussens et al., 420, 860-867, 2002). Cancers associated with chronic inflammation include, but are not limited to, lung, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, cervical, bladder, prostate and colorectal cancers. The role of the inflammatory microenvironment as a causative factor in the etiology of cancer is also supported by findings that regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal, breast and gastric cancer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are mediators of chronic inflammatory responses, and have effects on malignant processes.","Pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in carcinogenesis and malignant transformation, tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Persistent expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in or near tumors, exerts a range of effects, including but not limited to, increasing growth and invasiveness of the malignant cells, metastsis, tumorigenesis, to activation of immune-mediated mechanisms, leading to the destruction of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor growth. IL-1\u03b2-transfected tumor cells have been reported to fail to induce effective antitumor immune responses. In several human cancers, local IL-1\u03b2 expression by the malignant cells or the microenvironment has been associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis.","In IL-1\u03b2-transfected fibrosarcoma cells, an up-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and TGF\u03b2, genes that are involved in invasiveness, was observed, as opposed to the shut-off of these genes in IL-1\u03b1-transfected fibrosarcomas cells. IL-1\u03b2 is thought to also enhance the invasiveness of already existing tumor cells by switching on angiogenesis and by the induction of inflammatory molecules, such as MMPs, heparanase, chemokines or integrins on the malignant cells or endothelial cells, leading to tumor dissemination and metastasis. IL-1\u03b2 induces secretion of growth and invasiveness-promoting factors, e.g. matrix metalloproteinases and angiogenic factors (i.e. VEGF and bFGF and ELR-positive CXC chemokines, i.e. IL-8 and MCP-1). (Apte et al., seminars in , vol. 12, 2002, 277-290).","Secreted IL-1\u03b2 has been implicated in tumor growth and invasion. Inhibition of IL-1\u03b2 secretion, e.g. by using selective HDAC8 compounds, in malignant cells, or in the tumor's microenvironment provides a method for cancer therapy.","Thus in one embodiment, selective HDAC8 compounds described herein, are used in cancer therapy.

Compounds","In some embodiments, compounds described herein possess one or more stereocenters and each center exists in the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, separation of stereoisomers are performed by chromatography. In other embodiments, individual stereoisomers are obtained by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. In one embodiment the resolution of enantiomers are carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein, dissociable complexes are also possible (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and are readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. In some embodiments, the diastereomers are separated by chiral chromatography, or by separation\/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer(s) is\/are then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture is found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, \u201cEnantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions\u201d, John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981, herein incorporated by reference for such disclosure. In further embodiments, stereoisomers are obtained by stereoselective synthesis.","In some situations, compounds exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the formulas described herein.","The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides, crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations, compounds exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition, the compounds described herein exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.","In some embodiments, the compounds described herein in unoxidized form are prepared from the corresponding N-oxides compounds by treating with a reducing agent, such as, but not limited to, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus tribromide, or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent, such as, but not limited to, acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like at 0 to 80\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. In some embodiments, prodrugs are bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In other embodiments, the prodrug has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the \u201cprodrug\u201d) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.","To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. In some embodiments, the prodrug is designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. In some embodiments, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, aids in the design of prodrugs of the compound. (see, for example, Nogrady (1985) , Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), , Vol. 4, p. 1985; Rooseboom et al., 56:53-102, 2004; Miller et al., .

In some embodiments, some of the herein-described compounds are a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.","In some embodiments prodrugs are easier to administer than the parent drug. In some embodiments the prodrug is bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In other embodiments the prodrug has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. In further embodiments, prodrugs are designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility.

Roche, , American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated herein for such disclosure.","Sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds described herein are susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, such as, by way of example only, halogens reduces, minimizes or eliminates this metabolic pathway.","In some embodiments the compounds described herein are labeled isotopically (e.g. with a radioisotope) or by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels.","Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulae and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine, such as, for example, H, H, C, C, N, O, S, F, Cl, respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.","In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect.","In some embodiments, compounds described herein are formed as, and\/or used as, pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The type of pharmaceutical acceptable salts, include, but are not limited to: (1) acid addition salts, formed by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable: inorganic acid, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, and the like; or with an organic acid, such as, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo-[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4\u2032-methylenebis-(3-hydroxy-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid), 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, butyric acid, phenylacetic acid, phenylbutyric acid, valproic acid, and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion (e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium), an alkaline earth ion (e.g. magnesium, or calcium), or an aluminum ion. In some embodiments, compounds described herein form a coordinate with an organic base, such as, but not limited to, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, dicyclohexylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine. In other embodiments, compounds described herein form salts with amino acids such as, but not limited to, arginine, lysine, and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases used to form salts with compounds that include an acidic proton, include, but are not limited to, aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like.","It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. In some embodiments, solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and form during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of compounds described herein are conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. In addition, the compounds provided herein exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein.","In some embodiments, compounds described herein are in various forms, including but not limited to, amorphous forms, milled forms and nano-particulate forms. In addition, compounds described herein include crystalline forms, also known as polymorphs. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. In some embodiments, various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature cause a single crystal form to dominate.","In other embodiments, the screening and characterization of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs and\/or solvates is accomplished by using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, vapor sorption, and microscopy. Thermal analysis methods address thermo chemical degradation or thermo physical processes including, but not limited to, polymorphic transitions, and such methods are used to analyze the relationships between polymorphic forms, determine weight loss, to find the glass transition temperature, or for excipient compatibility studies.

Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, is reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Some patients require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.","The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but will be determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of about 0.02 to about 5000 mg per day, in other embodiments about 1 to about 1500 mg per day. In some embodiments the desired dose is presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.","The pharmaceutical composition described herein is in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage is in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions are packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers are used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection are presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.","The daily dosages appropriate for the compounds described herein described herein are from about 0.01 to about 2.5 mg\/kg per body weight.

Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration include from about 1 to about 50 mg active ingredient. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages are altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.","Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it is expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are contemplated herein. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies is used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. In some embodiments, the dosage of such compounds lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.","Combination Treatments","The compounds and compositions described herein are also used in combination with other therapeutic agents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents are not administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and are administered by different routes because of different physical and chemical characteristics. The initial administration is made according to established protocols and based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration.","In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer at least one compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein, such as a hydroxamic acid compound described herein, is nausea, then it is appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.","The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds are administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is determined after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.","For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein is administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s).","In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a HDAC8 selective compound described herein) are administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents are provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). In some embodiments the therapeutic agents are given in multiple doses, or both are given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses varies from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.","It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, is modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder or condition from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed varies widely and therefore deviates from the dosage regimens set forth herein.","The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein are a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy are administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen calls for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps ranges from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration also determines the optimal dose interval.","In addition, the compounds described herein are used in combination with procedures that provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and\/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and\/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.","The compounds described herein and combination therapies are administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound varies. Thus, for example, the compounds are used as a prophylactic and are administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions are administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds are initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, in other embodiments, within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, in further embodiments, within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, and in yet further embodiments within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration is via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, a compound is administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment varies for each subject, and the length is determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound is administered for at least 2 weeks, in some embodiments, about 1 month to about 5 years, and in other embodiments from about 1 month to about 3 years.","Anti-Cancer Agents","Combinations of selective HDAC8 inhibitors described herein with other anti-cancer or chemotherapeutic agents are described herein.

In some embodiments, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors include 5-azacytosine and Zebularine\u00ae.","Radiation Therapy","Radiotherapy, also called radiation therapy, is the treatment of cancer and other diseases with ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy that injures or destroys cells in an area being treated (a \u201ctarget tissue\u201d) by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, the latter are better able to repair themselves and function properly. Radiotherapy is used to treat localized solid tumors, such as cancers of the skin, tongue, larynx, brain, breast, prostate, colon, uterus and\/or cervix. It is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma (cancers of the blood-forming cells and lymphatic system, respectively).","A technique for delivering radiation to cancer cells is to place radioactive implants directly in a tumor or body cavity. This is called internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy, interstitial irradiation, and intracavitary irradiation are types of internal radiotherapy.) Using internal radiotherapy, the radiation dose is concentrated in a small area, and the patient stays in the hospital for a few days. Internal radiotherapy is frequently used for cancers of the tongue, uterus, prostate, colon, and cervix.","The term \u201cradiotherapy\u201d or \u201cionizing radiation\u201d include all forms of radiation, including but not limited to \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 radiation and ultra violet light. Radiotherapy with or without concurrent or sequential chemotherapy is an effective modality for head and neck, breast, skin, anogenital cancers, and certain nonmalignant diseases such as keloid, desmoid tumor, hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation, and histocytosis X.","Provided are methods of using at least one histone deacetylase inhibitor to reduce side effect caused by at least one other therapeutic treatment, such as radiation-induced normal tissue fibrosis or chemotherapy-induced tissue necrosis, and the methods provided herein also synergistically inhibit tumor cell growth with radiotherapy and other anti-cancer agents.","Growth Hormone Secretagogues","In some embodiments, a selective inhibitor of HDAC8 is used in combination with one or more growth hormone secretagogues including, but not limited to, arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (1-Dopa), glucagon, vasopressin, PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide), muscarinic receptor agonists and a
