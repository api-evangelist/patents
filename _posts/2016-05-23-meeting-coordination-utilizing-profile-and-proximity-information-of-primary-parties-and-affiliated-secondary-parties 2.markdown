title: Meeting coordination utilizing profile and proximity information of primary parties and affiliated secondary parties
abstract: A method and system for establishing a meeting location for affiliates of primary users of mobile devices. In various embodiments, geolocation information from first and second mobile devices in proximity to first and second affiliated parties, respectively, is used to identify a meeting location. The affiliated parties (e.g., human babies or dogs) may be unable to meaningfully and independently interact with a mobile device. Directions to the meeting location are communicated to each of the mobile devices, as well as location information regarding the other mobile device. Social profile information regarding a user of a mobile device and an affiliated party may also be provided to other potential meeting participants. Proximity of an affiliated party to a mobile device may be determined from electronic data received from a device coupled to the affiliated party. Further, potential points of interest culled from a curated database may be communicated for display.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present U.S. Utility Patent Application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 as a continuation of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 14\/481,172, entitled \u201cPET FRIENDLY SEARCH, MEETING, SOCIAL PROFILE MAPPING SYSTEM\u201d, filed Sep. 9, 2014, which claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/875,323, entitled \u201cDOG WALKING\/MEETING APP\u201d, filed Sep. 9, 2013, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/905,349, entitled \u201cSEARCH AND SOCIAL PROFILE MAPPING FOR BABY AND DOG FRIENDLY POINTS OF INTEREST AND THEIR PARENTS\u201d, filed Nov. 18, 2013, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and made part of the present U.S. Utility Patent Application for all purposes.","Technical Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to the field of directional and\/or mapping processes and systems for operation on electronic devices, such as smart phones and similar devices. More specifically, the present invention relates to a social profiling, mapping and meeting coordination involving a secondary party accompanied by a primary party.","Description of Related Art","Typical mapping and navigation applications (\u201capps\u201d) and services today only focus on human users, ignoring other potential beneficiaries such as dogs or even babies. Such apps are meant to be first person experiences, allowing a user to manage a location and a social profile on a map. A 2011 survey by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) estimated that there are over 43 million households in the United States, about 36.5% of total U.S. households, with at least one dog. In 2012, a study performed by a consumer group estimated that 22% of the World's population, about one out of every five people, will own a smartphone by 2013.","These numbers, while seemingly unrelated, represent two great passions and trends in American and World culture. However, no current solution allows social profiles and mapping services for dogs managed on their behalf by their owner\/human. In addition, no current apps or mapping programs combine social profiles for dogs on a map with live location data or dog friendly points of interest used for meeting point determination. Current GPS and location technology is used with dogs only for lost and found tracking purposes, and no existing solution allows the placement of dog social profiles on a map that can be managed on behalf of a dog by a human (their owner), while also allowing interaction and meetings between two or more dogs at dog friendly points of interest.","Further, typical mapping solutions only provide single direction point navigation, such as one person to a single point of interest, or in some cases, one person to the location of another person, or between two cars. None of these systems have been applied to dogs. In addition, although a mapping or navigation system may provide points of interest, there is often no way to determine whether that point of interest is dog friendly. No current no apps\/services enable near instantaneous in-person meetings between dogs and dog owners or provide social profiles based on locations, which are also searchable by a set of traits, so that owners of dogs can potentially meet.","As described more fully below, the present invention provides a mapping and social profile system which performs multiple functions in conjunction with a smartphone.","Disclosed herein are improved systems and methods which avoid the disadvantages of prior devices while affording additional operating advantages. Social profile, search, and meeting coordination systems and methods for mobile devices and affiliated secondary parties are disclosed. In one example, the system is in conjunction with a mobile app on a smartphone (or tablet) that provides search, social networking, and mapping for dogs and their owners.","In an embodiment, a method of assisting users with determining a convenient location for a meeting is disclosed. The method comprises providing an initial location for a first mobile device user, providing an initial location for a second mobile device user, determining a meeting point between the first and second device users, and providing directions to the meeting point to the first device user and the second device user.","In another embodiment, a location mapping system is disclosed. The system comprises an electronic device having processing circuitry to implement a mapping capability(ies), a program stored in memory of the electronic device which complements the operation of the mapping capability, including a mapping location for a first user, a mapping location for a second user, at least one point of interest location at a distance midway between the mapping location of the first user and the mapping location of the second user, wherein the program provides directions on the electronic device based on the mapping locations of the first user and the second user relative to the point of interest enabling the first user and the second user to reach the midway point of interest. Alternatively, the program is accessible through the Internet or stored as a cloud-based program.","The disclosed technology can be a feature or function within a larger application or software program. In addition this technology function can exist on various platforms including Apple iOS\u00ae, ANDROID\u2122 (\u201cAndroid\u201d), Windows, and other proprietary software platforms or web based code.","A location finding system and method for users to find dog friendly points of interest, and to provide social profiles of users, including dogs and their owners, based on location, is disclosed. In one example, the system includes a mobile app that provides search, social networking, and mapping capabilities for dog owners.","In another embodiment, a location mapping and social profile system is disclosed. The system comprises an electronic device having mapping capability, a program stored on the electronic device which complements the operation of the mapping capability, wherein the program is capable of creating a social profile for a user, a mapping location for the first user, and a searching feature wherein the social profile of the user can be located by a second user based on a GPS location.","In yet another embodiment, a location mapping and social profile system for dogs and their owners is disclosed. The system comprises an electronic device having mapping capability, a program stored in the electronic device which complements the operation of the mapping capability, wherein the program is capable of creating a social profile for the dog and its owner, a mapping location for the dog and its owner based on real time location data, and a searching feature wherein the social profile of the dog and its owner are located based on GPS location.","The described technology can be a feature or function within a larger application or software program. In addition, this technology can be implemented on various platforms including Apple iOS\u00ae, Android, Windows, and other proprietary software platforms or web based code.","These and other aspects of the invention may be understood more readily from the following description and the appended drawings.","The following descriptions of detailed embodiments are for exemplifying the principles and advantages of the inventions. They are not to be taken in any way as limitations on the scope of the inventions. The invention, in its several embodiments, is primarily described in the following text and appended drawings as a component which operates in conjunction with a smart phone or tablet. However, the disclosed system and methods can also be implemented on personal computers including a software application for personal computers, or it may reside on a hosted (server) site as an Internet-based application. Similarly, while it may be described as a supplement to navigation programs, it is equally suitable for stand-alone operation with minor changes which would be understood by those skilled in the art.","The novel concepts and architectures presented herein are not a natural extension of any existing mapping or navigation systems, and change previous assumptions in mapping and social profiles from simply a first person experience, to include a new perspective involving a secondary party (referred to herein in the alternative as a \u201csecondary party\u201d or \u201caffiliated party\u201d) not capable of using a device like a smartphone and unable to independently manage a social profile. Although the disclosure references dogs as an exemplary secondary\/affiliated party, certain embodiments could be extended to other secondary parties, such as human babies.","The disclosure includes a method that provides a convenient midway or halfway meeting point between two or more secondary parties (such as dogs) on a map, allowing them to meet, via their respective owners, at a convenient location. The display of dog friendly points of interest and specific dog social profiles on a map managed by owners is another exemplary beneficial feature.","In a specific embodiment, the system has multiple components and features. For example, the system:\n\n","Referring to , the described system and method assists dogs and dog owners in finding a convenient halfway or midway meeting point, as well as provides navigational directions between two or more users via a map to facilitate a meeting. The users can be two or more dogs (with connection to the owners). The directions can be given by foot, such as walking directions. Alternatively, aspects of the present invention can also be stored and accessible in the cloud.","Referring to , screen shot images  and  are shown in which a system according to the present invention establishes the location of each of two dogs and the distance between them. Software, which can be executed on a suitable mobile device, including a tablet or smart phone, accessible through the Internet (via a cloud-based server(s)), or as a cloud-based server software, then calculates the halfway distance between the dogs. It then searches proprietary dog friendly map data and business listings to find and recommend a logical meeting point within this distance, so that all parties travel the same or nearly the same distance to each other.","For example, and with reference to the flow chart  of , the mobile app is used for connecting two users (\u201cDog \u201d and \u201cDog \u201d) walking their dogs. After Dog  accepts an invitation to meet from Dog  (), the app notes the map location of the two users ( and ). It then looks for dog friendly points of interest (POI) () that are at a halfway distance point (calculated at ) and recommends one of these dog friendly businesses or areas as the halfway meeting point. The halfway meeting point is selected and presented () to both \u201cDog \u201d and \u201cDog ,\u201d who then begin navigation to meet each other in person at the selected halfway point. The parties should both have approximately the same distance to travel to meet each other at this halfway meeting point.","If there is no dog friendly business or POI at exactly the halfway point between the parties, the app looks at locations within, for example, no more than a two block radius of the halfway meeting point (this radius distance can be adjusted). If there is no dog friendly POI within this halfway point area, the software searches for an acceptable street corner or other POI on the map and establishes that as the halfway meeting point. The logic may ensure the existence of a sidewalk or POI so as not to use highways or roads as meeting points. All of this is calculated and processed automatically for the user instantly. Once the halfway meeting point is established on the map and presented to the parties involved, navigation directions (on foot or by car or other, such as mass transportation) are offered to each of the parties to begin their travel to meet in person.","Referring now to the screen shot image  of , if one of the dog owners does not want to use the established halfway point, he or she can choose a new meeting point by simply moving the meeting point with his\/her finger on the map. The new point is then recommended to the other user(s) to accept or decline. If the second or other user(s) accepts the change, a new meeting point is established.","Another unique aspect of the invention, in addition to calculating and finding a midway or halfway point, is that it provides the best recommended central meeting point by applying smart logic utilizing available data points. This logic may be based on having proprietary dog friendly data from the map, business listings, street information, POIs, etc. For example, the BARKHAPPY\u00ae mobile app uses a database of dog friendly businesses and points of interest to first search those that are located at the halfway\/midway point for mutual dog walking users.","A first level of logic will choose from dog friendly parks, bars, restaurants, and stores first, followed by all other miscellaneous dog friendly POIs along the route. A second level of logic is used if no dog friendly POIs exist at the midway point (or within a 2 block radius). This second logic uses any existing businesses or POIs that exist at that location, calling upon existing public map data, and avoids using highways or points in middle of streets. This logic identifies businesses or street corners that are accessible on foot. In addition to choosing one meeting point, the logic involved can provide parties with multiple meeting points to choose from instead of just one. In this manner, the present app offers a number of options for the user to choose from when deciding on a meeting place.","In addition to providing a system and methods to assist users in the search and display of dog friendly points of interest and businesses, an embodiment of the invention also provides searchable social profiles for dogs and their owners.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"In addition, POI of various categories may be culled from a managed database. The database may be accessed when a user performs a search. Items are placed on the map using respective addresses, and the icon used depends on the POI category.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"The social profile display by location function is also unique in that it uses the dog owners GPS location from the smartphone as well as the city and state location identified in their profile created by the user. Alternatively, the location may be determined by a small sensor attached to the dog. When searching for \u201cDogs\u201d nearby, a list of dogs nearby may be shown by distance and other factors (see ). The dog profiles in the list are found using GPS location of the dog owners smartphone, for example. Users have the option to turn this feature off and not be shown in the list, and decide whether to be visible to the public or not. The display also provides recommended profiles of potentially compatible dogs based on multiple traits including age, location, breed, temperament, size and gender.","Once a user sees another dog profile of interest, the user can open the profile, which allows the user to see pictures of the dog and owner, and preferably read information about the dog, such as age, breed, gender and temperament. The user can then decide to add the dog as a friend in the \u201cpack\u201d or possibly meet for an instant play date.","Also as shown in , the app may display social profiles of dogs on a map using real time location data and a unique map marker such as the dog's photo. The location of these dogs is found using the GPS location from their owner's smartphone, or can be found using Bluetooth enabled proximity sensors attached directly to the dog's collar, leash or body, which then sends data to the app via a smartphone. If smartphone GPS location is used, the owners of the dogs are assumed to be with their respective dogs unless specified otherwise. Another feature\/function allows the owner to designate whether or not their dog is with them. The live location is constantly updated and location may be known\/displayed in approximate real time. These profiles can be represented in many ways on the map, including by map point marker, dog profile photo, owner photos or other means of representing the location of one or more dogs. In addition to the location, the technology may gather historic data on locations visited.","The present invention uses GPS technology for social purposes and enables a full profile of a dog including pictures, age, and other traits or preferences, as well as descriptive details about the dog and the dog's owner. This allows other users of the relevant app and\/or the dog's owner and friends to see their approximate real time location and open the dog's or dogs' profile. The user can then message or meet with other dogs and their owners. This solution is unique as no current technology or mobile app solutions offer an experience that maps dog profiles on a map for social purposes.","The profile itself is first created by one or more users of the app, who have the ability to upload pictures and descriptive information about their dog or dogs, as well as information about themselves. The profile photo they choose may be used in the map marker to identify the dog to other users. Even though the user can designate a location (city, state) or it can be found using FACEBOOK\u00ae information, the actual live location is obtained through the GPS information of the smartphone. This feature permits the owner of the dog to find and possibly meet with other dog owners in a nearby location.","The technology uses the GPS location from a smartphone or similar GPS enabled mobile device which is running the app (in this case, the mobile app called BARKHAPPY\u00ae.) The technology in the BARKHAPPY\u00ae app then displays this location on a map in a map marker using the dogs profile photo (this can also be a map marker point or another image instead of photo). The smartphone is assumed to be with the dog's owner and the dog is assumed to be with the owner.","Another feature in the app allows the user of the app to toggle \u201cout with my dog\u201d as on or off. If the toggle is on, then the location of the dog is found and displayed on the map or shown as \u201cnearby\u201d to other users. If the toggle is off, location is not received and the dog profile is not displayed on the map or shown as \u201cnearby\u201d.","Users of the app can also search for potentially compatible owners and dogs using a variety of traits. For example, breed, age, gender, and personality characteristics can be set up as searchable traits within the app. Thus, users can search for other owners and their dogs based on a series of traits.","The disclosed system also displays dog friendly points of interest and businesses nearby using special markers on a map with useful information across various categories including, but not limited to the following: bars and restaurants; parks and playgrounds; medical services; events and entertainment; doggie daycare; and shopping. Dog owners out walking with their dogs can use these locations to potentially meet with other dog owners having similar interests, as determined via the social profile feature.","Referring now to , several exemplary screen shot flow diagrams are shown to help illustrate features of the present invention. Specifically, the \u201cLogin-Sign In\/Up\u201d feature (), the \u201cCreate Profile\u201d feature (), the \u201cMap View\u201d feature and the \u201cBusiness POI\u201d feature (), and the \u201cDog POI\u201d feature and the \u201cPlay Invite\u201d feature () are all shown.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},"Login\u2014Sign In\/Up:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["\u2018Sign in with Facebook\u2019 takes the user directly to step  after successful login.","\u2018Sign in with email\u2019 slides in the form fields from the right (tapping \u2018x\u2019 will slide in the previous screen from the left).","If the user enters the wrong Email address or password, a transparent popup will show an error message and an icon will indicate on which field the error occurred.","If the user tabs \u2018Sign Up\u2019, the sign up form slides in from the bottom (tapping \u2018x\u2019 will slide the splash screen buttons in from the top).","If the user tabs on \u2018Forgot password\u2019, a full screen popup will open and prompt the user to enter an email address.","All buttons should be disabled (50% transparent) until all required fields are filled."]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},"Create Profiles:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["Tapping the blank avatar opens a popup and lets you upload images from Facebook or the phone library, or allows you to use the camera to take a picture.","Small avatar image is disabled (if user is logged in with Facebook it will show the FB avatar).","Tapping \u2018what's my name\u2019 will open the iOS keyboard and lets the user enter a name (will replace the \u2018what's my name\u2019 text).","Tapping on any of the other fields will open the iOS picker showing lists to choose info from.","Optional: \u2018Locator\u2019 icon will prompt \u2018allow access to your location\u2019 popup and if accepted, fill \u2018ZIP\u2019 and \u2018neighborhood\u2019 fields automatically.","Once the user hits \u2018on to your profile\u2019 all content (avatars, name, breed, etc.) flip horizontally to the left and show a blank user profile.","If user is logged in with Facebook, image, name, age and sex fields are filled in automatically, and the \u2018relationship status\u2019 field will prompt a picker.","\u2018Busters Owner\u2019 field will be automatically filled with the name from the Doggy Profile.","Once completed, a popup opens and asks the user to add friends that use BarkHappy or invite other friends.","The popup then closes and the Map View shows."]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"900"},"Map View:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":["Bottom toggle button lets the user switch between \u2018visible\u2019 and \u2018invisible\u2019 status.
