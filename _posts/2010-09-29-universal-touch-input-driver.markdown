Multitouch systems provide for opportunities for new types of user interactions and experiences that have not been possible in single touch or non-touch systems. Some multitouch systems have included frustrated total internal reflectance systems and capacitive systems.","Embodiments described herein pertain to a universal touch input driver that includes a device driver interface through which touch data is obtained from a device driver. Also included is a computation module that processes the touch data and converts it into a standardized format.

For instance, multitouch device  may collect input information that includes x-axis coordinates and y-axis coordinates for touch gestures. Device driver  obtains that information from device . The input information is then passed along to a universal multitouch device driver . As those skilled in the art will recognize, multitouch device drivers  commonly have different types of outputs. For example, the format or syntax of outputs may vary (e.g. TUIO and HID). Also for example, the outputs may have different types or amounts of information. For instance, some multitouch devices  only output x and y coordinates while other devices  output x and y coordinates along with a change in x, a change in y, a width, a height, and an acceleration. Universal multitouch device driver  is illustratively able to collect the outputs of many different types of device drivers  and convert the outputs into a standardized or universal format. The output of universal driver  is then transmitted or collected by one or more applications . Applications  are illustratively multitouch applications. Several examples of multitouch applications  are discussed later in this description. Embodiments are not however limited to only multitouch applications and also illustratively include single touch or no touch applications.","Embodiments of the present disclosure are illustratively practiced with any type of multitouch device.

In one specific example, for illustration purposes only and not by limitation, diodes  are three quarter inch infrared LEDs. Embodiments are not however limited to any particular type of light source.

In other embodiments, device  may have multiple projectors  and\/or multiple imaging cameras  as is needed. Additionally, multiple devices  are illustratively connected together and function as a single unit. For instance, up to five devices  are optionally connected together and function as a single unit.","The multitouch devices shown in the previous figures have been vision based multitouch systems in that they detect touches utilizing optical imaging. Embodiments of the present disclosure are not however limited to only vision based systems. Embodiments are illustratively incorporated in or practiced with any type of multitouch device.  illustrates another type of multitouch system, a capacitive system .","In the example shown in , a multitouch capacitive screen overlay  is positioned in front of a television or monitor . In another embodiment, the multitouch capability and display device are not separate pieces and are illustratively integrated into one unit. A control system  (e.g. a computer) is communicatively coupled to television\/monitor  and to multitouch screen overlay . Control system  generates graphical output  that is transmitted to and displayed on television\/monitor . A user interacts with the graphics on television\/monitor  by touching capacitive screen overlay . Overlay  then sends multitouch output  back to control system  that indicates the user's touches. Control system  then uses the multitouch output  to update its graphics and sends the updated graphics back to television\/monitor .","It is also worth noting that any number of multiple multitouch systems are illustratively communicatively coupled together and work to run applications.  illustrates one example of such an environment. The environment in  has three multitouch devices, a wall type device  in a living room, a table type device  in the living room, and a second wall type device  in a bedroom. Devices are illustratively coupled to each other through an intranet\/router  and are also coupled to the internet .","In one embodiment, the screen  of table device  has multiple windows, windows  and window . Window  illustratively includes television programming or guide information such as, but not limited to, a listing of television stations and an indication of what programs will be on the stations at different times and dates. Windows  are illustratively television program windows. For example, a user may select four different programs from guide window  and each of the four programs is displayed in its own window . The user could then control what is being displayed on the screens of the wall type devices  and . For instance, a user could touch one of windows  and push or flick it in the direction of one of the wall devices, and the program being displayed in the window would then be displayed on the wall device. In another embodiment, table device  generates audio output for headphones and the selection of one or more of windows  generates one or more channels of headphone audio output (i.e. the audio corresponding to the television program being displayed in the selected windows). Additionally, the environment shown in  may have personal video recording capability, and a user is able to control the recording and playing of video utilizing the multiple multitouch devices. For example, for illustration purposes only and not by limitation, a user could touch the screen of table device  to pause or rewind the program being displayed on wall device .","The multiple multitouch device environment in  is not however limited to running any particular application and is illustratively used in running any application. Other illustrative applications include making or placing phone calls, making or placing video calls using optional cameras  and , controlling various aspects of the home (e.g. temperature, garage door), making drawings or doodles, doing homework, shopping or ordering (e.g. ordering a pizza), surfing the internet, and playing video games.","As was previously mentioned in reference to , multitouch device drivers commonly output their touch information in different formats or syntax. Their various types of outputs may also have different kinds of information. For example, one multitouch device driver may only output an x and a y coordinate of a touch, and another device driver may have x and y coordinates as well as a change in x and a change in y (i.e. dx, dy). These varying forms of multitouch output can make implementing multitouch applications difficult and\/or costly. For example, if an application developer wants to make a multitouch application that can be used on multiple different types of multitouch devices, he may have to make and maintain several different versions of the same application, with each of the versions being specially tailored to accommodate for a particular device driver.","In one aspect of the present disclosure, a universal multitouch driver is provided that eliminates or reduces the need to specially tailor applications to multiple types of device drivers. The universal multitouch driver is able to receive and interpret the outputs of multiple different types of device drivers. The universal multitouch driver then converts the output it receives into a standardized format such that regardless of the format or type of information that it receives, it consistently outputs multitouch information in the same format and having the same type of information. Consequently, multitouch application developers do not have to make or maintain multiple versions of multitouch applications to implement an application across multiple types of multitouch devices. Instead, developers only need to make applications that are able to use the multitouch information from the universal multitouch driver.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["1602","1604","1","2"]},"At block , the universal multitouch driver obtains the touch data from the device driver. In one embodiment, the device driver has an application programming interface, and the universal driver communicates with that interface to retrieve the data. In another embodiment, the device driver automatically sends the data to the universal driver. Embodiments are not limited to any specific manner of obtaining the data.","At block , the universal multitouch driver optionally stores the data. For instance, the universal multitouch driver optionally stores the data to a volatile (e.g. DRAM) or non-volatile (e.g. flash or hard disk drive) memory.","At block , the universal multitouch driver calculates any missing parameters. As was mentioned previously, different device drivers do not always output the same types of information. One device driver may for example only output a touch identifier, an x-axis coordinate, a y-axis coordinate, a width, and a height. Universal multitouch driver optionally retrieves the data stored at block  and uses the current information and the stored information to generate a full set of touch data parameters (i.e. the touch identifier, x, y, dx, dy, w, h, and m). Alternatively or in addition to calculating missing parameters, the universal multitouch driver may fill in one or more missing parameters with a default value. For instance, if the device driver does not provide a width or a height, the universal driver illustratively uses a default value for those parameters (e.g. 0 or 1).","At block , the universal multitouch driver formats or packages the touch data, including any calculated or default values, into a standardized format. In one embodiment, the standardized format follows the \u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d or \u201cUDP\u201d network protocol. In another embodiment, the standardized format follows the \u201cExtensible Markup Language\u201d or \u201cXML\u201d rules. In yet another embodiment, a universal multitouch driver formats the touch data and packages it using multiple different formats simultaneously (e.g. it packages the same touch data in both UDP and XML simultaneously). Embodiments are not however limited to any particular standardized format.","At block , the universal multitouch driver transfers the standardized touch data to one or more multitouch applications. Embodiments are not limited to any particular method of transferring the data. For instance, the universal multitouch driver may send the data to the application, or alternatively the application may retrieve the data from the universal multitouch driver. In one specific example, for illustration purposes only and not by limitation, universal multitouch driver sends UDP formatted data to the UDP port  and XML formatted data to the TCP port . Also, as was previously alluded to, the universal multitouch driver may optionally transfer data in multiple ways simultaneously (e.g. it sends data to both port  and  simultaneously).","At block , the multitouch application utilizes the standardized user touch data that it received from universal multitouch driver. The process then illustratively repeats itself and returns to block  where a user interacts with a multitouch screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"b":["1700","1700","1702","1752","1750","1700","1700","1704","1706","1704","1704","1608","1706","1607","1608","1708","1782","1780"]},"The methods and the universal multitouch drivers described above illustratively help to reduce problems associated with implementing multitouch applications across multiple types of multitouch devices having various types of drivers. Instead of making and maintaining multiple versions of the same application, developers only need to make and maintain one version of any given application. It should be noted however that embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to multitouch systems or environments having universal multitouch drivers. Embodiments are illustratively practiced without a universal multitouch driver, and applications illustratively receive touch data directly from device drivers. It should also be noted that in systems having a universal multitouch driver, the universal multitouch driver is optionally bypassable. For instance, in a situation in which the data from the device driver is already in a suitable format for an application, the data may bypass the universal multitouch driver and go directly to the application.","Embodiments of the present disclosure also illustratively include a number of multitouch applications. These applications may be practiced in environments such as those previously discussed. The applications are however not limited to any particular environment and may also be practiced in environments different than those previously discussed.","The first application that will be discussed is illustratively an Application Launcher application.
