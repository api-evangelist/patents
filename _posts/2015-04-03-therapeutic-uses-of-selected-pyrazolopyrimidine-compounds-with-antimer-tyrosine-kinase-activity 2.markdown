The entirety of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The U.S. Government has rights in this invention by virtue of support under Contract No. HHSN261200800001E awarded by the National Cancer institute, National Institute of Health.","A Sequence Listing in ASCII text format, submitted under 37 C.F.R. \u00a71.821, entitled 5470-701_ST25.txt, 1,783 bytes in size, generated on May 26, 2015 and filed via EFS-Web, is provided in lieu of a paper copy. This Sequence Listing is incorporated by reference into the specification for its disclosures.","The present invention is directed to the use of selected pyrazolopyrimidine compounds having Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) inhibitory activity as anti-infective agents, immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory agents, anti-cancer agents (including against MerTK \u2212\/\u2212 tumors and ITD and TKD mutant forms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)), and as adjunctive agents in combination with chemotherapeutic, radiation or other standard of care for neoplasms.","MerTK is a member of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family known as TAM, which also includes AXL and TYRO3. Each member of the TAM family contains an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a conserved intracellular kinase domain. MerTK was first discovered in the laboratory of H. Shelton Earp at the University of North Carolina in 1994 (Graham et al., Cloning and mRNA expression analysis of a novel human proto-oncogene, c-mer. 5, 647-657 (1994)). The TAM family members undergo ligand-induced homodimerization, followed by catalytic tyrosine kinase activation and intracellular signaling. Cross-phosphorylation has also been demonstrated within this RTK family, suggesting heterodimerization can occur also. These RTKs are widely expressed in many epithelial tissues and in cells of the immune, nervous, and reproductive systems. MerTK was given its name by the Earp laboratory because it was found to be expressed in monocytes and in tissues of epithelial and reproductive tissue.","As described in more detail below, ligand-bound MerTK can complex with phosphatidyl serine and it binds apoptotic cells which triggers ingestion and suppresses inflammatory cytokines. It is aberrantly expressed in certain cancers (for example, acute leukemia (ALL and AML) and some solid tumors (for example melanoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, glioblastoma and others).","The MerTK ligands include growth arrest-specific 6 protein (GAS6; Chen, et al; (1997) 14, 2033-2039), protein-S, tubby and tubby-like protein-1 (TULP1), and galectin-3. Several of these ligands are present in serum and expressed locally in a number of tissues. These ligands bind to the extracellular domain of MerTK, resulting in tyrosine kinase activation.","Since the discovery of MerTK in the Earp laboratory in 1994, there has been a growing body of literature and patents that suggest the possibility of MerTK as a druggable target for a number of indications.","TAM receptor tyrosine kinases have been investigated for their involvement in certain infectious diseases. Shimojima, et al., reported the involvement of members of the Tyro3 receptor tyrosine kinase family, Axl, Dkt and MerTK, in the cell entry of filoviruses Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, and concluded that each Tyro3 family member is likely a cell entry factor in the infection (\u201cTyro3 Family-mediated Cell Entry of Ebola and Marburg Viruses\u201d , October 2006 p. 10109-10116).","U.S. Pat. No. 8,415,361 to Lemke, et al. (claiming priority to a Nov. 9, 2007 provisional application), assigned to The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, describes the use of TAM receptor inhibitors as antimicrobials. In particular, the '361 patent reports that inhibition of the TAM pathway in virally infected macrophages from TAM triple knock-out mice leads to reduced levels of infection with a variety of pseudotyped viruses with either filoviral, retroviral or rhabdoviral glycoproteins. Brindley, et al., reported that in a bioinformatics-based screen for cellular genes that enhance Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) transduction, AXL mRNA expression strongly correlated with ZEBOV infection (\u201cTyrosine kinase receptor Axl enhances entry of Zaire ebolavirus without direct interactions with the viral glycoprotein\u201d 415 (2011) 83-84).","Morizono, et al, published that Gas6 mediates binding of the virus to target cells by bridging virion envelope phosphatidyl serine to Axl on the target cells. Replication of vaccinia virus, which was previously reported to use apoptotic mimicry to enter cells, is enhanced by Gas6, and Morizono asserts that these results reveal an alternative molecular mechanism of viral entry that can broaden host range and enhance infectivity of enveloped viruses (\u201cThe Soluble Serum Protein Gas6 Bridges Virion Envelope Phosphatidylserine to the TAM Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Axl to mediate Viral Entry\u201d & 9, 286-298, 2011). In 2014, Morizono and Chen reported that virus binding by viral envelope phosphatidyl serine is a viral entry mechanism generalized to a number of families of viruses (Morizono and Chen, \u201cRole of Phosphatidyl Receptors in Enveloped Virus Infection\u201d, Vol 88(8), 4275-4290 (Jan. 29, 2014)).","WO2013\/124324 filed by Amara et al. (priority date Feb. 21, 2012), and assigned to Institut National De La Sante et De La Recherche Medicale, reports that Dengue virus is mediated by the interaction between phosphatidylserine at the surface of the Dengue viral envelope and TAM receptors present at the surface of the host cell, and that such interaction can be blocked, thereby inhibiting entry of Dengue into host cells. They also report that the interaction between phosphatidyl serine and TAM receptors is used by other flaviviruses such as Yellow Fever, West Nile and perhaps Chikungunya. Amara focuses on antisense, siRNA and antibody approaches.","Similarly, Bhattacharayya et al., reports that several human viruses, for example Ebola, Dengue, and HIV, externalize PtdSer on their capsid during budding and use phosphatidylserine to bind to and activate TAM RTKs in the presence of TAM ligands, allowing entry of the virus into cells and furthermore, activation of MerTK in macrophages in response to viral particles expressing PtdSer stimulates an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile as if apoptotic material was being ingested, thereby inhibiting the anti-viral immune response. Bhattacharayya et al observe that TAM receptors are engaged by viruses to attenuate type 1 interferon signaling (\u201cEnveloped viruses disable innate immune responses in dendritic cells by direct activation of TAM receptors\u201d, & 14, 136-147 (2013)).

Vaccinia virus uses macropinocytosis and apoptotic mimicry to enter host cells. 320, 531-535, doi:10.1126\/science.1155164 (2008).","MerTK is ectopically expressed or overexpressed in a number of hematologic and epithelial malignant cells. Expression of MerTK and GAS6 correlates with poor prognosis and\/or chemoresistance in these tumor types. The mechanisms by which increased MerTK signaling in tumor cells contributes to tumor malignancy, however, remain unclear.","WO2013\/052417 titled \u201cPyrrolopyrimidine Compounds for the Treatment of Cancer\u201d filed by Wang, et al., and assigned to the University of North Carolina describe pyrrolopyrimidines with MerTK inhibitory activity for the treatment of tumors such as myeloid leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, melanoma, breast, lung, colon, liver, gastric, kidney, ovarian, uterine and brain cancer, wherein the pyrrolopyrimidines have the general structures below, with R substituents as defined in the those applications:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"87.04mm","wi":"58.84mm","file":"US09555030-20170131-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In November 2013, Dr. Stephen Frye presented data showing the inhibitory effects of a pyrrolopyrimidine compound (UNC2025) in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, MerTK-expressing AML cell lines, and MerTK-negative AML cell lines.

MerTK is normally expressed in myeloid lineage cells where it acts to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines following ingestion of apoptotic material. It was found that MerTK \u2212\/\u2212 leukocytes exhibit lower tumor cell-induced expression of wound healing cytokines (IL-10 and GAS6) and enhanced expression of acute inflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and IL-6). Further, intratumoral CD8+ lymphocytes are increased.

In 2004, Chen et al, from the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, published that MerTK, presumably through activation by its ligand Gas6, participates in the regulation of platelet function in vitro and platelet-dependent thrombosis in vivo. Chen, et al, \u201c\u201d, Arterioscler. Thromv. Vase. Biol. 1118-1123 June 2004. Chen reported that PtdSer on aggregating platelets activates MerTK, helping to stabilize clot formation. MerTK knockout mice have decreased platelet aggregation while maintaining normal bleeding times and coagulation parameters. Consequently, these mice appear to be protected from thrombosis without concomitant increased spontaneous bleeding (see also Angelillo-Scherrer A et al., Role of Gas6 receptors in platelet signaling during thrombus stabilization and implications for antithrombotic therapy. J. Clin. Invest. 2005, 115 (2), 237-246).","In 2007, Sather, et al., reported that membrane-bound MerTK is cleaved in the extracellular domain via a metalloproteinase to produce a soluble MerTK that decreased platelet aggregation in vitro and prevented fatal collagen\/epinephrine-induced thromboembolism. \u201cA soluble form of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells and platelet aggregation\u201d, , Vol 109(3): 1026-1033).","Paolino et al. have reported on the treatment of wild-type NK cells with a newly developed small molecule TAM kinase inhibitor, LDC1267, that conferred therapeutic potential and efficiently enhancing anti-metastatic NK cell activity in vivo.

Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs.","The compounds in any of the Formulas described herein include enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, racemates and other isomers, such as rotamers, as if each is specifically described.","The terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d do not denote a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item. The term \u201cor\u201d means \u201cand\/or\u201d. Recitation of ranges of values are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. The endpoints of all ranges are included within the range and independently combinable. All methods described herein can be performed in a suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of examples, or exemplary language (e.g., \u201csuch as\u201d), is intended merely to better illustrate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless otherwise claimed.","In one embodiment, the present invention includes compounds of Formula I, II, III, or IV, and the use of compounds with at least one desired isotopic substitution of an atom, at an amount above the natural abundance of the isotope, i.e., enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers, i.e., the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.","Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, F P, P, S, Cl, I respectively. The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes, such as H, C, and C, are present. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example H or H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an F labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen, for example, deuterium (H) and tritium (H) may be used anywhere in described structures. Alternatively or in addition, isotopes of carbon, e.g., C and C, may be used. A typical isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug, for example, the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, half-life, stability, AUC, Tmax, Cmax, etc. For example, the deuterium can be bound to carbon in a location of bond breakage during metabolism (an \u03b1-deuterium kinetic isotope effect) or next to or near the site of bond breakage (a \u03b2-deuterium kinetic isotope effect).","Isotopic substitutions, for example deuterium substitutions, can be partial or complete. Partial deuterium substitution means that at least one hydrogen is substituted with deuterium. In certain embodiments, the isotope is 90, 95 or 99% or more enriched in an isotope at any location of interest. In one embodiments deuterium is 90, 95 or 99% enriched at a desired location. Unless otherwise stated, the enrichment at any point is above natural abundance and enough to alter a detectable property of the drug in a human.","In one embodiment, the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs within an R group when at least one of the variables within the R group is hydrogen (e.g., H or D) or alkyl (e.g., CD). For example, when any of R groups are, or contain for example through substitution, methyl or ethyl, the alkyl residue is typically deuterated, e.g., CD, CHCDor CDCD. In certain other embodiments, when any of the above mentioned R groups are hydrogen, the hydrogen may be isotopically enriched as deuterium (i.e., H).","A dash (\u201c-\u201d) that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, \u2014(C\u2550O)NHis attached through carbon of the keto (C\u2550O) group.","\u201cAlkyl\u201d as used herein alone or as part of another group, refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.

One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well-known techniques of pharmacy comprising admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory ingredients.","In one aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of an active compound as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The compounds provided herein are administered for medical therapy in a therapeutically effective amount. The amount of the compounds administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.","The formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces), transdermal administration, and intraventricular injection (injection into a ventricle of the brain, e.g., by an implanted catheter or omman reservoir, such as in the case of morbid obesity), ocular (via injection, implantation or by reservoir), and intranasal, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active compound which is being used.","The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. Typically, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the compound is usually a minor component (as a nonlimiting example, from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form. In one embodiment, the compound is present from about 1% to about 10% by weight.","Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.","Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations may be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more accessory ingredients as noted above). In general, the formulations of the invention are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules containing the active compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and\/or surface active\/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid binder. In one embodiment, the compounds are administered in a controlled release formulation.","Formulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising the active compound in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.","Formulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous and non-aqueous injection solutions of the active compound, which preparations are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit\\dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. For example, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an injectable, stable, sterile composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), or a salt thereof, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid composition suitable for injection thereof into a subject. The unit dosage form typically comprises from about 10 mg to about 10 grams of the compound or salt. When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent which is physiologically acceptable may be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. One such useful emulsifying agent is phosphatidyl choline.","Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art.","Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture.","Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which may be used include petroleum jelly, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, transdermal enhancers, and combinations of two or more thereof.","Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by iontophoresis (see, for example, 3 (6):318 (1986)) and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. Suitable formulations comprise citrate or bis\\tris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol\/water and contain from 0.1 to 0.2M active ingredient.","Further, the present invention provides liposomal formulations of the compounds disclosed herein and salts thereof. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound or salt thereof is an aqueous-soluble salt, using conventional liposome technology, the same may be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance, due to the water solubility of the compound or salt, the compound or salt will be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed may be of any conventional composition and may either contain cholesterol or may be cholesterol-free. When the compound or salt of interest is water-insoluble, again employing conventional liposome formation technology, the salt may be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer which forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance, the liposomes which are produced may be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques.","Of course, the liposomal formulations containing the compounds disclosed herein or salts thereof, may be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate which may be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension.","Other pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared from the water-insoluble compounds disclosed herein, or salts thereof, such as aqueous base emulsions. In such an instance, the composition will contain a sufficient amount of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agent to emulsify the desired amount of the compound or salt thereof. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines, and lecithin.","In addition to compounds of Formula I, II, III, or IV, or other active compounds described herein, or their salts, the pharmaceutical compositions may contain other additives, such as pH-adjusting additives. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Further, the compositions may contain microbial preservatives. Useful microbial preservatives include methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. The microbial preservative is typically employed when the formulation is placed in a vial designed for multidose use. Of course, as indicated, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.","The Mer TKI compound of this invention can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.","In certain embodiments, the formulation comprises water. In another embodiment, the formulation comprises a cyclodextrin derivative. In certain embodiments, the formulation comprises hexapropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. In a more particular embodiment, the formulation comprises hexapropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (10-50% in water).","The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the compounds of the invention. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e. salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions such as the hydrochloride, hydroiodide, hydrobromide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, benzoate, para-toluenesulfonate, and the like.","The above-described components for pharmaceutical compositions are merely representative. Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in Part 8 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, 1985, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference.","As noted above, the present invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising the active compounds (including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof), in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for oral, rectal, topical, buccal, parenteral, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous, and transdermal administration.","The therapeutically effective dosage of any specific compound, the use of which is in the scope of present invention, will vary somewhat from compound to compound, and patient to patient, and will depend upon the condition of the patient and the route of delivery. As a general proposition, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 50 mg\/kg will have therapeutic efficacy, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound, including the cases where a salt is employed. Toxicity concerns at the higher level may restrict intravenous dosages to a lower level such as up to about 10 mg\/kg, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active base, including the cases where a salt is employed. The duration of the treatment can be once per day for a period of two to three weeks or until the condition is essentially controlled.","The therapeutically effective dosage of any active compound described herein will be determined by the health care practitioner depending on the condition, size and age of the patient as well as the route of delivery. In one non-limited embodiment, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 200 mg\/kg has therapeutic efficacy, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound, including the cases where a salt is employed. In some embodiments, the dosage can be the amount of compound needed to provide a serum concentration of the active compound of up to between about 1 and 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 \u03bcM. In some embodiments, a dosage from about 10 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg can be employed for oral administration. Typically, a dosage from about 0.5 mg\/kg to 5 mg\/kg can be employed for intramuscular injection. In some embodiments, dosages can be from about 1 \u03bcmol\/kg to about 50 \u03bcmol\/kg, or, optionally, between about 22 \u03bcmol\/kg and about 33 \u03bcmol\/kg of the compound for intravenous or oral administration. An oral dosage form can include any appropriate amount of active material, including for example from 5 mg to, 50, 100, 200, or 500 mg per tablet or other solid dosage form.","Active compounds may be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, which are those prodrugs of the active compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, commensurate with a reasonable risk\/benefit ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formulae, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Prodrugs as Novel delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and in Edward B.

In one embodiment, a tumor associated macrophage MerTK inhibiting amount of a Mer TKI is used in combination or alternation with the immunomodulatory agent. In another embodiment, a host tumor survival-signal inhibiting, antiviral or antibacterial amount of a Mer TKI is used in combination or alternation with the immunomodulatory agent.","Immunomodulators are small molecules or biologic agents that treat a disease by inducing, enhancing or suppressing the host's immune system. In the present application, one or more immunomodulators are selected that induce or enhance the host's immune system. Some immunomodulators boost the host's immune system and others help train the host's immune system to better attack tumor cells. Other immunomodulators target proteins that help cancer grow.","Three general categories of immunotherapies are antibodies, cancer vaccines, and non-specific immunotherapies. Antibodies are typically administered as monoclonals, although that is not required. \u201cNaked monoclonal antibodies\u201d work by attaching to antigens on tumor cells. Some antibodies can act as a marker for the body's immune system to destroy the tumor cells. Others block signaling agents for tumor cells. Antibodies can generally be used to bind to any signaling or metabolic agent that directly or indirectly facilitates tumor growth. Examples are alemtuzumab (Campath) which binds to CD52 antigen, and trastuzumab (Herceptin), which binds to the HER2 protein.","In another embodiment, an antibody can be used that is conjugated to another moiety that increases it delivery or efficacy. For example, the antibody can be connected to a cytotoxic drug or a radiolabel. Conjugated antibodies are sometimes referred to as \u201ctagged, labeled or loaded\u201d. Radiolabeled antibodies have small radioactive particles attached to them. Examples are Zevalin, which is an antibody against CD20 used to treat lymphoma. Chemolabeled antibodies are antibodies that have cytotoxic agents attached to them. Examples are Adcetris, which targets CD30, and Kadcyla, which targets HER2. Ontak, while not an antibody, is similar in that it is interleukin-2 attached to a toxin from diphtheria.","Another category of immunotherapy that can be used in the present invention is a cancer vaccine. Most cancer vaccines are prepared from tumor cells, parts of tumor cells or pure antigens. The vaccine can be used with an adjuvant to help boost the immune response. An example is Provenge, which is the first cancer vaccine approved by the US FDA. The vaccine can for example be a dendritic cell vaccine or a vector-based vaccine","Nonspecific tumor immunotherapies and adjuvants include compounds that stimulate the immune system to do a better job at attacking the tumor cells. Such immunotherapies include cytokines, interleukins, interferons (\u03b1 primarily but can be also \u03b2 or \u03b3). Specific agents include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-12, IL-7, IL-21, drugs that target CTLA-4 (such as Yervoy, which is Ipilimumab) and drugs that target PD-1 or PDL-1 (such as for example, nivolumab (BMS), pembrolizumab (Merck), pidilizumab (CureTech\/Teva), AMP-244 (Amplimmune\/GSK), BMS-936559 (BMS), and MEDI4736 (Roche\/Genentech)).","Other drugs that boost the immune system are thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, the Bacille Calmette-Gurin bacteria and Imiquimod.

In one embodiment, the compounds described herein are administered to a host having blood clots on the surfaces of artificial organs, shunts and prostheses (for example, artificial heart valves that are implanted into a patient), and in patients that have received an intracoronary stent. In one embodiment, a host is administered an effective amount of a compound described herein due to the formation of clots resulting from some pathological conditions (for example, genetic mutation of VWF cleaving protease, ADAMT13), which may cause spontaneous binding of VWF to platelets resulting in formation of microthrombi in blood vessels leading to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and other microangiopathy. Microangiopathy is a disease of blood vessels in which the walls of very small blood vessels (capillaries) become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood. In one embodiment, the treatment is in a patient with hemolytic uremic syndrome.","In one embodiment, an active compound disclosed herein is administered in combination with an additional anti-platelet agent. Examples of anti-platelet agents include, but are not limited to, aspirin, tirofiban (Aggrastat), Aggrenox, Agrylin, triflusal (Disgren), Flolan, eptifibatide (Integrilin), dipyridamole (Presantine), cilostazol (Pletal), abciximab (ReoPro), and Terutroban. In one embodiment, a compound UNC2207A is administered in combination with an additional anti-platelet agent. In one embodiment, the Mer TKI and the additional anti-platelet agent act synergistically. In one embodiment, the use of a Mer TKI in combination with an additional anti-platelet agent provides for increased anti-thrombotic or anti-clotting effects without an increase in the standard of care dosage.","In one embodiment, the additional anti-platelet agent is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor. Examples of ADP receptor inhibitors include, but are not limited to, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), ticlopidine (Ticlid), N6-methyl-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-bisphosphate (MRS2179; PY1 inhibitor), and 2-methylthioadenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate triethylammonium salt (2-Me-SAMP; PY12 inhibitor).","In one embodiment, an active compound disclosed herein is administered in combination with multiple anti-platelet agents.

In one embodiment, a compound UNC2207A is administered in combination with an anti-coagulant.","In one aspect of the present invention, an effective amount of an active compound as described herein is incorporated into nanoparticles, e.g. for convenience of delivery and\/or extended release delivery. The use of materials in nanoscale provides one the ability to modify fundamental physical properties such as solubility, diffusivity, blood circulation half-life, drug release characteristics, and immunogenicity. In the last two decades, a number of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic agents have been developed for the treatment of cancer, diabetes, pain, asthma, allergy, and infections. These nanoscale agents can provide more effective and\/or more convenient routes of administration, lower therapeutic toxicity, extend the product life cycle, and ultimately reduce health-care costs. As therapeutic delivery systems, nanoparticles allow targeted delivery and controlled release.","In addition, nanoparticle-based drug delivery can be used to release drugs at a sustained rate and thus lower the frequency of administration, deliver drugs in a target manner to minimize systemic side effects, or deliver two or more drugs simultaneously for combination therapy to generate a synergistic effect and suppress drug resistance. To date, a number of nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use. Among these products, liposomal drugs and polymer-based conjugates account for more than 80% of the products. See, Zhang, L., et al., Nanoparticles in Medicine: Therapeutic Applications and Developments, Clin.

Structure 2-2 can be prepared by aminating a desired sulfone, 2-1, with a desired amine in an organic solvent, for example, tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a base, for example, diisopropylethylamine optionally at an elevated temperature. Structure 2-3 can be prepared by treating a desired 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine with a desired R-LGin the presence of a base and an organic solvent optionally in a microwave apparatus at an elevated temperature. For example, Structure 2-3 can be prepared by treating a 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine with an alkyl halide, R-LG, in the presence of a base, for example, potassium carbonate, and an organic solvent, for example, N,N-dimethylacetamide in a microwave apparatus at an elevated temperature, for example, at about 150\u00b0 C. In one embodiment, LGis a halide. In one embodiment, LGis chloride. A compound of Formula II can be prepared by treating Structure 2-3, having a leaving group LG, with a borane reagent, an organometallic reagent, a base, and a solvent(s) in a microwave apparatus optionally at an elevated temperature. For example, a compound of Formula II can be prepared by treating a compound with a leaving group, for example, a halide, with a borane reagent, for example, 1-methyl-4-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzyl)-1,4-diazepane, an organometallic reagent, for example, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), a base, for example, potassium carbonate in a solvent(s) optionally at an elevated temperature. In one embodiment, the solvents are dioxane and water. In one embodiment, the reaction is carried out in a microwave apparatus at about 150\u00b0 C. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other leaving groups can be used at the three and six-positions of 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines to generate compounds of Formula II.

novel, orally bioavailable and potent MERTK-selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) was evaluated in preclinical models of melanoma, both alone and in combination with vemurafenib (a mutant B-RAF TKI). B-RAF wildtype (HMCB) and B-RAF mutant (G361) cell lines were treated with UNC TKI or vehicle. Downstream signaling was evaluated by immunoblotting, and induction of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry in cells stained with YO-PRO\u00ae-1 iodide and propidium iodide. Alternatively, cells were seeded in media containing UNC1062 or vehicle and colony formation was determined. Treatment with MRX6313induced apoptosis and reduced colony growth in both B-RAF wild-type and B-RAF mutant cell lines, with concentrations as low as 300 nM resulting in an almost complete block in colony formation. In addition, MerTK inhibition reduced activation of downstream pro-survival signaling pathways known to play roles in melanoma, including ERK, AKT, and STAT6. Importantly, combined treatment with UNC1062 and vemurafenib completely abrogated these signaling pathways in a BRAF mutant cell line and increased apoptosis relative to the single agents, consistent with the idea that MerTK inhibition may provide additional therapeutic advantage when combined with vemurafenib in patients with B-RAF mutant melanomas. Taken together, these studies validate UNC TKI as a potential treatment for both B-RAF wild-type and B-RAF mutant melanomas and provide data supporting continued development of UNC1062 for treatment of melanoma. See,  and .","In this example, the activity of a MerTK inhibitor is examined on tumor growth in autochthonous murine tumor models. Mer TKI is assessed in immune-competent, genetically engineered murine models (GEMMs). Activity is tested in RAS-driven, INK4a\/Arf null melanoma GEMM (TRIA) mice. The efficacy of 15 chemotherapeutic and\/or targeted regimens in a large (>220) cohort of TRIA mice has previously been tested (Clinical Cancer Research 18:5290, 2012). The overall response is 10% (partial responses and stable disease). There are no complete responses. A combination of MEK (AZD 6244) and PI3K\/mTOR (BEZ235) inhibitors are the most active previous regimen (responses seen in 9\/18 mice 50%, with 0 CRs) with moderate toxicity.","In this study, the interaction between a novel MerTK-selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and AZD-4547, an FGFR TKI, in NSCLC cell lines is studied. Colo699 (MerTK+, FGFR+) and H226 (MerTK+, FGFR+) NSCLC cells are cultured for 14 days in soft agar in the presence of Mer TKI and\/or AZD-4547, alone or in combination, and colonies are stained and counted. Changes in the activity of downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K\/AKT, MEK\/ERK, and STAT proteins are evaluated by immunoblotting.","In this example, preclinical testing of Mer TKIs as a potential therapy for MERTK-expressing ALL is disclosed. Mer TKI inhibition of phosphorylation\/activation of MerTK is tested in 697 B-ALL cells. Mer TKIs are tested in several mouse models, including an orthotopic B-ALL xenograft model of minimal residual disease and a similar model of existent disease in which leukemia is established for 14 days prior to initiation of treatment. In both models, tumor burden is measured by bioluminescent imaging.","The effects of Mer TKI treatment on activation of MerTK and related members of the TAM-family of kinases, Axl and Tyro3, and effects on downstream proliferative and pro-survival signaling pathways are analyzed by immunoblot. In addition, Mer TKI-mediated anti-tumor activity is determined in a panel of NSCLC cell lines using soft-agar and clonogenic assays. Cells are stained with YoPro-1-iodide and propidium iodide dyes and induction of apoptosis is determined using flow cytometry. Finally, a subcutaneous murine xenograft model is employed to determine therapeutic effects in vivo.","FLT-3 and Mer tyrosine kinases have been previously identified as potential targets in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expression of FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) occurs in \u02dc30-40% of AML patient samples and MerTK overexpression has been detected in \u02dc80-100%. In this example, a novel small molecule inhibitor is tested for activity against both of these kinases and the growth inhibition or apoptosis of cell lines and patient myeloblasts is examined. In these studies, the effects of treatment with MER-TKI are analyzed in FLT3-ITD-positive (Molm-13 and MV4;11) and MERTK-positive (Kasumi-1 and U937) AML cell lines and in primary AML patient samples with variable expression of FLT3-ITD and MerTK. AML cell lines are also stained with Yo-Pro-1 iodide and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine induction of apoptosis in response to treatment with Mer TKI. Primary patient samples that are MerTK and\/or FLT3-ITD positive are analyzed in similar assays.","To further investigate the utility of MerTK inhibition in the tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy, the efficacy of a Mer TKI is evaluated in immunocompetent C57Bl\/6 mice implanted orthotopically with PyVmT mammary gland tumor cells. These PyVmT tumors cells do not express MerTK, AXL or TYRO3.","6-12-week old C57BL\/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.), are fed low-soy laboratory chow to prevent interactions from genestein, a phytoestrogen with tyrosine kinase inhibitor activity. Approximately equal numbers of male and female mice are used for all experiments to limit any potential skewing of results by sex-based differences in thrombosis. The mice are anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (60-90 mg\u00b7kgloading dose, 10 to 20 mg\/kgmaintenance dose as needed to maintain adequate anesthesia as measured by paw pressure response). The mice are then fixed in the supine position to a polycarbonate experimental platform under a dissecting microscope (Olympus SZ61 Infinity Lite, Olympus Equipment). A rectal temperature probe is used in conjunction with a heating pad to monitor and maintain temperature at 37\u00b11\u00b0 C. A 2 cm vertical midline ventral cervical incision is made to expose the trachea, which is then horizontally incised and cannulated with a rigid endotracheal tube (Harvard MiniVent type 845, Harvard Apparatus) secured with a 4-0 silk tie, and attached to a ventilator (Harvard MiniVent type 845, Harvard Apparatus), which delivered a 200 \u03bcL stroke volume and 80 breaths per minute. The carotid artery is exposed by dissection, allowing for attachment of a microvascular ultrasonic flow probe (Transonic Flowprobe, Transonic Systems, Ithaca, N.Y.), and the cavity is flooded with NaCl to prevent tissue dehydration. A 1 mm\u00d75 mm strip of Parafilm (Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Chicago, Ill.) is placed perpendicular to, and immediately posterior to, the artery to separate it from other cavity tissue. NaCl (negative control), Mer TKI (3 mg\/kg in NaCl), 2 abciximab (positive control), HD ADPis in NaCl (3 mg\/kg MRS2179+3 mg\/kg 2-MeSAMP), LD ADPis (1.5 mg\/kg MRS2179+1.5 mg\/kg 2-MeSAMP), or a combination of Mer TKI and LD ADPis are injected and allowed to circulate for 30 minutes. The cavity is then dried and a 1.2 mm diameter circle of filter paper (Whatman Ltd, Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK) is saturated with 6% FeCl(\u02dc60 \u03bcM, Fisher) for 10 seconds, and placed on the artery, proximal to the ultrasound probe, for 3 minutes to create the injury. Then, the Parafilm and filter paper are removed, the cavity is flooded with saline, and the flow probe readout is analyzed using LabChart software (AD Instruments, CO Springs, Colo.). Elapsed Time To First (initial) artery Occlusion (TTFO, mean blood flow of 0 mL\/min flow for >30 seconds), and total Duration Of Occlusion time (DOO, mean blood flow <20% of pre-FeClbaseline) is measured during the 60 minutes following FeClapplication. Values are expressed as mean+\/\u2212SEM, with significance determined by unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test.","Two cell lines known to express a FLT3-ITD mutation (Molm14 and MV4;11) are treated with a novel FLT3 inhibitor which has high specificity for FLT3. The MV4;11 cell line has low MerTK expression, while the Molm14 cell line does not express MerTK. Immunoprecipitation of FLT3-ITD positive AML cell lines after 1 h treatment with a MerTK inhibitor is analyzed for phosphorylation of FLT3 (pFLT3) in comparison to total FLT3. Phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins STAT5, AKT, and ERK1\/2 in comparison to DMSO and control TKI are also analyzed. In addition, an AML cell line that expresses MerTK and does not have activating mutations in FLT3 (U937, Kasumi-1) is also used to determine abrogation of activation of intracellular signaling pathways downstream of FLT3 and MerTK, including AKT and ERK1\/2, when treated with MerTK inhibitors. Signaling in AML cell lines is analyzed after 1 hr treatment with MerTK inhibitors. Whole cell lysates or IPs are resolved on 8% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which are probed for phospho-proteins. Blots are then stripped and re-probed for the total protein, or actin (loading control).","AML cell lines are plated in equal number in soft agar, then colony number analyzed after incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 14 days. Colonies are counted using a Gel Count automated colony counter. AML cell lines are treated for 72 h with MerTK and apoptosis is analyzed after staining with Yo-Pro-1 iodide and propidium iodide and undergoing flow cytometric analysis.","A Molm14 xenograft is established by injection of 2.5\u00d710cells into NSG mice via tail vein. On day 4 after injection mice are started on daily therapy with a MerTK inhibitor or saline via oral gavage. Mice are treated through day 100 then observed for relapse.","A patient-derived xenograft model is established with cells from a patient with FLT3-ITD+ AML. NSG mice are sublethally irradiated and then 5\u00d710cells are injected via tail vein. Mice are started on therapy in the same fashion as described in Example 13 once peripheral blast counts reached \u02dc10%.","Two cell line derivatives of the human FLT3-ITD AML cell line Molm14, which acquired either the D835Y (activation loop) or F691L (gatekeeper) mutation after selection in escalating doses of the FLT3 inhibitor AC220, are used to test the activity of MerTK inhibitors against clinically relevant FLT3 point mutations. Cells are analyzed for viability after 48 hours of culture in Molm14, Molm14:D835Y, and Molm14:F691L after treatment with a MerTK inhibitor. Phosphorylation is analyzed in Molm14, Molm14:D835Y, and Molm14:F691L after treatment with a MerTK inhibitor. Cell lines are also analyzed for resistance to treatment with AC220 at concentrations (e.g. 20-fold higher) than the inhibitory concentration in the parental line.","A Molm14:D835Y xenograft model is established by injection of 2.5\u00d710Molm14:D835Y cells into NSG mice via tail vein. The D835Y mutation in the activation loop confers resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor AC220. On day 4 after injection, mice are started on daily therapy with a MerTK inhibitor, 10 mg\/kg AC220, or saline via oral gavage. Mice are treated through day 100 then observed for relapse.","Inhibition constants of MerTK, Flt3, Tyro3 and Axl kinase activity by an active compound as described herein is determined at the Km for ATP using a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis (MCE) assay in which phosphorylated and unphosphorylated substrate peptides were separated and analyzed using a LabChip EZ Reader.
