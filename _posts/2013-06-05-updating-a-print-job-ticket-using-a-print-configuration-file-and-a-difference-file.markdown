Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and a storage medium for storing a program to perform the information processing method.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a photographic processing system or the like, when a user performs printing from another system, the user can use a hot folder application as a print application capable of, without using a specific API (Application Programming Interface), achieving a print function by inserting image data and print configuration information data (or print setting information data) in a folder called a hot folder.","The hot folder is the holder in which data insertion is monitored. When image data and print configuration information data are newly stored in the hot folder, the hot folder application detects the image data and the print configuration information data both newly stored, and performs a print process based on the image data and the print configuration information data both detected. Usually, the hot folder is set within a large-capacity storage such as a hard disk or the like, and the image data and the print configuration information data which are the targets of the print process are stored. Hereinafter, the image data is called content data, the filed print configuration information data is generally called a job ticket or a print ticket, and the job ticket and the content data are collectively called job data.","In general, the same job ticket is often used to the same content data. However, there are cases where a user wishes to temporarily change the print configuration for certain reasons. For example, the user may wish to change a kind of print paper to an inexpensive paper for the purpose of test printing to be performed before real printing, and the user may wish to acquire a plurality of prints. In these cases, when the user intends to directly change the original job ticket, he\/she has to know the detailed structure of the relevant job ticket. However, only the users who know the detailed structure of the job ticket do not necessarily change the print configuration, and, there is a possibility that an error occurs when the user changes the print configuration. Further, when the job ticket is a read-only ticket, or when a plurality of users share the job ticket, it is basically impossible to change the job ticket. For such reasons as above, a function which enables to temporarily change the print configuration without changing the original job ticket has been required.","In the related background art, there is the technique of changing the print configuration for each image data on the basis of a first print condition file commonly used throughout a job and a second print condition file set for each image data (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006-227992).","In the relevant technique, although it is possible to set the print configuration for each image data, it is impossible to achieve a temporary change of the print configuration information.","The present invention has been completed in consideration of such problems as above, and an object thereof is to enable the user to easily change the print configuration information temporarily.","To achieve the above object, the present invention is directed to An information processing apparatus which is characterized by comprising: a monitoring unit configured to monitor that job data composed of print configuration information data and content data, and a difference file for temporarily changing print configuration information of the print configuration information data to different print configuration information are put in a hot folder; and a correcting unit configured to, in a case where the job data and the difference file are put in the hot folder, correct the print configuration information data included in the job data on the basis of the difference file.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.","In order to simplify the description, a job ticket to be used in a hot folder application is assumed to be a file of an XML (Extensible Markup Language) format.  is a diagram illustrating an example of a job ticket  in the XML format. As illustrated in , the job ticket has a hierarchical structure. The most significant element is a Job element. A description region  is a description region of the Job element. The Job element is such an element which expresses the whole job, and the print configuration, which is related to the whole job, for example, a type of paper to be used for the printing, a size of the printing paper and the like, is described. The job element has a Doc element as a child element. Description regions  and  are description regions of Doc elements. A group of pages is defined in the Doc element. The Doc element, which means one group within a document, can describe the print configuration of page numbers included between StartPage and Endpage by designating a StartPage number and an Endpage number by using a Page element to be described later. In a case that the StartPage and the Endpage are not designated, this case means that the Doc element is such a Doc element which defines all the pages of contents data. The print configuration can be also described to the Doc element. In this case, the same configuration is applied to all the page numbers defined by the Doc element. The Doc element has a Page element as a child element. Description regions  and  are description regions of Page elements. The page element means physical pages, and the print configuration of page number to be designated by PageNo of the Page element can be described. When the print configuration is applied to the Job element, Doc element and the Page element, the hierarchies to be applied are respectively called a job level, a document level and a page level.","Although the Job element is an essential element for the job ticket, the Doc element and the Page element can be omitted in a case that the print configuration is not required for the document level and the page level. However, in case of describing the Page element, the Doc element, which is a parent element of the Page element, is always required to be described.","Here, a case that job data is changed by a procedure that print configuration information desired to be temporarily applied to the job ticket is described in a difference file and the hot folder application corrects the job ticket to a parameter and a value described in the difference file is considered. The difference file may be either a text file format or an INI (Initialization) file format. Although it has been described that the job data is constituted by combining the job ticket with contents data, it is allowed that the job data is simply constituted by print configuration information data and the contents data. Incidentally, the difference file may include the print configuration information used for changing a part of the print configuration information of the job ticket.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["607","607"]},"In case of applying the description contents of the difference file to the job ticket, the print configuration of the job level and page level in the difference file has to be respectively described in the Job element and the Page element of the job ticket. The Job element is an essential element, and since only one element exists for one job, the print configuration addition of the job level can be performed without problem. However, in a case that a description of the Doc element is insufficient as mentioned below, the print configuration of page level cannot be added to the job ticket.","(1) A Doc element does not exist.","(2) Although the Doc element exists, a configuration change-target page is not included.","(3) Although Doc elements exist, plural Doc elements for defining the configuration change-target page exist.","Hereinafter, it will be described about the constitution that the print configuration for each page is temporarily changed even when the description of the Doc element of the job ticket is insufficient.","First Embodiment","It will be described about the first embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["101","101","101","102","101","102","102","103","101","103","101","102","103","102","101","101","102","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["101","101","201","202","203","204","201","103","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["101","301","201","101","301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308","204","101","203","202"]},"The CPU  performs a control process of the whole information processing apparatus .","The ROM  is a read-only memory. As for the ROM , there are a PROM (Programmable ROM), to which a user can perform a process that a program is electrically written in the ROM, and a mask ROM, of which the contents is written in the ROM when the ROM is manufactured, however, either ROM is available in the present embodiment.","The RAM  is such a memory, in which data can be freely written, and from which data can be freely read out.
