title: Delivery channel selection and application layer handover of programs for a mobile service
abstract: Methods and devices provide channel assignments of programs delivered in a mobile setting. The channel assignments include unicast channels, multicast channels, and broadcast channels. The channel assignments are based on one or more of the type of program, user viewership information, or user voting information. Additionally, methods and devices provide for handover between mobile service areas at the application layer. Programs are buffered based on a handover time. During the handover, the buffered portion of the program is played.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Mobile devices, such as mobile phones, smart phones, tablets, and other portable devices, are pervasive among users. As a result, service providers and network providers continue to strive to improve wireless services, in terms of types of service (e.g., location-aware services, multimedia services, etc.), access, performance, etc. Given the growing demand for wireless service, wireless bandwidth is gradually becoming a precious commodity.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.","The term \u201cprogram,\u201d as used herein, includes video content. For example, the program may be television video content (e.g., a movie, a television show, pay-per-view content, video-on-demand content, etc.) or Internet content (e.g., a webcast, a videocast, a podcast, etc.).","The term \u201cmobile service area,\u201d as used herein, is intended to include a geographic area associated with a wireless service. For example, a cell and a cell sector (e.g., a sub-area of the cell) represent a geographic area within a cellular network. Alternatively, in a non-cellular network (e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), WiFi, etc.), other types of geographic areas may be exist based on wireless coverage provided by a node or node of the non-cellular network. A mobile service area may also include multiple cells, cell sectors, or other types of geographic areas.","Wireless bandwidth is a limited resource. Due to the continuous increase in user demand, content delivery systems should be designed to use the available wireless bandwidth efficiently. For example, with the wireless bandwidth demands associated with the delivery of programs (e.g., videos) in a mobile setting, programs may be delivered in a unicast, multicast, or broadcast manner. If a program is viewed by more than one person, then the broadcasting or multicasting of the program is more economical (e.g., in terms of resource utilization, etc.) than unicasting. Additionally, in practice, a wireless network may have a limited number of channels allocated for broadcasting and multicasting programs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","1","110","110","110","150","1","150","150","150","150","150","1","1","150"]},"The number of devices and networks, and the configuration in environment  are exemplary and provided for simplicity. According to other embodiments, environment  may include additional devices, fewer devices, different devices, and\/or differently arranged devices, than those illustrated in .","According to other embodiments, a single device may be implemented as multiple devices and\/or multiple devices may be implemented as a single device. A device may be implemented according to a centralized computing architecture or a distributed computing architecture. Additionally, a device may be implemented according to one or multiple network architectures (e.g., a client device, a server device, a peer device, or a combination thereof).","Also, according to other embodiments, one or more functions and\/or processes described as being performed by a particular device may be performed by a different device, or some combination of devices. By way of example, one or more functions and\/or processes described as being performed by network device  may be performed by user device , or vice versa, or in combination.","Network  includes one or more networks. Network  includes a wireless network (e.g., mobile network, cellular network, non-cellular network, etc.). By way of example, the wireless network may corresponds to a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network, a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) network, a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) network, an Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) network, a High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) network, a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) network, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.X network, a Evolution Data Optimized (EV-DO) network, a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, a wireless Internet Protocol (IP) network, and\/or another type of wireless network (e.g., an ad hoc network, etc.). Network  includes networks that support the unicasting, multicasting, and broadcasting of programs to users. Network  may also include a wired network.","Network devices  include devices having the capability to communicate with other devices, systems, networks, and\/or the like. For example, network devices  may include wireless devices (e.g., base stations (BSs), Node Bs, base transceiver stations (BTSs), radio nodes, evolved Node Bs (eNBs), repeaters, relays, base station controllers (BSCs), etc.) to allow user devices  to access network . Network devices  also include devices for providing a program delivery service to users. The program delivery service includes unicasting, multicasting, and broadcasting programs. Network devices  are described further below.","User device  includes a device having the capability to communicate with other devices, systems, networks, and\/or the like. For example, user device  may take the form of a smartphone, a computer (e.g., a laptop, a palmtop, etc.), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a personal communication system (PCS) terminal, a pervasive computing device, a video playing device, or some other type of mobile device (e.g., a vehicle-based communication system, etc.).","According to an exemplary embodiment, a network device (e.g., network device ) determines whether a program is delivered to a user using a unicast channel, a multicast channel, or a broadcast channel. According to an exemplary embodiment, the network device determines between unicasting or broadcasting a program based on past user viewing statistics associated with the program and\/or similar program(s) in a mobile service area. According to another exemplary embodiment, the network device determines between unicasting or broadcasting a program based on user voting, which may be implemented, for example, via a mobile application and\/or a web interface. According to yet another exemplary embodiment, the network device determines between unicasting or broadcasting of a program based on whether the program is a sponsored event. For example, a content provider or an advertisement agency may sponsor a program for broadcasting. According to still another embodiment, the network device determines between unicasting or multicasting a program based on a subscription-based event. For example, a third party may coordinate among users to view a program. According to this scenario, the program may be multicasted to those users.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a network device determines the type of delivery on a periodic basis. For example, the network device may determine the type of delivery for a program, in a particular mobile service area, every half-hour or some other time period that corresponds to the timeslot of the program. Additionally, or alternatively, the network device determines the type of delivery in real-time. For example, the network device continually monitors and evaluates up-to-date viewing statistics, voting, and\/or other criterion, in a real-time, to determine the type of delivery of a program in a mobile service area.","As described above, the delivery of programs is determined for a particular mobile service area. When a user is viewing a program in one mobile service area and moves to another mobile service area, a handoff may take place. However, in some situations, the delivery of the program may be different between two mobile service areas. For example, the program may be broadcast to the user in one mobile service area, but in the other mobile service area, the program may be delivered in a unicast fashion. According to another example, the user may be moving from a mobile service area that unicasts the program to a mobile service area that broadcasts the program.","According to an exemplary embodiment, when a user begins to view a program, a mobile application of a user device (e.g., user device ) buffers video data of the program. In contrast to other approaches, when a user moves from one mobile service area (e.g., mobile service area-) to another service area (mobile service area-Z), the handover is managed, at least in part, at the application layer (e.g., the mobile application that plays the program). For example, during the handover, the user may view buffered video data of the program. The duration of the program that is buffered depends on the amount of time needed to complete the handover. According to an exemplary embodiment, the amount of buffering time may be based on a handover prediction time. According to another exemplary embodiment, an advance handover notification is used to minimize the amount of buffering time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","210","1","210","210","210","215","220","230"]},"Wireless devices  include network devices having wireless communicative capabilities that provide access to network . For example, wireless device  may take the form of a base station (BS), an enhanced Node B (eNB), etc.","Broadcast multicast device  includes a network device that provides for the delivery of programs via multicast and broadcast channels. For example, broadcast multicast device  may take the form of a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) device, a Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld (DVB-H) device, a Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) device, or a DVB-Next Generation Handheld (DVB-NGH) device.","Application device  includes a network device that supports various services related to user connections with network  and mobile service including program delivery. For example, application device  may provide or support user authentication, authorization, and billing. Application device  may also provide or support program delivery services. For example, application device  may facilitate handovers and manage programs-to-broadcast and multicast channel assignments. Application device  may take the form of a computational device, such as a server device, an application server, an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) device, and\/or other suitable network device(s).","Database device  includes a network device that stores data and\/or information. Database device  may include databases (e.g., a relational database, a distributed database, or other type of suitable database) pertaining to the management of channel assignments for programs. For example, database device  may include databases pertaining to user viewership of programs, user voting, and channel assignments for programs. Database device  may take the form of a computational device, such as, for example, a server or other form of database management system.","Unicast device  includes a network device that provides for the delivery of programs via unicast channels. User device  is a device similar to user device .","As previously described, according to an exemplary embodiment, a network device determines whether a program is delivered to a user using a unicast channel, a multicast channel, or a broadcast channel. According to an exemplary embodiment, the network device determines between unicasting or broadcasting a program based on past user viewing statistics associated with the program and\/or similar program(s) in a mobile service area, user voting, and\/or whether the program is a sponsored event. The network device also determines between unicasting or multicasting a program based on a subscription-based event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["220","220","220","225"]},"According to an exemplary embodiment, application device  correlates programs to channels based on user viewing information. For example, when a user of user device  selects a program to view, application device  may receive this information (e.g., as a program request) or another device (not illustrated) may receive this information and this information is subsequently communicated to application device . In addition to the program selected by the user, application device  may obtain the mobile service area at which the selected program is being viewed. For example, if the user views the program while located in mobile service area , this information may be obtained. In cases when the user moves from one mobile service area to another mobile service area, the mobile service area may be identified as multiple mobile service areas. Alternatively, the mobile service area may be identified as the area at which the majority of the program is viewed or the area at which the program was initially viewed (e.g. a source mobile service area).","The program selection and mobile service area information is collected, stored in database device , and used to correlate programs to channels. For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, application device  identifies which mobile service area(s) have the highest viewership for a particular program. Application device  assigns these programs to broadcast channels. Application device  may also determine, based on the program selection and mobile service area information, whether adjacent mobile service areas may be assigned the same broadcast channels-to-programs. In this way, handover processes between adjacent mobile service areas may be optimized.","An example of program selection and mobile service area information is illustrated in . As illustrated, programs - are mapped to mobile service areas -. For example, for program , mobile service area , there are five users that viewed program ; for program , mobile service area , there are two hundred users that viewed program ; for program , mobile service area , there are one hundred users that viewed program ; for program , mobile service area , there are ten users that viewed program ; and for program , mobile service area , there are twenty users that viewed program .","The program selection and mobile service area information may correspond to historical data or real-time data. According to an exemplary embodiment, the number of users that viewed a program may include similar programs or the program may represent a category of programs. For example, program  may represent courtroom TV shows (e.g., Judge Judy, Divorce Court, etc.). The number of users may represent viewership over any span of time (e.g., a month, a week, a day, currently, etc.). Additionally, the number of users may represent an actual number of users or an average number of users over the span of time. For example, in some instances, some users may not watch the entire program. Thus, the number of users may change over time and an average number of users may be calculated.","Based on the program selection and mobile service area information, application device  assigns channels to each of the programs. According to an exemplary embodiment, the selection of channel assignment-to-program is based on the number of users-to-mobile service area information. For example, according to an exemplary implementation, the mobile service area that has the highest number of users viewing the program relative to other programs viewed in that mobile service area, application device  assigns this program to a broadcast channel. Additionally, for example, according to an exemplary implementation, the mobile service area that has the highest number of users viewing the program relative to other mobile service area(s), application device  assigns this program to a broadcast channel.","Depending on the number of available broadcast channels, other channel assignment schemes may be used. For example, instead of a highest number of users criterion, the selection of channels may be based on a threshold number of users. Additionally, other factors may be considered. For example, depending on the program, historical data may not exist. By way of example, court TV programs typically air the same time, on the same channel, Monday through Friday. In contrast, other types of programs (e.g., movies, award shows (e.g., Academy awards, etc.), etc.) air once and not on a regular basis. Based on these distinctions, application device  may assign programs to channels based on other criterion, such as, genre of program, extent of advertising, etc. In this regard, some programs may be associated with, for example, special identifiers to allow application device  to distinguish these types of programs from other programs. For example, as described further below, programs may be associated with various types of metadata.","According to an exemplary embodiment, application device  may assign programs to channels on a periodic basis. For example, application device  may assign programs to channels every half-hour, hour, or some other period of time that corresponds to the airing of the programs being assigned a channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":["1","5"]},"As illustrated, program  is assigned to a broadcast channel  for each of the mobile service areas -. Referring to , program  has the highest number of users viewing program  across each of the mobile service areas relative to the other programs. Additionally, referring back to , program  is assigned to a broadcast channel  for each of the mobile service areas -. Similar to program , program  has the second highest number of users viewing program  across each of the mobile service areas relative to the remaining programs. Referring back to , application device  selects the highest number of users relative to programs ,  and  and mobile service areas -. For example, as illustrated in , program  has the highest number of users in mobile service area  and program  for mobile service area . Thus, referring to , program  is assigned to broadcast channel  in mobile service area  and program  is assigned to broadcast channel  in mobile service area .","Referring back to , since programs , , and  each have identical values, respectively, within mobile services areas -, application device  may assign either of programs , , or  to broadcast channel .","Depending on the locations of mobile service areas, application device  may assign adjacent mobile service areas and programs to the broadcast channel. For example, if historical data indicates a regular migration of users between mobile service areas  and , then application device  may assign the same program to a broadcast channel for both mobile service areas  and .","For programs that are not assigned to a broadcast channel, application device  assigns the programs to a unicast channel, with the exception if a program is a subscription-based event, as described further below.","As described above, in this example, application device  identified a level of user viewership (e.g., numerical number of users) with respect to programs and mobile service areas. According to an exemplary embodiment, the program yielding the highest number of user viewers is assigned to a broadcast channel. According to another embodiment, other criterion may be applied, such as a threshold user viewership value, as well as other criterion described herein. Application device  may also consider the number of broadcast channels available as a resource and assign programs to broadcast channels in the most optimal way.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the network device determines between unicasting or broadcasting a program based on user voting. For example, referring back to , a web device  (e.g., an application server, a web server, etc.) may permit users to cast votes for programs that the users wish to have broadcasted. Since the broadcasting of programs is less expensive than the unicasting of programs, users may be encouraged to place their votes. The user voting information may be stored by database device . According to another exemplary embodiment, users may vote via a mobile application (e.g., a video player, an Interactive Programming Guide (IPG), etc.). The users' votes may be stored by database device .","Application device  may assign channels to programs based on the user voting information. For example, programs with the highest votes or above a particular voting threshold, which indicate a level of user popularity, may be assigned a broadcast channel. Alternatively, application device  may use both the user voting information and the user viewing information to assign programs to channels.","According to an exemplary embodiment, application device  may assign channels to programs based on whether the programs are sponsored events. For example, a sponsor (e.g., a content provider, an advertiser, a corporation, a company, etc.) may sponsor the broadcasting of a program. According to such a circumstance, the sponsor may pay a fee to the service provider for broadcasting the particular program. Sponsored program information may be received by ordering device  and stored by database device .","According to an exemplary embodiment, application device  may assign channels to programs based on whether the programs are subscription-based events. For example, unlike a sponsored event, a third party may attract users for subscribing to a program. The third party may pay a fee to the service provider for multicasting the particular program to the subscribed users. Users that subscribe to the program may receive a subscription code. The subscription code may permit the users to view the multicasting of the program. Similar to the previous example, subscription-based events may be received by ordering device  and stored by database device .","According to an exemplary embodiment, channel assignments are a part of an interactive programming guide.  is a diagram of an exemplary interactive programming guide. Each program  of the interactive programming guide includes metadata. For example, the metadata may include the program title (e.g., News 9 at Five), the time (e.g., 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.), and description (e.g., accessible when program  is selected). Additionally, the metadata includes a channel assignment. For example, the channel assignment may take the form of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), a network address, etc., for unicast, multicast, or broadcast streaming of the program. The channel assignments of application device  are included in the interactive programming guide (e.g., as metadata). As described further below, when the user of user device (e.g., user device ) initiates a connection (e.g., via a mobile application), the streaming of the program is based on the URL, the network address, etc. According to an exemplary embodiment, the channel assignment for a program may be a broadcast channel, a multicast channel, or a unicast channel. According to other embodiments, the program may include multiple channels (e.g., a broadcast channel and a unicast channel, etc.). According to an exemplary embodiment, the broadcast channel is given preference over a unicast channel for program delivery purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1","250","2","220","220","3","220","220"]},"Additionally, application device  selects an interactive programming guide that includes the channel assignments. According to an exemplary embodiment, the interactive programming guide may be mobile service area-specific. That is, the channel assignments included in the interactive programming guide are for the mobile service area that user device  is located. According to such an embodiment, the mobile service area to which user device  is located is identified. According to an exemplary implementation, application device  may store the interactive programming guide. Alternatively, although not illustrated, application device  may obtain the interactive programming guide from database device .","In step (), application device  transmits a connection response to user device . The connection response includes the interactive programming guide. In step (), the user selects a program from the interactive programming guide. In this example, assume that the selected program is assigned a broadcast channel. Based on the user's program selection, a program request is transmitted to application device , as illustrated in step (). Application device  transmits a program request to broadcast multicast device  so that a program session is established between user device  and broadcast multicast device , as illustrated in step (). In step (), the program request is received and the selected program is broadcast to user device  via broadcast multicast device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","110","220","700"]},"Referring to , in block , at least one of user viewership information or user voting information is obtained. For example, user viewership of programs in mobile service area information is obtained and stored by database device . Additionally, user voting of programs in mobile service area information is obtained and stored by database device .","In block , the programs available to users are obtained. For example, application device  may identify programs that should be assigned a channel (e.g., a broadcast channel, a unicast channel, and\/or a multicast channel). This information may be obtained, for example, from a content device, which may include program schedule information, the interactive programming guide, and\/or some other network device.","In block , one of the available programs is selected. For example, application device  selects one of the programs for channel assignment.","In block , it is determined whether the program is a sponsored program or a subscription-based program. By way of example, programs that are sponsored programs or subscription-based programs may be flagged. Application device  may recognize these types of programs to permit appropriate channel assignment. According to an exemplary embodiment, sponsored programs may be given a higher priority for assignment to a broadcast channel than non-sponsored programs. For example, application device  may select sponsored programs for channel assignment before non-sponsored programs to ensure broadcast channels are available and appropriate channel assignment occurs. In practice, this approach may be useful, particularly when the number of broadcast channels are limited (e.g., in a mobile service area), According to another embodiment, application device  may not adhere to the sponsored program priority scheme.","If it is determined that the program is a sponsored program or a subscription-based program (block \u2014YES), the program is assigned a broadcast channel or a multicast channel (block ). For example, application device  assigns the sponsored program to a broadcast channel and assigns the subscription-based program to a multicast channel. The channel assignment may pertain to multiple mobile service areas.","In block , it is determined whether another program is to be assigned a channel. For example, application device  identifies whether there are any remaining programs that need a channel assignment. If it is determined that there is another program for channel assignment (block \u2014YES), then process  continues to block . If it is determined that there is not another program for channel assignment (block \u2014NO), then process  ends.","Returning to block , if it is determined that the program is not a sponsored program or a subscription-based program (block \u2014NO), then a channel assignment is determined based on the at least one of user viewership information or the user voting information (block ). For example, as previously described, application device  calculates the channel assignment for a program of a mobile service area. According to an exemplary implementation, with reference to the user viewership information, application device  assigns the most viewed programs to a broadcast channel. Alternatively, application device  may assign a program to a broadcast channel based on a threshold number of users, a channel assignment of another mobile service area, and\/or other criterion (e.g., genre of program, extent of advertising, etc.).","In block , the program is assigned to a channel. For example, application device  assigns a program to at least one of a broadcast channel or a unicast channel. Process  may continue to block  and proceed as previously described.","Although  illustrates an exemplary process  for assigning channels to programs, according to other embodiments, process  may include additional operations, fewer operations, and\/or different operations than those illustrated in  and described herein.","As previously described, when a user moves from one mobile service area to another mobile service area, a handover may take place. For example, the user may move from a mobile service area that broadcasts the program to another mobile service area that unicasts the program, or vice versa. According to an exemplary embodiment, the handover is managed, at least in part, at the application layer. For example, a mobile application of the user device (e.g., user device ) buffers the program for a time period equivalent to or substantially equivalent to the time period needed to perform the handover. In this way, the program session may continue with no or little interruption in mobile service when viewing the program. A further description is provided below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["150","250","150","250","805","805","810","815","820","825","805","820","825","825"]},"Video player  includes a multimedia player that is capable of playing programs (e.g., video). Video buffer manager  manages the buffering of a program. As described further below, video buffer manager  may buffer a program based on a handover time. Video session manager  manages the video session between user device \/ and network \/. According to an exemplary embodiment, video session manager  tracks the position of a program during the playing of the program. Video session tracking information may be used when user device \/ changes, for example, from a unicast connection to a broadcast connection, or vice versa, during a handover process. According to another embodiment, application device  performs video session tracking. Data connection monitor  monitors the state of a connection between user device \/ and network \/. As described further below, data connection monitor  manages advance handover notifications, which may be used to minimize the amount of buffering of a program.","Described below is an exemplary process for managing handover based on video buffering.  is an exemplary messaging diagram pertaining to switching from a broadcast session to a unicast session. For purposes of description, assume that user device  begins receiving a program based on a broadcast session in accordance with the steps previously described in relation to . As illustrated, in step (), video buffer manager  of user device  buffers the program based on a handover time. In this example, the handover time is 15 seconds. In this way, if a handover occurs, video player  may continue to play the program from a buffer (e.g., a memory) while the handover takes place. As previously described, the buffer size depends on the network handoff time. According to an exemplary implementation, video buffer manager  buffers the program when first received. During this time, the user may not view the program. Thereafter, as illustrated in , step (), user device  continues to receive (e.g., streaming) the program from broadcast multicast device .","According to this exemplary scenario, assume the user moves toward another mobile service area that does not support or provide a broadcasting of the program. Rather, the other mobile service area supports or provides a unicasting of the program. According to an exemplary embodiment, user device  identifies the position of user device  relative to the boundaries of the mobile service area at which user device  is located. For example, user device  may calculate position based on a Global Positioning System (GPS) or other suitable location-aware system. User device  may predict when a handover may take place based on a speed and a direction associated with the user's mobility and current position relative to the boundaries of the mobile service area. According to such an embodiment, mobile application  receives an advance handover notification (e.g., an application programming interface (API) level notification, such as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM API) level notification) to permit user device  to initiate a unicast connection, as illustrated in steps ( and ). For example, the advance handover notification may be generated from another mobile application of user device . Alternatively, network  may calculate user device  position and predict the handover. According to such an embodiment, user device  may receive an advance handover notification via wireless device .","According to an exemplary embodiment, user device  may transmit an advance handover alert to application device , as illustrated in step (). According to this example, application device  may be performing the video session tracking of the program. As illustrated in step (), in response to receiving the advance handover alert, application device  transmits video tracking information to unicast device . The video tracking information may include, for example, a program identifier and a program position (e.g., a time code position, a data chunk identifier, etc.). According to another embodiment, user device  may track the video position of the program and transmit video tracking information to unicast device  or some other network device (not illustrated).","During the handover from a broadcast channel to a unicast channel, in this example, user device  (e.g., video player ) plays the program from the video buffer, as illustrated in step (). According to this example, the amount of buffer time of the program may be reduced, since user device  may prepare for the handover earlier in time. For example, at least some steps pertaining to a handover may be performed in parallel with the broadcasting of the program.","As illustrated in steps ()-(), user device  and unicast device  negotiate a unicast session, and the program is unicasted to user device  via unicast device .","Described below is another exemplary process for managing handover based on video buffering.  is an exemplary messaging diagram pertaining to switching from a broadcast session to a unicast session. In this example, an advance handover notification scheme is not used. Rather, user device  and\/or wireless devices  detect when a handover is needed based on conventional downlink and\/or uplink channel monitoring. Referring to step (), when a broadcast connection becomes unavailable to user device , mobile application  receives a handover notification (e.g., an OEM level notification). Application device  transmits video tracking information to unicast device , as illustrated in step (). During the handover from a broadcast channel to a unicast channel, user device  (e.g., video player ) plays the program from the video buffer, as illustrated in step (). As illustrated in steps ()-(), user device  and unicast device  negotiate a unicast session, and the program is unicasted to user device  via unicast device .","According to the exemplary handover processes illustrated and described in relation to , interruption of program delivery may be minimized. The handover is accomplished, at least in part, at the (mobile) application layer based on the video buffering by mobile application  of user device . Application device  may also contribute to the handover process (e.g., by providing video session tracking). In contrast to conventional approaches in which handover is performed at the lower levels (e.g., lower Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) levels, etc.), the handover process described herein may be performed at the application layer.","Although  illustrates exemplary devices and messages, according to other embodiments, the messages and\/or the devices may be different. For example, depending on the type of network and the network devices therein, the functionalities assigned to each network device, etc., various modifications may be implemented. Additionally, although  have been described relating to switching from a broadcast session to a unicast session, the process may pertain to switching from a unicast session to a broadcast session, or other types of handover scenarios (e.g., unicast to unicast, multicast to multicast, etc.). However in some switching scenarios, the program stored by the video buffer on user device  cannot be continued from where the other connection ended. For example, when switching from a unicast channel to a multicast channel, the location of the program currently transmitted over the multicast channel may have already passed the program position saved by the video buffer. In this case, some piece of the program data is lost and the user has to experience some loss of the program (e.g., video frames).","There are various types of handovers, such as inter-cell, intra-cell, hard, soft, etc. The handover processes described herein are applicable to various types of handovers that may be performed in various types of networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","250","1000"]},"Referring to , in block , a session for delivery of a program is established. For example, user device  negotiates a wireless connection with network  for receiving a program. Depending on the mobile service area at which user device  is located and the program, the wireless connection may be for receiving the program in a unicast, multicast, or broadcast manner.","In block , the program is received. For example, user device  begins to receive a program selected by a user.","In block , video session tracking is performed. For example, user device  tracks a position (e.g., a time-based position), amount (e.g., video chunk), or other suitable marker related to the receipt of streaming of the program.","In block , the program is buffered based on a handover time. For example, user device  buffers a portion of the program equivalent to a handover time. The handover time may be a preconfigured value. As previously described, depending on whether the advanced handover notification scheme is used or not, the amount of buffering of the program vis-\u00e0-vis the handover time may vary.","In block , the program is played. For example, user device  plays the program via a mobile application (e.g., mobile application ).","In block , it is determined whether a handover is needed. For example, user device  may identify when a handover is needed based on techniques applicable to a wireless network. Alternatively, user device  may identify, in advance, a handover, as previously described. A handover may be triggered when user device  moves from one mobile service area to another mobile service area.","If it is determined that a handover is not to take place (block \u2014NO), then process  continues to block . That is, user device  continues to receive the program, perform video session tracking, and buffer the program. If it is determined that a handover is to take place (block \u2014YES), then the program is played from a buffer (block ). For example, the mobile application plays a portion of the program that has been buffered.","In block , video session tracking information is provided. For example, user device  provides video tracking information (e.g., a program identifier, a position of program) to a network device (e.g., broadcast multicast device , unicast device ) to which the handover is be given.","In block , the handover is performed. For example, user device  and network  coordinate a handover process.","In block , another session for delivery of the program is established. For example, user device  negotiates a wireless connection with network  for receiving the program. Depending on the mobile service area at which user device  is located and the program, the wireless connection may be for receiving the program in a unicast, multicast, or broadcast manner.","Although  illustrates an exemplary process  for performing a handover process based on video buffering, according to other embodiments, process  may include additional operations, fewer operations, and\/or different operations than those illustrated in  and described herein.
