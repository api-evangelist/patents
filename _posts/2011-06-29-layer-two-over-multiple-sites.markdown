The nodes may include routers, switches, bridges, or combinations thereof that transport the individual data packets or frames through the network. Some networks may offer data services that forward data frames from one node to another node across the network without using pre-configured routes on intermediate nodes. Other networks may forward the data frames from one node to another node across the network along pre-configured or pre-established paths.","In one embodiment, the disclosure includes an apparatus comprising a service network, and a plurality of Layer 2 sites connected by the service network via a plurality of gateways, wherein the gateways are configured to map a plurality of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of a plurality of hosts under a plurality of virtual local area networks (VLANs) in a plurality of Layer 2 sites to a plurality of addresses (which can be Media Access Control\u2014MAC, IP, or other addresses) of the corresponding gateways, inform the other gateways in the other Layer 2 sites of the mapped IP addresses under each of the VLANs in the local Layer 2 sites, and forward data frames originated from the hosts in the local Layer 2 sites to the other gateways in the other Layer 2 sites when the data frames' destinations are residing in the other Layer 2 sites.","In another embodiment, the disclosure includes a network component comprising a receiver configured to receive via a service network a frame encapsulated using one or two layers of Ethernet headers that comprise a destination address in an outer Ethernet header that is destined to a local gateway of a local Layer 2 site from a remote host in a remote Layer 2 site, a type field that indicates if the outer Ethernet header requires decapsulation or another type field in the Ethernet header that indicates if the destination address in the Ethernet header requires translation, a logic circuit configured to translate the destination address in the Ethernet header to a Media Access Control (MAC) address of a local host based on the Ethernet payload's Internet Protocol (IP) destination address of the local host in the local Layer 2 site if the destination address requires translation, and a transmitter configured to send to another gateway of another Layer 2 site a frame originated from a local host in the local Layer 2 site connected to the other Layer 2 site via the service network when the destination host resides in the other Layer 2 site.","In yet another embodiment, the disclosure includes a method comprising receiving a frame from a first host in a first site of a Layer 2 network that is intended for a second host in a second site of the same Layer 2 network, mapping a destination address (DA) for the second host in the frame to an address (MAC, IP, or others) of a gateway that corresponds to a first Layer 2 Gateway (L2GW1) in the first site of the Layer 2 network or a second Layer 2 Gateway (L2GW2) in the second site of the Layer 2 network, using the MAC address of the gateway in the frame as a target host MAC address, and sending the frame to the gateway in the second site of the Layer 2 network via a service network connected to the first site of the Layer 2 network and the second site of the Layer 2 network.","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","Modern data networks, which can be Layer 2 or Layer 3 networks, provide connectivity to cloud services and virtual machines (VMs) that may need to span across multiple locations or sites. Sometimes, Layer 2 networks for data centers that connect Clusters of servers (or VMs) and storage devices have to span across multiple locations. The data center networks may also need to stay in Layer 2 level to support already deployed applications and thus save cost, e.g., in millions of dollars. Layer 2 communications between the Cluster of servers and\/or storage devices include load balancing, database clustering, virtual server failure recovery, transparent operation below the network layer (Layer 3), spreading a subnet across multiple locations, and redundancy. Layer 2 communications also include a keep-alive mechanism between applications. Some applications need the same IP addresses to communicate on multiple locations, where one server may be Active and another server may be on Standby. The Active and Standby servers (in different locations) may exchange keep-alive messages between them, which may require a Layer 2 keep-alive mechanism.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","110","112","120","122","112","124","126","124","100"]},"The VPLS  may be any network that is configured to connect the LANs  across different locations or DCs. For instance, the VPLS  may comprise a Layer 3 network to interconnect the LANs  across different DCs. The Layer 2 switches 122 may be configured to communicate at the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model data link layer. Examples of data link protocols include Ethernet for LANs, the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), and Advanced Data Communication Control Protocol (ADCCP) for point-to-point connections. The access switches  may be configured to forward data between the Layer 2 switches  and the VMs . The VMs  may comprise system virtual machines that provide system platforms, e.g., operating systems (OSs) and\/or process virtual machines that run programs or applications. The VMs  in each LAN  may be distributed over a plurality of processors, central processor units (CPUs), or computer systems. A plurality of VMs  in a LAN  may also share the same system resources, such as disk space, memory, processor, and\/or other computing resources. The VMs  may be arranged on a shelf and connected to the corresponding LANs , e.g., via the access switches .","Some aspects of the VPLS interconnected LANs  may pose impractical or undesirable implementation issues. In one aspect, the VPLS  may require implementing a Wide Area Network (WAN) that supports Multiple Label Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). However, some operators do not support MPLS over WAN and thus may have difficulties in implementing VPLS interconnected LANs . Further, to resolve host link layer addresses, e.g., for the VMs  across the LANs , an IP version four (IPv4) ARP or IP version six (IPv6) Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol may be needed, such as the IPv4 ARP described in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 826 and IPv6 ND described by IETF RFC 4861, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The ARP may flood requests to all the interconnected LANs  and thus exhaust a substantial amount of system resources (e.g., bandwidth). Such ARP flooding mechanism may suffer from scalability issues, as the number of LANs  and\/or VMs  increases. The VPLS interconnected LANs  also need to setup mesh pseudo-wires (PWs) to connect to the LANs , which may require intensive configuration and state maintenance of tunnels. In some scenarios, the VPLS  may use a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to discover a LAN  and build a mesh PW for each LAN .","Optical Transport Virtualization (OTV) is another scalable mechanism that has been proposed for connecting Layer 2 networks across multiple locations or DCs to establish a flat Layer 2 network. OTV is a method proposed by Cisco that depends on IP encapsulation of Layer 2 communications. OTV may use an Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol to distribute MAC reachability within each location (e.g., DC) to other locations. The OTV scheme may also have some impractical or undesirable aspects. In one aspect, OTV may require maintaining a relatively large number of multicast groups by a provider core IP network. Since each LAN may have a separate overlay topology, there may be a relatively large quantity of overlay topologies that are maintained by the service provider IP network, which may pose a burden on the core network. OTV may also require that an edge node to use Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) to join different multicast groups in the IP domain. If each edge node is connected to a plurality of VLANs, the edge node may need to participate in multiple IGMP groups.","In OTV, edge devices, such as a gateway at each location, may be IP hosts that are one hop away from each other, which may not require implementing a link state protocol among the edge devices to exchange reachability information. However, the link state may also be used to authenticate a peer, which may be needed in OTV if the peer joins a VLAN by sending an IGMP version 3 (IGMPv3) report. Alternatively, OTV may use a BGP authentication method. However, the BGP authentication timing may be different than the IS-IS authentication timing. For example, BGP may be tuned for seconds performance and IS-IS may be tuned for sub-second performance. Further, the IS-IS protocol may not be suitable for handling a substantially large numbers of hosts and VMs, e.g., tens of thousands, in each location in the OTV system. OTV may also be unsuitable for supporting tens of thousands of closed user groups.","Disclosed herein are systems and methods for providing a scalable mechanism to connect a plurality of Layer 2 networks at a plurality of different locations to obtain a flat or single Layer 2 network. The scalable mechanism may resolve some of the aspects or challenges for obtaining a flat Layer 2 network that spans across multiple locations. The scalable mechanism may facilitate topology discovery across the locations by supporting scalable address resolution for applications and allowing network switches to maintain a plurality of addresses associated with all or a plurality of hosts across the locations. The scalable mechanism may also facilitate forwarding traffic across the different locations and broadcasting traffic, e.g., for unknown host addresses, and support multicast groups.","The methods include a border control mechanism to scale a relatively large flat Layer 2 over multiple locations. As such, applications, servers, and\/or VMs may not be aware of a virtual Layer 2 network that comprises multiple Layer 2 networks interconnected by another network, such as a Layer 3, a Layer 2.5, or a Layer 2 network. The Layer 2 networks may be located in different or separate physical locations, multiple floors of one location, or multiple rows interconnected by Layer 3. A protocol independent address resolution mechanism may also be used and may be suitable to handle a relatively large virtual Layer 2 network and\/or a substantially large number of Layer 2 networks over multiple locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","200","210","220","210","212","210","220","222","212","224","222","200","224"]},"The service network  may be any network established to interconnect the Layer 2 networks , such as a service provider network. For example, the service network  may be a Layer 2, Layer 2.5, or Layer 3 network, such as a virtual private network (VPN). The service network  may not be aware of all the addresses, e.g., MAC addresses, behind the L2GWs . The L2GWs  may be border nodes in each DC location and have Layer 2 interfaces to communicate internally in the DC locations. The L2GWs  and the intermediate switches  may communicate with the hosts and\/or VMs in the same locations within the same Layer 2 networks  using the corresponding MAC addresses of the hosts. However, the L2GWs  and the intermediate switches  may not need to be aware of the MAC addresses of the hosts\/VMs in the other Layer 2 networks . Instead, a host in one Layer 2 network  can use the address of a L2GW  of another Layer 2 network  (in another location or site) as the destination address to communicate with a target host in the other Layer 2 network. When a frame (e.g., an Ethernet frame) arrives at the L2GW  of the target site, e.g., the other Layer 2 network, the destination address of the target host may be translated by the L2GWs  based on the IP address carried in the payload of the frame, e.g., using a network address translation (NAT) table or a MAC address translation (MAT) table, as described below.","In an embodiment, each L2GW  may maintain the addresses of all the hosts\/VMs within the same Layer 2 network  of the L2GW  in a local IP addresses information table (Local-IPAddrTable). The L2GW  may also be configured to implement a proxy ARP function, as described below. Additionally, the L2GW  may maintain a MAC forwarding table, which may comprise the MAC addresses for non-IP applications. The MAC addresses may comprise the MAC addresses of the hosts\/VMs and the intermediate switches  within the same location, e.g., the same Layer 2 network .","The L2GW  may inform its peers (e.g., other L2GWs ) in other locations (e.g., other Layer 2 networks ) of all the active VLANs and all the IP addresses of the local hosts under each VLAN in its location. If there are non-IP applications within the domain, the L2GW  may also inform its peers of the MAC addresses and VLANs of those non-IP applications. A Layer 2 site or Layer 2 network  may have many VLANs enabled on the L2GWs'  ports and the intermediate switches'  ports for the sake of operation convenience. Thus, a VM or host belonging to any of the enabled VLANs may be moved in without additional configuration. A VALN that is active in a site (or Layer 2 network ) may have hosts belonging to this VLAN that resided within this site. The L2GWs  across the different locations may obtain the host IP addresses of all the other locations, even if the L2GWs  may only keep the address information for the VLANs that are active in their local sites (e.g., in a remote IP Address Information Table for each L2GW ). If there are no hosts in the local domain that belong to VLAN identifier (VID) for the VLAN, then there may be no need to keep the remote hosts information for this VID, since there may be no communications for this VID to be targeted to local domain. The terms VLAN and VID are used herein interchangeably to refer to an established VLAN, even though a VLAN may be assigned multiple VIDs (e.g., as described in IEEE 802.1Q). Hence, each L2GW  may map each group of IP addresses that belongs to a location (e.g., on of the Layer 2 networks ) to the MAC address of the corresponding L2GW  that belongs to the same location. The L2GW  also sends update of the address information to the peers when there is a change in its Local-IPAddrTable to update the information in the other peers. This may allow updating the address information and mapping in each L2GW  in an incremental manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","310","320","310","312","220","322","312","324","322","324","326"]},"Based on the border control mechanism , each L2GW  may maintain the IP addresses of hosts in all the locations belonging to the VLANs which are active in its corresponding local Layer 2 site, e.g., corresponding the Layer 2 network . Each L2GW  may also be aware of the MAC addresses of the peer L2GWs  in the other locations. However, the L2GW  may not maintain the MAC addresses of the hosts in the other locations, which may substantially reduce the size of data exchanged (and stored) among the L2GWs , since IP addresses may be summarized (e.g., 10.1.1.x may represent 255 hosts) while MAC addresses may not be summarized. The IP addresses maintained at the L2GW  may be mapped to the MAC addresses of the corresponding L2GWs  of the same locations. Specifically, each set of host IP addresses that belong to each location or Layer 2 network  may be mapped to the MAC address of the L2GW  in that location. However, the L2GWs  may exchange, across different locations, a plurality of MAC addresses for nodes that run non-IP applications.","To support address resolution across the different locations of the virtual Layer 2 network, an ARP (or ND) request may be sent from a first host  (host A) and be intercepted by the corresponding local L2GW  in a first location or Layer 2 network . The host A may send the ARP request to obtain the MAC address of a second host  (host B) in a second location or Layer 2 network . If the local L2GW  has an entry for the host B belonging to the same VLAN as host A, e.g., the IP address of the host B, the local L2GW  may respond to the ARP\/ND request by sending its own MAC address to the host A. Alternatively, the local L2GW  may send the corresponding L2GW's MAC address (where host B resides) in the ARP\/ND response to host A. If the local L2GW  does not maintain or store an entry for the host B for the VLAN, the local L2GW  may assume that the host B does not exist. For example, the L2GWs  may update their peers with their local host IP addresses and their corresponding VLAN(s) on a regular or periodic basis. It is possible that some L2GWs  may not have received updates for the IP addresses of newly configured hosts in other locations for some VLANs. In such case, no response is sent back and the requesting entity (host A) may send multiple ARP\/ND requests for the target host.","In an embodiment, the L2GW  may send out a plurality of aggregated IP addresses of the local hosts under each VLAN to the other L2GW  in the other Layer 2 sites. The number of entries in the aggregated addresses may be substantially smaller than the corresponding number of entries in the Local-IPAddrTable of the L2GW . in some embodiments, the L2GW  may send out requests to all other L2GWs  in other Layer 2 sites to solicit IP addresses (in aggregated form) under a single VLAN (or any of the VLANs) in the remote sites. This may be useful when a host belonging to a VLAN that was not active is added to the local site of the L2GW .","Table 1 illustrates an example of mapping host addresses to the corresponding L2GW's MAC addresses and VLAN according to the border control mechanism . A plurality of L2GW MAC addresses (e.g., L2GW1 MAC and L2GW2 MAC) may be mapped to a plurality of corresponding host addresses. Each L2GW MAC address may be mapped to a plurality of host IP (or MAC) addresses in a plurality of VLANs (e.g., VLAN#, VLAN-x, . . . ) that may be associated with the same location or DC. Each VLAN may also comprise a plurality of virtual private groups (VPGs) (or Closed User Groups) of hosts. A VPG may be a cluster of hosts and\/or VMs that belong to a Layer 2 domain (or L2 domain) and may communicate with each other via Layer 2. A Layer 2 domain may be used herein to refer to a sub-location or sub-site in a Layer 2 network. When a Layer 2 network spans across multiple sites or locations, each site may be referred to herein as a Layer 2 domain. The terms Layer 2 domain, Layer 2 site, and Layer 2 district may be used herein interchangeably. The terms domain, site, and district may also be used herein interchangeably. The hosts in the VPG may also have multicast groups established among them. The hosts\/VMs within a VPG may span across multiple physical locations. Under many cases, one VLAN may be dedicated to one customer, e.g., there may be only one VPG per VLAN. As such, there may be no need to have the VPG column (or attribute) in the table under in such cases.","For example, VLAN# may comprise a plurality of hosts in multiple VPGs, including G-x1, G-x2, . . . . And each VPG may comprise a plurality of hosts. For IP applications, the hosts IP addresses in each VLAN may be mapped to the corresponding L2GW MAC address in the same location, such as in the case of VLAN# and VLAN-x . . . ). IP Addresses may be summarized to reduce the amount of entries in the table. For non-IP applications, the hosts MAC addresses in each VLAN may be mapped to the corresponding L2GW MAC address in the same location for the VLAN, such as in the case of VLAN-x1. In some cases, there may be only one VPG for each VLAN, and hence the VPG column in Table 1 may not be needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Border Control Mechanism"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["L2GW","VLAN","VPG","Host"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["L2GW1 MAC","VLAN#","G-x1","All IP hosts"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"in this group"]},{"entry":[{},{},"G-x2","All IP hosts"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"in this group"]},{"entry":[{},"VLAN-x",". . ."]},{"entry":[{},{},"G-xj"]},{"entry":[{},"VLAN-x1","G-j1","MAC (switches and\/or nodes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"without IP addresses)"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"MAC"]},{"entry":[{},{},"G-j2","MAC"]},{"entry":"L2GW2 MAC"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","410","420","410","412","420","422","412","424","422","424","426","200"]},"Based on the data frame forwarding scheme , the L2GWs  may support the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1ah standard for MAC-in-MAC, which is incorporated herein by reference, using an Ether Type field to indicate that an inner frame needs MAC address translation.

Address resolution and IP address updating may be implemented in one of two scenarios. The first scenario corresponds to when a host or VM is configured to send gratuitous ARP messages upon being added or after moving to a network. The second scenario corresponds to when a host or VM that is added to or has moved to a network does not send ARP announcements. The two scenarios may be handled as described in the virtual Layer 2 networks above.","The virtual Layer 2 networks and similarly the pseudo Layer 2 networks described above may support address resolution in each location\/domain and a mechanism to keep each L2GW currently updated with IP addresses of its local hosts in its location\/domain. In one scenario, when a host or a VM is added to the network, the host or VM may send an ARP announcement, such as a gratuitous ARP message, to its Layer 2 network or local area. In another scenario, the host or VM added to the network may not send an ARP announcement.","In the first scenario, a new VM in a Layer 2 network or location\/domain may send a gratuitous ARP message to a L2GW. When the L2GW receives the gratuitous ARP message, the L2GW may update its local IPAddrTable but may not forward the gratuitous ARP message to other locations\/domains or Layer 2 networks. Additionally, the L2GW may use a timer for each entry in the IPAddrTable to handle the case of shutting down or removing a host from a location\/domain. If the timer of an entry is about to expire, the L2GW may send an ARP (e.g., via uni-cast) to the host of the entry. Sending the ARP as a uni-cast message instead of broadcasting the ARP may avoid flooding the local Layer 2 domain of the host and the L2GW. When a host moves from a first location to a second location, a L2GW may receive an update message from the first location and\/or the second location. If the L2GW detects that the host exists in both the first location and the second location, the L2GW may send a local ARP message in the first location to verify that the host does not exist anymore in the first location. Upon determining that the host is no longer present in the first location, for example if not response to the ARP message is detected, the L2GW may update its local IPAddrTable accordingly. If the L2GW receives a response for the ARP message for its own location, then a MAC multi-homing mechanism of BGP may be used.","In the second scenario, the new host in a location may not send an ARP announcement. In this case, when an application (e.g., at a host) needs to resolve the MAC address for an IP host, the application may send out an ARP request that may be broadcasted in the location. The ARP request may be intercepted by a L2GW (or a Top-of-Rack (ToR) switch), e.g., by implementing a proxy ARP function. In a relatively large DC, the L2GW may not be able to process all the ARP requests. Instead, a plurality of L2GW delegates (e.g., ToR switches) may intercept the ARP announcements. The L2GW may push down the IP addresses (e.g., a summary of IP addresses) that are learned from other locations to its corresponding delegates (ToR switches). The delegates may then intercept the ARP requests from hosts or local servers. If an IP address in the ARP request from a host or server is present in the IPAddrTable of the L2GW, the L2GW may return an ARP response with the L2GW's MAC address to the host or server, without forwarding the broadcasted ARP request any further. For non-IP applications, e.g., applications that run directly over Ethernet without IP, the applications may use MAC addresses as DAs when sending data. The non-IP applications may not send an ARP message prior to sending the data frames. The data frames may be forwarded using unknown flooding or Multiple MAC registration Protocol (MMRP).","In one scenario, an application (e.g., on a host) may send a gratuitous ARP message upon joining one of the interconnected Layer 2 networks in one location to obtain a MAC address for a targeted IP address. When the L2GW or its delegate (e.g., ToR switch) may receive the ARP request and check its IP host table. If the IP address is found in the table, the L2GW may send an ARP reply to the application. The L2GW may send its MAC address in the reply if the targeted IP address corresponds to an IP host in another location. If the IP address is not found, no reply may be sent from the L2GW, which may maintain the current or last updated IP addresses of the hosts in all locations. In relatively large DCs, multiple L2GWs may be used, e.g., in the same location, where each L2GW may handle a subset of VLANs. As such, each L2GW may need to maintain a subset of IP addresses that comprise the IP addresses of the hosts in the corresponding VLAN.","In the case of substantially large DCs, e.g., that comprise tens of thousands of VMs, it may be difficult for a single node to handle all the ARP requests and\/or gratuitous ARP messages. In this case, several schemes may be considered. For instance, a plurality of nodes or L2GWs may be used to handle different subsets of VLANs within a DC, as described above. Additionally or alternatively, multiple delegates may be assigned for a L2GW in each location. For instance, a plurality of ToR switches or access switches may be used. Each L2GW's delegate may be responsible for intercepting gratuitous ARP messages on its corresponding downlinks or in the form of a Port Binding Protocol. The delegates may send a consolidated address list (AddressList) to their L2GWs. The L2GW may also push down its learned IP address lists from other locations to its delegates. If there are multiple L2GWs in a location that are responsible for different subsets of VLANS, the delegates may need to send a plurality of consolidated messages that comprise each the AddressLists in the VLANs associated with the corresponding L2GWs.","In comparison to Cisco's OTV scheme, using the virtual Layer 2 network described above may substantially reduce the size of forwarding tables on intermediate switches in each location. The switches in one location may not need to learn MAC addresses of IP hosts in other locations, e.g., assuming that the majority of hosts run IP applications. This scheme may also substantially reduce the size of the address information exchanged among the L2GWs. For example, a subnet that may comprise thousands of VMs may be mapped to a L2GW MAC address. The hierarchical Layer 2 scheme of the virtual Layer 2 network may use 802.1ah standard, which may be supported by commercial Ethernet chip sets, while Cisco's scheme uses proprietary IP encapsulation. Both schemes may use peer location gateway device (L2GW) address as outer destination address. The hierarchical Layer 2 scheme may also use address translation, which may be supported by current IP gateways. However, the hierarchical Layer 2 scheme may use MAC address translation instead of IP address translation. The MAC address translation may need carrier grade NAT implementation that can perform address translation for tens of thousands of addresses.","In an embodiment, a VLAN may span across multiple locations. Thus, a multicast group may also span across multiple locations. Specifically, the multicast group may span across a subset of locations in the virtual Layer 2 network. For example, if there are about ten locations in the virtual Layer 2 network, the multicast group may only span across three of the ten locations. A multicast group within one service instance may be configured by a network administrator system (NMS) or may be automatically established in Layer 2 using MMRP. Since L2GW supports 802.1ah, the L2GW may have a built-in component to map client multicast groups to proper multicast groups in the core network. In a worst case scenario, the L2GW may replicate the multicast data frames to all the locations of the service instance. For example, according to Microsoft research data, about one out of four traffic may go to a different location. Thus, the replication by L2GW may be simpler than implementing a complicated mechanism in the Provider core.","The virtual Layer 2 network may support broadcast traffic, such as for ARP requests and\/or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) requests. The broadcast traffic may be supported by creating multiple ARP delegates, such as ToR switches, in each location. The broadcast traffic may also be supported by adding a new component to the Port Binding Protocol for the delegates to maintain current updates of all the IP hosts from the servers. Additionally, the L2GW may push down on a periodic or regular basis all the learned host IP addresses from other locations.","In some instances, the L2GW may receive unknown DAs. The L2GW may keep current updates of all the hosts (or applications) in its location and periodically or regularly push its address information to all the peers (other L2GWs in other locations). If the L2GW receives a frame comprising an unknown DA, the L2GW may broadcast the frame to the other locations. To avoid attacks on the network, a limit may be imposed on the maximum number of times the L2GW may forward or broadcast a received unknown DA. The L2GW may be configured to learn the addresses of the intermediate switches in another location to avoid mistaking an intermediate switch address for an unknown address before sending the address to the other location. Although there may be tens of thousands of VMs in each DC location, the number of switches in each DC may be limited, such as the number of ToR or access switches, end of row or aggregation switches, and\/or core switches. The L2GW may learn the MAC addresses of all the intermediate switches in a location ahead of time, e.g., via a Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) from each switch. Messages may not be sent directly to the intermediate switches, except for management system or Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) messages. An intermediate switch that expects or is configured to receive NMS\/OAM messages may allow other switches in the location to learn its MAC address by sending an autonomous message to NMS or a MMRP announcement.","In some embodiments, the L2GWs may use BGP, e.g., instead of IS-IS, for exchanging address information. A plurality of options may be used for controlling Layer 2 (L2) communications. For instance, forwarding options may include Layer 2 only forwarding with MAC and MAC, Layer 2 forwarding over MPLS, and Layer 2 forwarding in Layer 3 network. Options of Layer 2 control plane may include Layer 2 IS-IS mesh control, Layer 2.5 MPLS static control, Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)-Traffic Engineering (TE) using Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Constraint-based Shortest Path First (CSFP), and BGP discovery. Some VLAN mapping issues may also be considered, such as the VLAN-MAC mapping required for uniqueness and whether Network Bridged VLANs (e.g., VLANs-4K) may be too small for a DC.

the BGP that may be supported in the virtual Layer 2 network. For instance, OTV basic aspects may include OTV multicast groups, OTV IS-IS usage, which may require MT-IS-IS, and OTV forwarding. Additionally, BGP may support BGP-MAC mapping and IP overlay, such as for DC multicast group. BGP-MAC mapping may also use MT-BGP. Further, IBGP may be supported by MT-IS-IS and using IS-IS for peer topology (e.g., Label Switched Path Verification (LSVP)).","In the virtual Layer 2 network above, the number of applications within one Layer 2 network (or DC) may increase substantially, e.g., over time. Thus, a mechanism may be needed to avoid issues associated with substantially large Layer 2 networks. These issues may include unpredictable behavior of servers\/hosts and their applications. For example, the servers\/hosts may correspond to different vendors, where some may be configured to send ARP messages and others may be configured to broadcast messages. Further, typical lower cost Layer 2 switches may not have sophisticated features to block broadcast data frames of have policy implemented to limit flooding and broadcast. Hosts or applications may also age out MAC addresses to target IP mapping frequently, e.g., in about minutes. A host may also frequently send out gratuitous ARP messages, such as when the host performs a switch over (from active to standby) or when the host has a software glitch. In some cases, the Layer 2 network components are divided into smaller subgroups to confine broadcast into a smaller number of nodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"b":["1500","1522","1530","1535","1522","1535","1524","1522","1537","1524","1539","1537","1522","1530"]},"The typical broadcast scheme  may suffer from broadcast scalability issues.

The frames with unknown addresses may also be flooded in the opposite direction, via an AS , to a plurality of other Pods (in other DCs) in the core, which may be associated with the same service as the Pod . The frames may be further flooded to a plurality of VMs in the other Pods, which may reach thousands of VMs. Such broadcast scheme for unknown DAs may not be efficient in relatively large networks, e.g., that comprise many DCs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"b":["1600","1600","1500","1622","1630","1635","1622","1635","1624","1622","1637","1624","1639","1637","1622","1630"]},"To control or limit the broadcast scope of the broadcast scheme , frames with unknown DAs may only be flooded within the Pod  to a single root, for instance to one server\/VM  that may be designated as a broadcast server or to an AS . The frames may be flooded to the root using a rooted-multipoint (RMP) VLAN configuration, e.g., a push VLAN tag for RMP VLAN that is rooted at a broadcast server. However, the flooded frame may not be forwarded to all the other servers, e.g., that are not broadcast servers, which may save link resources and server processing of extraneous frames. Additionally, the forwarded frames may not be forwarded to the core, e.g., to other Pods or DCs.","In some embodiments, the broadcast server may hosts a proxy ARP server, a DHCP server, and\/or other specific function servers, e.g., for improving efficiency, scalability, and\/or security. For instance, the broadcast server may be configured to provide security in DCs that only allow selected broadcast services. If no known service is selected, data frames with unknown DAs may be flooded from the broadcasts server on a first or original VLAN. The broadcast scheme  may be used to handle cases where customer applications are allowed to use Layer 2 broadcast. A data rate limiter may also be used to protect against broadcast storms, e.g., avoid substantial broadcast traffic.","As described above, when introducing server virtualization in DCs, the number of hosts in a DC may increase substantially, e.g., over time. Using server virtualization, each physical server, which may originally host an end-station, may become capable of hosting hundreds of end-stations or VMs. The VMs may be added, deleted, and\/or moved flexibly between servers, which may improve performance and utilization of the servers. This capability may be used as a building block for cloud computing services, e.g., to offer client controlled virtual subnets and virtual hosts. The client control virtual subnets offered by cloud computing services may allow clients to define their own subnets with corresponding IP addresses and policies.","The rapid growth of virtual hosts may substantially impact networks and servers. For instance, one resulting issue may be handling frequent ARP requests, such as ARP IP version 4 (IPv4) requests, or neighbor discovery (ND) requests, such as ND IP version 6 (IPv6) requests from hosts. The hosts in a DC may send out such requests frequently due caches or entries that may age in about few minutes. In the case of tens of thousands of hosts in a DC, which may have different MAC addresses, the amount of ARP or ND messages or requests per second may reach more than about 1,000 to 10,000 requests per second. This rate or frequency of requests may impose substantial computational burden on the hosts. Another issue associated with a substantially large number of virtual hosts in a DC may be existing duplicated IP addresses within one VLAN, which may affect the ARP or ND scheme from working properly. Some load balancing techniques may also require multiple hosts which serve the same application to use the same IP address but with different MAC addresses. Some cloud computing services may allow users to use their own subnets with IP addresses and self defined policies among the subnets. As such, it may not be possible to designate a VLAN per each client since the maximum number of available VLANS may be about  in some systems while there may be hundreds of thousands of client subnets. In this scenario, there may be duplicated IP addresses in different client subnets that end up in one VLAN.","In an embodiment, a scalable address resolution mechanism that may be used in substantially large Layer 2 networks, which may comprise a single VLAN that includes a substantial number of hosts, such as VMs and\/or end-stations.

This is indicated by the dashed lines in . As such, the paths to the end-stations  of the VLAN may not be lost which allows the end-stations  to communicate over the VLAN. When the DBB  in the VLAN fails, the DS may be notified of the failure, for instance by sending an explicit message to the DS or using a keep-alive method. Thus, a DBB may replace the address information of the failed DBB and possibly other original DBBs  in the VLAN in the entries of the DS address table with information of the new DBBs  that were on standby and then used to replace the failed and other original DBBs . A replaced failed and original DBB are indicated by circles in .

For example, for a relatively large DC with about 50,000 severs, which may each support up to about 128 VMs, the total number of VMs in the DC may be equal to about 50,000\u00d7128 or about 6,400,000 VMs. To achieve dynamic allocation of resources across such large server pool, Ethernet-based Layer 2 networks may be used in DCs. Such a large Layer 2 network with potentially a substantial number of virtual hosts may pose new challenges to the underlying Ethernet technology. For instance, one issue may be MAC forwarding table scalability due to the flat MAC address space. Another issue may be handling a broadcast storm caused by ARP and other broadcast traffic.","One approach to reduce the size of the MAC forwarding table, also referred to herein as a FDB, in the core of the network may be using network address encapsulation, e.g., according to IEEE 802.1ah and TRILL. The network address encapsulations of 802.1ah and TRILL are described in IEEE P802.1ah\/D4.2 standard and IETF draft draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-protol-12-txt, respectively, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. With network address encapsulation, the number of FDB entries in core switches may be reduced to the total number of switches (including edge and core) in the network, independent of the number of VMs. For example, with about 20 servers per edge switch, the number of edge switches in a network of about 50,000 servers may be equal to about 50,000\/20 or about 2,500. However, with data path MAC address learning, the FDB size of edge switches (e.g., ToR switches in DCs) may be about the same as when network address encapsulation is not used, which may be substantially large.","Even with selective MAC learning at ToR switches, the FDB size may still be substantially large. For example, if a ToR switch has about 40 downstream ports, a pair of ToR switches may have up to about 40 dual-homed servers connected to the ToR switches. If a server supports up to about 128 VMs, a ToR switch may have about 128\u00d740\/2 or about 2,560 VMs connected to the ToR switch in normal operation, e.g., when the TOR switches handle about the same number of VMs. The number of VMs may increase to about 5,120 if one ToR switch fails. If each VM communicates on average with about 10 remote VMs simultaneously, the ToR switch FDB size (e.g., number of entries) may be at least proportional to about 2,560 (local VMs)+2,560\u00d710 (remote VMs)+2,500 (ToR switches) or about 30,660 entries, which may be further doubled in the failure scenario.","The network address encapsulations in 802.1ah and TRILL may be symmetric. Specifically, the same switches, such as edge switches, may perform the address encapsulation. The problem with the symmetric network address encapsulations in 802.1ah and TRIL is that an edge switch needs to keep track of the remote VMs that communicate with local VMs. The number of the remote VMs may vary substantially. One solution proposed by A. Greenberg et al. in a paper entitled \u201cTowards a Next Generation Data Center Architecture: Scalability and Commoditization\u201d, published in PRESTO 08, which is incorporated herein by reference, is to move the network address encapsulation procedure inside the VMs, thus reducing the switch FDB size to its minimum, which may be equal to the sum of the number of local VMs and the number of edge switches in the network (e.g., equal to about 2,560+2,500 or about 5,060 entries in the above example). A drawback of this approach is the change of guest operation system (OS) protocol stack.","Instead, moving the network address encapsulation to a virtual switch of a physical server (e.g., inside a hypervisor) may reduce the edge switch FDB size and avoid changing the guest OS protocol stack, as described further below. Such a network address encapsulation is referred to herein as asymmetric network address encapsulation since address decapsulation is still done elsewhere in edge switches. This mechanism of asymmetric network address encapsulation may reduce the amount of addresses maintained in the FDBs of intermediate\/edge switches or routers.","The asymmetric network address encapsulation scheme may be implemented in a Layer 2 network that comprises edge and core switches, such as in the different network embodiments described above. For instance, the edge switches may correspond to ToR switches in DCs. Each edge switch may be assigned a unique ID, which may be a MAC address (as in 802.1ah), an about  bit nickname (as in TRILL), or an IP address. The network may be configured to forward a frame based on the destination edge switch ID carried in the header of the frame from an ingress edge switch to the egress edge switch. The frame may be forwarded inside the network using any transport technology. The asymmetric network address encapsulation scheme may be similar to the address encapsulation scheme in 802.1ah, also referred as MAC-in-MAC. MAC learning may be disabled in the network but enabled on the edge switch server facing ports. The terms server, end-station, and host may be used interchangeably herein. The terms virtual server, VM, virtual end-station, and virtual host may also be used interchangeably herein.","In MAC-in-MAC, there are two types of MAC addresses: the MAC addresses assigned to edge switches, also referred to as network addresses or backbone MAC (B-MAC) addresses, and the MAC addresses used by VMs, also referred to as customer MAC (C-MAC) addresses.  illustrates an embodiment of a typical physical server , which may be a dual-homed server in a DC.

The virtual switch  may be connected to the VMs via a plurality of corresponding virtual Network Interface Cards (NICs)  of the VMs  and a plurality of corresponding virtual switch ports  of the virtual switch . The virtual switch  may also be connected to the pNICs  via a plurality of corresponding virtual switch trunk ports  of the virtual switch . The pNICs  may serve as uplinks or trunks for the virtual switch . The physical server  may be connected to a plurality of edge switches  via corresponding pNICs  of the physical server . Thus, the edge switches  may be connected via the components of the physical server  (the pNICs  and the virtual switch ) to the VMs . The components of the physical server  may be arranged as shown in .","For load balancing, traffic may be distributed to the trunks (pNICs ) based on the virtual port IDs or VM source C-MAC addresses of the traffic. Each VM  may have a virtual NIC  with a uniquely assigned C-MAC address. A VM  may send traffic to an edge switch  during normal operation. For example, a first VM  (VM1) may send a plurality of frames intended to external VMs in other physical servers in the network (not shown) via a corresponding first edge switch  (edge switch X). A second edge switch  (edge switch R) may be a backup for edge switch X. When edge switch X becomes unreachable due to a failure (e.g., the corresponding pNIC  fails, the link between the pNIC  and edge switch X fails, or edge switch X fails), the virtual switch  may then send the frames to edge switch R.","In the FDB , the local FDB  may correspond to the local VMs (VMs ) and may comprise a plurality of C-MAC destination addresses (C-MAC DAs), a plurality of VLAN IDs, and a plurality of associated virtual switch port IDs. The C-MAC DAs and VLAN IDs may be used to look up the local FDB  to obtain the corresponding virtual switch port IDs. The remote FDB  may correspond to external VMs (in other physical servers) and may comprise a plurality of B-MAC destination addresses (B-MAC DAs) and a plurality of C-MAC DAs associated with the B-MAC DAs. The C-MAC DAs may be used to look up the remote FDB  by the local VMs to obtain the corresponding B-MAC DAs.

If TRILL is supported and used in a network, where an edge switch is identified by an about  bit nickname, the TRILL encapsulation may be used in the asymmetric network address encapsulation scheme. Alternatively, an IP-in-IP encapsulation may be used if an edge switch is identified by an IP address. Further, network address encapsulation may be performed at the virtual switch level and the network address de-capsulation may be performed at the edge switch level. In general, the network address encapsulation scheme may be applied at any level or any of the network components as long as the encapsulation and de-capsulation are kept at different levels or components.","In a bridged network that is partitioned into districts, such as in the interconnected network districts , a DBB may be a bridge participating in multiple districts.

The EARP response may comprise a SA MAC address A and a SA IP address IPA for the local host , a DA MAC address B and a DA IP address IPB for the remote host , and a MAC address for a second bridge in a remote location  of the remote host . At step , the first bridge  may process\/decapsulate the EARP response and send an ARP response to the local host . The ARP response may comprise the MAC address A and IP address IPA for the local host , and the MAC address B and the IP address IPB for the remote host . Thus, the local host  may become aware of the MAC address B of the remote host . The first bridge  may also associate (in a local table) the MAC address Y of the remote bridge in the remote location  with the IP address IPB of the remote host . The first bridge  may not need to store the MAC address B of the remote host .","At step , the local host  may send a data frame intended for the remote host  to the first bridge . The data frame may comprise a SA MAC address and SA IP address of the local host , and the DA MAC address and DA IP address of the remote host . At step , the first bridge  may receive and process\/encapsulate the data frame to obtain an inner frame. The inner frame may comprise a SA MAC address X of the first bridge , a DA MAC address Y of the remote bridge, a DA MAC address B and a DA IP address IPB of the remote host , and a SA MAC address A and a SA IP address IPA of the local host . At step , the remote bridge in the remote location  may receive the inner frame and process\/decapsulate the inner frame to obtain a second frame by removing the SA MAC address X of the first bridge  and the DA MAC address Y of the remote bridge. Thus, the second frame may be similar to the initial frame sent from the local host . The remote bridge may then send the second frame to the remote host . The method  may then end.","In the enhanced ARP processing method , the core network may use 802.1aq or TRILL for topology discovery. If the core network uses 802.1aq for topology discovery, then the first bridge  may not encapsulate the frame sent form the local host  and may forward the frame to the remote location  without processing. Further, the frame forwarded through the core network may be flooded only in the second location  and only when the outbound port indicated in the frame has not been learned.","In an embodiment, an extended address resolution scheme may be implemented by district gateways or gateway nodes that may be TRILL edge nodes, MAC-in-MAC edge nodes, or any other type of overlay network edge nodes. The extended address resolution scheme may be based on the ARP proxy scheme implemented by a DBB in a plurality of districts in a Layer 2 bridged network, such as the ARP proxy scheme . For example, the intermediate\/edge nodes  that may be connected to a plurality of physical servers and\/or VMs may implement an extended address resolution scheme similar to the ARP proxy scheme described above. The gateway node may use the DS server in the ARP proxy scheme to resolve mapping between a target destination (e.g., host) and an egress edge node. The egress edge node may be a target district gateway, a TRILL egress node, a MAC-in-MAC edge node, or any other type of overlay network edge node. The reply from the DS may also be an EARP reply as described above.","The extended address resolution scheme may be used to scale DC networks with a substantial number of hosts. The overlay network (e.g., bridged network) may be a MAC-in-MAC, TRILL, or other types of Layer 3 or Layer 2 over Ethernet networks. The overlay network edge may be a network switch, such as an access switch (or ToR switch) or an aggregation switch (or EoR switch). The overlay network edge may also correspond to a virtual switch in a server. There may be two scenarios for overlay networks for using the extended address resolution scheme. The first scenario corresponds to a symmetric scheme, such as for TRILL or MAC-in-MAC networks. In this scenario, the overlay edge node may perform both the encapsulation and decapsulation parts. The second scenario corresponds to an asymmetric scheme, where the overlay network may implement the asymmetric network address encapsulation scheme above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0194"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["2900","2900","2901","2910","2980","2920","2970"]},"At step , HV A may send an address resolution (AR) request to an ARP server  to retrieve mapping from VM B IP address to a VM B MAC address and HV B MAC address pair, in the case of the symmetric scheme. The ARP server may comprise or correspond to a DS server, such as the DS . In the asymmetric scheme, the mapping may be from VM B IP address to a VM B MAC address and second DBB  (DBB B) MAC address pair. DBB B may be a remote DBB in the same district of VM B.","HV A may also be configured to intercept (broadcasted) ARP requests from local VMs and forward the ARP requests to the DS server. HV A may then retrieve EARP replies from the DS server and cache the mappings between target addresses and target gateway addresses (as indicated by the EARP replies). The target gateway address may also be referred to herein as a target location address. In another embodiment, instead of intercepting ARP requests by HV A, the DS server may send consolidated mapping information to HV A on regular or periodic basis or when VMs move or migrate between districts. The consolidated mapping information may comprise the same information exchanged with L2GWs in the virtual Layer 2 networks described above. For instance, the consolidated mapping information may be formatted as gratuitous group announcements, as described above.","At step , HV A may create an inner address header that comprise (SA: VM A MAC, DA: VM B MAC) and an outer header that comprises (SA: HV A MAC, DA: HV B MAC), in the case of the symmetric scheme. In the asymmetric scheme, the outer header may comprise (SA: HV A MAC, DA: DBB B MAC). HV A may add the inner header and outer header to the frame received from VM A and send the resulting frame to a bridge  connected to HV A in the same district. Within the district, the DA of the outer header, which may be HV B MAC or DBB B MAC, may not be known.","At step , the frame may be forwarded from the bridge  to a first DBB  (DBB A) in the district. At DBB A, the DA HV B MAC or DBB B MAC may be known since the core may be operating on routed forwarding (e.g., 802.1aq SPBM or TRILL) and learning may be disabled in the core. At step , DBB A may forward the frame to DBB B.","At step , DBB B may forward the frame to HV B since DBB may know all HV addresses from the routing subsystem, in the case of the symmetric scheme. In the asymmetric scheme, DBB may remove the outer header comprising (DA: DBB MAC) and forward the frame to VM B MAC in the remaining header, since addresses local to the district may be registered and known within the district.","At step , HV B may receive the frame, remove the outer header comprising (DA: HV B MAC), and forward the resulting frame to VM B MAC in the remaining header, since addresses local to the server are known to HV B, in the case of the symmetric scheme. Additionally, HV B may learn the mapping from VM A MAC (SA in the remaining header) to HV A MAC (SA in the removed header), which may be subsequently used in reply frames from VM B to VM A. In the asymmetric scheme, in addition to forwarding the frame to VM B, HV B may send an ARP message to the ARP (or DS) server  to retrieve the mapping from VM A MAC (SA in the remaining header) to DBB A MAC, which may be subsequently used in reply frames from VM B to VM A.","VM B may then send frames addressed to VM A (IP destination address). At step , HV B may create an inner address header that comprises (SA: VM B MAC, DA: VM A MAC) and an outer header that comprises (SA: HV B MAC, DA: HV A MAC) to a frame, in the case of the symmetric scheme. HV B may maintain VM A IP to VM A MAC mapping and VM A MAC to HV A MAC mapping from a previously received message or AR response. In the asymmetric scheme, the outer header may comprise (SA: HV B MAC, DA: DBB A MAC). HV B may maintain VM A MAC to DBB A MAC mapping from a previously received AR response. Alternatively, HV B may send an ARP message to the ARP (or DS) server to retrieve the mapping when needed. The frame may then be forwarded from VM B to VM A in the same manner described in the steps above (e.g., in the reverse direction). The method  may then end.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0203","num":"0202"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["3000","3000","3000","3010","3020","3030"]},"The network components described above may be implemented on any general-purpose network component, such as a computer system or network component with sufficient processing power, memory resources, and network throughput capability to handle the necessary workload placed upon it.  illustrates a typical, general-purpose computer system  suitable for implementing one or more embodiments of the components disclosed herein.
