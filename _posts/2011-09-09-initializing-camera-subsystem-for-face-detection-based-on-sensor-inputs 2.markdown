title: Initializing camera subsystem for face detection based on sensor inputs
abstract: In one embodiment, while a mobile electronic device is in a first operation state, it receives sensor data from one or more sensors of the mobile electronic device. The mobile electronic device in a locked state analyzes the sensor data to estimate whether an unlock operation is imminent, and in response to a positive determination, initializes the camera subsystem so that the camera is ready to capture a face as soon as the user directs the camera lens to his or her face. In particular embodiments, the captured image is utilized by a facial recognition algorithm to determine whether the user is authorized to use the mobile device. In particular embodiments, the captured facial recognition image may be leveraged for use on a social network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to mobile electronic devices and more specifically relates to automatically priming the camera subsystem of a mobile device based on detected events in preparation for an image-based unlocking operation.","A mobile electronic device, such as a smartphone, tablet, notebook computer, etc., may have multiple operation states. For example, while a mobile device is not being used by its user, it may be in a power-saving or sleep state (e.g., the screen is dim or dark) in order to decrease power-consumption level and prolong battery life. In some cases, the mobile device may also be in an input locked state (e.g., the touchscreen or keypad of the mobile device is locked) so that the mobile device does not perform unintentional or accidental operations. In other cases, the mobile device may be security locked, such that a user is required to provide a correct password or personal identification number (PIN) in order to unlock and use the device. The advent of optical face or iris detection and recognition obviates the need for physical manipulation of a touchscreen or keypad to unlock mobile devices.","This disclosure generally relates to mobile electronic devices and more specifically relates to automatically initializing the camera subsystem of a mobile electronic device based on a detected sensor inputs.","In particular embodiments, a mobile electronic device detects the angular acceleration about one or more axis from an accelerometer or gyrometer in a sensor hub indicative of a user picking up the mobile device. In particular embodiments, a mobile device detects a transition from a low-light to high-light environment via a light sensor in a sensor hub indicative of a user removing the mobile device from a pocket, bag, or case. In particular embodiments, a mobile device detects a transition from having nearby objects to having no nearby objects via a proximity sensor indicative of the mobile device being removed from a pocket, bag, or case. In particular embodiments, a mobile device detects a transition from a low volume to high volume environment via a microphone indicative of the mobile device being removed from a pocket, bag, or case. In particular embodiments, a mobile device detects a transition from muffled audio to clear audio via a microphone indicative of removal of the mobile device from a pocket or bag. In particular embodiments, any combination of the previous sensor transitions may be utilized to determine that the user is about to look at the mobile device, and may trigger an operation to initialize the camera subsystem of the mobile device. In particular embodiments, upon camera initialization, the camera continuously monitors its input for the presence of a face. In particular embodiments, facial recognition is utilized to unlock the mobile device. In particular embodiments, the camera captures a photo of the user and prompts the user as to whether he or she would like to use the photo as a profile picture on a social network. In particular embodiments, the mobile device automatically uploads the captured photo to the user's profile page on a social network.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","This disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. However, this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure this disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","A mobile electronic device, such as a smartphone, tablet or notebook, may have multiple operation states. For example, when a mobile device has not being used by its user for a period of time (e.g., a few seconds), it may enter into a power-saving state. At the power-saving state, the mobile device may operate at a lower power level in order to save energy and prolong battery life. The screen of the mobile device may be dim or dark. To bring the mobile device out of the power-saving state into the normal power state, the user may need to perform an action with the mobile device (e.g., pushing the power button of the mobile device). In some cases (e.g., after the mobile device is in the power-saving state for a few seconds), the mobile device may also enter into an input-lock state. At the input-lock state, the input component (e.g., keypad or touch-sensitive screen) of the mobile device may be locked to prevent accidental inputs causing unintentional operations. To unlock the keypad or screen of the mobile device, the user may need to perform another action with the mobile device. For example, if the mobile device has a keypad, the user may need to push a key. If the mobile device has a touch-sensitive screen, the user may need to press a control to power up the device and make a swipe gesture on the screen. In addition, the mobile device may have a security-lock state. At the security-lock state, the mobile device is password or PIN (Personal Identification Number) locked to prevent unauthorized access to and usage of the mobile device. To unlock the mobile device, the user may need to enter the appropriate password or PIN. When the mobile device is being actively used by its user, it may be in a normal operation state (e.g., operating at the full power level and ready to receive user inputs). In some cases, the mobile device may be in an operation state where its audio output is turned on, an operation state where its audio output is turned off, or an operation state where its audio output is in a specific mode (e.g., loud, quiet, vibrate, etc.). Other operation states may also be possible, and this disclosure contemplates any applicable operation state.","At any given time, a mobile device may be in any one of the operation states, depending on, for example, whether the user is currently using the mobile device, the amount of time passed since the user's last use of the mobile device, the location of the mobile device (e.g., in a carrying case, in the user's pocket or purse, etc.).","For example, suppose that the user has not used his mobile device (e.g., an Apple iPhone) for some time and the mobile device has been stored in the user's pocket. In this case, the mobile device is most likely in the power-saving state to save battery as well as the input-lock state to prevent accidental inputs. In addition, the mobile device may also be in the security-lock state to prevent unauthorized access to the mobile device. Further suppose that the user now wishes to use his mobile device. The user may need to: (1) take the mobile device out of his pocket; (2) push the power button to bring the mobile device out of the power-saving state; and (3) swipe the touch screen to unlock the input component of the mobile device. In addition, if the mobile device is security locked as well, then the user also needs to enter the password or PIN to unlock the mobile device. At least, the user needs to perform a few actions, which may take several seconds, before the mobile device is ready to be used. Considering that such a sequence of actions may need to be performed several times a day (e.g., each time the user needs to use his mobile device after not using the mobile device for a period of time), it may become inefficient and time consuming.","Recent advances in face recognition technology greatly simplifies the unlocking process by utilizing a front-facing camera in a mobile device to capture an image of the user's face, match it against a known database of authorized users, and unlock the phone if the current user's face matches one of the faces in the database. Other camera-based implementations utilize iris detection rather than facial detection. However, current implementations, such as the RecognizeMe application for iOS or Recognizr, Visidon, and BioLock applications for Google Android OS, still require that the user swipe the touchscreen to initiate the process. Additionally, current implementations only activate the camera subsystem after the user has swiped the touchscreen, resulting in delays while the operating system initializes and readies the front-facing camera for image capture.","Therefore, particular embodiments may automatically initialize the camera subsystem of a mobile device in the locked mode in anticipation of a likely unlock operation based upon one or more inputs to its sensor hub. In particular embodiments, a mobile electronic device, such as a mobile device, may include various types of sensors, such as, for example and without limitation, touch sensors (disposed, for example, on a display of the device, the back of the device and\/or one or more lateral edges of the device) for detecting a user touching the surface of the mobile electronic device (e.g., using one or more fingers), accelerometer for detecting whether the mobile electronic device is moving and the speed of the movement, thermometer for measuring the temperature change near the mobile electronic device, proximity sensor for detecting the proximity of the mobile electronic device to another object (e.g., a hand, desk, or other object), light sensor for measuring the ambient light around the mobile electronic device, imaging sensor (e.g., camera) for capturing digital images of objects near the mobile electronic device, location sensors (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS)) for determining the location (e.g., in terms of latitude and longitude) of the mobile electronic device, near field communication (NFC) sensors, Bluetooth sensors, etc. This disclosure contemplates that a mobile electronic device may include any applicable type of sensors. These sensors may provide various types of sensor data, which may be analyzed to determine that the user has picked up his or her mobile device in the locked state and will be imminently performing an unlock operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","150","140","100","150","140","150","150","150","160","140","160","150","140","150"]},"In particular embodiments, mobile electronic device  (e.g., a mobile device) may have a touchscreen as its input component.  illustrates the exterior of an example mobile device . Mobile device  has six sides: front, back, top, bottom, left, and right. Touch sensors may be placed anywhere on any of the six sides of mobile device . For example, in , a touchscreen incorporating touch sensors A is placed on the front of mobile device . The touchscreen may function as an input\/output (IO) component for mobile device . In addition, touch sensors B and C are placed on the left and right sides of mobile device , respectively. Touch sensors B and C may detect a user's hand touching the sides of mobile device . In particular embodiments, touch sensors A, B, C may be implemented using resistive, capacitive, and\/or inductive touch sensors. The electrodes of the touch sensors A, B, C may be arranged on a thin solid piece of material or a thin wire mesh. In the case of capacitive touch sensors, there may be two types of electrodes: transmitting and receiving. These electrodes may be connected to a controller (e.g., controller  illustrated in ), which may be a microchip designed to drive the transmitting electrodes with electrical pulses and measure the changes in capacitance from the receiving electrodes caused by a user's touches in order to detect the locations of the user touches.","Of course, mobile device  is merely an example. In practice, a device may have any number of sides, and this disclosure contemplates devices with any number of sides. The touch sensors may be placed on any side of a device.","In particular embodiments, mobile device  may have a proximity sensor  (e.g., an infrared LED (light-emitting diode)) placed on either its front or back side. Proximity sensor  may be able to supply sensor data for determining its proximity, and thus the proximity of mobile device , to another object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","200","110","140","160","310","320","330","340","200","350","200"]},"As an example, suppose that a user has a mobile device that is stored in the user's pocket. Thus, the mobile device is currently in the locked state. When the user desires to use the mobile device, the user may reach into his pocket, grab hold of the mobile device, and take it out of the pocket. In particular embodiments, while in the locked state, a processor of the device (such as a main CPU or a controller) may periodically wake up (for example, every 100 milliseconds) and poll one or more sensors to detect if a user has picked the device. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the CPU may be waken up by other means without having to specifically poll the sensors. For example, the CPU may be woken up through an interrupt signal or event or by dumb circuit.","In particular embodiments, in addition to the front side, the mobile device may have touch sensors on the left and right sides. Optionally, the mobile device may also have touch sensors on the back, top, or bottom side (e.g., mobile device  illustrated in ). Thus, as the user's hand touches the mobile device to grab hold of it, the touch sensors may detect the user's fingers or palm touching the mobile device. The touch-sensor data may be analyzed to determine when and where the user has touched the mobile device. When the user touches the mobile device, it may be an indication that the user may wish to use the mobile device.","In particular embodiments, the placement of touch sensors on the left, right, top, and\/or bottom sides may indicate whether a user is touching both sides of the mobile device (i.e., the user is grasping the mobile device). Thus, the touch sensors can differentiate grasping the mobile device in addition to simply touching it. In particular embodiments, being able to detect that the user has grasped the mobile device may yield a more accurate, and thus better, indication of the user's intention.","In particular embodiments, the mobile device may have an accelerometer in addition or instead of the touch sensors on the left and right sides. Again, sometimes, the user may put his hand in the pocket where the mobile device is stored and thus touch the mobile device even when the user does not intend to use the mobile device at that time. If the mobile device also has an accelerometer, the sensor data provided by the accelerometer may also be used to estimate whether the user intends to use the mobile device. When the mobile device is stored in the user's pocket, it may move as the user moves. However, such movements usually are relatively slow. On the other hand, when the user grabs hold of the mobile device and takes it out of the pocket to bring it in front of the user's face, there may be a relatively sudden increase in the movement speed of the mobile device. This change in the mobile device's movement speed may be detected based on the sensor data supplied by the accelerometer. In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a significant increase in the speed of the mobile device's movement, either by itself or in addition to detecting that the user has touched the mobile device, the mobile device processor may determine that an unlock operation is imminent.","In particular embodiments, the mobile device may have a Gyrometer in addition or instead of the touch sensors on the left and right sides. A Gyrometer, also known as a gyroscope, is a device for measuring the orientation along one or more axis. In particular embodiments, a Gyrometer may be used to measure the orientation of the mobile device. When the mobile device is stored in the user's pocket, it may stay mostly in one orientation. However, when the user grabs hold of the mobile device and takes it out of the pocket to bring it in front of the user's face, there may be a relatively sudden change in the orientation of the mobile device. The orientation of the mobile device may be detected and measured by the gyrometer. If the orientation of the mobile device has changed significantly, it may be another indication that the user may have taken the device out of his pocket, or from a flat surface, such as resting on a table, to a more vertical orientation, as when a users lifts his or her phone from a table to view near the user's face.","In particular embodiments, the mobile device may have a light sensor. When the mobile device is stored in the user's pocket, it is relatively dark around the mobile device. On the other hand, when the user brings the mobile device out of his pocket, it may be relatively bright around the mobile device, especially during day time or in well-lit areas. The sensor data supplied by the light sensor may be analyzed to detect when a significant change in the ambient light level around the mobile device occurs. In particular embodiments, upon detecting that there is a significant increase in the ambient light level around the mobile device, either by itself or in addition to detecting that the user has touched the mobile device or in addition to detecting that there is a significant increase in the speed of the mobile device's movement, the mobile device processor may ascertain that an unlock operation is imminent.","In particular embodiments, the mobile device may have a proximity sensor. The sensor data supplied by the proximity sensor may be analyzed to detect when the mobile device is in close proximity to a specific object, such as the user's hand. For example, as illustrated in , mobile device  may have an infrared LED  (i.e., proximity sensor) placed on its back side. When the user holds such a mobile device in his hand, the palm of the user's hand may cover infrared LED . As a result, infrared LED  may detect when the user's hand is in close proximity to mobile device . In particular embodiments, upon detecting that the mobile device is in close proximity to the user's hand, either by itself or in combination with other types of sensor indications, the mobile device may determine that an unlock operation is imminent.","Alternatively to or in conjunction with a back-facing proximity sensor, mobile device  may have a front-facing proximity sensor, to detect whether the front of the device is near an object (such as a face when used for voice communications). In particular embodiments, when the phone is in a lock mode, the presence of an object to the front facing proximity sensor may indicate that mobile device  is in a pocket, bag, or case, and a sudden transition from a positive proximity sensor reading (object detected) to a negative proximity sensor reading (no objects detected) may indicate that mobile device  has been taken out of the pocket, bag, or case, and may signify an impending unlock operation.","In particular embodiments, sensor hub  may include a microphone that periodically captures ambient audio waveforms. Transitions from quiet environments to noisy environments occur with some regularity, but, coupled with the other sensor transitions as described above, they may indicate that mobile device  was removed from a bag, pocket, purse, or other type of carrying case and indicate that an unlock operation is imminent. Additionally, waveform analysis may be performed by one or more processors in mobile device  to determine whether sound is muffled or clear. In particular embodiments, this waveform analysis is performed through the use of Fast Fourier Transforms, wavelet analysis, or other frequency-domain analysis. For example, muffled sound is commonly associated with high amplitude low frequency bands and low amplitude high frequency bands. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of detecting muffled and clear audio waveforms. In particular embodiments, transitions from muffled to clear audio environments indicates that an unlock operation is imminent.","A mobile device may have any number of sensors of various types, and these sensors may supply different types of sensor data. Different combinations of the individual types of sensor data may be used together to determine whether an unlock operation is imminent. Sometimes, using multiple types of sensor data in combination may yield a more accurate, and thus better, estimation of the user's intention to unlock the mobile device at a given time than only using a single type of sensor data. Nevertheless, it is possible to estimate the user's intention to unlock a mobile device using a single type of sensor data (e.g., touch-sensor data).","One or more combinations of the various sensor data is generally sufficient to capture all the possible scenarios in which a user may wish to unlock his or her mobile device, including but not limited to: removing the mobile device from a pocket; removing the mobile device from a bag or case; lifting a mobile device from a flat surface such as a table; lifting the mobile device from a docked position; flipping over the mobile device; and the like. This disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of sensor inputs in determining whether the user of a mobile device intends to unlock the mobile device.","In particular embodiments, the identity of the user currently handling the mobile device may be verified. If the user currently handling the mobile device is the true owner of the mobile device, the mobile device may be unlocked automatically. On the other hand, if the identity of the user currently handling the mobile device cannot be verified satisfactorily, the user may be prompted and required to provide a password or PIN in order to unlock and use the mobile device.","There may be various means to verify a user's identity. As the user brings the mobile device in front of his face, the camera of mobile device  may analyze captured digital images of the objects in front of its lens in order to detect and capture the user's face. These images may be analyzed using one or more suitable facial recognition algorithms to locate and compare the user's face to the face of the owner of the mobile device (e.g., the face stored on file in connection with the mobile device). If there is a sufficient amount of similarity between the two faces (i.e., a match), then the user currently handling the mobile device may be verified as the actual owner of the mobile device, and the mobile device may be unlocked without asking the user to explicitly provide a password or PIN. The image representing the face of the owner of the mobile device may be stored on the mobile device itself or elsewhere (e.g., on a server accessible to the mobile device). In some implementations, multiple different images of the user's face may be stored. In some implementations, the captured imaged of the user's face (if a match is successful) may be stored for later comparison. In some implementations, a set of captured images of the user's face may be stored an used in a comparison. The set of captured images can be stored in a ring or circular buffer structure where the last captured image overwrites the oldest image in the set of images.","In particular embodiments, the user may authorize guest users, and the mobile device may store photos of authorized guest users' faces for comparison. In particular embodiments, the user may define a set of access rights or use privileges for each guest user, or may apply a global setting to all guest users.","In particular embodiments, the camera of mobile device  may analyze captured digital objects in front of its lens in order to capture the user's iris. Iris-recognition algorithms may be utilized to match an authorized user's iris to the captured iris. If there is a sufficient amount of similarity between the two irises, then the user currently handling the mobile device may be verified as the actual owner of the mobile device.","In particular embodiments, the user of the mobile device may be a member of a social-networking system. A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige. In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. Such social-networking websites enable their members, who are commonly referred to as website users, to perform various social activities. For example, the social-networking website operated by Facebook, Inc. at www.facebook.com enables its users to communicate with their friends via emails, instant messages, or blog postings, organize social events, share photos, receive news of their friends or interesting events, play games, etc.","The user may have a profile with the social-networking system that includes information relevant to the user (e.g., demographic data, social connections and activities, interests, hobbies, etc.). In particular embodiments, the information found in the user's profile may also be used to help determine the user's intention with respect to the mobile device at a given time or estimate the user's identity. For example, if, based on the user's calendar stored with the social-networking system, it may be determined that the user is attending an event (e.g., a meeting), then the mobile device may be transitioned to a state where the screen is turned off and the input component is locked. As another example, it may be determined, based on the information available with the social-networking system, that the user is with his social connections (e.g., friends) at a given time and location. If the mobile device is in an atypical location for its owner, but at the same time, several of the owner's family members or friends are also there, this may suggest that the mobile device is with its true owner, in which case, the device may be unlocked without requiring a password or PIN. On the other hand, if the mobile device is in an atypical location and none of its owner's social connections is there, a password or PIN may be required to unlock the device to ensure that the user of the device is indeed its true owner.","In particular embodiments, mobile device  may use the image utilized for facial recognition unlocking on the social network. In particular embodiments, the mobile device may prompt the user as to whether he or she would like to update the user's profile picture on the social network. Upon an affirmative confirmation that the user would like to use the newly captured image as a profile picture, mobile device  may automatically upload the picture to the social network via a wireless data network. In particular embodiments, mobile device  automatically uploads the captured image as the user's new profile picture. In particular embodiments, mobile device  uploads the newly-captured image into a special album on the user's profile, thus generating a slideshow of facial recognition photos. In particular embodiments, this slideshow may be converted into a video documenting how the user has aged or progressed over a significant period of time. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of leveraging the facial recognition image on the social networking system.","In particular embodiments, detection of an impending unlock process may affect the settings of the user account associated with mobile device  on a social networking system. For example, a social networking system may include one or more instant messaging clients. After a period of inactivity, the user's presence on the instant messaging system may be dropped or altered to an \u201cidle\u201d state. However, upon mobile device  determining that sensor inputs indicate the user had picked up mobile device  and will be looking at the screen, mobile device  may, either prior to or after authentication, update or alter the user's online status to \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cactive.\u201d In particular embodiments, the photo captured by mobile device  for use in facial recognition may be uploaded as the user's instant messaging avatar.","In particular embodiments, mobile device  may perform various actions in anticipation of likely actions following an unlock event. For example, upon determining that an unlock event is imminent, mobile device may begin to download notifications and commonly viewed content, such as a newsfeed, from a social networking system. In particular embodiments, the actions may be tailored to the specific user based on previous habits. For example, if mobile device  determines that the user of the device habitually checks certain news sites or RSS feeds every time the user unlocks the phone, mobile device  may begin to automatically pull content from the sites when an unlock operation is imminent. In particular embodiments, the time of day and day of week may also affect which actions mobile device  initiates upon detecting an imminent unlocking operation. In particular embodiments, the user's location may affect what actions are performed by mobile device . For example, if the user has moved to an area that is neither his home nor his office, mobile device  may begin pulling nearby points of interest for a check-in operation. In particular embodiments, when the user has traveled greater than a predetermined distance, mobile device may begin pulling content from the social network for an \u201caround me\u201d page.","Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.  illustrates an example computer system . In particular embodiments, one or more computer systems  perform one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein. In particular embodiments, one or more computer systems  provide functionality described or illustrated herein.
