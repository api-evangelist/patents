After the nearby computing devices have been detected, communication can be established so that users of the computing devices can engage in a social interaction (e.g., a chat). Before engaging, in a social interaction, however, it may be desirable to discover whether or not the user of the nearby computing device has similar interests, etc. Known applications, however, lack the ability to privately discover selected information and\/or filter out certain communications before users engage in additional social interactions.","In one general aspect, a computer-readable storage medium can be configured to store instructions that when executed cause a processor to perform a process.

The method can include sending the hash value to a peer device, and receiving an indicator of a number of matches of a plurality of hash values calculated at the peer device with the hash value sent to the peer device.

Although not shown in , if at least a portion of the attributes B are sent from the destination device  to the source device  as target attributes, the destination device  can function as a source device (and can be referred to as such) and the source device  can function as a destination device (and can be referred to as such). Although a single target attribute  is described in this embodiment, in some embodiments, multiple attributes from the attributes A can be processed as target attributes. The comparison of attributes A, B (or target portions thereof) between the source device  and the destination device  is handled by the attribute modules , . A more detailed discussion of modules included in the attribute modules ,  are discussed at least in connection with, for example, .","The user accounts A, B can be social media accounts associated, respectively, with social media applications , . For example, the user accounts A, B, which can be associated with different users, can be social media accounts through which the user(s) can share content (e.g., images, video, comments, etc.) and\/or other information with a network of users (e.g., friends, relatives, colleagues, business associates) associated with the user via the social media applications , . In some embodiments, the social media applications ,  can be, or can include, social media user interfaces associated with a social media application operating at a host device (not shown) or locally at the devices (e.g., the source device , the destination device ).","The exchange of attributes as described herein can be performed so that users can maintain privacy (e.g., reveal relatively little personal information) while still being able to discover (e.g., confirm), for example, mutual interests (in the form of the attributes A, B) before engaging in further social interactions. The mutual interests targeted for comparison can be represented within one or more target attributes. After mutual interests have been confirmed (e.g., confirmed with a threshold probability), the users can optionally engage in further social interactions.","The comparison of at least a portion of the attributes A, B can be performed so that a user of the source device  may receive confirmation (e.g., confirmation with a threshold probability) as to whether or not the target attribute  from the attributes A matches (or does not match) with one or more of the attributes B, which can be referred to as destination attributes, without explicitly revealing (e.g., masking, hiding, disguising, concealing) the target attribute . The target attribute  can be an attribute such as a social interest (e.g., an identifier of a social group, a musical interest, a social preference), a personal attribute (e.g., an indicator of gender, an indicator of age), and\/or so forth of the user of user account A, that the user of user account A may desire to confirm with the user of user account B before engaging in a social interaction (e.g., chat, meeting, telephone conversation) with the user of user account B. In other words, a user of the source device  may trigger sending of the target attribute , within an attribute request  (also can be referred to as an attribute discovery request), to the destination device  to discover whether or not the target attribute  matches with one or more of the attributes B of user account B before engaging in a social interaction with the user of user account B. The confirmation, which can be included in an attribute response  (also can be referred to as a match response), can be defined by (e.g., triggered by a user of the destination device  to be defined by) the destination device  so that the attributes B may not be explicitly revealed to the user of the source device . After mutually confirming (e.g., confirming beyond a threshold probability) that the target attribute  is common to the attributes A and the attributes B, the target attribute  can optionally be explicitly revealed.","Also, the comparison of at least a portion of the attributes A, B can be performed so that identities associated with the user accounts A, B may not be explicitly revealed. In other words, users associated with the user account A, B can remain anonymous during the comparison of the attributes A, B (or targeted portions thereof). After at least a portion of the attributes A, B have been compared, identities associated with the user accounts A, B can be optionally revealed. In some embodiments, identities associated with the user accounts A, B can be optionally revealed during the comparison of at least some of the attributes A, B.","As a specific example, a user of user account A may select the target attribute  (from attributes A) to be sent from the source device  to the destination device  within the attribute request  (also can be referred to as an attribute confirmation request or attribute discovery request) so that a user of user account B may confirm whether or not the target attribute  matches with (or substantially match with) at least a portion of attributes B. The processing of the attributes A, B may be performed at the source device  and the destination device , respectively, via the attribute module  of the social media application  and the attribute module  of the social media application . The target attribute  can be an attribute such as a social interest (e.g., an identifier of a social group, a musical interest, a social preference), a personal attribute (e.g., an indicator of gender, an indicator of age), and\/or so forth of the user of user account A, that the user of user account A may desire to confirm with the user of user account B before engaging in a social interaction (e.g., chat, meeting, telephone conversation) with the user of user account B. The target attribute  can be sent from the source device  to the destination device  so that the target attribute  is concealed and without revealing the identity of the user of user account A at least until confirmation of the target attribute  (or a portion thereof) has occurred. In other words, the attribute request  can be defined at the source device  so that the target attribute , which can be included in the attribute request , can be concealed (e.g., masked, not revealed). In some embodiment, the target attribute  can be sent with multiple other attributes (that are not target attributes and can be referred to as dummy attributes) so that a user of the destination device  will not be able to detect (e.g., discern) which of the attributes is the attribute targeted by the source device  for confirmation (e.g., for discovery). Accordingly, the target attribute  may not be revealed as the target attribute.","In response to the attribute request , the destination device  can define the attribute response  based on a comparison of the target attribute  with the attributes B. The attribute response can be sent from the destination device  to the source device . In some embodiment, the attribute response  can include an indicator of mismatches, rather than matches. The number of mismatches (or number of matches) can be an indicator of, or can be used to calculate a probability of the target attribute  matching with one or more of the attributes B will be sent to the source device . Accordingly, the attribute response  can be defined so that the user of the source device  will not be able to definitively identify (e.g., detect, discern) which of the attributes B are associated with user account B at the destination device . In other words, the attribute response  can be defined by (e.g., triggered by a user of the destination device  to be defined by) the destination device  so that the attributes B may not be explicitly revealed to the user of the source device  in the attribute response .","If the target attribute  from the attributes A has been matched (e.g., matched with a threshold probability) with at least a portion of the attributes B (and has been communicated from the destination device  to the source device  in the attribute response ), the user of user account A may optionally engage in a social interaction with the user of user account B. For example, in response to the target attribute  matching (e.g., matched with at least a threshold probability) with at least a portion of the attributes B, the user of the user account A may request via the social media application  a chat with the user of user account B via the social media application . In response to the request, the user of user account B may grant the request and engage in the chat with the user of user account A. In some embodiments, the user of user account A and\/or the user of user account B may optionally reveal their respective identities before attributes are compared, while attributes are compared, and\/or after attributes have been compared (e.g., during a social interaction).","Although not shown, in some embodiments, the user of user account B may send, in a concealed (e.g., a masked) fashion within an attribute request, at least a portion of the attributes B as target attributes from the destination device  to the source device . In other words, the user of user account B can request confirmation of a match (or mismatch) (via an attribute request) of at least a portion of the attributes B with at least a portion of the attributes A associated with the user of user account A. In such embodiments, the destination device  may function as a source device, and the source device  may function as a destination device.","In some embodiments, the source device  and\/or the destination device  can be, for example, a wired device and\/or a wireless device (e.g., wi-fi enabled device) and can be, for example, a computing entity (e.g., a personal computing device), a server device (e.g., a web server), a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), e-reader, and\/or so forth. The source device  and\/or the destination device  can be configured to operate based on one or more platforms (e.g., one or more similar or different platforms) that can include one or more types of hardware, software, firmware, operating systems, runtime libraries, and\/or so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["200","200","202","204","202","206","200","204","206","200"]},"The attribute module  is configured to process attributes  stored in a memory  of the device . In some embodiments, the attributes  can be associated with a user account (e.g., a social media account) (not shown) of a user. In some embodiments, the attributes  can be retrieved from a user account associated with a social media application and stored in the memory , where the attributes  can be processed by the attribute module . In some embodiments, the attributes  can be accessed from (e.g., called from, retrieved from) a memory (e.g., a remote memory) that is not included in the device . In some embodiments, the attributes , when the device  is functioning as a source device, can be referred to as source attributes. In some embodiments, the attributes , when the device  is functioning as a destination device, can be referred to as destination attributes.","As shown in , the source portion  of the attribute module  includes a target attribute processor  configured to define an attribute request. When the device  is functioning as a source device, the target attribute processor  is configured to send an attribute request including one or more of the attributes  identified as target attributes from the device  (functioning as a source device) to a destination device (not shown) during comparison of attributes between the device  and the destination device. In this embodiment, attributes Q and Q are identified as target attributes . In some embodiments, the target attributes  can be sent to the destination device in one or more packets (e.g., data packets) defining an attribute request. In some embodiments, the target attribute processor  can be configured to define the attribute request so that one or more of the target attributes  may be concealed from the destination device.","The source portion  of the attribute module  also includes a response processor  configured to process an attribute response. When the device  is functioning as a source device, the response processor  is configured to process an attribute response from a destination device (not shown) that indicates (in a comparison indicator) whether or not one or more of the target attributes sent from the device  to the destination device match or do not match with the target attributes .","The attribute analyzer  of the destination portion  of the stream module  is configured to process an attribute request. When the device  is functioning as a destination device, the attribute analyzer  is configured to receive an attribute request that includes, for example, attributes that may be target attributes or dummy attributes sent from a source device (not shown). The attribute analyzer  can be configured to compare the target attributes received within the attribute request with the attributes  accessible at (e.g., stored at, retrievable at) the device . The attribute analyzer  can be configured to determine whether or not any of the attributes received within the attribute request from the source device match (or do not match) with attributes accessible at the device .","A response definition module  of the destination portion  can be configured to define and send an attribute response to a source device (not shown) after an attribute request has been processed at the device . The attribute response can include one or more indicators (e.g., comparison indicators) of matches (or mismatches) between attributes received from a source device (not shown) and attributes accessible at the device  while the device  is functioning as a destination device.","As described above, the target attribute processor  is configured to perform processing to conceal (e.g., mask) the attributes from the attributes  that are identified as target attributes in an attribute request. A specific example of target attribute concealment is described in connection with . As shown in , the target attributes  can be included by the target attribute processor  of the device  in multiple target attributes sets , which are labeled R through R, that include a combination of the target attributes  and dummy attributes (shaded with lines). For example, target attribute set R includes target attribute Q, and dummy attributes Q through Q. Target attribute set R includes target attributes Q and Q, and dummy attributes Q and Q. Target attribute set R includes target attributes Q and Q, and dummy attributes Q and Q.","The target attributes sets  can be sent to a destination device (not shown). Destination attributes  of the destination device can be compared by the destination device (e.g., an attribute analyzer of the destination device) with each attribute from each of the target attributes sets . In this embodiment, the destination device can be configured to determine that none of the destination attributes  match with the attributes included in the target attribute set R. The destination device can be configured to determine that attributes Q and Q from the destination attributes  match, respectively, with attributes Q and Q included in the target attribute set R. Also, the destination device can be configured to determine that attributes Q and Q from the destination attributes  match, respectively, with attributes Q and Q included in the target attribute set R.","In response to the comparisons performed at the destination device, the destination device can be configured to define (e.g., define using a response definition module of the destination device) an attribute response. The attribute response can include indicators (e.g., comparison indicators) of one or more attribute matches with the attributes from the target attributes sets . For example, the attribute response can indicate that the destination attributes  do not include any matches with the attributes included in target attribute set R, includes two matches with the attributes included in target attribute set R, and includes two matches with the attributes included in target attribute set R.","The attribute response (or attribute responses) defined at the destination device can be sent from the destination device and received at the response processor  of the device . Based on the number of matches included in the attribute response (or attribute responses), the response processor  of the device  can be configured to determine (e.g., determine with a specified probability) that the destination attributes  of the destination device do not include matches with both of the target attributes . Specifically, because the target attribute set R included the target attribute Q and the destination attributes  did not include a match with any of the attributes included in target attribute set R, the response processor  can be configured to determine that the destination attributes  do not include attribute Q.","In this embodiment, the attribute response included indicators of one or more attribute matches with the attributes from the target attributes sets . In some embodiments, the attribute response can include one or more indicators of (e.g., a quantity of) mismatches with the target attributes sets . For example, the destination device can define an attribute response that indicates that the destination attributes  do not match with two attributes included in target attribute set R. By indicating mismatches, rather than matches, the attributes included within the destination attributes  can be concealed in a desirable fashion from the device  in some scenarios.","In some embodiments, the matches (or mismatches) that have been identified within an attribute response (or attribute responses) can be used to calculate a probability (e.g., a probability value) that the target attributes  are included in the destination attributes . In some embodiments, the probability can be calculated based on a relative size of the target attributes sets , the number of target attributes included in each of the target attributes sets , the number of target attributes sets included in the target attribute sets , and\/or so forth. As a specific example, two mismatches and two matches exist within the target attribute set R. Accordingly, there is approximately a 50% probability that Q or Q is included in the destination attributes . Generally, if a single target attribute is included in a relatively large target attribute set and a number of mismatches with the target attribute set is relatively high, a probability that the single target attribute is included in a set of destination attributes can be relatively low (e.g., a relatively low probability percentage, a relatively low probability value). Also, if a single target attribute is included in a relatively small target attribute set and the number of mismatches with the target attribute set is relatively low, a probability that the single target attribute is included in a set of destination attributes can be relatively high (e.g., a relatively high probability percentage, a relatively high probability value).","In some embodiments, comparisons of attributes (to identify matching attributes) can be performed using, for example, natural language processing techniques. For example, an attribute can be compared with another attribute based on the language used to define each of the attributes using natural language processing of each of the attributes. As a specific example, a description of a user as being \u201cinterested in sports\u201d in an attribute can be positively matched with a description of another user as being \u201ca sports fanatic\u201d in another attribute. In some embodiments, attributes can be associated with identifiers (e.g., an alphanumeric identifier, unique identifiers, predefined identifiers) that can be used to identify matching attributes.","In some embodiments, the target attributes sets  can be sent from the device  (which is functioning as a source device) to a destination device (e.g., a destination device configured to access the destination attributes ) serially and\/or in parallel. For example, more than one of the target attributes sets  can be sent in an attribute request from the device  to a destination device. As another example, the device  can be configured to send target attribute set R to the destination device before sending target attribute set R. In such embodiments, the device  can be configured to send the target attribute set R only after an attribute response related to target attribute set R has been received. If in the embodiment described in connection with  Q were the only target attribute , since none of the destination attributes  are matched with any of the attributes included in target attribute set R, further communication with the destination device can be terminated without sending additional target attributes sets .","Although not shown in , in some embodiments, a destination device can be configured to function as a source device. For example, a first device functioning as a destination device can be configured to receive one or more target attribute sets from a second device functioning as a source device. The first device can also be configured to function as a source device by defining and sending one or more target attributes sets to the second device, which will function as a destination device with respect to the target attributes set(s).","In this embodiment, each of the target attributes sets  includes exactly four attributes. In some embodiments, a target attribute set can include more than four attributes or less than four attributes. Also, in this embodiment, each of the target attributes sets  includes the same quantity (e.g., number) of attributes. In some embodiments, each of the target attribute sets from the target attributes sets  may not include the same quantity (e.g., number) of attributes.","In some embodiments, the target attributes  can be designated by a user as target attributes. For example, a user of a user account associated with the attributes  can select the attributes Q and Q as the target attributes . In some embodiments, a user can be prompted to select one or more target attributes by a notification module  of the attribute module . For example, in response to the device  detecting a peer device with which the device  can exchange attributes (for discovery of mutual attributes), the notification module  can notify (via one or more user interface prompts) the user. In some embodiments, the user can also be prompted (via one or more user interface prompt) to select one or more target attributes for confirmation with the peer device. In some embodiments, the target attributes can be designated by a user as target attributes before detecting the peer device with which the device  can exchange attributes for discovery of mutual attributes.","In some embodiments, the dummy attributes included in the target attributes sets  can be designated as dummy attributes by a user, randomly selected (e.g., randomly selected by the target attribute processor  when defining an attribute request), and\/or so forth. In some embodiments, the dummy attributes can be selected from the attributes  associated with a user account of a user, or from a pool of attributes that may or may not intersect with the attributes .","Although not shown in , in some embodiments, one or more target attributes sets may not include one or more target attributes. For example, a source device can be configured to define a target attribute set that includes only dummy attributes (or attributes that are not of interest to the user).","In some implementations, the attribute module  can be configured to operate at a host device. In such implementations, the attribute module  can be accessed through a network by the device , which can function as a client to the attribute module . Accordingly, the functionality of the attribute module  can be called and\/or executed on an on-demand basis. In some implementations, the attribute module  can function as a background application operating in conjunction with the device  (and\/or additional devices). In some implementations, the attribute module  can function as an application (or service) that can be accessed via an application programming interface (API). More details related to the attribute module  operating at a host device are set forth, for example, in connection with .","The attribute module  can be, or can include, any type of hardware and\/or software configured to process attributes. In some implementations, one or more portions of the components shown in the attribute module  in  can be, or can include, a hardware-based module (e.g., a digital signal processor (DSP), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a memory), a firmware module, and\/or a software-based module (e.g., a module of computer code, a set of computer-readable instructions that can be executed at a computer). For example, in some implementations, one or more portions of the attribute module  can be, or can include, a software module configured for execution by at least one processor (not shown). In some implementations, the functionality of the components can be included in different modules and\/or different components than those shown in . For example, although not shown, the functionality of the target attribute processor  of the attribute module  can be included in a different module than the target attribute processor  of the attribute module , or divided into several different modules.","Although not shown, in some implementations, the attribute module  (or portions thereof) and\/or the device  (or portions thereof) can be configured to operate within, for example, a data center (e.g., a cloud computing environment), a computer system, one or more server\/host devices, and\/or so forth. In some implementations, the attribute module  (or portions thereof) and\/or the device  (or portions thereof) can be configured to operate within a network. Thus, the attribute module  (or portions thereof) and\/or the device  (or portions thereof) can be configured to function within various types of network environments that can include one or more devices and\/or one or more server devices. For example, the network can be, or can include, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), and\/or so forth. The network can be, or can include, a wireless network and\/or wireless network implemented using, for example, gateway devices, bridges, switches, and\/or so forth. The network can include one or more segments and\/or can have portions based on various protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP) and\/or a proprietary protocol. The network can include at least a portion of the Internet.","As discussed above, in some implementations, the attribute module  can be included in, or can be associated with, a social media application (not shown). The social media application can be any type of application (e.g., a smartphone application, a stand-alone application) that can be used by a user to share content and\/or other information with a network of users (e.g., friends, relatives, colleagues, business associates) associated with the user. In some implementations, the social media application can be a web-based application that can be accessed by users. In some implementations, the social media application can be referred to as a social media system and can be part of a social media platform. In some implementations, the social media application can be associated with a social network service. In some implementations, the social media application can be a collaborative environment through which one or more users (such as a sharer and\/or a consumer of content) can engage in collaborative work. In some implementations, the social media application can include one or more search engines, social network services, forums, instant messaging\/chat applications, virtual environments, peer-to-peer communications applications, and\/or so forth. In some implementations, the social media application can include, or can be based on, one or more open application programming interfaces (APIs).","The attribute module  (or any other portion of the device ) can be configured to operate based on one or more platforms (e.g., one or more similar or different platforms) that can include one or more types of hardware, software, firmware, operating systems, runtime libraries, and\/or so forth. In some implementations, the device  can represent a cluster of devices (e.g., a server farm). In such an implementation, the functionality and processing of the attribute module  can be distributed to several devices of the cluster of devices.","Although not shown, in some implementations, the memory  can be implemented as more than one memory component (e.g., more than one random-access memory (RAM) component or disk drive memory) associated with the attribute module . In some implementations, the memory  can be a database memory. In some implementations, the memory  can be, or can include, a non-local memory. For example, the memory  can be, or can include, a memory shared by multiple devices (not shown). In some implementations, the memory  can be associated with a server device (not shown) within a network and configured to serve the attribute module .","Referring back to , in some embodiments, the user of user account A may proceed with engaging in a social interaction with the user of user account B even if the target attribute  is not definitively confirmed as matching with at least some of the attributes B. For example, the target attribute  (or a portion thereof) may be confirmed as matching with at least some of the attributes B with a specified probability (that may be less than 100%). In such instances, the user of user account A may proceed with engaging in a social interaction with the user the user account B based on (or in response to) the specified probability.","In some embodiments, a communication between the source device  and the destination device  can be performed via a secure connection.

In some embodiments, the secure connection can be established using any combination of public and private keys. In some embodiments, the secure connection can be established using a symmetric key algorithm, an asymmetric key algorithm, and\/or so forth. In some embodiments, the secure connection can be classified as a private connection.","In some embodiments, a connection between the source device  and the destination device  can be a temporary connection established for the purpose of matching one or more of the attributes A, B. In other words, a connection between the source device  and the destination device  can be temporarily established so that the source device  can send the target attribute  to the destination device  for comparison (or discovery) with one or more of the attributes B, which are accessible at the destination device . If the target attribute  does not match with one or more of the attributes B, the temporary connection can be terminated. If the target attribute  does match with one or more of the attributes B, the connection can be maintained between the source device  and the destination device  a social interaction. In some embodiments, a different connection can be established (and the temporary connection can be terminated) between the source device  and the destination device  after confirmation that the target attribute  matches with one or more of the attributes B.","Although not shown in , in some embodiments, the source device  can be configured to send, in a concealed fashion, the target attribute  for comparison with at least some attributes with multiple destination devices (in addition to destination device ). For example, the source device  can be configured to send (via one or more secure connections) the target attribute  to multiple destination devices. In some embodiments, the target attribute  can be sent to at least a portion of the multiple destination devices serially, or in parallel. Each of the multiple destination devices can be configured to determine whether or not at least a portion of the attributes available at each of the destination devices matches with the target attribute . In response to matching the available attributes with the target attribute , a user of the source device  can engage in one or more social interactions with one or more users of the one or more destination devices.","In some embodiments, a temporary identifier can be sent from the source device  to the destination device  with the target attribute  so that an identity associated with the user account A may not be revealed. Accordingly, the temporary identifier can be associated with the user account A for comparison of at least some of the attributes A, B. In some embodiments, different temporary identifiers can be sent to each destination device from multiple destination devices in communication with the source device . In some embodiments, an identifier received from the destination device  at the source device  can be a temporary identifier (e.g., a temporary identifier associated with user account B).","In some embodiments, one or more temporary identifiers can be associated with a key (e.g., an encryption key) used for establishing a secure connection between the source device  and the destination device . For example, the source device  can be configured to generate a key that can be used to establish a secure connection between the source device  and the destination device . In some embodiments, the key can function as, or can be included in, an identifier of the source device . In some embodiments, an identifier can be included in a key used to establish a secure connection between the source device  and the destination device .","Although not shown in , in some embodiments, the source device  can be configured to send at least a portion of the target attribute  to one or more destination devices based on the proximity (e.g., a threshold proximity) of the one or more destination devices with the source device . For example, the source device  can be configured to send the target attribute  to the destination device  in response to an indicator that a distance between the destination device  and the source device  is within a threshold distance. In some embodiments, the distance between the destination device  and the source device  can be determined based on, for example, global positioning system (GPS) coordinates, wireless signals exchanged between the source device  and the destination device, and so forth.","In some embodiments, the target attribute  can be automatically sent from the source device  and the destination device  for comparison in response to detecting that the destination device  is within a threshold distance of the source device . For example, the source device  can be configured to send out a relatively short range wireless beacon (or ping) signal. When the destination device  receives the beacon signal, the destination device  can respond to the source device  within indicator that the destination device  has received the beacon signal. In response to the response from the destination device , the source device  can be configured to send the target attribute  to the destination device  for comparison with one or more of the attributes B, which are accessible at the destination device . In some embodiments, the sending of the target attribute  can be handled by the attribute module  of the social media application , and the comparison of the attribute(s) B can be handled by the attribute module  of the social media application . In some embodiments, permission can be requested (e.g., requested by a notification module such as the notification module  shown in ) before sending one or more of the target attributes .","In some embodiments, the target attribute  can be sent from the source device  and the destination device  for comparison in response to an action performed by a user of the source device  or a user of the destination device . For example, the source device  can be configured to determine that the destination device  is within a threshold distance of the source device . Accordingly, a user (e.g., a user associated with user account A) of the source device  can be notified that the destination device  is within the threshold distance of the source device . In response to the notification, the source device  can be configured so that the user can trigger sending of the target attribute  to the destination device  for comparison with one or more of the attributes B, which are accessible at the destination device .

In other words, the exchange of attributes is performed without, for example, processing of the attributes at a host device. Although, this does not preclude the possibility that the exchange of attributes may occur via a network that can include one or more host devices. In some embodiments, communication between the source device  and the destination device  can be performed via wireless communication and\/or wired communication. In some embodiments, a connection between the source device  and the destination device  can be established using one or more transceivers (e.g., a wireless transceiver, a wired transceiver) included in the source device  and\/or the destination device .

Although not shown in , in some embodiments, the attribute U can be selected from a group of source attributes associated with a user account (e.g., a source user account) of a social media application. After the hash value XP of the target attribute U has been calculated at the source device , the hash value XP can be sent to the destination device  in an attribute request.","In this embodiment, the hash value space is relatively small compared with the attribute space. Accordingly, several of the attributes, when hashed by the hash module , can result in the same hash value. In other words, the hash value space is defined to be relatively small compared the attribute space so that collisions between hash values will occur. In some embodiments, the hash value space (which can include a specified quantity of hash values or potential hash values) can be defined so that each attribute from the attribute space will be hashed to (e.g., can be mapped to) a common hash value with another attribute from the attribute space (which can include a specified quantity of attributes or potential attributes). By defining a relatively small hash value space compared with the attribute space, an attribute that is designated as a target attribute can be masked even if advertising a hash value calculated based on the attribute. Specifically, several attributes in addition to attribute U can result in the hash value XP. Accordingly, advertising the hash value XP does not necessarily indicate that the target attribute is attribute U, because the hash value XP could also be calculated based on the several attributes.","In response to receiving the attribute request, the hash module  of the destination device  can be configured to calculate hash values based on destination attributes  accessible at the destination device . In this embodiment, hash value XP is calculated based on both attribute U and attribute U, hash value XQ is calculated based on attribute U, and a hash value XS is calculated based on attribute U. As mentioned above, because the hash value space is relatively small compared the attribute space collisions between hash values can occur. Such is the case with attribute values U and U which both are related to (e.g., hashed to) the hash value XP.","After the hash values have been calculated based on the destination attributes , the destination device  can be configured to define an attribute response indicating that at least two hash values calculated at the destination device  match with the hash value XP received in the attribute request from the source device . Even though the destination device  may reveal that the hash value XP calculated by the destination device  matches with the hash value XP calculated by the source device , neither the destination device  nor the source device  has precisely revealed any attributes because multiple attributes can be hashed to hash value XP.","Based on the attribute response, the attribute module  of the source device  can be configured to calculate a probability that the attribute U (which is designated as the target attribute) is included in the destination attributes . In some embodiments, the probability can be calculated based on a relative size of the hash value space compared with the attribute space. In some embodiments, the probability can be calculated based on a number of attributes (in addition to attribute U) that can be hashed to the hash value XP. For example, in this embodiment, if the hash value space is defined so that no more than two attribute values can be hashed to a single hash value, the attribute U designated as a target attribute at the source device  is guaranteed to be included in the destination attributes  because at least two of the attributes from the destination attributes  are hashed to the hash value XP. As another example, the hash value space can be defined so that no more than two attribute values can be hashed to a single hash value. In such embodiments, if only one of the attributes from the destination attributes  is hashed to the hash value XP, the attribute U designated as a target attribute at the source device  may only have approximately a 50% probability of being included in the destination attributes  because only one of the attributes from the destination attributes  is hashed to the hash value XP (and potentially another attribute value could be hashed to the hash value XP).","In some embodiments, at least a portion of the attributes (e.g., attribute U at the source device , the destination attributes ) that are processed by the source device  and\/or the destination device  can be configured so that they can be hashed using one or more hash algorithms (e.g., hash procedures) implemented by the hash modules , .

In some embodiments, the set of mapping values can be stored locally, or in a remote location, where they can be accessed by the source device  and\/or the destination device . The value space of the mapping values, like hash values, can include a number of values that is smaller than a number of values included in the attribute space. Accordingly, multiple attributes can be mapped to a single mapping value, and attribute values can be concealed (through mapping to the mapping values) by one device from another device.

In some embodiments, the probability can vary depending on a size of the portion of the code that is included in the attribute request. For example, if a relatively large portion (e.g., a large number a bit values) of the code is included in an attribute request, the probability of positively matching with a destination attribute can be higher than if a relatively small portion of the code is included in the attribute request. The number of collisions possible with relatively large portion may be smaller than the number of collisions possible with the relatively small portion.","Although illustrated as binary values in this embodiment, in some embodiments, one or more codes can include different types of values (e.g., alphanumeric values).

In some embodiments, the portion of the code that is selected and included in an attribute request can be defined by, for example, a user (e.g., a preference of a user).
