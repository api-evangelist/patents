{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Print devices have increased in number and geographic footprint throughout the world and have become increasingly connected to networks. These networks can include a print server. Typically, when one or more documents and\/or other print data are scheduled to be printed, the print data is either directly sent to one print device, or sent to a print server.","The networks can include many print devices. Some or all of the print devices can have different features, functions, and capabilities. For example, some print devices print in color, while others do not. As another example, some print devices are equipped with duplexing hardware that allows printing on both sides of a sheet of paper, while other print devices can only print on one side of a sheet of paper.","Several different network communication protocols and channels can be used to manage and utilize large numbers of print devices. Once a print device is installed, typically the print device's specific remote network (e.g., Internet) configuration remains unchanged while the printer is in service.","In one aspect, a method is provided. A transaction is opened between one or more managing servers and one or more print devices. The transaction is associated with one or more tasks. As part of the transaction, the one or more managing servers and one or more print devices perform the one or more tasks. Each task of the one or more tasks is communicated from a source device selected from among the one or more managing servers and the one or more print devices to one or more destination devices selected from among the one or more managing servers and the one or more print devices, where the source device is not one of the one or more destination devices. Each of the one or more destination devices communicates a reply to the communicated task. The transaction between one or more managing servers and one or more print devices is closed.","In another aspect, a system is provided. The system includes one or more print devices and a managing server. The managing server includes one or more processors and data storage. The data storage is configured to store computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the managing server to perform functions. The functions include: opening a transaction between the managing server and the one or more print devices, wherein the transaction is associated with one or more tasks; as part of the transaction, performing the one or more tasks using the managing server and the one or more print devices, wherein each task of the one or more tasks is communicated from a source device selected from among the managing server and the one or more print devices to one or more destination devices selected from among the managing server and the one or more print devices, wherein each of the one or more destination devices communicate a reply to the communicated task, and wherein the source device is not one of the one or more destination devices; and closing the transaction.","In another aspect, an article of manufacture is provided. The article of manufacture includes computer-readable instructions that, when executed by one or more processors of a managing server associated with one or more print devices, cause the managing server to perform functions. The functions include: opening a transaction between the managing server and the one or more print devices, wherein the transaction is associated with one or more tasks; as part of the transaction, performing the one or more tasks using the managing server and one or more print devices, wherein each task of the one or more tasks is communicated from a source device selected from among the managing server and the one or more print devices to one or more destination devices selected from among the managing server and the one or more print devices, wherein each of the one or more destination devices communicate a reply to the communicated task, and wherein the source device is not one of the one or more destination devices; and closing the transaction.","Other aspects, embodiments, and implementations will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying figures, which form a part hereof. In the figures, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, figures, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.","I. Overview","Example apparatus and methods are described herein related to performing tasks related to managing and using connected print devices and associated managing servers. In some cases, the print devices are located in a local network and may be protected by firewalls from some (or all) external network traffic. Different network protocols can be supported as part of the local network and other networks to retrieve information from all of the print devices with minimum restrictions on local (and other) network configuration; e.g., restrictions on proxies, firewalls, domain name resolution, etc. These network protocols include, but are not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP), Java Message Service (JMS), Kyocera Page Description Language (KPDL), Printer Command Language (PCL), Portable Document Format (PDF). Page Description Language (PDL), Postscript, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Short Message Service (SMS), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Message Queue (MQ) family of network protocols.","To perform these tasks, a language, such as the herein-described Printer Transaction Language, can be used. The Printer Transaction Language is based on a transaction opened between one or more source devices, such as managing servers, and one or more destination devices, such as print devices. While the transaction is open, tasks can be communicated from the source device(s) to the destination device(s). Then, when the tasks are performed by the destination devices, one or more corresponding replies to the tasks can be generated and sent from the destination device(s) to the source device(s). In some cases, one task can lead to multiple replies from a destination device; e.g., a task requesting multiple reports from the destination device. In some network examples, virtual devices can be used as source and\/or destination devices. For example, suppose that a number of physical managing server devices are configured to act as one virtual managing server, e.g., when failover of some of the physical managing server devices is enabled. Then, the virtual managing server can act as a source or destination device of the Printer Transaction Language.","Communication via the Printer Transaction Language is bidirectional, allowing devices to send and receive messages related to tasks to be performed and replies to the tasks. Then, once all tasks associated with the open transaction have been performed, the open transaction can be closed by the source device(s). The Printer Transaction Language can use multiple communication channels to both support as many devices as possible and to allow the servers to process as many tasks as possible. For example, a transaction between one source device and D destination devices, D>1, can use D channels; e.g., channel 1 between the source device and destination device , channel 2 between the source device and destination device , and so on, until reaching channel D between the source device and destination device D.","Devices can support multiple communication protocols. Thus, the Printer Transaction Language can be conveyed using different protocols and channels. For example, some or all aspects of the Printer Transaction Language can be communicated using HTTP over IP. In other examples, some or all aspects of the Printer Transaction Language can be conveyed using the above-mentioned network protocols; e.g., SNMP, SMTP, MQ, etc. Part or all of the Printer Transaction Language can be encapsulated in outgoing and\/or incoming messages using one or more of the multiple communication protocols. Printer Transaction Language messages can be used to tracking messages conveyed through different transport channels; for example, by having a reply to received messages include a copy of received Printer Transaction Language tasks\/commands.","Transport adapters can transparently convey messages and message encoding can be shared across various available transport protocols and channels. For instance, if a message from a particular device is in a designated format, e.g., an eXtended Markup Language (XML) format, then subsequent messages to the particular device can be encoded into XML and subsequent messages from the particular device can be decoded from XML. The server can collect and identify messages retrieved from different channels to synchronize outgoing messages with related incoming messages.","The herein described Printer Transaction Language can be used to help manage large and possibly diverse networks of servers and print devices by providing a protocol for management and use of print devices. The Printer Transaction Language can be used specifically for print device related tasks; e.g., printing of test data, providing information about printing-related parameters. Thus, the Printer Transaction Language can be optimized and configured specifically for print devices and devices that manage print devices, such as managing servers, and so can be utilized to perform printing-specific tasks efficiently.","II.

Example Printer Transaction Language",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","110","120","130","140","110","310","130","312","120","130","314","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","312","314"]},"In the example Printer Transaction Language, a transaction can be opened up between one or more source devices and one or more destination devices using one or more OPEN messages. A device can have multiple transactions open simultaneously and can act, on a per-transaction basis, as a source device and as a destination device. For example, print device  could have three transactions open with managing server  and act as a destination device for two of the three transactions, while acting as a source device for the third, and further have a fourth transaction with device manager , where print device  acts as a destination device in the fourth transaction. Many other examples of transactions and channels are possible as well.","While a particular transaction is open, one device; e.g., the source device can send commands, as TASK messages, to one or more other devices; e.g., one or more destination device. After a particular device receives TASK message, the particular device can carry out the task specified in the TASK message and send a REPLY message in response, where the REPLY message communicates any response the particular device has to the TASK request. Then, once all tasks for a transaction are completed, a transaction can be closed using one or more CLOSE messages.","Table 1 below summarizes the example Printer Transaction Language that utilizes four messages: OPEN, TASK, REPLY, and CLOSE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1.","OPEN - begin a transaction"]},{"entry":[{},"Format:"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003OPEN id [ch] - begin a transaction identified by transaction ID id "]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003and perhaps by channel ch"]},{"entry":[{},"Examples:"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"i.

As shown in Table 1 above, a REPLY message can have the following format:\n\n","The command portion of the REPLY message can be a copy of part or the entire input command; that is, the corresponding TASK message. Including the copied (portion of the) corresponding TASK message in a REPLY message allows for correlation between TASK and REPLY messages by the source device. Additionally, having a copy of the TASK message embodied in the REPLY message allows the source device to verify transmission of the original TASK message.","The code portion of the REPLY message can indicate whether or not the activity was carried out successfully by the device that received the TASK message. As shown in the example of Table 1, a code of \u201cOK\u201d can indicate successful completion of the activity and a code of \u201cNO\u201d can indicate unsuccessful completion of the activity. In other embodiments, other values and\/or codes can be used in REPLY messages.","The response portion of the REPLY message can include results of the activity that was prompted by the corresponding TASK message. The response portion can be in any format. For example, if the activity was \u201cGET pagesprinted\u201d and the value of the pagesprinted parameter is 139, then example response formats include, but are not limited to, \u201c139\u201d, \u201c0x8b\u201d, \u201cpagesprinted=139\u201d, or \u201cThe value of pagesprinted at 12:35 PM on 28 Jun. 2015=139\u201d.","For some activities, the response can be null (empty)\u2014that is, some activities do not have specified responses beyond perhaps an indication of success or failure that can be conveyed using the code portion. Some activities can lead to one or more error codes to be generated. As shown in Table 1, an example response portion for reporting error codes can be \u201cERROR x [x2 . . . ]\u201d, where x, x2 . . . are error codes.","As an example, suppose a source device SD1 sends the following TASK message to destination device DD1: TASK OPEN 123456 12. If the OPEN command was successfully completed by destination device DD1, an example REPLY message to be sent by DD1 in response is: REPLY OPEN 123456 12 OK, where the command portion of the REPLY message is \u201cOPEN 123456 12\u201d, the code portion is \u201cOK\u201d, and the response portion is null.","If the OPEN message was not successfully completed by destination device DD1, an example REPLY message to be sent by DD1 in response is: REPLY OPEN 123456 12 NO, where the command portion of the REPLY message is \u201cOPEN 123456 12\u201d, the code portion is \u201cNO\u201d, and the response portion is null. If the command was not successful and returned error code 73, an example response is: REPLY OPEN 123456 12 NO ERROR 73, where the command portion of the REPLY message is \u201cOPEN 123456 12\u201d, the code portion is \u201cNO\u201d, and the response portion is \u201cERROR 73\u201d to report the error code \u201c73\u201d from destination device DD1 to source device SD1. Many other examples are possible as well.","A CLOSE message of the Printer Transaction Language can be used to end a transaction. As shown in Table 1 above, an CLOSE message can have the following format:\n\n","Messages of the Printer Transaction Language can be conveyed using one or more network protocols, such as, but not limited to the network protocols discussed herein. In some embodiments, some or all Printer Transaction Language messages can be conveyed by multiple protocols; e.g., a Printer Transaction Language can be conveyed in one or more TCP packets conveyed using IP.","In other embodiments, some or all Printer Transaction Language messages can be compressed, encrypted, hashed, and\/or otherwise reformatted, perhaps using relatively transparent techniques. For example, software communicating Printer Transaction Language messages could automatically or otherwise be directed to compress and\/or encrypt some or all outgoing Printer Transaction Language messages and\/or decompress and\/or decrypt some or all incoming Printer Transaction Language messages. As another example, software communicating Printer Transaction Language messages could be protected by using Secure HTTP (SHTTP) links to convey the Printer Transaction Language messages.","In still other embodiments, more, fewer, and\/or different messages can be used as part of the Printer Transaction Language than discussed herein. In even other embodiments, some or all of the messages described herein as part of the Printer Transaction Language can have different formats; e.g., part or all of some or all of the messages in the Printer Transaction Language can be formatted using a binary format, a numeric format, different alpha-numeric format(s), and\/or other formats. In yet other embodiments, different Printer Transaction Language message can be conveyed using different protocols; e.g., a TASK message with a GET or SET command can be conveyed, at least in part, using the SNMP protocol, while a TASK message with a DOWNLOAD or UPLOAD command can convey files at least in part using the FTP protocol.
