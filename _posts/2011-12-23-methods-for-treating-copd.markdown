EXAMPLES"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under award number 08-0219 awarded by the American Asthma Foundation. The Foundation may have certain rights in the invention.","This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/426,788 filed Dec. 23, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments of this invention are related generally to physiology and medicine. More specifically, this invention is related to aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) and their use in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","Aldose reductase (AR) catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of aldehydes (Bhatnager and Srivastava, 48(2):91-121, 1992). The substrates of the enzyme range from aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to aldoses such as glucose, galactose, and ribose. The reduction of glucose by AR is particularly significant during hyperglycemia and increased flux of glucose via AR has been etiologically linked to the development of secondary diabetic complications (Bhatnager and Srivastava, 48(2):91-121, 1992; Yabe-Nishimura, 50(1):21-33, 1998). However, recent studies showing that AR is an excellent catalyst for the reduction of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes and their glutathione conjugates (Srivastava et al., 217:741-746, 1995; Vander Jagt et al., 1249(2):117-26, 1995; Srivastava et al., 37(37):12909-17, 1998; Srivastava et al., 463:501-7, 1999; Dixit et al., 275:21587-21595, 2000; Ramana et al., 39:12172-12180, 2000) suggest that in contrast to its injurious role during diabetes, under normal glucose concentration, AR may be involved in protection against oxidative and electrophilic stress. The antioxidant role of AR is consistent with the observations that in a variety of cell types AR is upregulated by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (Spycher et al., 11(2):181-8, 1997), lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes (Ruef et al., 20(7):1745-52, 2000; Rittner et al., 103(7):1007-13, 1999), advanced glycosylation end products (Nakamura et al., 29(1):17-25, 2000) and nitric oxide (Seo et al., 275(39):30355-62, 2000). The expression of the enzyme is also increased under several pathological conditions associated with increased oxidative or electrophilic stress such as iron overload (Barisani et al., 469(2-3):208-12, 2000), alcoholic liver disease (O'Connor et al., 343 Pt 2:487-504, 1999), heart failure (Yang et al., 102(25):3046-52, 2000), myocardial ischemia (Shinmura et al., 97(18):10197-202, 2000), vascular inflammation (Rittner et al., 103(7):1007-13, 1999) and restenosis (Ruef et al., 20(7):1745-52, 2000), and various forms of cancer.","Inhibitors of aldose reductase have been indicated for some conditions and diseases, such as diabetes complications, ischemic damage to non-cardiac tissue, Huntington's disease. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,696,407, 6,127,367, 6,380,200, which are all hereby incorporated by reference. In some cases, the role in which aldose reductase plays in mechanisms involved in the condition or disease is known. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,407 indicates that an aldose reductase inhibitors increase striatal ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which has ramifications for the treatment of Huntington's Disease. In other cases, however, the way in which aldose reductase or aldose reductase inhibitors work with respect to a particular disease or condition is not known.","Therefore, the role of aldose reductase in a number of diseases and conditions requires elucidation, as patients with these diseases and conditions continue to require new treatments. Thus, there is a need for preventative and therapeutic methods involving aldose reductase and aldose reductase inhibitors.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a subject diagnosed with, exhibiting symptoms of, or at risk of developing COPD by administering a therapeutically effective amount of an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI). As used herein, a \u201crisk\u201d of developing COPD is based on the subject's medical, personal, and\/or family history. In particular, current or previous smoking (most notably cigarettes, but also other nicotine or non-nicotine, e.g., marijuana, products) indicate a risk of developing COPD, but risk factors also include, but are not limited to exposure to smoke or other environmental hazards (e.g., mining or textile industry hazards, fumes, air pollution), genetic susceptibility, autoimmune disease, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. A subject may also be one that exhibits one or more symptoms of COPD including, but not limited to: chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea (shortness of breath), rhonchi (rattling breathing sounds), and airway limitation on pulmonary function testing.","In certain aspects, the aldose reductase inhibitor is administered to the patient as a prodrug. Typically, a prodrug is an inactive or less active form of a drug that is metabolized or converted in vivo to an active or more active form.","The ARI can be administered by any route, including orally, endoscopically, intratracheally, intrabronchially, intravenously, intralesionally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, percutaneously, or subcutaneously. In certain aspects the ARI is administered orally or by inhalation or instillation, e.g., by inhaler or other aerosol delivery devices.","In certain embodiments the aldose reductase inhibitor is a peptide, a peptide mimetic, a small molecule, or an inhibitory RNA. The aldose reductase inhibitor can be an siRNA or other inhibitory nucleic acid, a carboxylic acid, a hydantoin, a pyridazinone, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. In particular aspects the aldose reductase inhibitor is fidarestat, sorbinil, epalrestat, ponalrestat, methosorbinil, risarestat, imirestat, ALO-1567, quercetin, zopolrestat, AD-5467, NZ-314, M-16209, minalrestat, AS-3201, WP-921, luteolin, tolrestat, EBPC, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. In certain embodiments the aldose reductase inhibitor is fidarestat.","Other embodiments of the invention are discussed throughout this application. Any embodiment discussed with respect to one aspect of the invention applies to other aspects of the invention as well and vice versa. The embodiments in the Example section are understood to be embodiments of the invention that are applicable to all aspects of the invention.","The term \u201ctreating\u201d includes treating a physiological cause of disease, treating a condition associated with the disease, and treating one or symptoms of the disease. Treating includes reducing the severity (including any measurable decrease to complete elimination), reducing the frequency, slowing or stopping the progression of, increasing the time until onset, or preventing the onset of one or more disease symptoms.","The use of the word \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d when used in conjunction with the term \u201ccomprising\u201d in the claims and\/or the specification may mean \u201cone,\u201d but it is also consistent with the meaning of \u201cone or more,\u201d \u201cat least one,\u201d and \u201cone or more than one.\u201d","Throughout this application, the term \u201cabout\u201d is used to indicate that a value includes the standard deviation of error for the device or method being employed to determine the value.","The use of the term \u201cor\u201d in the claims is used to mean \u201cand\/or\u201d unless explicitly indicated to refer to alternatives only or the alternatives are mutually exclusive, although the disclosure supports a definition that refers to only alternatives and \u201cand\/or.\u201d","As used in this specification and claim(s), the words \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201chaving\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and \u201ccontaining\u201d are inclusive or open-ended and do not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps.","Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating specific embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.","The inventors have demonstrated that Aldose Reductase (AR) is important for the detoxification of lipid aldehydes. In addition to the detoxification role, AR activity is necessary for cell signaling of cytokines, chemokines, endotoxins, high glucose, and growth factors that cause cell apoptosis and proliferation which cause tissue dysfunction leading to inflammation and various diseases, i.e., AR is an obligatory mediator of cytokine, chemokine, growth factors, and bacterial endotoxin-induced by activation of transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP1 through a cascade of kinases. The activation of transcription factors is responsible for the synthesis and release of a number of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that cause cytotoxicity. They are responsible for causing inflammation in general (see U.S. Pub. 2004\/0047919, U.S. Pub. 2006\/0293265, and U.S. Pub. 2010\/0144748, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference), which is associated with COPD and allergic asthma.","In certain aspects of the invention, an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) is used to treat COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which results from chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, noxious gases and\/or particles, is one of the most common reasons of major morbidity and mortality worldwide and afflicts over 600 million people as estimated by World Health Organization. Inflammation of the airway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of COPD, which involves infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airway and the accumulation of inflammatory mucous exudates. The major risk factor in the pathogenesis of COPD is cigarette smoke, which causes airway inflammation by activating resident cells including airway epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and T-lymphocytes, which generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release proteases leading to cellular injury. Production of ROS has been directly linked to oxidation of proteins, DNA, and lipids, which may cause direct lung injury or induce a variety of cellular responses through the generation of secondary metabolic reactive species. The inventors have demonstrated that inhibition of aldose reductase (AR) prevents cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cellular changes in human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) that are characteristic of COPD including cellular apoptosis, and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory markers. Aldose reductase (AR), a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, is a cytosolic protein that catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of glucose to sorbitol in hyperglycemic conditions, which is implicated in diabetic complications. However evidence has recently been presented indicating that AR is crucial in the oxidative stress-induced molecular signal and that AR catalyzed metabolic product is an excellent mediator of redox signaling that plays an important role in various inflammation-related pathologies such as diabetic complications, cardiovascular diseases, asthma, COPD, cancer, and infectious diseases. The results described herein show that IL-13-induced goblet cell formation is prevented by AR inhibition in-vitro as well as in-vivo. These and present results together suggest that AR inhibition is beneficial in preventing and treating the COPD as it prevented cell-death, cytokines release and mucus formation in human airway epithelial cells.","Aldose reductase (AR), a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, is a cytosolic protein that catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of glucose to sorbitol in hyperglycemic conditions, which is implicated in diabetic complications.

When the salt is of a monobasic acid (e.g., the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide, the p-toluenesulfonate, the acetate), the hydrogen form of a dibasic acid (e.g., the hydrogen sulfate, the succinate) or the dihydrogen form of a tribasic acid (e.g., the dihydrogen phosphate, the citrate), at least one molar equivalent and usually a molar excess of the acid is employed. However when such salts as the sulfate, the hemisuccinate, the hydrogen phosphate, or the phosphate are desired, the appropriate and exact chemical equivalents of acid will generally be used. The free base and the acid are usually combined in a co-solvent from which the desired salt precipitates, or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and\/or addition of a non-solvent.","In addition, the aldose reductase inhibitors that may be used in accordance with this invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or of said prodrugs, may occur as hydrates or solvates.

Cigarette Smoke Extract","1. Results","CSE caused a dose-dependent cell-death in SAEC that was 23, 26, 37 and 40% in 24 h at 12.5, 25, 50 and 75% concentration of CSE, respectively. The treatment of SAEC with fidarestat prevented CSE-induced cell death such that at 50% CSE>85% cells were alive and at 12.5% more than 95% cells were alive (). TNF-\u03b1-induced cell death in SAEC was used as a positive control.","Further, levels of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were measured in the SAEC culture media after 24 h of CSE (50%) treatment (). The levels of cytokines such as IL-1a and IL-8 increased by approximately 2-folds where as that of by approximately 10-folds and TNF-\u03b1 by 3-folds. All the changes were significantly (p<0.05 and 0.01) prevented by AR inhibition in SAEC (). Similarly, there was significant increase in the levels of chemokines such as G-CSF (\u02dc7-folds), MCP-1 (\u02dc15 folds), GM-CSF (\u02dc0.75 fold) and IP-10 (more than 30-folds) and growth factors such as TGF-\u03b1(3-folds) and VEGF (4-folds) and treatment with AR inhibitor prevented these changes by more than 50% ().","2. Materials and Methods","Selection of the Cells:","The airway epithelial cells, which are the point of first contact between the allergens and the respiratory system, plays an important function as a barrier to foreign particles including environmental gases and particles, cigarette smokes and other xenobiotics which disturb cellular redox homeostasis leading to changes in cell viability, morphology and physiology of airway epithelial cells resulting in COPD. Therefore we chose primary human small airway epithelial cells.","Cell Culture:","Primary human Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAEC) obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, Md.) were normal human SAEC harvested from distal airspace of 18 yrs old male donor. The cells were cultured according to the supplier's instructions at 37\u00b0 C. in humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% COin small airway epithelial basal medium (SABM) with supplements containing 52 \u03bcg\/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 ng\/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.5 \u03bcg\/ml epinephrine, 1 \u03bcg\/ml hydrocortisone, 10 \u03bcg\/ml transferrin, 5 \u03bcg\/ml insulin, 0.1 ng\/ml retinoic acid (RA), 6.5 ng\/ml triiodothyronine, 50 \u03bcg\/ml Gentamicin\/Amphotericin-B (GA-1000), and 50 \u03bcg\/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA).","Preparation of Cigarette Smoke Extract (CSE):","Research-grade cigarettes (1R3F) with a filter from the Kentucky Tobacco Research and Development Center at the University of Kentucky (Lexington, Ky.) were smoked to 0.5 cm above the filter in a fume hood, using a modification of the method developed by Carp and Janoff (1978; 118(3):617-621). CSE was prepared by bubbling smoke from 1 cigarette into 10 ml of serum-free media at a rate of 1 cm\/min and labeled as 100%. Various concentrations of CSE were prepared by diluting with media. The pH of the media was adjusted to 7.4 and the medium was sterile filtered with a 0.2-\u03bcm filter (Millipore). The CSE was always prepared fresh on the day of the experiment.","Cell Viability Assays:","The SAEC were plated at the density of 5000 cells\/well in a 96-well plate and growth-arrested for 24 h by replacing complete medium with fresh basal medium containing fidarestat (20 \u03bcM) or carrier. The cells were incubated with CSE (75, 50, 25, 12.5, 0%) for an additional 24 h with or without fidarestat, after which 10 \u03bcl of MTT (5 mg\/ml) was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for an additional 2 h.

The levels of cytokines and chemokines in the supernatant were determined by Milliplex MAP kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore Corporation, Bellerica, Mass.)).","Statistics:","Data presented as mean\u00b1SD and statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test using graph pad prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, Calif.). The value of P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.","B. Ragweed Pollen Extract","Stimulation with Ragweed pollens, allergens, growth factors, or cytokines cause increased ROS production inside the cells. The ROS could oxidize membrane lipids to form lipid aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), which readily reacts with glutathione and form GS-conjugates such as GS-HNE. AR catalyzes the reduction of GS-HNE into GS-1,4-dihydroxynonene (GS-DHN). The latter is known to activate various downstream protein kinases such as PKC, PI3K and MAPK activating transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1, which transcribes various inflammatory markers, including IL-13, which in paracrine fashion induces more ROS formation. The GS-DHN could also phosphorylate JAK-1 and MAPK such as ERK1\/2, eventually phosphorylating and activating STAT-6, which translocate to the nucleus and transcribe genes including mucin genes\u2014leading to goblet cell metaplasia. The continuously formed GS-DHN may amplify the signaling loop by increased ROS production via PKC\/NOX pathway. Inhibition of AR blocks the initial as well as the amplification loop and prevents ROS-induced pathological changes (Ramana et al. 281: 33019-33029, 2006; Tammali et al. Cancer Res 66: 9705-9713, 2006).","1. Results","AR Inhibition Prevents IL-13-Induced ROS Levels in SAEC:","Since cytokines-induced oxidative stress is known to mediate molecular signaling that leads to differentiation of airway epithelial cells into mucus cells, so we determined the effects of AR inhibition on IL-13-induced ROS levels in SAEC by two different methods. As shown in , stimulation with IL-13 caused approximately twofold increase in the ROS levels over the control and treatment of the cells with fidarestat significantly (80%) prevented the increase. These results suggest that cytokine-induced oxidative stress could be prevented by inhibition of AR.","AR Inhibition Prevents IL-13-Induced Goblet Cell Metaplasia in SAEC:","To investigate the role of AR in the regulation of goblet cells metaplasia and mucin production, the inventors used an air-liquid interface culture system that mimics in-vivo airway environment. First, the inventors cultured primary human airway epithelial cells on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane insert with collagen type-1 coating. The cells on the collagen-coated membrane insert formed a consistent 2-3 cells thick layer of airway cells. Further, the monolayer cells fully differentiated into ciliated cells when cultured on the ALI in EGF-containing medium for 11 days () and when these cells were stimulated with IL-13 for 48 h, the number of ciliated cells were markedly reduced as also determined by immunostaining using \u03b2-tubulin specific antibodies. However, AR inhibition by fidarestat preserved the ciliated morphology (). AR inhibitor alone had no toxic effects and the monolayers of ciliated cells were largely intact. As determined by PAS staining a large number of ciliated cells (\u02dc6-fold) transformed into mucus-laden goblet cells when stimulated with IL-13 for 48 h, whereas addition of AR inhibitor, fidarestat, in the medium prior to IL-13 challenge prevented the airway cells from differentiating into goblet cells (data not shown).","AR Inhibition Prevents IL-13-Induced Expression of Mucin and SPDEF in Airway Epithelial Monolayer:","Next, sections of monolayer cells were stained with antibodies against Muc5AC. As shown in , IL-13 stimulation resulted in a large number of Muc5AC immuno-positive cells. When the cells were treated with AR inhibitor and incubated with IL-13, the number of cells with Muc5AC positive staining decreased significantly (\u02dc70%) suggesting that only a few cells had transformed into goblet cells. Next, the inventors measured the level of secreted Muc5AC in the culture medium using an ELISA. There was a marked increase in the secretion of Muc5AC in the medium after IL-13 stimulation that was significantly (\u02dc80%) prevented by treatment with AR inhibitor (). These results suggest that AR regulates IL-13-mediated metaplasia and mucus production in the airway epithelial cells and inhibition of AR could prevent these events.","Next, the inventors examined whether Mucin levels in these cells were regulated by transcription or translation. As shown in , upper panel, Muc5AC-specific RNA expression increased by approximately 3-fold in IL-13-treated SAEC monolayer and fidarestat significantly prevented the increase. A number of studies have shown that SPDEF regulates the expression of several genes in the airway epithelial cells including both acidic and neutral mucins and cause goblet cell hyperplasia. The inventors therefore, determined the expression of SPDEF mRNA levels by RT-PCR in our cell-culture model and observed that IL-13 significantly enhanced the expression of SPDEF in epithelial cells, whereas control cells had only basal level of expression. When these cells were treated with AR inhibitor prior to IL-13 stimulus, the SPDEF mRNA levels decreased significantly (, lower panel).","Next the levels of Muc5AC and Muc5B proteins were measured by immunoblotting in SAEC monolayer after incubation with IL-13 for 24 and 48 h. Muc5AC\/B were not detectable after 24 h however, after 48 h of incubation with IL-13 there was a robust increase in the expression of protein levels (, top two panels), which was significantly (\u02dc75 and \u02dc50%, respectively) prevented in fidarestat treated cells. Also in the airway epithelial cell monolayer incubated with IL-13, the levels of SPDEF protein in the cells significantly increased after 24 h and further increased after 48 h and the increase was significantly (\u02dc50%) prevented by AR inhibitor treated cells (). The decrease in the levels of protein corresponded with the decrease in mRNA levels of SPDEF and Muc5AC\/B suggesting that SPDEF and Muc5AC genes are induced in the presence of IL-13, and that the expression of Muc5AC is prevented by AR inhibition at the level of transcription.","AR Inhibition Prevents IL-13-Induced Phosphorylation and Activation of Signaling Intermediates:","Since AR inhibition in airway epithelial cells monolayer on ALI successfully prevented the expression of transcription regulator SPDEF and subsequent expression of mucin, the effect of AR inhibition on the molecular mechanism(s) that regulates the expression of these mediators of asthma was studied. Cells grown on ALI were stimulated with IL-13 in presence or absence AR inhibitor and determined the phosphorylation of JAK1, ERK1\/2 and STAT-6 proteins. As shown in , IL-13 caused a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of STAT-6 and upstream mediators such as JAK1 and ERK1\/2. When these cells were treated with AR inhibitor prior to IL-13 stimulus, the phosphorylation of these proteins decreased significantly. Further, in cells treated with AR inhibitor alone the basal phosphorylation of JAK1 but not ERK1\/2 and STAT-6 was decreased. These results suggest that AR regulates the activation of key signaling intermediates involved in goblet cell metaplasia that transforms airway-ciliated epithelial cells to mucus secreting goblet cells.","AR Inhibition Prevents RWE-Induced Expression of IL-13 and Activation of STAT-6 in Mouse Lung:","Since Th2 cytokines, especially IL-13, is involved in the goblet cell metaplasia, the inventors examined the expression levels of IL-13 in mice lung after RWE challenge and found that its level increased approximately 6-fold compared to control and treatment with fidarestat prior to challenge prevented this increase (). To examine whether increased IL-13 levels coincided with the phosphorylation and activation of STAT-6, which play a major role in metaplasia, the mice were killed after 20 h of RWE challenge and performed immunofluorescence studies on the lung section using phospho-STAT-6 antibodies. It was observed that while the lungs of control mice showed only background, RWE-challenged mice lung epithelium showed a marked increased in the fluorescence intensity specific to phospho-STAT-6, which was prevented by AR inhibition (). The results were confirmed by DAB-based immunohistochemistry on the lung sections as well (). These results suggest that inhibition of AR could prevent the allergen-induced IL-13 expression and subsequent activation of STAT-6 in vivo.","AR Inhibition\/Deficiency Prevents RWE-Induced Goblet Cell Metaplasia in Mice Lung:","The inventors next examined the effect of AR inhibition on goblet cell metaplasia in RWE-sensitized and -challenged mice. After 72 h of challenge the lung sections were obtained and stained with PAS and changes in the airway epithelia were examined. As shown in , there was a significant increase in the PAS positive cells in the airway of RWE-challenged mice and absent in the lungs of mice treated with fidarestat prior to RWE challenge. Similar to the inhibitor-treated mice, AR-null mice challenged with RWE showed absence of PAS positive cell in the airway (). These results further confirm that AR plays a significant role in the goblet cell metaplasia and AR inhibition could prevent metaplasia in allergic asthma.","2.

The cells on the ALI were pre-treated with AR inhibitor, fidarestat (10 \u03bcM), for over-night from the basal side in differentiation medium without EGF beginning day 11 after establishment of ALI and stimulated with IL-13 by addition of recombinant human IL-13 (25 ng\/ml) to the medium for varying time periods as indicated.","Cell Fixation and Immunocytochemistry:","After the completion of incubation with IL-13, the apical surface of the cells was rinsed with PBS and cells were fixed in 10% z-fix, aqueous buffered-zinc formalin (Anatech Ltd; Battle Creek, Mich.), for 24 h at 4\u00b0 C. and embedded in paraffin. The 504 thin sections of the epithelial cell monolayer on the membrane insert were stained with H&E and periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-stain. The stained sections were analyzed and representative fields were photographed using a Photometrix CoolSNAP Fx camera mounted on a NIKON Eclipse TE 200 UV microscope. Antibodies against \u03b2-tubulin and Muc5AC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.) and matched control IgG were used for immunocytochemistry. Antibodies were detected using the Vector LSAB kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) as suggested by the manufacturer.","RT-PCR:","Total RNA was isolated from differentiated SAEC treated with IL-13 with or without AR inhibitor by using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as per supplier's instructions. Aliquots of RNA (1.0 \u03bcg) isolated from each sample were reverse-transcribed with Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase one-step RT-PCR system with HotStar Taq DNApolymerase (Qiagen) at 55\u00b0 C. for 30 min followed by PCR amplification. The oligonucleotide primer sequences were as follows: Muc5AC: 5\u2032-TCCGGCCTCATCTTCTCC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:1) (sense) and 5\u2032-ACTTGGGCACTGGTGCTG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:2) (Antisense); SPDEF: 5\u2032-CGAAGTGCTCAAGGACATCGAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:3) (sense) and 5\u2032-CGGTATTGGTGCTCTGTCCACA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:4) (anti-sense) and GAPDH: 5\u2032-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTCAAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:5) (sense) and 5\u2032-CATACCAGGAAATGAGCTTG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:6) (antisense). RT-PCR reaction was carried out in a PCR Sprint thermal cycler (Thermo electron corporation, Milford, Mass.) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0 C. for 15 min followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0 C. for 1 min, 60\u00b0 C. for 1 min, 72\u00b0 C. for 1 min, followed by 72\u00b0 C. for 10 min for final extension. The RT-PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose-1\u00d7TAE gels containing 0.5 m\/ml ethidium bromide. The densitometry analysis of the gel was performed using NIH image analysis software.","Western Blot Analysis:","Subsequent to incubations, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. The cell lysates were pooled and cleared by centrifugation. Protein levels were determined using Bradford reagent (Biorad, Hercules, Calif.). Forty micrograms of protein were mixed with sample buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electro transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST, and probed with antibodies against phospho-ERK1\/2, ERK1\/2, phospho-STAT-6, STAT-6, Muc5AC, Muc5B, and SPDEF for overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The blots were then washed, exposed to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution) for 1 h, and the antigen-antibody complex was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J., USA). The membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against GAPDH to depict loading control. Densitometry was performed by biospectrum 410 image system from Ultra Violate Products Ltd. (Cambridge, UK).","Muc5AC ELISA:","Muc5AC levels in the culture medium were assessed by ELISA using commercially available human anti-Muc5AC ELISA essentially as described by the manufacturer (Cosmo Bio USA; Carlsbad, Calif.).","Sensitization and Challenge of Animals:","Wild type C57BL\/6 and Balb\/cJ mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (San Diego, Calif., USA) and AR null mice on C57BL\/6 background were bread by us at Animal resource center, UTMB, Galveston, Tex. Six-eight weeks old female mice were sensitized with RWE as previously described (Hwang et al., FASEB J. 19: 795-797, 2005). Briefly, mice were sensitized with two intraperitoneal administrations of 100 \u03bcl of endotoxin-free RWE (150 \u03bcg) combined with Alum adjuvant (1 mg) in a 3:1 ratio (v\/v), on days 0 and 4. On day 11, mice (n=6) were challenged intranasally with RWE (100 \u03bcg). A parallel group of mice received fidarestat (7 mg\/kg body wt\/day) in drinking water from one day before the challenge. Control groups of mice were challenged with equivalent volumes of PBS. The animals were euthanized at different time points as mentioned, with ketamine (135 mg\/kg body wt) and xylazine (15 mg\/kg body wt), the lungs were perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned to 5 \u03bcm. Lung sections were stained with PAS and the representative fields were observed and photographed with a Photometrix CoolSNAP Fx camera mounted on a NIKON Eclipse TE 200 UV microscope.","Determination of IL-13 in Mice Lungs:","The mice lungs were harvested 16 h after RWE-challenge and total RNA was isolated. From each sample, one microgram of total RNA was transcribed into first-strand cDNA and quantitative RT-PCR was conducted using IL-13 specific forward and reverse primers 5\u2032AGACCAGACTCCCCTGTGCA (SEQ ID NO:7), 3\u2032TGGGTCCTGTAGATGGCATTG (SEQ ID NO:8); GAPDH specific primers (5\u2032TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA (SEQ ID NO:9), 3\u2032CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGAT (SEQ ID NO:10)) were used as housekeeping gene (HKG) control. Data were collected and analyzed by ABI 7000 System equipment and software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). To assess expression levels, delta-delta Ct method (\u0394\u0394C) was used. Values of expression in fold increase (ratio of control) were calculated using the formula for relative expression by the method of Delta Delta C(\u0394\u0394C): F=2, F=fold change (ratio of control), \u2212\u0394\u0394C=(CTarget\u2212CT)x\u2212(CTarget-C. Time x is any time point. Time 0 represents 1 x expression of the target gene normalized to a HGK.","Detection of STAT-6 Phosphorylation in Mouse Lungs:","Approximately 20 h after RWE-challenge, mice are killed, and their lungs perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and 5 \u03bcm sections were obtained. The sections were immunostained with p-STAT-6 specific primary antibodies followed by probing with either FITC labeled secondary antibodies and mounted with fluorosave medium with DAPI or DAB-based HRP-conjugated antibodies from Vector LSAB kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Photomicrographs were acquired by a Photometrix CoolSNAP Fx camera mounted on a NIKON Eclipse TE 200 UV microscope using fluorescence or bright-field microscopy, respectively.","Statistics:","Data presented as mean\u00b1SE and statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test using graph pad prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.
