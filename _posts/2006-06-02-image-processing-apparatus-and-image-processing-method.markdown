A main cause of this is that a color gamut of the monitor and a color gamut of the printer are different.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"]},"Therefore, in order to contemplate the perceptual identity of displayed color images between such display media having different color gamuts, a technique for having one color gamut correspond to another color gamut in a uniform color specification system is required. Actually, in order to fit one color gamut into another color reproduction range, its color space is compressed. This color space compression is referred to as \u201cGamut Mapping\u201d, and a gamut mapping method for realizing this is referred to as \u201cGamut Mapping Algorithm (GMA)\u201d.","For GMA, various methods have been designed, such as a method for mapping of a color reproduction in a state where a chroma is maintained as shown in , a method for mapping of the color reproduction with a lightness being maintained as shown in , and the like.","<Color Matching with an ICC (International Color Consortium) Profile>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"For processes of the GMA, there are three types of processes: Perceptual generally for outputting a photo-image, in which maintaining a relationship of tones is prioritized over a precise color reproduction of the image, Colorimetric for reproducing a logo and the like faithfully, and Saturation intended to maintain a bright impression of the original color without a high regard for a hue precision for vibrantly outputting a pie chart or characters. For color matching data for implementing these three types of methods, in an example of a printer profile as shown in , a transformation LUT (Look Up Table) from Lab to printer CMYK is prepared for each method of these three types, and the LUT corresponding to the GMA information which has been set is selected to be used for the color matching.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["301","302","301","310","311","312","313","312","314","302","315","313","316","311","316","317"]},"Moreover, the printer engine  is configured with a communication I\/F unit  for exchanging the data with the front-end server , and an output unit  for performing a print.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["311","1","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["301","302","301","310","501","312","502","316","311","503"]},"Next, the PDL interpreter unit  generates the intermediate data from the PDL data including the color data on which the GMA process has been performed at the color management processing unit , and stores the intermediate data in the intermediate data storage unit  (S) Next, the rendering unit  expands the intermediate data in the intermediate data storage unit  into the bitmap image data, and stores the bitmap image data in the bitmap storage unit  (S). Then the bitmap image data is transformed into the printer CMYK (S). Finally, the expanded bitmap image data is transferred to the printer engine  via the communication I\/F unit , and the print is performed by the output unit  of the printer engine  (S).","In this way, conventionally since the GMA process is performed prior to the rendering, there has been a characteristic in which the color space of the rendering is the color space (within the color reproduction) of the device (printer).","Here using , details of the GMA process With respect to the color data of the object in the PDL data at S as shown in  will be described.  is a flowchart showing the details of the GMA process with respect to the color data of the object in the PDL data.","First, it is determined whether the object attribute in the PDL data is an image or not (S). If the object attribute is an image, the GMA information selected for the image is set to a Flag (S), and the GMA process is performed (S). Moreover, if the object attribute is not an image but vector graphics (YES at S), the GMA information selected for vector graphics is set to the Flag (S), and the GMA process is performed (S).","On the contrary, if the object attribute is not an image or vector graphics but text (YES at S), the GMA information selected for the text is set to the Flag (S), and the GMA process is performed (S). While the object exists (YES at S), the above described process is repeated, and when there is not any object to be processed (NO at S), this process is terminated.","Here using , the details of the GMA process at S, S and S as shown in  will be described.  is a flowchart showing the details of the GMA process.","First, the source profile selected now is extracted (S), and the destination profile is extracted (S). Next, the type of GMA selected now (any one of the above described Perceptual, Colorimetric and Saturation) is set to a Rendering intent flag (S). Then the source profile and the destination profile, as well as the Rendering intent flag which has been set with the type of GMA, are set to the CMM (S), and the color matching process of the CMM is performed (S).","<Description of the Color Matching Process>","A conventional color management system of color image data (for example, U.S. Pat.

Here, the transformation parameter indicates the storage location in which the color transformation sequence created by the transformation sequence creation module  is arranged. The input image data is color image data transformed with the color transformation sequence corresponding to the transformation parameter by the user. The output image data is the color image data which has been transformed with the color transformation sequence based on the transformation parameter.","In this way, the user utilizes the transformation sequence creation module  to generate the color transformation sequence based on the profile list and the GMA list, applies the color transformation sequence to the input image data , and creates the output image data  through the color transformation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["830","830","830","1","801","840"]},"It should be noted that the color profile  representatively relates to a particular image device such as the printer, a scanner, the monitor, a digital camera and the like.

First, the color appearance transformation  is used to transform the color image data from a device color space corresponding to the device to which the color profile  relates, into a device-independent color space. Also, the color appearance transformation  is used to inversely transform the color image data from the device-independent color space into a device-dependent color space.","Next, the color gamut boundary descriptor  is used to define a color gamut boundary of a color image device to which the color profile  corresponds. Thereby it is possible to map the color image data so that the color image data after mapping does not go out of the reproducible color gamut boundary of the color image device providing the mapped color image data by the gamut mapping. As a result, it is possible to render the color image data appropriately with the image device related to the color profile .","Next, the linearization table  includes one or more linearization tables, which are utilized between the color appearance transformation and a gamut mapping transformation, in order to access the color appearance transformation  and the color gamut boundary descriptor  respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1110","1120","910","1110","1","1111","1112","1110"]},"It should be noted that the color profile reference ()  to the color profile reference (N)  correspond to the individual color profile as shown in .","The GMA list  has a plurality of reference entries including a GMA reference selected by the user, such as a GMA reference ()  to a GMA reference (N) .","The transformation sequence creation module  acquires the color appearance transformation  and the linearization table  from the color profiles  of the color profile references  to .

In this way, the profile step () includes the data required for mapping the color image data into the device-independent color space, and for mapping the color image data from the device-independent color space.","It should be noted that the profile step () does not necessarily use all the above described transformations and tables. For example, the input image data from the monitor is transformed from CIE XYZ space into CIE JCh space, using the first pair of one-dimensional look up tables followed by the 3\u00d73 matrix, and the color space transformation, and other steps are not performed. On the contrary, on outputting the color image data to the monitor, the color space transformation for transforming from the JCh color space into the XYZ color space would be used, subsequently the 3\u00d73 matrix would be used, and furthermore the second pair of one-dimensional look up tables would be used.","A transformation step bit field  configures a mechanism for indicating which is specified and required among the above described elements by the profile step ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1130","910","1301","1310","840","1120"]},"It should be noted that the GMA pointer  may identify a specific type of GMA by use of another appropriate means such as identifying the GMA with its name.

The SVG, which is an abbreviation of Scalable Vector Graphic, is a standard for describing a two-dimensional graphic in an XML format. Moreover, the SVG is a drawing method for dealing with graphics as numerical data for representing lines or curves, instead of as a collection of dots, and stores the image as coordinates of the lines and a collection of angles and directions. For that purpose, the drawn graphics may be freely processed such as movement, inversion, enlargement, reduction and the like, and also have small data capacity.","In the SVG, there are three types of objects: an image, a vector graphic and a text. The SVG is an advanced application, and it is possible to use the SVG to utilize rich and graphical functions. As representative of the functions, an \u03b1 blending and a gradation are cited.","The \u03b1 blending is a technique which is also known as a translucent copy. This process performs an operation by adding two color values in the color space in which the rendering is performed, depending on an a value (opacity). Assuming that a basic expression has the RGB as an \u03b1 blending result, RGB1 as a transferring RGB, RGB2 as a transferred RGB, and an \u03b1 as the \u03b1 value (0.0-1.0) results in the following expression:\n\n12*(1\u2212\u03b1).\n","On the other hand, the gradation performs an operation in which a linear interpolation is discretely performed between the two color values in the color space in which the rendering is performed.","The following processes are performed in a case where a web designer performs a web design on the monitor using the \u03b1 blending function of the above described SVG. First, the \u03b1 blending function is implemented in a rendering color space (for example, a RGB color space such as the sRGB) specified in an operating system (OS), and then the RGB data of that rendering color space would be color-matching transformed into monitor RGB to be displayed.","In other words, after the process of \u03b1 blending is performed in a device-independent rendering color space (SRGB), the data is transformed into a monitor RGB color space which is the device color space.","However, in the color matching by means of the above described conventional ICC profile as described above, since it is not possible to perform the matching based on color space information of the input device, and the process is to be uniformly performed even if input color data comes from the device of whatever color gamut (the input color data is transformed into Jch or L*a*b* of CIE and the color matching is performed), there has been a limit in improving color matching accuracy.","Moreover, on applying the color matching by means of the ICC profile to the PDL data and outputting it to the printer, as shown in , rendering processing of the \u03b1 blending  is generally performed by performing gamut mapping  (first processing) to the color gamut of the output device and then by performing processing (second processing) for obtaining color after the \u03b1 blending. However, it is not easy to replace \u03b1 blending data of application software by \u03b1 blending function of PDL because of data structure in comparison with SVG, whether the PDL has \u03b1 blending function or not. It should be noted that it is easy to look for \u03b1 blending objects because the SVG is described by XML and is structured data (tree structure and tag). Therefore, utilizing the \u03b1 blending function of PDL was less than the SVG. Accordingly, it does not become something of a problem because performing the first processing and the second processing is not the rule.","However, in the case where the \u03b1 blending function is more commonly used for web design, such as the above described SVG, if the gamut mapping is performed before the rendering, a problem occurs in which appearance would be different between the monitor display and the printer output at a portion of the \u03b1 blending.","The present invention is made in order to solve the above described problems, and it is an object of the present invention to realize preferred color reproducibility when a rendering and color space compression (gamut mapping) are performed for objects described by a description language.","In order to attain the above described object, according to an embodiment of the present invention, an image processing apparatus comprising: rendering means for performing a rendering of objects described by description language into bitmap data; and color space compression means for performing, in a color reproduction range, color space compression of the bitmap data in which the rendering has been performed is provided.","Moreover, according to an embodiment of the present invention, an image processing method comprising: a rendering step of performing a rendering of objects described by description language into bitmap data; and a color space compression step of performing, in a color reproduction range, color space compression of the bitmap data in which the rendering has been performed is provided.","Other objects of the present invention will be apparent with the following drawings and a detailed description described below.","Hereinafter, the best embodiment for practicing the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.","It should be noted that, in the embodiment, a new color matching process is incorporated in a print process instead of a color matching process by means of an ICC profile.

device, a reader, the printer and the like), or applied to an apparatus consisting of one device (for example, a copying machine, a facsimile machine and the like).","Moreover, of course, the object of the present invention is also attained by supplying a recording medium having recorded thereon a program code of software for realizing the functions of the above described embodiment, to the system or the apparatus, and reading and executing the program code stored on the recording medium by the computer (a CPU or an MPU) of the system or the apparatus.","In this case, the program code itself read from the recording medium would realize the functions of the above described embodiment, and the recording medium having recorded thereon the program code would configure the present invention.","For the recording medium for supplying this program code, for example, it is possible to use a floppy\u00ae disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magneto optical disk, a CD-ROM, a CD-R, a magnetic tape, a non-volatile memory card, a ROM and the like.","Moreover, of course, not only the case where the functions of the above described embodiment are realized by executing the read program code by the computer, but also the case is included where an operating system (OS) operating on the computer or the like performs some or all of actual processes based on instructions of the program code and the functions of the above described embodiment are realized by the processes.","Furthermore, of course, the case is also included where, after the program code read from the recording medium is written into a function expansion board inserted into the computer or a memory provided on a function expansion unit connected to the computer, the CPU or the like provided on the function expansion board or the function expansion unit performs some or all of actual processes based on the instructions of the program code and the functions of the above described embodiment are realized by the processes.","According to the present invention, it is possible to match the color gamuts of the input and output devices with respect to the overlapping portion of the objects having different colors.","Although the present invention has been described above with preferred examples, the present invention is not limited to the above described examples, and various modifications are possible within the scope of the claims.","This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-167349 filed on Jun. 7, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG.
