{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to methods, techniques, and systems for providing sentiment analysis and, in particular, to methods, techniques, and systems for providing sentiment analysis using natural language processing to determine sentiment of objects in a corpus.","Every minute of every day people express their sentiments and write them down in news articles, blog posts, other web content, and the like. Some people may regard themselves as too famous to write down their sentiments, but journalists, bloggers and other content creators are more than willing to document their feelings. Often times a famous radio commentator will bash a politician, or a politician will thrash a Hollywood actress. On occasion, a true act of heroism will be recognized, and all sorts of famous folk will follow with praise. Whether depressing or uplifting, disturbing or unnerving, tapping in to the sentiments of key actors on the world stage can be highly informative and engaging.","Determining the underlying sentiment of an article using a computing system may be difficult because of the variety of styles people employ in expressing sentiment\u2014a comment may be an offhanded compliment in amongst an otherwise negative article, for example. Current techniques often involve traditional keyword searching for particular negative or positive words (verbs) such as \u201chate,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d \u201cdistaste,\u201d etc. to guesstimate the underlying sentiment of an article.","The headings employed herein are used to assist in the presentation and organization of the material and are not to be used to limit the scope of the described techniques.","A. Overview","Embodiments described herein provide enhanced computer- and network-based methods, techniques, and systems for providing sentiment analysis and for presenting the results of such analysis. Example embodiments provide a Sentiment Analysis System (\u201cSAS\u201d), which provides tools to enable authors, programmers, users, developers, and the like to incorporate sentiment analysis into their content, such as into their web pages, and other web blogs or textual content. In some embodiments such tools are provided in the form of an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d). In other embodiments, such tools are provided in the form of an \u201cready-made\u201d Sentiment Widget, which is programmed to analyze sentiment for a particular topic, entity, or facet (e.g., characteristic of an entity). Other embodiments provide other mechanisms and examples of user interfaces which incorporate the techniques of the SAS and deliver information via NLP-based sentiment analysis to a consumer of such results.","The SAS works to understand the sentiments, or positive and negative expressions by and about entities. Many types of applications can be built using the sentiment API in areas including, but not limited to: market intelligence, market research, sports and entertainment, brand management, product reviews and more. For example, using the sentiment API, one can:","Find the percentage of positive and negative expressions of sentiment made by an entity, or about an entity. For example, one can find out what percentage of things being written about the iPhone are positive and which percent are negative.","Discover who is criticizing and who is praising a particular person, place or thing. For example, see who is criticizing and praising IBM right now.","Read what praisers and critics are saying about an entity. For example, see what the GOP are saying about the Democrats.","Discover who or what your favorite entity is bashing and why. For example, see who Lance Armstrong is complaining about.","Discover who or what your favorite entity is praising and why. For example, see who the World Health Organization is commending and why.","The SAS uses natural language based processing techniques, such as parts of speech tagging and relationship searching, to identify sentence components such as subjects, verbs, and objects, and to disambiguate and identify entities so that the SAS can recognize whether the underlying relationships (e.g., between subjects, verbs, and objects) in the content are expressed in a negative or positive sentiment. Example relationship searching technology, which uses natural language processing to determine relationships between subjects and objects in ingested content, is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,526,425, issued on Apr. 28, 2009, and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR EXTENDING KEYWORD SEARCHING FOR SYNTACTICALLY AND SEMANTICALLY ANNOTATED DATA,\u201d and entity recognition and disambiguation technology is described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/288,158, filed Oct. 15, 2008, and entitled \u201cNLP-BASED ENTITY RECOGNITION AND DISAMBIGUATION,\u201d both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. As explained therein, relationship searching uses queries which attempt to understand the underlying content through the use of natural language processing and to recognize and understand the various relationships between entities (e.g., persons, locations, things, events, and the like) using syntactic and semantic analysis of the underlying content. The use of relationship searching, enables the SAS to establish second order (or greater order) relationships between entities and to store such information.","Although the example embodiments described below utilize the EVRI\u2122 relationship searching described in the above listed references to achieve more robust and precise sentiment analysis, other natural language systems and Boolean keyword matching systems may be used to identify content of a particular sentiment, which can then be integrated into the user interface and presentation tools of an SAS as described further herein.","In addition, as used herein, entities are generally identifiable people, places or things, such as people, locations, organizations, products, events, and the like. Facets are generally more finely granular characteristics of entities such as categories, types, and\/or characteristics of certain entities such as actor, politician, nation, drug, automobile, and the like. Topics are subjects of interest that may involve a group of entities and\/or facets. Any hierarchy or non-hierarchical division of the subjects (e.g., nouns and modifiers) and objects (e.g., nouns and modifiers) searched for in content may be used.","In one example embodiment, the Sentiment Analysis System comprises one or more functional components\/modules that work together to provide sentiment analysis of a set of content stored in, for example, a corpus of documents. For example, a SAS may comprise an analysis engine, an API, and example user interface tools such as real time updated widgets that are embeddable in other content (for example, a third party website). The sentiment analysis engine is responsible for determining and categorizing the various relations (e.g., S-A-O triplets, or other forms) in the underlying content according to their sentiment. Different embodiments of the sentiment analysis engine may use different techniques for discovery of sentiment, for example, relationship searching using particular verbs, phrases, and heuristics, and\/or modifications of same incorporating machine learning techniques. Example implementations of the sentiment analysis engine are discussed further below.","The sentiment analysis API (application programming interface) provides a programmatic interface to the capabilities of the sentiment analysis engine to uncover sentiment from underlying content. The API may provide different forms of the results of analyzing and categorizing the content such as in summary form or with specific details. For example, EVRI\u2122 currently supports an API adhering to a REST interface (a REST API) that is found on www.evri.com\/developer in the Reference API Specification and the descriptions of the various available functions. With the EVRI API, a developer or other would be consumer of relationship query data can automatically, cost effectively and in a fully scalable manner: analyze text, get recommendations, discover relationships, mine facts and get popularity data. A particular REST API, the GetSentiment API, is provided to query and organize content according to positive and negative sentiment. A full description of this \u201cGET sentiment\u201d API is provided below in Section D, \u201cExample Sentiment API Specification.\u201d The GET sentiment API offers summary data of content sentiment as well as particular details of sentiment data according to a specified source of the sentiment, type of sentiment, and\/or subject (target) of the sentiment. Other API can similarly be incorporated into the SAS to provide the sentiment data, which can then be displayed with the user interface tools of the SAS.","Example user interface tools (or widgets) are shown in  and in . These widgets can be built, for example, using the API described below in Section D, \u201cExample Sentiment API Specification.\u201d  illustrate a widget externally configured to be about the entity Barack Obama corresponding to the EVRI URI: \/person\/barack-obama-0x16f69 (a particular entity ID).","B.

For example, as illustrated in , more detail on the positive sentiments about \u201canything\u201d is shown to the right of the positive and negative entity columns. These results can be obtained by calling and executing the following REST API request, for example, using the SAS API:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/v1\/sentiment\/about?sentimentSource=\/person\/"]},{"entry":[{},"barack-obama-0x16f69&sentimentType=positive&sort=date"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The API call results also provide a specific snippet from the article, as well as a time stamp, the article title, and a link off to the source article for each result having sentiment that corresponds to the input specification.

It is built on top of the EVRI subject\/verb\/object style data extraction (using EVRI relationship searching), and can easily be extended to other verbs, or actions, such as: LoveMachine, HateMachine, KillMachine, etc. In each case, the equivalent of \u201cattackers\u201d and \u201cvictims\u201d are present. For example, for LoveMachine, the source\/targets of the verb love are \u201cThe lover\u201d and \u201cThe loved\u201d.","Other applications, interfaces, tools, and widgets can be developed using the SAS API, and equivalents that interface to the Sentiment Analysis Engine capabilities.","As mentioned above, the SAS provides a sentiment analysis engine to classify and discover sentiment in content, such as from a corpus of articles. In one embodiment, the sentiment analysis engine uses a determined list of verbs or sentiment phrases in sentiment queries against the content to derive sentiment. These lists may be pre-formulated or provided by means of an external storage so that they can be defined somewhat automatically or dynamically at runtime, or through some combination of both. Certain post filtering activities may also be incorporated, such as to compare the title of a corresponding article where a relationship having sentiment is found with a relationship found therein, to make sure the title the sentiment doesn't indicate that the relationship is a backhanded compliment or criticism or sarcastic. An example of using this technique for uncovering sentiment is discussed with reference to  in regard to the implementation of the example vibology meter widget of .","In other embodiments, machine learning techniques can be incorporated to derive the sentiment verbs and phrases that are searched for in the relationship queries.

Other approaches as they are developed can similarly be incorporated.","Example embodiments described herein provide applications, tools, data structures and other support to implement a Sentiment Analysis System to be used for presenting sentiment of certain content. Other embodiments of the described techniques may be used for other purposes, including for marketing or intelligence information, branding, advertising, and the like. Also, although described primarily with respect to textual content, the techniques described herein can be extrapolated to address visual content, or combined text and visual content, for example, when meta data labeling the visual content can be similarly mined for sentiment information. For example, in some cases the title of a picture may indicate that the picture contains positive or negative sentiment. Also, although certain terms are used primarily herein, other terms could be used interchangeably to yield equivalent embodiments and examples. In addition, terms may have alternate spellings which may or may not be explicitly mentioned, and all such variations of terms are intended to be included.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as data formats and code sequences, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the described techniques.

The source and subject may be an entity or facet. Either the source or subject may not be specified, indicating \u201canything\u201d is an acceptable value. For example, source=Barack Obama, sentimentType=\u201cnegative\u201d, and subject=\u201canything\u201d will return a list of sentiments made up of a snippet, an article title, link to the article, and a date for the article where Barack Obama is mentioning a negative sentiment about anything. If the subject is AIG, then sentiments with Obama mentioning something negative about AIG will be returned.","The explicit feedback mechanism enables a user to rank the quality of each returned result by selecting one of the following options: \u201cvery poor\u201d, \u201cpoor\u201d, \u201caverage\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cgreat.\u201d Users will be provided these options for both use cases shown above.
