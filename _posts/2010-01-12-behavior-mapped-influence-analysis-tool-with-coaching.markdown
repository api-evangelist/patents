title: Behavior mapped influence analysis tool with coaching
abstract: An analysis tool guides the selection of an external agent who will interact with a selected organizational actor. The analysis tool helps to minimize mismatches in personality and behavior between the external agents and actors in the business. The analysis tool also coaches deal external agents on how to successfully interact with the selected organizational actor. As a result, there are fewer misunderstandings about project scope and requirements, there is better communication between individuals, and valuable deals are more frequently closed.

No. 61\/144,636, filed Jan. 14, 2009 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/184,210, filed Jun. 4, 2009. This application is a Continuation in Part Application of application Ser. No. 12\/478,546, filed Jun. 4, 2009. Each of the applications noted above is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to analyzing and leveraging the influence and behavior of actors within an organization, particularly as it relates to understanding, preparing for and influencing an organization's decision, selecting the most effective external agents to engage the actors and coaching those external agents in behaviors to which the actors will be open.","2. Related Art","Modern organizations interact extensively with independent external agents. One example of such an external agent is a consulting company that assembles a deal team to work with the organization to propose, plan, and (ideally) win and implement a project. Regardless of the role that the external agents play, there is typically extensive interaction between many external agents and many actors from the organization. The interaction continues throughout the lifetime of a deal as the external agent and the organization work all aspects of the deal toward a mutually agreeable conclusion.","In the past, little guidance was available to help determine which deal team member or other external agent should interact with or build a relationship with specific actors in the organization and the best behavior that can help do that. Choosing the wrong external agent often led to an inability to effectively communicate with the right actors who influence other organizational actors in making decisions, misunderstandings about project scope and requirements, and, ultimately, failure to close and\/or complete delivery of valuable deals. Therefore, a need exists to address the problems noted above and others previously experienced.","An analysis tool helps determine which external agent should interact with which actor in the organization and understand which actor influences which actor and in what way. The analysis tool helps to understand and leverage the influence relationships that exist in the organization and to use that understanding to minimize mismatches in behavior between the external agents and the organizational actors. As a result, there are fewer misunderstandings about project scope and requirements, there is better communication between individuals, and valuable deals are more frequently closed and\/or brought to a mutually agreeable conclusion.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","100","104","106","108","110","112","114"]},"The individuals identified in  are examples of actors within an organization. The actors may assume virtually any role related to a specific deal, such as approver, recommender, or influencer, and may fill virtually any position in the organization, from chief executive officer to part-time project assistant. Symbols of various shapes, sizes, and designs may be used to distinguish between positions, importance, decision-making authority, or other characteristics of the roles of actors within the company.","The core influence mapping  further shows how the actors in the organization influence one another. More specifically, the core influence mapping  includes actor influence specifiers selectively connecting the actors to show how one actor influence as another, if at all. For example, the arc  shows that Jim directly influences Holly's decisions.  also shows that John has two paths of influence to Holly: first, directly to Holly as shown by the arc , and second, and indirectly to Holly through Stephanie, as shown by the arcs  and . Actor influence specifiers of various shapes, sizes, and designs may be used to distinguish various levels or strengths of influence between actors in the organization.","Additionally, directional indicators may be used to note if an influence is a positive, negative, or neutral influence. Negative influences may arise because, as examples, two people simply do not like each other, because an organizational actor does not like the external agent, or for other reasons.  shows an example of a positive internal directional indicator  and a negative internal directional indicator . The internal indicators illustrate positive, negative, or neutral influence between organizational actors. , described below, gives further examples, as well as examples of another type of directional indicator: an external directional indicator. The external directional indicator captures positive, negative, or neutral influence between organizational actors and an external agent (e.g., Consulting Corp. or Dave Smith of Consulting Corp.) or a competitor to the external agent. For example, Claire may have a positive relationship with Consulting Corp, making her a more attractive target to match with an external agent from Consulting Corp. for ultimately influencing Stephanie. The tool described below may take directional indicators into account when selecting a compatible external agent to interact with an organizational actor. It is noted that an external agent may not only refer to a company (e.g., Consulting Corp.), but also may refer to individuals (e.g., specific employees of Consulting Corp.) or other entities that may work with the organization.","The core influence mapping  helps to identify the actors within an organization and understand how the actors influence one another. The core influence mapping  may, of course, be adapted to map any selected organization and any selected actors within the selected organization. However, the core influence mapping  does not help determine which external agents should interact with the actors in the organization. Accordingly, the behavior mapped influence analysis tool (\u201ctool\u201d), described in more detail below, transforms the core influence mapping  into a behavior influence mapping  which does effectively assist with determining which external agents should interact with the organizational actors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","100","200","202","206","202"]},"The behavior specifiers may indicate any predetermined selection of behavioral type. In one implementation, the permissible behavioral types are those present in the behavior model . The behavior model  includes an \u2018Analytic\u2019 behavior , which indicates fact driven and logical analysis; \u2018Driver\u2019 behavior , which indicates a result oriented practical approach to problems; \u2018Amiable\u2019 behavior , which indicates relationship oriented behavior; and \u2018Expressive\u2019 behavior , which indicates a spontaneous and impulsive type of behavior. The permissible behavior types may thereby be determined according to and follow the Social Style Model\u2122 representation of behavior in the suite of products and services available from the TRACOM Group\u2122 company. However, the behavior model  may instead employ any other framework for identifying behavior. An example of a suitable framework is a behavioral analysis framework that aids people to better understand and work with others, for example by identifying, classifying, or understanding decision-making and control needs and identifying the behavior that people exhibit when interacting with others.","The arrangement of behaviors in the behavior model  helps to reveal whether certain types of behaviors are suited to interacting with other types of behaviors. Often, opposite behaviors are not good matches for interaction. Thus, for example, a person exhibiting analytic behavior tends to be a poor match for someone exhibiting expressive behavior. However, individuals exhibiting the same behavior tend to be well matched and are preferential choices for building relationships. Finally, individuals with adjacent behaviors are typically able to interact in a productive or otherwise successful manner. Thus, for example, a first person exhibiting amiable behavior is typically able to successfully interact with a second person exhibiting analytic or expressive behavior. However, the determination to match people with adjacent behaviors may be a secondary or subordinate choice compared to matching people with the same behavior. Though there may be differences in behavior, versatility (described in detail below) can sometimes overcome those differences. In other words, versatile behavior diverse individuals can in many cases successfully work together.","The tool assists with the generation of the behavior influence mapping . To that end, the tool may initial generate a user interface  that initially displays a rendering of the core influence mapping . The tool may then accept operator input to tag any selected organizational actor with a behavior.","In the example shown in , the operator has provided a selection input (e.g., a mouse click, voice command, keystroke, or other input) specifying Jim as the selected actor to tag with behavior information. In response to the selection input, the behavior influence mapping tool displays a behavior list . The tool populates the behavior list  with the permissible behavior tags for the selected actor. The operator selects a permissible behavior tag for the selected actor from the behavior list . The list  may be a drop-down list, radio button set, text entry box, or any other type of selection or data entry mechanism.","Continuing the example, in response to operator behavior selections from the list , the tool has tagged Jim with \u2018Amiable\u2019 behavior by creating the behavior specifier . The behavior influence mapping tool also creates the behavior link  to connect Jim with the behavior specifier . The behavior links may be implemented in many different ways, such as a pointer from (or to) a record containing previously stored information (e.g., identifier and influence specifiers) about a selected actor to (or from) a record containing the behavior and versatility specifiers. As another example, the behavior link may be formed by storing behavior specifiers in a database record containing the previously stored information about the selected actor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","702","704","706","708"]},"Thus, the mapping  tracks multiple types of influences that the tool may analyze when determining a compatible external agent to select for interaction with an organizational actor. Suppose, for example that Sally needs to be influenced because of her role as an Approver. Sally has a \u22121 external directional indicator toward the external agent and a +2 external directional indicator toward the external agent's competitor. Therefore, it may be difficult to directly influence Sally in favor of Consulting Corp. However, David has a +3 external directional indicator toward the external agent and a positive internal indicator toward Christy, who in turn can strongly influence Sally. Therefore, David may be a good choice for assignment to a specific compatible person from the external agent in an attempt to influence Sally, through Christy, in favor of the external agent.","In addition to determining a compatible external agent for any given organizational actor, the tool may also analyze the behavior influence mapping, including the external directional indicators, to assist in determining which organizational actor to target for a match to a given external agent. For example, the tool may first look for organizational actors to match who have the most positive external directional indicators, or the least negative competitor external directional indicators. The tool may further search the behavior influence mapping to find who has positive internal relationship paths to an ultimate decision maker that needs to be influenced (e.g., an organizational actor with an Approver role). Graph searching or other algorithms may perform this analysis, with the organizational actors and their roles forming nodes in the graph, and the internal directional indicators forming edges between nodes, with elements of the graph weighted by the strength of internal or external directional indicators.","With regard to determining compatibility with an external agent, the tool may increase or decrease compatibility in relation to increased or decreased external directional indicator strength for the external agent. The tool may further increase or decrease compatibility in relation to decreased or increased external directional indicator strength for the competitor. In other words, the tool may give preference to matches to those organizational actors who view the external agent most favorably, and\/or who view the competitor least favorably. However, the tool may also match an external agent to an organizational actor who is not favorable toward the external agent. The tool may make such a match when it is important to focus on organizational actors who need to be persuaded, in contrast to those who already value the organization actor or their offer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","302","304","116"]},"The mapping program also defines in computer readable memory an electronic representation of the core influence mapping (). In other words, the mapping tool stores a representation of the core influence mapping  in memory. The data for the representation stored in memory may include the actor identifiers, the actor influence specifiers, or other data that encodes entities or relationships in the core influence mapping . The mapping program generates on a user interface a rendering of the core influence mapping  (). As shown in , the core influence mapping  visualizes that actors within an organization influence one another, according to the actor identifiers and the actor influence specifiers.","The mapping program transforms the core influence mapping  into a behavior influence mapping  by tagging actors with behaviors. In that regard, the mapping program accepts a selection input specifying a selected actor among the organizational actors (), displays a behavior list  of permissible behavior tags for the selected actor (), and accepts a behavior selection from the behavior list  (). The mapping program then creates an actor behavior specifier for the behavior selection in the core influence mapping . The mapping program creates a behavior link (e.g., ) from the selected actor to the actor behavior specifier in the behavior influence mapping (), thereby transforming the core influence mapping  into a behavior influence mapping .","The tool also helps to find suitable external agents to interact with actors within an organization. The tool may analyze the structure of the behavior model  as part of a compatibility analysis to determine external agents who would be compatible with any given organizational actor. One implementation of the compatibility analysis operates under the following analysis rules: 1) individuals exhibiting opposite behaviors (e.g., Analytic<->Expressive) should be rejected as matches; 2) individuals exhibiting the same behavior are preferred as highly compatible matches; and 3) individuals with adjacent behaviors (e.g., Amiable<->Expressive) are compatible, but less preferred than matches with the same behavior.","Examples of additional rules include: 4) if an external agent has a negative internal directional indicator for influence toward an organizational actor, then reject the external agent as a match, regardless of behavior; 5) if an external agent has a positive internal directional indicator for influence toward an organizational actor, then increase the determined level of compatibility between the external agent and the organizational actor (e.g., by increasing a compatibility score by a pre-determined amount); 6) increase the determined level of compatibility in relation to the strength of the external directional indicator for the external agent; and 7) decrease the level of compatibility in relation to the strength of the external directional indicator for the competitor of the external agent.","In some implementations, the tool considers versatility when determining which external agents are compatible with any selected organizational actor. Versatility may reflect ability or skillfulness in adapting to many different people in many different situations. Versatility is one indication that the external agent and the organizational actor may effectively build a relationship. Versatility may be measured by a versatility score or ranking, such as a numerical or alphabetic ranking. The versatility score for an external agent may be generated by analysis and processing of questions (e.g., behavioral analysis questions) given to, and answers given by, selected individuals who were chosen to answer the questions about the external agent. When the organizational actor is not among the selected individuals, the versatility score may not turn out to be absolutely correct with respect to the organizational actor, but the versatility score nevertheless may serve as a starting point for understanding versatility with respect to the organizational actor and as a reasonable basis for making compatibility decisions based in part on versatility. As one specific example, the versatility of an external agent may be scored in terms of how others see the eternal agent managing their tension level in the relationship on a four level scale from low versatility to high versatility. In one implementation, the following factors may compose the versatility score: Image, 8% of total versatility score, measuring how the individual dresses and how they carry themselves; Presentation, 9% of versatility score, measuring how well an individual communicates and presents; Competence, 48% of versatility score, measuring dependability, perseverance, and flexibility; and Feedback, 35% of versatility score, measuring the ability to understand others rationally and emotionally.","Referring back to , Holly is a Driver. Assume that a first available external agent, Dan, is an Analytic, and that a second available external agent, Darren, is an Expressive. There is therefore already some level of compatibility between Holly and Dan and between Holly and Darren because their behaviors are adjacent in the behavior model . Assume also that Dan is versatile in terms of behavioral compatibility. The tool may take the versatility into consideration by increasing the assessed level of compatibility determined between Dan and Holly, or by making Dan a more preferred match than Darren.","Sufficient versatility may also reveal that otherwise behavior diverse individuals could be compatible and build relationships. Assume that Doug is an available external agent who is Amiable, opposite that of Holly. Ordinarily, the tool would indicate that Doug and Holly should not be matched. However, assume that Doug is versatile and that testing has determined a versatility score or level of 3. The versatility may make Doug a workable match. For example, if Doug's versatility score exceeded a matching threshold (e.g., level 3 versatility or above), then the tool may recommend matching Doug and Holly, but may further indicate that Doug is a less preferred match than Dan or Darren due to the fundamental opposing behavior of Doug and Holly.","The level of compatibility may be expressed in many different ways, both abstract (e.g., low, medium, high) and concrete (e.g., a numerical score). For example, a scoring model may assign an external agent with a matching behavior a compatibility score of 20, and may assign an external agent with an adjacent behavior a compatibility score of 10. The scoring model may also reward external agent versatility by increasing the compatibility score according to the strength of that versatility (e.g., level 1: increase 1 point, level 2: increase 4 points, level 3: increase 6 points, level 4: increase 8 points).","The scoring model may also assign a base compatibility score of 0 (zero) to an external agent with opposing behavior to a selected organizational actor. The tool may increase the base compatibility score as a function of the external agent versatility score (e.g., level 1: increase by 1, level 2: increase by 2, level 3: increase by 5, level 4: increase by 8). Thus, as the external agent exhibits greater versatility, the tool may further increase the compatibility score. The tool may cap the resulting compatibility score below the other scores explained above, to indicate that such a match is not preferred, but might be attempted in the right situations (e.g., no other external agent is available).","An agent search program executing in the tool may implement the compatibility analysis rules explained above. In particular,  shows logic  that the agent search program may implement to identify compatible external agents to interact with a selected organizational actor. The agent search program searches an agent database to determine external agent identifiers that specify available external agents (). The agent search program also searches the agent database to determine external agent behavior and versatility specifiers assigned to the available external agents (). The agent database may be preconfigured to include the agent identifiers, behaviors, and versatility specifiers for any particular external agents or specific deal teams of external agents assembled to work with any particular organization.","The agent search program initiates a compatibility analysis of the actor behavior specifier for the selected actor with the external agent member behavior and versatility specifiers (). In particular, the agent search program determines whether any external agents have identical behavior compared with any selected actor in the organization. If so, the agent search program identifies the external agent as a preferred compatible external agent (). As explained above, the agent search program may assign a compatibility score indicative of the level of compatibility found between the external agents and the selected actor.","Continuing the analysis, the agent search program may also determine whether any external agents have behavior that is adjacent to the behavior of the selected actor. If so, those external agents may be identified as secondarily compatible external agents (). Furthermore, if either the external agent has versatility, then the agent search program may increase the level of compatibility found for the external agent and the selected actor ().","It may also be the case that the external agent has opposing behavior to the selected actor. Opposing behavior may result in immediately rejecting the external agent as non-compatible (). However, in some implementations of the tool, when the external agent has versatility, then the agent search program may identify the external agent as a compatible (though possibly non-preferred) selection to interact with the selected actor ().","Furthermore, the agent search program may analyze external and internal influence directional indicators and apply them to the analysis of whether an external agent is compatible () (or which organizational actor to select to influence). For example, the agent search program may apply the analysis rules 4), 5), 6), and 7) noted above. Accordingly, even when an external agent has compatible behavior with respect to an organizational actor, the agent search program may nevertheless reject the external agent as a compatible external agent, when the direction of influence is negative or adverse between the external agent and the organizational actor. On the other hand, the agent search program may further increase the level of determined compatibility when the direction of influence is positive. As another example, the agent search program may attempt to match external agents to those organizational actors with the most positive external indicators, the least negative competitor external indicators, or any combination thereof.","The analysis described above is well suited for the behavior model . The behavior model  may be further subdivided into more finely grained behaviors. For example, each behavior may be subdivided into four subcategories of behavior, determined by the underlying analysis factors gathered when the behavior analysis was performed. However, any other behavior analysis on any other behavior model  may be implemented and analyzed instead (), and may give rise to additional, fewer, or different behavior compatibility rules.","Once the agent search program has completed the analysis, the agent search program may display a list (e.g., a score ranked list) of compatible external agents to interact with the selected actor (). The compatibility scores assigned to the external agents may also be displayed with each compatible external agent. The agent search program may also display those external agents who were rejected as incompatible because of opposing behavior, unavailability, or for other reasons.","In addition, the agent search program may retrieve and display coaching information (). To that end, the agent search program may search a coaching database as described in detail below to locate coaching information relevant to the selected organizational actor, relevant to the compatible external agent behavior, or both. The agent search program may display the coaching information on a user interface to provide helpful information about how to interact with individuals who have specific behaviors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","500","502","504","506","500","508","510","508","508","509"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Field","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Agent Member ID (512)","An identifier of the external agent, e.g., a"]},{"entry":[{},"name or employee number"]},{"entry":["Deal Team IDs (514)","An identifier of one or more specific"]},{"entry":[{},"deal teams that the external agent belongs to,"]},{"entry":[{},"e.g., ACME Company"]},{"entry":[{},"Network Consulting Deal"]},{"entry":["Agent Member Assignment","An indicator of whether the external"]},{"entry":["(516)","agent is available to be assigned, or is"]},{"entry":[{},"already assigned to another task"]},{"entry":["External Agent Behavior","An identifier of the external agent's"]},{"entry":["Specifier (518)","behavior, e.g., Analytic"]},{"entry":["External Agent Versatility","The external agent's versatility score or"]},{"entry":["Score (520)","level, e.g., \u2018level 3\u2019, \u2018Z\u2019, \u2018Strong\u2019, or 75"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The actor database  stores sets of records that define the actors within the organization being targeted by the deal team.

The coaching strategies help to build a relationship that increases the understanding and influence on organizational decisions. To that end, a coaching database  stores coaching entries . The records that define the coaching entries  may include a record number, behavior type, an entry type, and coaching information. The entry type may distinguish between different types of coaching information, such as a \u2018coaching tip\u2019 (e.g., a helpful text message that explains behavior characteristics of any selected organizational actor), and a \u2018matching strategy\u2019 (e.g., specific advice for an external agent with a specific behavior for successfully interacting with an organizational actor with a specific behavior). Examples are given below. The coaching information in the coaching entries  may point to or store text, audio, video, or other information that describes or explains characteristics of individuals with certain behaviors, that gives strategies for working with an individual with any particular behavior, and any other desired guidance information for interacting with an individual who exhibits a particular behavior.","Table 3 shows an example of records in the coaching database  that store coaching entries  for Analytical behavior. The mapping program , agent search program , or another program (e.g., a separate coaching program) may search the coaching database  to find, retrieve, and display appropriate coaching strategies.

In other words, given an Analytical selected actor, the behavior matching strategy provides guidance for how an external agent with any type of behavior may best interact with the selected actor.

As another example, the databases may be implemented as Microsoft\u2122 Sharepoint\u2122 repositories, Structured Query Language based databases, or in other forms. The programs may be stored on a computer readable medium, such as a CDROM, hard drive, floppy disk, flash memory, or other computer readable medium.
