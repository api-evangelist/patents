App. No. 60\/384,650, filed May 30, 2002. The disclosures of the above-listed applications are all hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth herein in their entireties.","This disclosure relates to the field of consumer credit information and particularly to the presentation of simulated credit score information.","The credit score is an important indicator of a consumer's financial health. Consequently, having a high credit score is important to consumers for many reasons. A high credit score is required for such things as loan applications, rental applications, real estate mortgages, and so on. Thus, many consumers have a substantial interest in finding ways to improve their credit scores.","There is much information available to consumers as to how to improve credit scores. For example, sources provide advice to consumers to pay off loans, to establish certain numbers of credit accounts, to establish new loans, to raise or lower credit card limits, and so on. However, this advice is generic to all consumers and does not provide information specific to a particular consumer's situation. The question for many consumers then is which of the suggested actions would be the most effective in improving that consumer's credit score based on that consumer's situation.","Thus, it would be advantageous for consumers to be able to quickly investigate the various actions that may be taken to change one's credit score and the effect that those actions would have. In particular, it would be advantageous for consumers to be able to visualize those effects in an interactive and real time manner.","An embodiment is a computer-readable medium that operates a computer system. The system receives credit information relating to a consumer. The system calculates a credit score associated with the consumer based on the received credit information and further based on a credit score calculation algorithm.

The system receives credit information relating to a consumer. The system identifies a plurality of credit score simulation scenarios, each credit score simulation scenario including data indicating credit score simulation parameters associated with the respective credit score simulation scenario. The system executes, using a computer processor, a credit score simulation calculation for each of the credit score simulation scenarios. Each execution of the credit score simulation calculation for a credit score simulation scenario is based on the credit information and the credit score simulation parameters associated with the respective credit score simulation scenario. The execution produces simulated credit scores for respective credit score simulation scenarios. The system constructs user interface data configured to cause the display of a user interface including a listing of information associated with respective credit score simulation scenarios, in conjunction with the simulated credit scores for respective credit score simulation scenarios. The system then transmits the constructed user interface data.","In an embodiment, the method also includes calculating a credit score based on the credit information, and wherein the user interface further includes the calculated credit score.","In an embodiment, at least one of the simulated credit scores are greater than the calculated credit score, and at least some of the simulated credit scores are less than the calculated credit score, and wherein the user interface graphically differentiates the greater and less simulated credit scores.","In an embodiment, the user interface is configured to display, upon clicking an element of the listing of information associated with a particular credit score simulation scenario, expanded information including further credit score simulation data related to the particular credit score simulation scenario.","In an embodiment, the user interface is configured to display expanded information by requesting and receiving further credit score simulation data from an external server.","In an embodiment, identifying the plurality of credit score simulation scenarios comprises selecting a subset of credit score simulation scenarios based at least in part upon the received credit information.","In an embodiment, the selected subset of credit score simulation scenarios is further based upon stored user preferences.","In an embodiment, the listing of information is sorted by the simulated credit scores for respective credit score simulation scenarios.","In an embodiment, a system performs a method of constructing a credit score simulation control interface.

The users accessing public user interface  may be the consumers themselves. Alternatively, the users accessing public user interface  may be entities interested in particular consumers. For example, a bank or landlord may access public user interface  to perform credit score simulation on a prospective loan recipient or tenant.","In various embodiments, the public interface may include an authenticated section that may be accessed only by authenticated users, such as members who have signed up for an account and\/or paid a fee such as a subscription fee. The public interface may further include an unauthenticated section that may be accessed by users regardless of authentication status, or that may be accessed by unauthenticated users. The authenticated and unauthenticated sections may have the same features, similar features, or different features. In an embodiment, the authenticated section offers additional features not available in the unauthenticated section. For example, credit data or credit-related information is used in the various systems and methods described herein. This information be stored in member accounts or automatically retrieved based on member account data. In such an embodiment, the credit-related information may be automatically pre-populated, so that members need not enter that information, while unauthenticated users would enter their information manually.","Public user interface  includes a scenario simulation section  which may enable the user to view various predetermined scenarios and determine simulated credit scores associated with those various scenarios.

In an embodiment, no administrative interface is provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"101"},"At block , the system receives credit-related information from a user and\/or third parties. Such information may include personal identifying information enabling the system to determine the identity of the user or another individual. The information may further enable the system to retrieve credit data associated with the appropriate individual. Furthermore, such information may include the public data as retrieved from a credit bureau or other credit information source. In an embodiment, the credit data retrieved is a credit score. In an embodiment, the credit information retrieved is credit data from a consumer's credit history that the system  may use to calculate a credit score for the consumer, such as based on a credit score model of a credit bureau or based on a credit score model that is configured to approximate credit scores provided by one or more credit bureaus. Further data may be retrieved by the system and incorporated into the processes described herein.","At block , the system constructs one or more credit score simulation parameters and\/or other data. These parameters may be used by the system to simulate a credit score. For example, such data may include the credit score itself, which may be calculated using credit data of the consumer. Additional parameters relating to the consumer's credit usage may be calculated as well. For example, the system may use credit data to calculate aggregate or average information, such as the average credit balance for the consumer or the average number of months late that the consumer pays off credit card debt.","In an embodiment, the data constructed at block  may include information on how much a particular consumer's credit score would be affected by various activities. In an embodiment, the data may include information about types of actions that may be taken by the individual whose credit score is being simulated. This information may be based on particular personal information associated with the individual. For example, the system may determine that a consumer has no credit cards based on, for example, information received at block . In such a case, at block , the system may determine that it is not possible for the user to pay off the consumer's credit card debt and thus, the system will not recommend doing so.","In an embodiment, the data constructed at block  may include summary information associated with the user's credit behavior. Such information may be derived from the user's credit report, may be received directly from the user, or may be gathered by other means. Other such parameters may be constructed at block .","At block , the system applies one or more credit score simulation models to determine a simulated credit score. Various score simulation models may be used. Some of such models are disclosed throughout this specification and in the related applications that are incorporated by reference. In various embodiments, the score simulation model may incorporate information about the consumer's actual credit score, or it may estimate the consumer's credit score based on user provided information alone and\/or other information, without relying on an actual credit score. In an embodiment, the score simulation model may be based on various statistical models such as linear regression, non-linear regression, neural networks, and the like. The results of applying the score simulation model at block  may include one or more simulated credit scores and possibly other information, which may include, for example, recommendations for possible actions to be taken, ranges of credit scores, possible parameters for adjustment, and so on.","At block , the system uses the results of the score simulation model from block , as well as other information, to construct user interface data. The user interface data may take on various forms depending on the particular means of communication with the user who initiated the request. In various embodiments, the user interface data may be web page data, application-specific data, mobile application data, or other such graphical data. In other embodiments, the user interface data may not be visual data, but rather be audio data, XML data, comma-separated values (CSV) data, and so on.","At block , the user interface data constructed at block  may be transmitted to the user, who may be the consumer or other entity. At block , the user may use the user interface to adjust various simulation parameters. This may be done, for example, via an interactive user interface that provides various controls configured to be manipulated by the user. The interface may be configured to convert those user manipulations into data that may be transmitted back to the score simulation system.","At block , the adjusted parameters are transmitted to the system, and the system receives a request to adjust parameters. Upon receiving the request to adjust the parameters, the system further may perform various steps in the process of  to calculate updated credit score simulation values and provide the user with further user interface data. In an embodiment, the system distinguishes between the initial transmission of user interface data and subsequent transmissions of user interface data so that it may transmit only portions that are necessary to update the user interface data in the latter case. This may be done, for example, using an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) mechanism, a data push interface, or other communication protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"The user's current credit score may be displayed on the user interface using interface element . This credit score may be an actual credit score or an estimated credit score provided based on information submitted by the user. In addition to the user's numeric credit score, the interface may optionally or alternatively present a graphical and\/or textual representation of the user's credit rating . In an embodiment, the graphical representation of the rating may include a dial with a pointer indicating the user's relative credit risk. In an embodiment, a textual representation may include a textual description of the user's credit risk rating such as \u201cVery Low Risk.\u201d Both a graphical and a textual representation may be included, or only one, or neither, in various embodiments.","In an embodiment, the interface may include a listing or other display of various scenarios , representing possible actions that may potentially affect the consumer's credit score. The scenarios  listed in  may be a predefined list of scenarios displayed for every consumer whose information is displayed by the system. Thus, because the same scenarios are used for each consumer, the consumer's credit rating  may be located at different locations between the predefined scenarios . As shown in , the interface includes scenarios that would cause a decrease in credit score of the consumer, as well as scenarios that would cause an increase in the credit score of the consumer.","In another embodiment, the scenarios are selected based on information relating to the consumer. For example, the system may omit particular scenarios that are not applicable to the consumer's situation, as determined based on the consumer's credit history or other personal information. In other embodiments, the system may identify actions that are particularly relevant to the consumer and graphically highlight or otherwise identify them. In an embodiment, the selected scenarios are chosen based on factors such as scenarios of the most interest to the general public, the level of impact on the simulated credit score (for example, selecting scenarios having the most impact), scenarios relevant to the consumer based on the consumer's credit history or spending habits, and\/or other factors.","In an embodiment, a subset of scenarios is initially displayed, and then an expanded list of scenarios may be optionally shown upon user request. For example, if the system determines that a consumer could easily pay off credit card debt but would have more difficulty paying off a home mortgage, then the system may highlight the scenario of paying off credit card debt, and\/or it may omit or hide the home mortgage payment scenario. In an embodiment, the user may be provided options to add in scenarios that are not selected to be displayed, or to remove scenarios that are displayed, thus making the user interface customizable by the user.","In an embodiment, the scenarios are presented in association with an indication of an estimated credit score that would potentially result should the user perform the associated action. The simulated credit score may be calculated based on data maintained by the system relating to the action, and it may be further based on credit information associated with the particular user. The simulated credit score may be calculated using various score simulation models, as explained previously in this disclosure.","In an embodiment, each scenario is displayed with a numeric estimated score  and a graphical indication  of the simulated score. For example, as shown in , the graphical representation  may include an up arrow, down arrow, or equal sign indicating the relative change that the scenario would have on the user's credit score. In an embodiment, to further improve the user's ability to understand the user interface of , the graphical representations  are colored to reflect the relative effect the action will have on the user's credit score. For example, actions that would increase the user's credit score may be colored green, whereas actions that would decrease the user's credit score may be colored red.","In an embodiment, the listing of scenarios  may further be sorted in various orders, such as by the estimated credit scores . The user may be able to select the order in which the scenarios are sorted. In an embodiment, the interface element  showing the user's actual credit score is inserted into the list of scenarios  in an appropriate location relative to estimated scores . In other embodiments, the interface element  showing the actual score may be placed on other parts of the user interface.","The display shown for each scenario may further include extended and\/or additional information  relating to the particular scenario. In an embodiment, to improve the appearance of the user interface, such additional information may be hidden and only displayed in response to an appropriate user interaction with the user interface. For example, in the embodiment shown in , the user may use interface elements , for example by clicking on it, to display additional information.","The display of additional information  may include any additional information that may be associated with the particular selected scenario. For example, the scenario associated with additional information  is the scenario of making all payments on time for the next six months. The additional information includes a textual description of the scenario  as well as further score simulations  for time frames different from six months. This provides the user with easy access to further credit score simulations for related scenarios.","Additionally, the display of additional information  may include one or more graphical and\/or textual descriptions of credit score simulations  for the selected scenario and\/or for the extended displays of related scenario. For example, dials indicating the relative simulated credit score may be shown for the selected scenario, for any or all of the related scenarios in the extended information, for both, or for neither. Additionally, in an embodiment, the additional information  may include one or more links  to further information relating to the selected action.","The user interaction employed to display additional information  may be, for example, a mouse click, a tap or gesture on a touch screen, a keyboard selection, a drag and drop operation, voice command, or other form of interaction. In an embodiment, when a user requests to display additional information for one particular action, any other displays of additional information are automatically hidden thereby reducing clutter on the user interface. In other embodiments, additional information  may always be displayed or may never be displayed.","The location at which additional information  is placed may also vary in various embodiments. For example, as shown on , additional information  may be displayed underneath the particular selected action. In another embodiment, additional information  may be shown in an internal window within the user's web browser or other application. In other embodiments, the additional information  may be shown in a separate pop-up window. In another embodiment, the additional information  may be shown on a separate web page.","One example of a scenario that may be included on the interface of , in an embodiment, is whether the individual accepted a pre-approved credit card offer with a particular credit limit. The particular credit limit may be $2,500, $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, or $20,000, or any other amount, in various embodiments. The expanded scenarios associated with this scenario may be based on any subset of these credit limit amounts, or all of the amounts, or further amounts.","Another example of a scenario that may be included on the interface of  is whether the individual makes all payments on time for a particular number of months into the future. The number of months may be 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, or any other number, in various embodiments. The expanded scenarios associated with this scenario may be based on any subset of these numbers of months, or all of the numbers, or further numbers.","Another example of a scenario that may be included on the interface of  is whether the individual consolidates all of his\/her major credit card balances onto one major credit card with a particular credit limit. The particular credit limit may be $2,500, $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, or $20,000, or any other amount, in various embodiments. The expanded scenarios associated with this scenario may be based on any subset of these credit limit amounts, or all of the amounts, or further amounts.","In order to generate the listing of various actions as shown on , the system may include a database or other data store of information relating to possible actions. An example of a data structure that may be employed to store such information about actions and\/or scenarios is shown on . In various embodiments, the system may include additional information or less information in such a data structure. The data structure may be stored in any number of formats such as a relational database, XML data, HTML data, common separated values (CSV) data, or other formats.","In the embodiment shown in , one or more score simulation scenario data records  may be stored by the system. Each score simulation scenario data record may include a number of elements. For example, each record may include a textual description of the scenario . This textual description may be used in the listing of possible actions as shown in .","The score simulation scenario data structure  may further include one or more parameter adjustment rules . Such rules may be used to determine the appropriate simulated credit score to be associated with the scenario or action. For example, for a scenario of making all payments on time for the next six months, the parameter adjustment rules  may indicate how much a credit score would change should such an action be taken. The adjustment rules may account for the user's actual credit information in performing the adjustment of the credit score.","In an embodiment, the parameter adjustment rules comprise executable code that recalculates the estimated credit score. In another embodiment, the parameter adjustment rules comprise data relating to how to adjust parameters to be provided to one or more score simulation models and the score simulation models apply the parameter adjustment rules  to calculate the new simulated credit score.","The score simulation scenario data structure  may further include data relating to expanded simulation scenario data . This data may be used, for example, to calculate the information for the expanded display of additional information  shown in . In an embodiment, the expanded simulation scenario data  may include similar data elements to that of the score simulation scenario data structure . For example, it may include descriptive text and\/or further parameter adjustment rules for each of the expanded simulations. In an embodiment, for example, the expanded simulation scenarios may include making all payments on time for the next six months, one year and two years. Thus, in this embodiment, the expanded simulation scenario data  may include descriptive text and parameter adjustment rules for each of those three possible expanded scenarios.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":"101"},"At block , the system accesses credit information associated with a particular consumer.

Thus, the system may recalculate the simulated credit score for the scenario using credit data of the consumer, with some data elements replaced with data for the particular scenario being processed.","At block , the system optionally calculates simulated credit scores for expanded scenarios. These calculations may be used to display the additional information associated with particular actions or scenarios. The credit scores for expanded scenarios may be calculated in the same way described with respect to block , or by other means.","In an embodiment, the simulated credit scores for expanded scenarios are calculated prior to transmitting data to the user. In another embodiment, the system does not calculate simulated credit scores for the expanded scenarios, and instead waits to receive appropriate requests from the user before calculating simulated credit scores for those expanded scenarios. Thus, the processes of block  may be performed at various times in different embodiments.","At block , the system determines whether there are further simulation scenarios in the list of simulation scenarios retrieved at block . If there are, then the system returns to block  and further performs calculations of simulated credit scores for each of the other scenarios. If not, then at block , the system constructs user interface data or other data, based on the calculated credit scores and\/or other information calculated or retrieved by the system.

Such a listing may appear like listing  of . At block , a user selection of a simulation scenario is received. Such a selection may be, for example, a mouse click on a web page. The user selection may indicate a particular scenario that has been selected or may indicate several scenarios to be selected.","At block , the client computer optionally sends a request to the score simulation server for expanded scenario information. At block , the expanded scenario information is received by the client computer. In order to do this, the score simulation system may be configured to receive such requests for expanded scenario information and to transmit that appropriate data indicating the expanded score simulation scenario information. This expanded information may be in the form of user interface data such as web page data, or it may simply include numeric credit scores or other raw information that may be formatted by the client's computer web browser in accordance with the executable code.","In another embodiment, the expanded scenario information is already available to the client computer without performing blocks  and . This may be the case, for example, where the expanded score simulation scenario information was pre-calculated and transmitted in conjunction with the user interface data that was displayed at block . For example, if optional block  of  was performed, then the client computer may already have received the expanded scenario information. In such a case, blocks  and  may not need to be performed. In another embodiment, the client computer performs blocks  and  the first time a user selects a particular scenario at block  but it caches the result received at block , so that it need not perform block  and  again the next time the user selects that same scenario.","At block , the client computer displays the expanded scenario information. This display may be presented using any number of forms such as an expanded display on the window, on internal window within the web browser, a separate pop-up window, a separate web page or tab, or other means. In an embodiment, the user interface is configured to animate the display of the expanded scenario information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["801","802","803","804","803","804","801","802"]},"The user interface further includes one or more credit scores simulation adjusters . These adjusters enable the user to modify parameters to be provided to the credit score simulation system and allow it to calculate further simulated credit scores. In an embodiment, the simulation adjusters  are graphical sliders including a display of a bar  and a handle  configured so that the user may adjust handle  across bar , for example by clicking and dragging it so as to slide it.","In an embodiment, bar  comprises a plurality of segments associated with different values to be provided to the credit score simulation system. For example, bar  is divided into sections, each section representing different portions of credit use such as 65-100% , 52-64% , 30-51% , 16-29% , and 0-15% .","In an embodiment, handle  is initially placed within the segment of bar  that most closely reflects the user's actual credit information. For example, handle  is initially placed within region  because the user whose credit score is being simulated in the interface of  has a credit usage value of 16-29%.","In an embodiment, each of the segments  through  is colored to reflect a credit risk associated with that segment. In an embodiment, the colors are selected to correspond with those colors used in the graphical display  and . For example, a credit used amount of 65-100% may create a high credit risk and as a result, section segment  may be colored the same as the high risk section of elements  and . In an embodiment, segment  is colored red and segment  is colored green, to indicate that segment  indicates a low risk while segment  represents a high risk. As shown in the example of , not all sliders include all risk categories and the risk categories are not uniform for all sliders.","In an embodiment, the segments of bar  and the other interface element  are created automatically by the credit score simulation system and remain positioned where they are regardless of the user's adjustment of handle  or other manipulations of the user interface. In other embodiments, the segments may be adjusted in response to the user adjusting one or more of the interface element . For example, if the user moves handle  to indicate a different amount of credit use, this may cause other sliders or interface elements to change their colored segments and\/or handles.","In an embodiment, changing the value of one or more of the simulation adjusters results in a corresponding change to the display of the potential score  and . This is shown in detail in .","In , the user has moved handle  into region  of slider bar . In response, the user interface element  displaying the simulated credit score has been updated to reflect a new simulated credit score. Additionally, display  has been updated to graphically indicate the changed simulated credit score. While in  element  showed a very low risk for the user, in , as a result of the change of the value for bar , element  displays an average risk for the user. These updates may be performed substantially in real time, so that there is minimal delay or no delay between the user moving handle  and the simulated credit score values being updated. In this way, the consumer is provided with a graphical indication of how various changes affect their risk level.","In , handle  has been further moved into segment  of bar . Accordingly, the simulated score  and graphical display of the simulated score  have been further updated to reflect the new simulated score and a high risk category.","Although the user interface has been described with respect to slider interface elements, other user interface elements may be used in various embodiments. For example, the user may select items off of a list, rotate a dial, type in information, or otherwise interact with the user interface. Additionally, the user interface may include various graphical, textual, and other indications of changes, in addition to, or rather than, updating the simulated score  and graphical display . For example, the \u201cvs\u201d symbol between the current score and simulated score may be colored to reflect the difference between the scores. In an embodiment, the \u201cvs\u201d symbol is colored red when the potential score is lower than the current score, yellow when the scores are equal, and green when the potential score is higher than the current score. In various embodiments, audible and\/or tactile feedback may further be provided based on the simulated score.","The credit score simulation system maintains information about each of the adjuster elements such as slider shown in . The information for these adjuster interfaces may be stored in data structures such as those shown in . Each adjuster interface element data structure  may include various information associated with the particular simulation adjuster interface elements. For example, it may include parameter adjustment rules . These adjustment rules indicate how a simulated credit score should be adjusted for various values presented by the simulation adjuster interface elements.","Additionally, the data structure may include a range of adjustment values  indicating what values the adjuster interface element may take on. The range of adjustment values may be a continuous range with a minimum and maximum value, or it may be a discrete set of particular values. Additionally, the data structure may include a description  and\/or other information useful in displaying the simulation adjustment interface element.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":"101"},"At block , the system provides multiple simulation controls such as slider positions at the parameter values associated with a particular user's information. These controls may be provided via an interface such as that shown in . At block , the system receives one or more change simulation control values. This change to simulation control values may be based on user interactions with the simulation controls. Such interaction may include, for example, sliding the handle on one or more slider bars.","At block , the system determines a simulated credit score based on the depicted change to the simulation control values. The simulated credit score may further be based on actual credit information associated with the user including the user's actual credit score.","At block , the system determines a risk category associated with the simulated credit score calculated at block . The risk category may be based on internal data relating to risk categories for particular credit scores or range of the credit scores. At block , the system constructs an updated user interface illustrating the simulated credit score calculated at block  and the associated risk category calculated at block . The constructed user interface may be a complete user interface such as that shown in , or only a portion of the user interface that requires updating.","In an embodiment, if the system determines at block  that the risk category has not changed, then block  may be omitted.

The request may include data indicating those adjusted interface elements using a variety of formats in accordance with the protocol understood by the credit score simulation system. In response, the credit score simulation system may transmit updated user interface data or other data to the client computer.","Alternatively, at block , the client computer may calculate an updated simulated credit score and\/or other information using client-side code such as JavaScript code. In such an embodiment, the client computer does not need to communicate with the credit score simulation server which provides some possible performance benefits to the user of the client computer.","In an embodiment, rather than calculating an updated score at either block  or , only a score delta value is calculated, indicating not the resulting simulated credit score but a difference between the actual credit score and the simulated credit score. Executable code on the client computer or score simulator system may then be configured to update the user interface to reflect the simulated credit score, calculated based on the actual credit score and the delta value.","At block , the system updates the overall score display of the user interface. Such updating may involve, for example, displaying a new simulated credit score and\/or updating graphical or textual representations of the associated credit risk.
