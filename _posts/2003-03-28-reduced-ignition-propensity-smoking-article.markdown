title: Reduced ignition propensity smoking article
abstract: A smoking article having reduced ignition propensity is disclosed. The smoking article includes a tobacco column, a wrapper surrounding the tobacco column and a filter element. The wrapper has a base permeability, an untreated area and a least one discrete area treated with a composition to reducing the base permeability. The discretely treated area interacts with a coal of a burning tobacco firecone as it advances to self-extinguish the smoking article. The composition of the treated area includes a permeability reducing substance, a burn rate retarding substance and a burn rate accelerating substance. Either the burn rate retarding substance or the burn rate accelerating substance acts as an organoleptic enhancing substance. In this way a smoker's experience when smoking either the at least one treated area or the untreated area is substantially the same.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/795,054, filed Feb. 26, 2001, now abandoned.","The present invention relates generally to a wrapper for a smoking article to create a reduced ignition propensity (IP) smoking article and, more particularly, to a smoking article having the ability to freeburn in a static state and reduced IP. Under some circumstances cigarettes may ignite fire-prone substrates if the article is laid or accidentally contacts the substrate. Therefore, a cigarette prepared from a wrapper, which diminishes the ability of the article to ignite a substrate, may have the desirable effect of reducing cigarette-initiated fires. Furthermore, a wrapper that concurrently confers on the cigarette the ability to freeburn in a static state and reduced IP character allows a beneficial reduction in the tendency of the article to ignite fire-prone substrates while maintaining consumer acceptability.","There have been various attempts to create a cigarette that has reduced IP and consumer acceptable attributes particularly taste and the ability to freeburn in the static state. Technologies that appear to provide such cigarettes are described in the patent literature. Cigarettes claiming to possess reduced IP are commercially available.","A factor that manufacturers consider in preparing a smoking article having reduced IP is whether currently used processes and equipment will remain substantially unchanged. One method for preparing a reduced IP paper involves the addition of elaborate equipment on a conventional papermaking machine. Cellulose fibers or particles suspended in water are sprayed from angular moving nozzles moving at an angle to a continuous forming moist web. This approach involves the coordinated angular movement of the spray nozzle and the about 400 feet per minute moving web to create spaced apart bands transverse to the web. The above-mentioned technology suffers from a number of deficiencies that limit consumer acceptability, IP reduction, and ease of manufacture. The technology requires expensive add-on equipment including a spray nozzle system and an associated slurry distribution system, pressure regulating system, and a means for carefully synchronizing the angular material distribution system with the underlying papermaking machine.","The reduced consumer acceptable properties of the prepared cigarettes are due to factors including reduced ability of the cigarette to freeburn in the static state, poor ash appearance, and variable taste profile.","The poor IP reduction performance achieved by cigarettes prepared with wrappers made using this technology is believed to be caused by a number of factors including difficulty in depositing an even layer of the cellulose fibers or particles, low efficiency of the cellulose fibers or particles to reduce the permeability of the underlying web, and poor reproducibility caused by fanning out of the sprayed material. Deficiencies in the approach that limit ease of manufacture include the difficulty in synchronizing the angular moving cellulose fibers and particles distribution apparatus with the underlying web forming apparatus and difficulty in reducing the banded moist web to dryness without disrupting the structure of the web.","Another technology involves adding discrete material regions to the dry web using organic solvent-based printing equipment. Organic solvents and non-aqueous soluble solutes are used to make the discrete regions on the web. The presence of organic solvents requires hoods to capture the solvent vapors and the corresponding further expenses.","In regard to commercially available cigarettes claiming to possess reduced IP, consumers may find their organoleptic experience wanting. Some technologies that are based on discretely treated areas for reduced IP cigarettes create a varying organoleptic experience as the consumption of the smoking article moves from treated area to non-treated areas.","One commercial product claiming to possess reduced IP is characterized by a tendency to extinguish when left burning in the static state\u2014that is reduced freeburn. The article displays a less desirable taste when relit after being extinguished. Thus, although the cigarette may possess the reduced IP, the reduced freeburn property decreases consumer acceptability of the article.","Other factors affecting consumer acceptability are product appearance, including pleasing and consistent wrapper and ash character. Moreover, it is important that the construction of the smoking article exhibit a reasonable shelf-life while maintaining reduced IP.","Thus, there remains a need for a new and improved wrapper and smoking article having reduced IP while at the same time possessing a sufficient free burn. Also, there remains a need for a new and improved method for making a wrapper that can be used to create a smoking article having reduced IP and sufficient freeburn.","The present invention is directed to a smoking article having reduced IP. The smoking article includes a tobacco column, a wrapper surrounding the tobacco column and, optionally, a filter element. The wrapper has a base permeability, an untreated area and a least one discrete area treated with a composition to reduce the base permeability. The discretely treated area interacts with a coal of a burning tobacco firecone as it advances to self-extinguish the smoking article if the smoking article is left on a surface or causes the cigarette not to ignite the surface.","The tendency of a cigarette to self-extinguish or not ignite surfaces can be measured by the use of IP tests such as those published by the Consumer Products Safety Commission and developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM). See Ohlemiller, T. J. et al., \u201cTest Methods for Quantifying the Propensity of Cigarettes to Ignite Soft Furnishings. Volume 2, \u201cNIST SP 851; volume 2; 166 pages [also includes: Cigarette Extinction Test Method, see pp. 153-160] August 1993 available from U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207 as order number PB94-108644, the subject matter of which is herein incorporated by reference. One NIST IP test, the \u201ccotton duck test\u201d, involves placing a smoldering cigarette on a test assembly composed of a cellulosic fabric over a foam block. Variations of the test use fabrics of various weights and polyethylene sheet backing. A test failure occurs when the fabric ignites. Another NIST IP test, the \u201cfilter paper test\u201d, involves placing a smoldering cigarette on a test assembly composed of layered filter paper sheets. Various forms of the test use 3, 10, and 15 layered filter paper sheets. A successful test result occurs when the cigarette self extinguishes before the whole tobacco column is consumed.","The composition of the treated area includes at least a permeability reducing substance. Another substance in the treated area includes a burn rate retarding substance. Yet another substance in the treated area includes a burn rate accelerating substance. Either the burn rate retarding substance or the burn rate accelerating substance or both preferably acts as an organoleptic enhancing substance. In this way a smoker's experience when smoking either the at least one treated area or the untreated area is substantially the same. Additionally, the composition of the treated area may include a filler component.","In a wrapper making process, the applied amount of the permeability reducing substance, the burn rate retarding substance, and the burn rate accelerating substance is such as to give the desired freeburn character and IP reduction to a finished article made from the wrapper. The quantity and the concentration of the applied composition will depend on factors including the absorbency of the web, polymer properties of the permeability reducing substance, whether the web is wet or dry, and the operating conditions of the application equipment.","The burn rate accelerating substance may be an alkali metal or alkaline-earth containing salt. Preferably, the bum rate accelerating substance may be an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid and the like. Preferably, the salt of the carboxylic acid is a salt of citric acid. Also, the alkali metal containing compound is preferably at least one of a sodium containing compound and a potassium containing compound. Alternatively, the burn rate accelerating substance may be monoammonium phosphate.","The burn rate retarding substance may be a phosphate, preferably a phosphate of ammonium and more preferably a diammonium phosphate.","The permeability reducing substance may be a pore filling substance, a film forming substance or combination thereof. The permeability reducing substance may be a polymer and, preferably, a polysaccharide. Among the contemplated polysaccharides are starch, including various mixtures of amylose, amylopectin and dextrin, modified starch and starch derivatives. The starch and starch derivatives may be water dispersible and, preferably, water soluble. Other contemplated polysaccharides include cellulose, cellulose derivatives, chitosan, chitosan derivatives, chitin, chitin derivatives, alginate, alginate derivatives and combinations thereof. These polysaccharides are preferably water dispersible and, more preferably, are water-soluble.","In one embodiment, the discretely treated area is a circumferential band about the body of the article. The band has a sufficient width so as to deprive the coal of the burning tobacco firecone of oxygen from behind a char line of the wrapper when the smoking article is placed on a surface. That may be achieved by a band width typically of at least about 3 millimeters.","In an alternative embodiment, the discretely treated area includes at least two bands spaced sufficiently to reduce the IP of the smoking article. In this case, the two bands preferably have a center-to-center spacing of between about 10 millimeters to about 30 millimeters. The two bands may have a width of about 3 millimeters to about 10 millimeters. A center-to-center spacing is preferably about 25 millimeters.","The discretely treated area preferably has a thickness and properties so a bobbin of the wrapper is useable in a commercially available smoking article manufacturing machine. Also, the discretely treated area is preferably visually substantially the same as the untreated area.","Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a population of smoking articles having a reduced IP. Each smoking article within the population includes a tobacco column, wrapper surrounding the tobacco column so that the smoking article includes an ignition end and a distal end, and at least one banded region, preferably at least two spaced apart banded regions, between the ignition end and the distal end having a combustion characteristic substantially different from that of an non-banded, untreated, region. A distance from the ignition end to the at least one of the banded region of each smoking article may be sequentially related, random, or quasi-random within a selected population.","In one embodiment, the selected population is a package of smoking articles and in another embodiment a grab sample of smoking articles.","In another embodiment, the distance from the ignition end to the at least one of the banded regions of each smoking article are sequentially related, random, or quasi-random.","In a preferred embodiment, the IP of the selected population is between about 50 and about 100 percent for the population.","The invention also provides a method of making a wrapper, of making a smoking article having reduced IP, and a composition for application to a paper to make a wrapper and a smoking article.","Referring now to the drawings in general and  in particular, it will be understood that the illustrations are for the purpose of describing a preferred embodiment of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention thereto. As best seen in , a smoking article  includes a tobacco column  surrounded by a wrapper . The smoking article  may, as an option, include a filter element  adjacent to the tobacco column  surrounded by the wrapper .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","14","14","20","22","22","14","10","22","22","22","14","10"]},"The permeability reducing substance may be a polymer. The polymer may be any one of a natural polymer, a derivative of a natural polymer, a synthetic polymer, and a combination of any of the preceding. Applicants have found that polysaccharides are suitable as permeability reducing substances. The polysaccharides may be at least one of a starch, modified starch, starch derivative, cellulose, cellulose derivative, chitosan, chitosan derivative, chitin, chitin derivative, alginate, alginate derivative or a combination of any of the preceding. Any polysaccharide that suitably reduces the permeability of the wrapper would be appropriate for use as the permeability reducing substance.","Applicants believe that starch, modified starch, starch derivatives, cellulose and cellulose derivatives would act particularly well as permeability reducing substances. Applicants have found that starch and starch derivatives work particularly well as the permeability reducing substance. Water soluble and water dispersible starch, starch derivatives, cellulose and cellulose derivatives would be more desirable than nonaqueous solvents and dispersants. Nonaqueous solvents may be harmful to workers, or environmentally regulated so that exhaust equipment that may be needed to capture organic solvent mists and vapors.","Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory and explanation, applicants believe that a permeability reducing substance may interact with the wrapper in a number of ways. In one, a permeability reducing substance may form a film on the wrapper  to reduce permeability by blocking pores in the wrapper . That is, when the permeability reducing substance is applied to the wrapper , a film is created that acts as a barrier to block the movement of gas through pores in the discretely treated area .","Alternatively, a permeability reducing substance may act to fill pores and thereby reduce the porosity of the wrapper . In this way, a discretely treated area  possesses porosity or gas permeability less than that of the untreated area  of the wrapper .","As a further alternative, a permeability reducing substance may both form a film on the wrapper  and act to fill pores in the wrapper  so that a discretely treated area  possesses a porosity or gas permeability less than that of the untreated area  of the wrapper .","Applicants have determined that the permeability in the discretely treated area  of wrapper  may be less than about 10 CU (CORESTA units, cm\/min\/cmat 1 kPa measuring pressure as substantially measured according to CORESTA [Cooperative Centre for Scientific Research Relative to Tobacco, Paris, France] Recommended Method No. 40: Determination of Air Permeability of Materials Used as Cigarette Paper, Filter Plug Wrap and Filter Joining Paper including Materials Having an Oriented Permeable Zone, October 1994, published in Bulletin 1994-3\/4, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference) and is preferably less than about 7 CU. Alternatively, the band area, and optionally untreated area, may contain a perforation zone produced by methods such as electrostatic and mechanical perforation and the like that are known to those skilled in the art. Applicants have discovered the unexpected property that a banded area, possessing a perforation zone, may exhibit a relatively high apparent permeability while still conferring a reduced IP character on an article made from the thus treated paper. In a preferred embodiment the permeability of a perforated band may be less than about 60 CU.","A burn rate retarding substance includes any substance that reduces the smolder rate of materials such as paper, cloth and plastic, and may also increase their resistance to flaming combustion. Phosphates have been found to work well and, in particular, phosphates of ammonium. A particular preferred phosphate of ammonium is the diammonium phosphate (having synonyms such as diammonium hydrogenphosphate; DAP; diammonium hydrogenorthophosphate; phosphoric acid, diammonium salt; and ammonium hydrogen phosphate).","A burn rate retarding substance may have additional beneficial benefits including unexpected improved organoleptic properties discovered by applicants. To that end, applicants have found that consumers detect a more pleasing smoke taste when the burn rate retarding substance is present in the discretely treated area  in smoking article  according to the present invention.","A burn rate retarding substance also may cooperate with a permeability reducing substance in another unexpected synergistic manner. That is, the inclusion of a burn rate retarding substance may reduce the amount of a permeability reducing substance that may need to be applied to a discretely treated area . This may have an impact on the manufacturability of a wrapper  according to the present invention by decreasing the amount of permeability reducing material needed to achieve IP reduction.","A burn rate accelerating substance includes any substance known to increase the rate at which the smolder process of such materials as paper, cloth and plastic takes place. Such a substance may contribute to the free burn of a smoking article  according to the present invention. Preferably, a reduced IP smoking article  self-extinguishes when placed onto a surface and continues to burn when the smoking article  is freely suspended such as within the holder of an ashtray or held without puffing. This latter attribute is known as \u201cfreeburn.\u201d To that end, a burn rate accelerating substance interacts with the wrapper , the permeability reducing substance, and the burn rate retarding substance to create a discretely treated area  that works to maintain the balance between self-extinguishment and freeburn.","A burn rate accelerating substance may be a salt such as an alkali metal and an alkaline-earth metal containing salt and, preferably, one containing an alkali metal preferably sodium, potassium and sodium and potassium. The salt may be a salt of a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid and the like. In a particularly preferred embodiment, it is a salt of a citric acid. Alternatively, the burn rate accelerating substance may be monoammonium phosphate.","A burn rate accelerating substance may have additional beneficial benefits including unexpected organoleptic enhancing abilities discovered by applicants. To that end, applicants have found that consumers detect substantially no difference between smoking an untreated area  and a discretely treated area  in smoking article  according to the present invention. This removes the need for difficult to achieve gradations, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,878,753, between a discretely treated area  and untreated areas  to maintain a substantially consistent organoleptic experience for the consumer.","A filler substance includes particulate materials such clay, chalk (calcium carbonate), and titanium oxide. Applicants believe that the presence of filler may be beneficial during the manufacture of discretely treated areas  by allowing the appearance, particularly the opacity, of discretely treated areas  to be carefully controlled so as to be substantially the same as the untreated region .","A manufacturing of discretely treated areas  may be made by applying compositions that are applicable to the wrapper  when the wrapper  might be in a wet or dry state or a semi-wet state. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the quantity and the concentration of the applied composition will depend on factors including the absorbency of the web, properties of the permeability reducing substance, whether the web is wet or dry, and the operating conditions of the application equipment. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the composition may be applied by a number of known methods including spraying, stenciling, flexographic printing, gravure printing, and the like including both multiple-pass and single-pass processes.","Preferably, the composition for affecting the discretely treated areas may be applied on one side of the base paper such that the formed band  faces the tobacco-side  after making article  from the banded paper. Alternatively, the composition may be applied on both sides of the paper or applied such that the formed band  faces the outside or consumer-side after making article  from the banded paper.","Manufacturing of reduced IP smoking articles is preferably accomplished using a reel, or bobbin, length of wrapper  with discretely treated areas  and untreated areas . Using a bobbin of banded paper in a cigarette-making machine will provide a population of banded smoking articles having a reduced IP. That is, each smoking article within the population will include a tobacco column, wrapper surrounding said tobacco column so that the smoking article includes an ignition end and a distal end, and at least one banded region, preferably at least two spaced apart banded regions, between the ignition end and the distal end whereby the distance from the ignition end to the at least one of the banded region of each smoking article may be random (substantially as depicted in FIG. A), quasi-random (substantially as depicted in FIG. B), or sequentially related (substantially as depicted in ) within the population. The population may any population such as a grab sample and a package of cigarettes as depicted in FIG. .","Applicants believe that the sequentially related, random, or quasi-random band position would have the benefit of allowing the cigarette population as a whole to have fewer tendencies to ignite fire-prone substrates. Overall, IP tests incorporate a fixed burn-down distance in which the article is burned before being placed on the test substrate. In real-world ignition scenarios the article may burn down to any distance with respect to the ignition end of the article before contacting a substrate. Therefore, a sequentially related, random, or quasi-random band position will increase the probability that any individual member of the banded article population may prevent ignition of a prone substrate when the article is burned down to a random distance before substrate contact. Alternatively, bands may be registered at a fixed distance with respect to the ignition end of article . The preferred embodiment of this invention is for the manufacture of reduced IP articles having a sequentially related, random, or quasi-random band position with respect to the ignition end of article .","The following examples relate to smoking articles produced according to the present invention and are provided to more fully explain the invention. In the examples describing sample cigarette papers made by \u201cgravure printing\u201d the samples were made using a single-pass gravure printing process. Bands on the gravure-printed paper were about 6 mm wide, substantially perpendicular to the paper edge, and applied at about 25 mm intervals center to center. After printing and allowing the applied composition to dry, the treated paper was slit and rolled into bobbin form compatible with a standard cigarette-making machine. The banding composition was printed on one side of the base paper such that band  was facing the tobacco-side  after making article  from the banded paper. Gravure print-banded paper was used to manufacture cigarette using a conventional cigarette-making machine thereby giving a selected population of cigarettes with quasi-random band positions.","In the examples describing sample cigarettes prepared by \u201chand banding\u201d a circumferential ring of material was applied around the body of smoking article, by hand, using an aluminum printing plate. The aluminum printing plate was fashioned from a slab of aluminum metal with a straight channel, about 7 millimeters wide and about 30 millimeters long, milled below the surface of the slab. A banding composition was used to fill the channel of the printing plate. The smoking article was then rolled, by hand, across the composition-filled channel such that a circumferential band was formed about the body of the smoking article. Therefore, the about 7 millimeter wide band was printed on one side of the wrapper such that band  was on the outside or consumer-side of article . Hand banded cigarettes are characterized as having the applied band registered at a fixed position with respect to the ignition end of the article.","In each of the examples, \u201cfreeburn\u201d was measured by igniting a cigarette and placing the smoldering article horizontally in a holder. The article was allowed to statically smolder without the column or ember contacting a surface. A positive freeburn result occurred when the cigarette was consumed to the filter element.","In each of the examples, a series of conventional flax pulp cigarette papers were used and the properties of these papers are given in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e3008","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Average Base Paper Properties."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Basis Weight"]},{"entry":["Paper","Permeability (CU)","Filler (%)*","Citrate (%)**","(g\/m)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["A","18","30","0.85","     25.5"]},{"entry":["B","29","29","0.85","25.5"]},{"entry":["D","31","28","2.30","26.0"]},{"entry":["E","32","28","0.60","26.0"]},{"entry":["F","37","30","0.90","26.0"]},{"entry":["G","48","28","0.93","25.5"]},{"entry":["H","71","32","0.70","25.8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Weight percent calcium carbonate "},{"entry":"**Weight percent citrate salt "}]}}]}}},"Three smoking article types were made using a paper wrapper, an about 63 millimeter tobacco column length, an about 21 millimeter cellulose acetate non-air diluted filter section, and a cigarette tobacco blend. The cigarettes were made on a conventional cigarette-making machine. Two of the smoking article samples were made using separately banded, reduced IP papers. The third smoking article sample served as a control and was made from a standard cigarette paper. For all smoking article samples in this example paper A was used.","Two banded wrappers were made by applying permeability reducing compositions on base paper A using gravure printing. About 60,000 cigarettes were made for each of a high band weight wrapper type, designated 1-C, a low band weight wrapper type, designated 1-B, and a conventional non-banded wrapper, designated 1-A, as a control. All cigarette types were tested for IP according to the NIST (10-sheet) filter paper IP test and freeburn.","Cigarette type 1-B was made from cigarette paper A gravure printed with a composition containing about 20.5 weight percent Flokote-64\u00ae starch (National Starch, Berkeley, Calif.), about 0.90 weight percent DAP (Rhodia, Cranbury, N.J.), about 8.40 weight percent citrate salt, and bout 70.17 weight percent tap water. The citrate salt was a mixture of sodium citrate dihydrate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, N.J.) and potassium citrate monohydrate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, N.J.) in an about 1:2.8 weight\/weight ratio. The composition was heated at approximately 87\u00b0 C. for about 15 minutes. The permeability in the banded region was measured as about 6 CU.","Cigarette type 1-C was made from cigarette paper A gravure printed with a composition containing about 27.21 weight percent Flokote-64\u00ae starch (National Starch, Berkeley, Calif.), about 1.20 weight percent DAP (Rhodia, Cranbury, N.J.), about 11.13 weight percent citrate salt, and about 60.46 weight percent tap water. The citrate salt was a mixture of sodium citrate dihydrate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, N.J.) and potassium citrate monohydrate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, N.J.) in an about 1:2.8 weight\/weight ratio. The composition heated at approximately 87\u00b0 C. for about 15 minutes. The permeability in the banded region was measured as about 4 CU.","During cigarette production, approximately 100 cigarettes were collected after about multiples of about 6,000 cigarettes were produced. The banded, reduced IP, papers ran substantially the same as the non-banded standard cigarette paper. No manufacturing or packing problems were observed.","Table 2 indicates IP and freeburn results for the control cigarette. The results in Table 3 and Table 4 indicate that the reduced IP prototypes cigarettes were characterized as having significant IP reduction, relative to the control, while maintaining the ability to freeburn in the static state.","Applicants observed that the manufacturing of cigarettes 1-B and 1-C gave a population of banded cigarettes. The band position of grab samples, collected on the cigarette-making machine immediately after manufacture, were believed to have sequentially related band positions. Overall, the band position relationship between the grab samples and the population as a whole was believed to be quasi-random. The results in Tables 2 and 3 show that the freeburn and IP reduction for the grab samples was similar to the population average.","The smoke taste profile of cigarettes 1-B and 1-C were substantially the same as control cigarette 1-A in terms of taste when smoking within banded areas and smoking in the untreated, non-banded, areas.

The cigarettes were collected such that the individual cigarettes were randomly mixed in a collection box. Therefore, the band positions on the manufactured cigarettes may be characterized as random. The banded, reduced IP, papers ran substantially the same as non-banded cigarette paper A. No manufacturing problems were observed during cigarette production.","The IP and freeburn data in Table 18 demonstrate that at constant applied band composition, and application method, results may vary depending on the structure of the base paper. Articles prepared from the higher permeability papers, 10-E and 10-H, showed lower IP pass rates than articles 10-A through 10-F. Applicants believe that increasing the applied amount of the composition will increase IP pass rate for higher base paper permeability types (such as 10-E and 10-G). For articles 10-A through 10-D and 10-F applicants fully expect that the freeburn value may be increased by the incorporation of a burn rate accelerating substance in the band.","Article type 10-F used an about 18 CU base paper (A) electrostatically perforated, before band printing, to about 70 CU. After banding, the permeability in the band region was measured as about 57 CU. Article type 10-A, utilizing base paper A, had a measured band permeability of about 5 CU. Interestingly, article types 10-A and 10-F gave similar IP and freeburn results. This example demonstrates the unexpected result that perforation in the banded region, at the level applied, does not degrade the IP performance. Applicants fully anticipate higher levels of perforation may give similar results.","An important consideration for the design of commercially acceptable reduced IP articles is product smoke delivery. Smoke delivery is the quantity of various smoke components produced by the article during its consumption. For this example, carbon monoxide was used as a surrogate for all components delivered by the article. An article manufactured from a paper containing a banded region of lower permeability than the non-banded region may display increased smoke delivery relative to the non-banded control article. The width, spacing, composition, and number of the bands may also affect smoke delivery changes.","For example in Table 19, an article type prepared from base paper A gave a carbon monoxide delivery of about 18.2 milligrams\/cigarette, but the same wrapper in a banded state (band permeability about 5 CU) caused the delivery to increase to about 21.3 milligrams\/cigarette. Applicants have demonstrated that substituting a higher permeability base paper will afford smoke deliveries similar to the control type (for example 10-B through 10-G versus control).","Additionally, applicants have discovered the unexpected result that incorporating a burn accelerating substance in the band (such as article type 6-C) can give a lower smoke delivery relative to the banded article not containing the burn accelerating substance (such article type 10-A).",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e8247","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00019","num":"00019"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 19"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Carbon Monoxide Content of Banded and Control Articles."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Cigarette Type","Carbon Monoxide (milligrams\/cigarette)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Control*","18.2"]},{"entry":[{},"10-A","21.3"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20026-C","20.6"]},{"entry":[{},"10-B","18.3"]},{"entry":[{},"10-C","18.4"]},{"entry":[{},"10-D","17.6"]},{"entry":[{},"10-E","17.3"]},{"entry":[{},"10-F","18.5"]},{"entry":[{},"10-G","17.6"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"*Control, non-banded, article manufactured with base paper A "]}]}}]}}},"Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description.
