{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/920,500 filed Dec. 24, 2013, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention provides novel tricyclic compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and methods of using them, for example, for the treatment or prophylaxis of certain cancers and to their use in therapy.","The genomes of eukaryotic organisms are highly organized within the nucleus of the cell. The long strands of duplex DNA are wrapped around an octomer of histone proteins to form a nucleosome. This basic unit is then further compressed by the aggregation and folding of nucleosomes to form a highly condensed chromatin structure. A range of different states of condensation are possible, and the tightness of this structure varies during the cell cycle, being most compact during the process of cell division. There has been appreciation recently that chromatin templates form a fundamentally important set of gene control mechanisms referred to as epigenetic regulation. By conferring a wide range of specific chemical modifications to histones and DNA (such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation and SUMOylation) epigenetic regulators modulate the structure, function and accessibility of our genome, thereby exerting a huge impact in gene expression.","Histone acetylation is most usually associated with the activation of gene transcription, as the modification loosens the interaction of the DNA and the histone octomer by changing the electrostatics. In addition to this physical change, specific proteins bind to acetylated lysine residues within histones to read the epigenetic code. Bromodomains are small (\u02dc110 amino acid) distinct domains within proteins that bind to acetylated lysine residues commonly but not exclusively in the context of histones. There is a family of around 50 proteins known to contain bromodomains, and they have a range of functions within the cell. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteins comprises 4 proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRD-T) which contain tandem bromodomains capable of binding to two acetylated lysine residues in close proximity, increasing the specificity of the interaction.","BRD2 and BRD3 are reported to associate with histones along actively transcribed genes and may be involved in facilitating transcriptional elongation (Leroy et al., Mol. Cell. 2008 30(1):51-60), while BRD4 appears to be involved in the recruitment of the pTEF-I3 complex to inducible genes, resulting in phosphorylation of RNA polymerase and increased transcriptional output (Hargreaves et al., Cell, 2009 138(1): 1294145). All family members have been reported to have some function in controlling or executing aspects of the cell cycle, and have been shown to remain in complex with chromosomes during cell division\u2014suggesting a role in the maintenance of epigenetic memory. In addition some viruses make use of these proteins to tether their genomes to the host cell chromatin, as part of the process of viral replication (You et al., Cell, 2004 117(3):349-60).","Recent articles relating to this target include Prinjha et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, March 2012, Vol. 33, No. 3, pp. 146-153; Conway, ACS Med. Chem. Lett., 2012, 3, 691-694 and Hewings et al., J. Med. Chem., 2012, 55, 9393-9413.","Small molecule BET inhibitors that are reported to be in development include GSK-525762A, OTX-015, TEN-010 as well as others from the University of Oxford and Constellation Pharmaceuticals Inc.","Hundreds of epigenetic effectors have been identified, many of which are chromatin-binding proteins or chromatin-modifying enzymes. These proteins have been associated with a variety of disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, inflammation and cancer. Thus, these compounds which inhibit the binding of a bromodomain with its cognate acetylated proteins, promise new approaches in the treatment of a range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions and in the treatment of various types of cancer.","There is provided a compound of formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"28.79mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09458156-20161004-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"A is optionally substituted heterocyclo or optionally substituted heteroaryl, wherein the substituents are one or more R;","R is independently one or more hydrogen, CD, halogen, haloalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, CN, CF, CHF, CHF, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkoxy, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl, optionally substituted heterocyclo, \u2014OR, \u2014CONRR, \u2014NRR, NRR(C-C)alkyl-, \u2014NROCOR, \u2014NRCOR, NRCOR(C-C)alkyl-, \u2014NRCOR, NRCOR(C-C)alkyl-, \u2014NRCONRR, \u2014SONRR, SO(C-C)alkyl-, \u2014NRSONRR, \u2014NRSORor NRSOR(C-C)alkyl-;","X and Y are independently selected from hydrogen, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted heteroaryl or optionally substituted heterocyclo;","Z is hydrogen, halogen, \u2014OH, (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)alkoxy, \u2014NRR, \u2014CONRR, \u2014OCONRR, \u2014NROCOR, \u2014NRCONRR, \u2014NRSONRRor \u2014NRSOR;","Ris, independently at each occurrence, one or more hydrogen, halogen, \u2014CN, \u2014OR, \u2014NRR, \u2014CONRR, \u2014COOH, \u2014OCONRR, \u2014NROCOR, \u2014NRCONRR, \u2014NRSONRR, \u2014NRSOR, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkenyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkynyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkoxy, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl-CO\u2014, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted aryl (C-C)alkoxy, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl (C-C)alkoxy, optionally substituted heterocyclyl-CO\u2014, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-SO\u2014, \u2014NRSO-optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, \u2014NRSO-optionally substituted heterocyclo, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-NRSO\u2014 or optionally substituted heterocyclo-NRSO\u2014;","Ris hydrogen, halogen, \u2014CN, OH, \u2014CONRR, \u2014NRCOOR, \u2014NRCONRR, \u2014NRCOR, \u2014NRSOR, \u2014SONRR, \u2014NRSONRR, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl, optionally substituted (C-C) alkoxy, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted aryl-SO, optionally substituted heteroaryl or optionally substituted heterocyclo;","Ris hydrogen, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkenyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkynyl, cyano(C-C)alkyl, hydroxy(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted aryl(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted aryloxy(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl or optionally substituted heteroaryl(C-C)alkyl,","Ris hydrogen, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl or optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl;","or Rand Rmay be taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted (C-C) heteroaryl or (C-C) heterocyclic ring; Ris hydrogen, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)cycloalkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkenyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkynyl, cyano(C-C)alkyl, hydroxy(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted aryl(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted aryloxy(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl-SO\u2014, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl(C-C)alkyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl or optionally substituted heteroaryl(C-C)alkyl;","Ris hydrogen or optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl;","Ris hydrogen, optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl, \u2014OR, CN or halogen;","and\/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, tautomer or stereoisomer thereof.","In another aspect, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.","In another aspect, there is provided a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in therapy.

Autoimmune diseases are characterized in that the cells of the immune system produce antibodies against its own organs and molecules or directly attack tissues resulting in the destruction of the latter. A failure of those self-reactive cells to undergo apoptosis leads to the manifestation of the disease. Defects in apoptosis regulation have been identified in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.","Thus, according to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating an autoimmune disease by providing to a patient in need thereof a compound or composition of the present invention.

The substituent Hal is a halide. L is a leaving group such as a halide or OH that can be easily converted to a leaving group such as a triflate. As shown in Scheme 1, a general procedure for the preparation of compounds of the invention involves starting with the substituted aminopyridine 1. Coupling of 1 with the aromatic heterocycle A (2, where M is a suitable coupling partner, such as boronic acid, boronic ester or stannane) using a suitable catalyst can yield functionalized aminopyridines 3. For example, 3 could arise from a Suzuki coupling reaction between 5-bromo-2-chloropyridin-3-amine and a heteroaromatic boronic acid using Pd(dppf)Clas a catalyst. Subsequent coupling to give the functionalized aniline 6 can be achieved using a variety of conditions known in the literature. For example, aminopyridine 3 can undergo copper-mediated coupling with a suitably substituted arene 4 (where M is a boronic acid, boronic ester or stannane) to give aniline 6. Alternatively, 6 could arise from a Buchwald N-arylation reaction of 3 with an aromatic halide 5 (where Hal is a halide). Ring closure to generate carboline 7 can be achieved using a Pd catalyst in the presence of a base, such as sodium acetate. In the final step, the carboline nitrogen can be substituted under Mitsunobu conditions using triphenylphosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) with an alkylating agent 8 (where X is OH). Alternatively, functionalized carboline 10 can be generated from a displacement reaction between the carboline 7 and an alkylating agent 9, where L is a leaving group such as a halide, mesylate or triflate, in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate.

The residue was purified using ISCO silica gel chromatography (40 g column, gradient from 0% to 50% EtOAc\/CHCl) to give the title compound (139 mg) as an impure mixture which was carried on to the subsequent step without further purification. LCMS (M+H)=496.2; HPLC RT=3.06 min (Column: Chromolith ODS S5 4.6\u00d750 mm; Mobile Phase A: 10:90 MeOH:water with 0.1% TFA; Mobile Phase B: 90:10 MeOH:water with 0.1% TFA; Temperature: 40\u00b0 C.; Gradient: 0-100% B over 4 min; Flow: 4 mL\/min).","A 250 mL round bottom flask containing methyl 3-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-5-(phenyl(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)methyl)-5H-pyrido[3,2-b]indole-7-carboxylate (1.58 g, 3.19 mmol) in CHCl(50 mL) was cooled in an ice\/MeOH bath. MeMgBr, (3M in EtO, 17.0 mL, 51.0 mmol) was added slowly over 2 min. The resulting suspension was stirred for 2.5 h and then quenched carefully with sat. NHCl. Ice was added to the reaction mixture followed by 10% LiCl solution. The aqueous layer was extracted with CHCl(2\u00d7). The organic layer was dried over MgSO, filtered and concentrated to give racemic 2-[3-(dimethyl-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)-5-[oxan-4-yl(phenyl)methyl]-5H-pyrido[3,2-b]indol-7-yl]propan-2-ol, which was separated using chiral prep SFC (Column: Chiral OD-H 25\u00d73 cm, 5 \u03bcm; Mobile Phase: 70\/30 CO\/MeOH; Flow: 85 mL\/min). The faster eluting peak was concentrated to a small volume. Water was added to form a white precipitate which was collected via filtration, rinsing with water, to give a white solid which was assigned as Enantiomer A (0.59 g, 36%). The slower eluting peak was treated in an identical manner and assigned as Enantiomer B (0.51 g, 31%).
