{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Payments using mobile devices began as simple interactions that would allow a mobile device holder to pay for items within vending machines using a mobile device. Short Message Service (SMS) messages may be used to communicate such payments by entering a code associated with a particular vending machine. The message is received by the vending machine, the item is dispensed and mobile device holder's account is debited the appropriate amount for the selected item. Over time, mobile payments have grown to include mobile banking and mobile credit cards. Mobile devices may be used to transfer money from one mobile banking account to another, pay utility bills, pay parking fees, etc.","However, mobile devices have not gained wide acceptance for use as payment vehicles at a point-of-sale (POS) in, e.g., merchant locations. Here, the traditional payment vehicles, e.g., credit\/debit cards, cash and checks still reign supreme. This is because POS terminals must undergo a certification processes with back-end transaction processors to ensure compatibility with their systems and compliance with security regulations.","Systems and methods are provided for making purchases at a merchant point-of-sale (POS) device using a mobile device. Transaction information may be communicated from the POS device to the mobile device and an authorization from the purchaser to proceed with the transaction returned to the POS device from the mobile device. After authorization, the POS device may communicate the transaction information together with an identifier of the mobile device to a financial institution to process payment. The financial institution may confirm the transaction with the purchaser at the mobile device using the identifier of the mobile device. Upon receiving a confirmation response from the mobile device, the financial institution may then transfer funds from a purchaser account to a merchant account. A confirmation of the transfer may be provided to the merchant and the purchaser, after which, the transaction may be completed at the merchant POS device where a receipt is printed and provided to the purchaser.","It should be noted that this summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Certain specific details are set forth in this description and accompanying figures to provide a thorough understanding of various aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter. However, certain well-known details often associated with computing and software technology are not set forth in this disclosure in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring these various aspects. Further, those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that they can practice other aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter without one or more of the details described below. Finally, while various methods are described with reference to steps and sequences in this description, the description as such is for providing a clear implementation of the aforementioned aspects, and the steps and sequences of steps should not be taken as required to practice this subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","101","101","106","106","108","110"]},"The mobile computing device  may be a personal digital assistant, a mobile phone, a personal portable computer, etc. The mobile computing device  may be capable of sending text messages, making voice calls, Internet browsing, personal organizer functions, e-mail, instant messaging, and infrared, near field communication (NFC) and BLUETOOTH connectivity.","NFC is a short-range high frequency wireless communication technology that enables the exchange of data between devices over a limited range of 10 cm. NFC is an extension of the ISO 14443 proximity-card standard (contactless card RFID) and may be considered a near field effect communication technique. BLUETOOTH is a wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances, and uses frequency-hopping spread spectrum communications techniques to achieve a data rate of 1 Mb\/s (or higher). BLUETOOTH provides a way to connect and exchange information between devices using the 2.4 GHz short-range radio frequency bandwidth. In accordance with some implementations, NFC or BLUETOOTH may be used to establish communications between the mobile computing device  and the point of sale device .","The merchant server computing device  may be connected to a network connection  to communicate with a merchant financial institution . An individual financial institution  may also communicate using the network connection . The network connection  and network connection  may be a communications connection such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, Wi-Fi, and the like.","The merchant  may hold an account at the merchant financial institution . The account may be any type of account for depositing funds, such as a savings account, a checking account, a brokerage account, and the like. The merchant server computing device  may communicate with merchant financial institution  or the individual financial institution  by way of the communications network  to send and receive information regarding transactions made at the point of sale device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["200","101","102","114","102","106","104","102","106"]},"At , the point-of-sale device provides a transaction ID to an application running on the mobile computing device. For example, using an NFC or Bluetooth connection established between the point-of-sale device  and mobile computing device , an application running on the mobile computing device  may receive transaction information from the merchant . The application may be a \u201cvirtual checkbook\u201d that provides a check register interface. The virtual checkbook application may show recent transactions, an account balance, etc., to provide current balance information about the individual's account with the individual financial institution . The individual  may enter and\/or receive transaction information into the virtual checkbook application. For example, the individual  may enter a merchant name, a transaction categorization (e.g. groceries, gasoline, etc.) and an amount into the register interface. The transaction ID may be a unique identifier of the transaction between the merchant  and the mobile computing device , and may be populated automatically or manually into the register interface.","At , the payment to the merchant is authorized using the application on the mobile computing device. The application may include a \u201csend\u201d or \u201cpurchase\u201d option that may be selected by the individual  to indicate that the transaction is authorized for payment to the merchant . The authorization may include a telephone number of the mobile computing device , an e-mail address associated with the individual , an Internet Protocol address, or other identifier such that an electronic message, telephone call, SMS message, etc. may be communicated to the mobile device  at a later time.","At , the point of sale device communicates information about the transaction to the merchant server computing device. This may include the transaction ID and the information acquired at . At , the merchant server computing device communicates with the individual financial institution to request a transfer funds to the merchant financial institution at an account associated with the merchant. For example, the merchant server computing device  may communicate a merchant account number and a routing number of the merchant financial institution  to the individual financial institution .","At , information regarding the transaction may be received by the individual financial institution. This information may include the transaction ID, a merchant identifier, an amount, identification of the goods or products to be purchased, the mobile device information, etc., and may be communicated to the individual financial institution  at .","At , the individual financial institution may send a confirmation request to the application on the mobile computing device. A confirmation request  may be communicated to the mobile computing device  using the information indicated at  to the individual financial institution . As such, a confirmation request  may be an e-mail, text message, telephone call etc. to the mobile computing device  to request a confirmation from the individual  that the transaction is to be completed.","At , it is determined if the confirmation is received. Using the mobile computing device , the user  may communicate a confirmation  to the individual financial institution  that the transaction is to be completed with the merchant . Only after receiving the confirmation , would the individual financial institution  send transaction approval information to the merchant server computing device  and transfer funds to the merchant financial institution .","In some implementations, the confirmation request  may request that the individual  approve a purchase within a predetermined amount of time or for a predetermined amount of money. Thus, individuals  may be allocated several minutes to \u201copt-out\u201d of a purchase by sending a \u201cno\u201d response; alternatively, individuals  could \u201copt-in\u201d by sending a \u201cyes\u201d response, depending on the system implementation. In some implementations, individuals  may not want to receive such requests , thus a configuration option may be set that a confirmation request  is sent only if a purchase is above an amount (e.g., $100). Furthermore, a combination of these two confirmation requests could be used.","For example, an individual  may configure options of three minutes for sending a confirmation , and $100 dollars as a threshold for sending a request . Thus, if a purchase was under $100 dollars and the confirmation  took more than three minutes to complete, a purchase may be conducted automatically (i.e., transactional approval information may be sent to a merchant , even if the confirmation  had not been received). However, if a purchase was over $100 and a confirmation  took over three minutes, the purchase could be delayed or canceled, or another confirmation request  may be sent to mobile computing device  (or different device).","If the confirmation is not received, then the process ends at . However if a confirmation is received, then at , the individual financial institution transfers the funds to the merchant account at the merchant financial institution. The transfer funds may be accomplished using an ACH transfer, wire transfer, mailing the physical check, etc. At , the individual financial institution confirms the transaction with the merchant server computing device and the mobile computing device. For example, the individual financial institution  may send a message over the network connection  to the merchant server computing device  to indicate the funds had been transferred from the individual's account at the individual financial institution  to the merchants account at the merchant financial institution . Likewise, an e-mail, text message, phone call, etc. may be communicated to the mobile computing device . The mobile computing device  may indicate the confirmation by e.g., changing a color of the transaction in the virtual checkbook application. This provides the appearance that the \u201ccheck\u201d associated with the transaction between the individual  and the merchant  has cleared. In addition, a running account balance displayed in the application may be updated to reflect the debit to the individuals account at the individual financial institution .","At , the merchant server computing device notifies the point-of-sale device of the completed transaction. A message may be communicated from the merchant server computing device  using a network connection  to the point-of-sale device  to activate a process whereby the transaction is completed. At , the point-of-sale device prints a receipt and a transaction is completed. Optionally, at , the mobile computing device  may send a confirmation to the individual financial institution of the completed transaction. For example, the individual one or two using the application running on the mobile computing device  may indicate to the individual financial institution  that the transaction has been completed to the individual satisfaction. At , the process ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","300","300","310"]},"Thus, the system  may send a purchase confirmation request  to the mobile computing device  and wait to receive a confirmation  from the mobile computing device . In so doing, the subsystem  may be configured to perform the following: receive transactional information from a merchant  regarding a pending transaction; determine an associated account  with the transactional information; send a confirmation request  to a mobile computing device  of an individual  associated with the account ; receive a confirmation ; and make a determination based on the confirmation  whether to send transactional approval information to the merchant .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","102","104","101","104","106","104","102","104","114","102","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","102","101","104","502","104","114","114"]},"At , a transaction ID, merchant information, and amounts of the transaction are communicated to the individual financial institution. For example, using the an NFC or Bluetooth connection between the mobile computing device  and the point-of-sale device , this information may be passed from the point-of-sale device  to the mobile computing device  and uploaded to the individual financial institution  through the Web bill pay site. Alternatively, the individual one or two may enter this information manually into a Web browser and submit it to the individual financial institution through the Web bill pay site.","At , the individual financial institution determines or receives the account and routing information associated with the merchant financial institution and the merchant. This information may be received in a communication at , or may be derived based on information stored by the individual financial institution  about the merchant  and the merchant financial institution .","At , the individual financial institution communicates the mobile computing device to request a confirmation. The confirmation may be communicated as a webpage that is communicated from the individual financial institution  to the mobile computing device . At , it is determined if a confirmation is received. The confirmation may be received from the mobile computing device  as a user input to the webpage communicated at . If no confirmation is received, the process ends at . If a confirmation is received at , then the process continues at  () and proceeds as described above.","Thus, as described above implementations of the present disclosure provide for payments using a mobile device that are processed as \u201cvirtual checks.\u201d Such processing may be performed using the same backend systems that are used to process paper checks. In addition, such processing eliminates the credit card transaction fees that are charged to merchants, while provides a near instantaneous transfer of funds from the individual bank account to the merchant bank account.","It should be noted that the various aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in various combinations of the components discussed with reference to  and on the exemplary computing device discussed with reference to .","Exemplary Computing Arrangement",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations may be used.
