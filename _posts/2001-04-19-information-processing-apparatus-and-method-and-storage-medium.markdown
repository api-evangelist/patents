{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for information processing and a storage medium for storing such a method. More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus and a method for information processing and a storage medium for accommodating that method, whereby an avatar that is active in a shared virtual space is made to output a sound during a chat.","There have existed personal computer network services such as NIFTY-Serve (trademark) of Japan and CompuServe (trademark) of the United State. Each of these entities allows a plurality of users to connect their personal computers through modems and over a public switched telephone network to a centrally located host computer in accordance with a predetermined communication protocol. A cyberspace service called Habitat (trademark) has been known in this field.","The development of Habitat was started in 1985 by LucasFilm Ltd. of the United States. When completed, Habitat was run by QuantumLink, a U.S. commercial network, for about three years before Fujitsu Habitat (trademark) began to be offered in Japan by NIFTY-Serve in February 1990. Habitat embraces a virtual city called \u201cPopulopolis\u201d which, drawn in two-dimensional graphics, is inhabited by users' alter egos called avatars (incarnations of Hindu deities) Through their avatars, the users carry on between them what is known as a chat (a real-time text-based dialogue in which characters are input and read by users). More detailed information about Habitat is found in \u201cCyberspace: First Steps\u201d (ed. by Michael Benedikt, 1991, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., ISBN0-262-02327-X, PP. 282\u2013307).","In a conventional cyberspace system run by the above-mentioned type of personal computer network service, virtual streets as well as house interiors were described in two-dimensional graphics. For apparent movement toward the depth of a scene or back to its front side, avatars were simply moved upward or downward against a two-dimensional background. There was precious little power of expression to make users enjoy a virtual experience of walking or moving about in the virtual space. Furthermore, a given user's avatar was viewed along with other users' avatars simply from a third party's point of view in the virtual space. This was another factor detracting from the effort to let users have more impressive virtual sensory experiences.","In order to improve on such more or less unimpressive proxy experiences, there have been proposed functions which display a virtual space in three-dimensional graphics and which allow users freely to move about in the virtual space from their avatars' points of view. Such functions, disclosed illustratively in U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,038, are implemented by use of 3D graphic data in description language called VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). A description of various cyberspace environments in which users may carry on chats using avatars is found in the Sep. 9, 1996 issue of Nikkei Electronics (a Japanese periodical, No. 670, pp. 151\u2013159).","Where avatars and so-called virtual pets are set to be active in such a virtual space, users are expected conventionally to operate predetermined keys selectively in order to get their avatars or virtual pets to do certain actions.","Illustratively, the present applicant has proposed a plurality of keys by which to cause an avatar to execute a set of actions in a virtual space, as shown in .","In the example of , an active key A operated by a user enables an avatar to call up a virtual pet. Operating a sleep key B causes the avatar to put the virtual pet to sleep.","Operating a feed key C causes the avatar to feed the virtual pet. A smile-and-praise key D, when operated by the user, causes the avatar to smile at and praise the virtual pet. Operation of a play-tag key E prompts the avatar to play tag with the pet in the virtual space.","A scold key F when operated causes the avatar to scold the virtual pet for discipline. Operating a brush-and-groom key G causes the avatar to brush and groom the virtual pet.","In such an environment, each action performed by the avatar corresponds to a key that needs to be operated. To get the avatar to execute more actions requires setting up more keys. The user must select one of the numerous keys for any desired action to be done by the avatar; the procedure involved makes it difficult to get the avatar to carry out desired actions rapidly.","The avatars' various actions are often performed during chats carried on between them. In such cases, the users entering strings of characters through a keyboard to conduct their chats need to find and operate suitable keys to execute desired actions by their avatars. This requires the users to get their hands off the keyboard to make the necessary operations, which tends to hamper the users' smooth text input.","The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides an apparatus and a method for causing avatars to execute actions quickly without obstructing chats.","In carrying out the present invention and according to one aspect thereof, there is provided an information processing apparatus which is connected to a server along with other information processing apparatuses through a network and which is supplied with a shared virtual space, the information processing apparatus comprises an inputting element for allowing a user to input strings of characters constituting a chat carried on via an avatar which is active in the shared virtual space as an incarnation of the user, a transmitting element for transmitting strings of characters input through the inputting element to the server as character data, a converting element for converting the character data coming from the server into audio data, and an outputting element for audibly outputting the audio data converted by the converting element.","In a preferred structure according to the present invention, the converting element may include a correspondence table storing element for storing a correspondence table in which character data are made to correspond with audio data, and a processing element for referencing the correspondence table storing element so as to convert character data transmitted from the server into the corresponding audio data.","In another preferred structure according to the present invention, the information processing apparatus may further comprise a correspondence table updating element which, in response to a query from the server, transmits to the server an ID representing a type of the correspondence table stored in the correspondence table storing element, wherein, if the server returns an updated correspondence table in response to the ID transmitted thereto, then the correspondence table updating element stores the updated correspondence table into the correspondence table storing element.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing method for use with an information processing apparatus which is connected to a server along with other information processing apparatuses through a network and which is supplied with a shared virtual space, the information processing method comprises the steps of allowing a user to input strings of characters constituting a chat carried on via an avatar which is active in the shared virtual space as an incarnation of the user, transmitting the strings of characters input in the inputting step to the server as character data, converting the character data coming from the server into audio data, and audibly outputting the audio data converted in the converting step.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a storage medium which stores a computer-readable program for use by an information processing apparatus which is connected to a server along with other information processing apparatuses through a network and which is supplied with a shared virtual space, the program comprises the steps of allowing a user to input strings of characters constituting a chat carried on via an avatar which is active in the shared virtual space as an incarnation of the user, transmitting the strings of characters input in the inputting step to the server as character data, converting the character data coming from the server into audio data, and audibly outputting the audio data converted in the converting step.","Through the use of the above-outlined information processing apparatus and method as well as storage medium for storing a program representing that method, strings of characters included in chats are converted to a sound that is output.","Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent upon a reading of the following description and appended drawings.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","For the moment, the description of the embodiments is preceded by an explanation hereunder of VRML (virtual reality modeling language), a description language capable of handling three-dimensional information in unified fashion through the use of a framework called WWW (World Wide Web) that offers diverse kinds of information over the Internet, a globally established computer network.","The WWW, an information offering system utilized on the Internet, was developed by CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. The system permits browsing over the network of information made up of text, images and sounds in what is known as hypertext format. Information held in WWW servers is transferred asynchronously to terminals such as personal computers in accordance with a protocol called HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).","The WWW server is constituted by server software called an HTTP demon and by HTML files that store hypertext information. The demon signifies programs that perform management and processing in the background in a UNIX work environment. Hypertext information is expressed in description language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). A hypertext description expresses a logical text structure enclosed by format codes \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d called tags. Description of links to other information is provided by link information called anchors. Locations of information are designated by anchors using URL (Uniform Resource Locator).","Files described in HTML are transferred over a TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) network in accordance with the HTTP protocol. HTTP transfers requests from clients for information to WWW servers and sends hypertext information in HTML files back to the clients.","An environment in which to utilize the WWW is provided by client software called WWW browsers such as Netscape Navigator (trademark of Netscape Communications Corporation of the United States).","WWW browsers allow users to look up so-called websites, i.e., URL-compatible files in WWW servers located over the Internet expanded throughout the world. In what is known as net-surfing, users can hop from one website to another through links to access multitudes of WWW information sources.","Recently a new type of browsers called VRML browsers has been developed. A VRML browser permits users to access WWW servers one after another through links established in hypertext regarding objects drawn in an extended WWW format, i.e., three-dimensional graphics in a 3D space described in 3D graphics description language called VRML.","Details of VRML are described illustratively in \u201cVRML: Browsing & Building Cyberspace\u201d (by Mark Pesce; 1995, New Readers Publishing, ISBN 1-56205-498-8) and in \u201cLatest Trends of VRML and CyberPassage\u201d (articles by Koichi Matsuda and Yasuaki Honda in a Japanese periodical \u201cbit\u201d published by Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., 1996; Vol. 28, No. 7, pp. 29\u201336; No. 8, pp. 57\u201365; No, 9, pp. 29\u201336; No. 10, pp. 49\u201358).","When a file described in VRML-compatible file format is transferred from a server to a user's personal computer and processed by browser, a three-dimensional virtual space is computed on the basis of VRML data. The 3D virtual space thus computed is allowed to appear on a display of the user's personal computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In , reference numerals ,  and  denote client PCs (personal computers) in which a VRML browser and a WWW browser are installed and active.

The received file and contents are recorded onto the local HDD . Netscape Navigator processes the HTML file to display text and images on the CRT monitor. Community Place Browser, on the other hand, processes the VRML file to display a 3D virtual space on the CRT monitor and varies the behaviors of objects in the 3D virtual space in keeping with the results of processing of the script programs by the Java interpreter.","Although not shown, the other client PCs  and  have the same structure as the client PC .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["12","12","1","30","46","130","146"]},"Below is a description of how the above-described embodiment of the present invention works.","As an example, it is assumed here that VRML contents are downloaded over the Internet and turned into a multi-user environment where a single virtual space is shared by a plurality of users. Typical steps constituting the processing involved are described below with reference to .","In , as indicated by numeral (1), the WWW browser is first used to browse the home page of a website offering VRML contents. In this example, a typical website is looked up. As pointed to by numeral (2), users of the client PCs  and  each download from the website the VRML contents made up of the VRML 2.0 file and script program (Java-based growth script program) to implement autonomous avatar behavior in a VRML space.","Obviously, the VRML contents may be provided by means of a CD-ROM disk  and may be read therefrom through the CD-ROM drive .","In each of the client PCs  and , as shown in , Community Place Browser acting as a VRML 2.0 browser interprets and executes the VRML 2.0 file that has been downloaded and stored onto the local HDD . As indicated by numeral (3), the browser queries the WLS  about a URL of the shared server  based on VSCP (Virtual Society Server Client Protocol). In response, as indicated by numeral (4), the WLS  refers to a shared server URL management table held on the HDD and notifies the client PCs  and  of the URL of the shared server  retrieved from the table.","Using the URL, the client PCs  and  link up to the shared server  as illustrated in . The linkup permits transmission of shared messages through the shared server  regarding locations and motions of shared 3D objects, as indicated by numeral (5). The transmission of the shared messages implements a multi-user environment, as pointed to by numeral (6).","More detailed steps for implementing the connection above are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,038.","The AO server  that manages behaviors of virtual life objects in the shared virtual space exchange data about the virtual life objects with the shared server  by use of VSAP.","Below is a description of processes performed when a client PC (e.g., client PC ) accesses the shared server  to take part in a shared virtual space. When accessed by the client PC , the shared server  causes the client PC  to acquire and retain data making up a table of correspondence between character strings and sounds so that the client will be able to carry on a chat. The shared server  performs steps constituting the flowchart of , while the client PC  executes steps forming the flowchart of .","In step S, the CPU  of the shared server  waits for the client PC  to gain access to the virtual world. When the client PC  is judged to have gained access, step S is reached. In step S, the accessing client PC (PC  in this case) is asked if it has the table of correspondence between character strings and sounds. This is a table that describes relations between character strings and the sounds corresponding thereto, as shown in . In the example of , a sound  is stored corresponding to a character string \u201cGood afternoon\u201d; a sound  is stored corresponding to a character string \u201cGood evening\u201d; and so on. A sound \u201cn\u201d is stored corresponding to a character string \u201cYoo-hoo.\u201d","The sound  denotes data representing a corresponding sound generated by the avatar when the character string \u201cGood afternoon\u201d is detected; the sound  stands for data representing a corresponding sound generated by the avatar when the character string \u201cGood evening\u201d is detected; and son on. The sound \u201cn\u201d denotes data indicative of a corresponding sound generated by the avatar when the character string \u201cYoo-hoo\u201d is detected.","In step S of , the CPU  of the client PC  having accessed the virtual world waits to be asked about the correspondence table by the shared server . When queried about the correspondence table, the CPU  goes to step S. In step S, a check is made to see if the client PC  retains the correspondence table in question. More specifically, the CPU  ascertains whether the hard disk drive  contains the table of correspondence between character strings and sounds. If no such table is found, step S is reached in which the CPU  notifies the shared server  of the absence of the table in question through the modem  and over the Internet .","If in step S the character string-to-sound correspondence table is judged stored on the hard disk drive , then step S is reached. In step S, the CPU  reads the stored correspondence table ID from the hard disk drive  and notifies the shared server  of the presence of the table through the modem  and over the Internet .","Step S follows step S in which the CPU  of the shared server  asked the client PC whether it had the correspondence table. In step S, the CPU  waits for a response from the client PC. Given a response, the CPU  determines whether the client PC has the latest correspondence table.","That is, upon receipt of a correspondence table ID from the client PC , the CPU  compares the ID with that of the correspondence table held on its own hard disk drive . If the ID from the client PC is judged to be an old ID upon comparison, step S is reached in which the latest correspondence table is read from the hard disk drive  and transmitted to the client PC. More specifically, the CPU  sends data constituting the correspondence table retrieved from the hard disk drive , to the client PC  through a modem  and over the Internet .","A similar process is also carried out when the client PC has reported the absence of such a correspondence table.","Meanwhile, if the CPU  judges that the ID from the client PC matches that of the latest correspondence table the server possesses, then there is no need to transmit the table. In that case, step S is reached and subsequent steps are repeated.","After step S or S, the CPU  of the client PC  reaches step S in which a check is made to see if the correspondence table data have been transmitted from the shared server . If the data are judged to have been sent, step S is reached in which the transmitted correspondence table is stored onto the hard disk drive . If the correspondence table has not been sent within a predetermined time period, step S is skipped.","In the manner described, each client PC taking part in the 3D virtual space (world) offered by the shared server  is made to retain beforehand the table of correspondence between character strings and sounds shown in .","On the CRT monitor  of each client PC participating in the virtual world, the browser causes a picture shown in  to appear. More specifically, on the left-hand half of the screen, a world display window  appears along with an image of the virtual world in which the client PCs are taking part.","To the right of the world display window  appears a multi-user window . At the top of the window  is an action key display area  showing keys for each user to operate when prompting his or her virtual pet to perform certain actions in the virtual world.

Upon receipt of a chat message from a user, the CPU  transfers in step S the message to the client PCs of other users whose avatars are located near the avatar of the message-originating user. The CPU  of the shared server  repeats this process.","In step S of , the CPU  of a client PC checks to see if a chat message transmission is ordered. If the order is judged to be given, step S is reached in which the CPU  checks whether a chat message has been input. That is, a check is made to see if a chat message to be transmitted is displayed in the input chat display area  of  after being input by the user operating the keyboard . If no chat message is judged input, step S is reached in which the CPU  performs error processing.

In that case, as shown in , the screen displayed by the user A's browser shows the user's own avatar \u201call\u201d at the center with the avatar \u201cb\u201d on the right and avatar \u201cc\u201d on the left; the screen displayed by the user B's browser indicates the user's own avatar \u201cb\u201d at the center with the avatar \u201cc\u201d on the right and avatar \u201ca\u201d on the left; the screen displayed by the user C's browser likewise presents the user's own avatar \u201cc\u201d at the center with the avatar \u201ca\u201d on the right and the avatar \u201cb\u201d on the left.","It is also possible for each user to make his or her own avatar disappear from the screen.","Suppose now that, as shown illustratively in , the user A of the avatar \u201ca\u201d outputs a message \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d The message is transferred by the shared server  (called Community Place Bureau) to the other avatars (avatars \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d in this example) near the avatar \u201ca\u201d as indicated in . As a result, the message \u201cGood afternoon\u201d appears as a chat message from the avatar \u201ca\u201d in the chat log display area  on each user's browser screen.","The CPU  of the client PC then goes to step S. In step S, the CPU  checks to see if the user has ordered an end to the chat. If there is no order to end the chat, step S is reached again and subsequent steps are repeated.","If in step S transmission of the chat message is not judged to be ordered, the CPU  goes to step S. In step S, the CPU  checks whether any chat message has been sent from another user (i.e., avatar). If a chat message is not judged to be sent from any other user, step S is reached in which a check is made to see if a chat end order is issued. If the chat end order is not judged issued, step S is reached again and subsequent steps are repeated.","If in step S a chat message is judged to have been transmitted from another user, step S is reached. In step S, the CPU  causes the modem  to receive the chat message transferred over the Internet . In step S, the CPU  checks whether the correspondence table contains any sound corresponding to the message received in step S. Illustratively, if a message \u201cGood afternoon\u201d is received, a search is made for the matching sound through the character string-to-sound correspondence table retained on the hard disk drive .","In step S, the CPU  judges, following the search, whether the sound matching the received chat message exists in the correspondence table. If the corresponding sound is judged to exist, step S is reached in which the sound is audibly output as a voice of the avatar representing the user who has sent the message in question.","In the example of , the user B's screen illustratively displays the message \u201cGood afternoon\u201d coming from the avatar \u201ca.\u201d In such a case, the CPU  of the user B's client PC  checks to see if a character string \u201cGood afternoon\u201d is found in the correspondence table retained on the hard disk drive . If the character string is judged to exist in the correspondence table, the corresponding sound is retrieved from the table. In the example of , the sound  is stored in correspondence with the character string \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d The CPU  of the user B's client PC  then feeds data constituting the sound  to the sound processing circuit  for speech synthesis. The resulting sound is audibly output by the speakers  and  as a voice of the avatar \u201ca\u201d displayed on the CRT monitor .","In this manner, with the avatar \u201ca\u201d displayed as shown in , the received chat message \u201cGood afternoon\u201d from the avatar \u201ca\u201d is turned into a voice \u201cGood afternoon\u201d that is apparently generated by the avatar \u201ca\u201d as indicated in .","If in step S no sound is judged to exist corresponding to the character string constituting the chat message, then step S is skipped and step S is reached.

If a chat end order is judged to be given in step S, the chat process is terminated.","Although images in the shared virtual space have been described above as generated on the side of client PCs, this is not limitative of the invention; these images may be generated alternatively by the shared server . The alternative setup, however, tends to increase burdens on the shared server  as the number of client PCs connected to the server  grows. Under the circumstances, it is preferable for the client PCs to take on the processing involved.","The above series of steps may be executed either on a hardware or on a software basis. If the steps are to be carried out by software, the programs involved are installed into the client PCS ,  and  as well as into the shared server  from the Internet  or from a suitable storage medium.","As shown in  or , the storage medium is distributed, apart from computers, for the purpose of providing users with necessary programs.

The programs may otherwise be offered to users in a manner preinstalled in the ROMs  and  or on the hard disk drives  and  of the client PC  and shared server .","In this specification, the steps which are stored on a program storage medium and which describe the programs to be executed represent not only processes that are carried out in the depicted sequence (i.e., on a time series basis) but also those that are conducted parallelly or individually.","In this specification, the term \u201csystem\u201d refers to a whole configuration made up of a plurality of component devices.","As described, the information processing apparatus and method according to the invention as well as the inventive program stored on the storage medium allow sounds to be generated corresponding to character strings included in chats. During a text-based chat session, avatars are made to act in diverse fashion rapidly and reliably so that the users may enjoy proxy conversations of enriched contents. In such cases, manipulative chores that could hamper the smooth flow of users' chat-related operations are reduced. Because the amount of data to be transmitted is substantially less than that of audio data, a sound-based chat system is implemented with no change or addition to the existing network system.","As many apparently different embodiments of this invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
