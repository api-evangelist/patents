Field of the Invention","The present invention is related to computer aided design and to electronic maps, and in particular, to computer aided event and venue setup and to interactive maps.","2. Description of the Related Art","Event ticketing typically involves pricing and selling tickets. Certain conventional techniques statically price event tickets. That is, once a price is set for a ticket or class of tickets with respect to an initial sale of those tickets, the price does not change. Further, using conventional techniques, ticket pricing is often based on insufficient information, resulting in ticket prices that are too high or too low given the actual demand for such tickets.","In addition, ever greater numbers of event ticket are sold online, rather than via telephone or brick-and-mortar outlets. However, conventional seating maps for venues presented in conjunction with such online sales tend to be static, and fail to adequately provide relevant real time dynamic data. Further, conventional seating maps fail to provide adequate interfaces for enabling users to quickly locate suitable seats.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects.

Data stores (e.g., databases) may be used to store some or all of the information discussed herein (e.g., seating maps, pricing information, seat status, purchase information, ticket information, etc.).","By way of example, a given computing device may optionally include user interface devices, such as some or all of the following: one or more displays, keyboards, touch screens, speakers, microphones, mice, track balls, touch pads, printers, etc. The computing device may optionally include a media read\/write device, such as a CD, DVD, Blu-ray, tape, magnetic disc, semiconductor memory, or other optical, magnetic, and\/or solid state media device. A computing device, such as a user terminal, may be in the form of a general purpose computer, a personal computer, a laptop, a tablet computer, a mobile or stationary telephone, an interactive television, a set top box coupled to a display, etc.","Described herein are methods and systems for creating ticketed events and executing ticket sales. In particular, certain methods and systems described herein are configured to create ticketed events, set ticket prices, and execute ticket sales via dynamic interactive user interfaces.","An example ticket system, configured to set ticket prices and\/or to sell tickets, is networked (e.g., via the Internet or other network) to computing systems of box offices, promoters, artist managers, venue set-up personnel, social network systems, and\/or potential ticket purchasers. Thus, the ticket system may receive and\/or provide for display information and\/or instructions described herein to one or more of the foregoing networked systems and\/or other systems.","Certain embodiments receive and utilize information, such as event ticket sale information, timing of event, occurrence of competing attractions, and\/or other information to set initial pricing and\/or to adjust previously set pricing of event tickets. Certain embodiments provide interactive seating maps configured to facilitate user understanding of the available seats, prices, available discounts, seating packages, etc., by providing a unified view (including a graphical representation) of what may be a complex set of prices and promotions.","With respect to ticket pricing, certain embodiments utilize a model with high pricing granularity, optionally determined by statistical analysis and\/or other model in combination with price level flexing\/adjustment as a function of at least sell through (percentage or amount of available event tickets actually sold). Such high granularity can be two or more times the conventional granularity of four pricing points. For example, 8, 10, 16, 32, 64, or other number of pricing levels may be utilized, where different seats or seating sections can be associated with different pricing and where prices can be increased or decreased from a first pricing level to a second pricing level.","This increase in granular price levels enable ticket pricing to be set or adjusted to more precisely match user demand and\/or predicted user demand. However, certain embodiments optionally set the granularity low enough of avoid or reduce operational inefficiencies and customer confusion (e.g., no more than 64 pricing levels).","Certain embodiments estimate demand and set ticket prices using the pricing levels or event-wide based on a number of characteristics optionally including, but not limited to, some or all of the following: artist, similar artist activity, recent metropolitan area activity, or day of show. Certain embodiments take into account venue sightlines in pricing tickets for a given event at a given venue.","Still further, certain embodiments combine events, such as sporting, theatrical, or concert events into a season package or a partial season package. Such a package may include high or medium demand events and relatively lower demand events to thereby enhance ticket sales for the lower demand events. The grouping may be selected to as to achieve a certain desired level of ticket sales for a given season. Demand may be measured by actual tickets sales for other events that involve a given performer\/performance (e.g., a musical performer\/artist, a sporting team, a play, etc.) and\/or that involve a similar performer (e.g., a performer in the same genre as the performer that is being packaged).","For example, certain embodiments perform pattern matching on sales rates utilizing automated tools that analyze sales rates of a given event and current and\/or past comparable events to determine the likelihood that certain seats\/sections\/price levels may or may not sell out at the current set price, and to indicate whether price changes may or may not be recommended in order to sell out or to achieve other sales goals and\/or whether certain events should be packaged together. By way of example, an event may be determined to be comparable using one or more of the following factors and\/or other factors:","performer\/artist (e.g., is it the same artist)","genre (e.g., is it the same genre of music)","venues (e.g., is it a similar sized venue, is it an outdoor venue, etc.)","time of year of event;","time of day of event;","sales;","existence of competing attractions at the same or within a specified range of time and\/or within a specified distance of the event (e.g., a popular sporting event, concert, new blockbuster movie, etc.).","Still further, certain embodiments address the challenge presented with respect to enhancing tickets sales, revenues, and\/or profits presented by season tickets and \u201cholds\u201d (tickets held for the performer, promoter, or other entity, that are not available for sale to the general public). Season tickets and \u201cholds\u201d tend to consume much or all of the most elastic, high-demand inventory in certain venues, and yet conventionally, are not appropriately priced or offered for sale at appropriate times.","Yet further, certain embodiments may be utilized to enhance gross revenues, net revenues, and\/or the number of seats filled\/tickets sold. Certain embodiments may be utilized to reduce certain types of resale activity (e.g., resale activities that may not be in the public interest, such as, in certain instances, ticket scalping).","Certain example embodiments will now be described with respect to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","112","114","116","118","120","102","104","106","108","110","102","112"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["a venue operator terminal ;","a box office terminal ;","a promoter terminal ;","a ticket seller terminal ;","a ticket purchaser terminal ."]}}}},"The system  enables a user to define a representation or model of a venue for an event (e.g., to setup the event). For example, as described in greater detail herein, various user interfaces are provided via which a user can define ticket pricing (e.g., pricing levels) for individual seats and\/or groups of seats (e.g., price breaks). Further, certain embodiments enable a user to model the impact various ticket prices have on ticket sales and revenues for an event. For example, as described in greater detail below, a user may change the price level for one or more groups of seats, and the system will calculate a projected effect on ticket sales and revenues (e.g., from ticket sales and\/or concessions). The system will then generate a report that is displayed to the user that reports the projections.","The system may generate a detailed summary for executive review, which may then be transmitted to (and\/or printed out and provided to) one or more designated recipients (e.g., whose approval is\/are required in order to implement the event setup or changes thereto), whose approval or disapproval may be recorded by the system. The system may also keep and store an archive of certain or all changes made to the event setup. The approved detailed summary may be physically and\/or electronically stored with or in association with a related contract (e.g., a contract between the ticket seller, venue, promoter, and\/or performer\/team).","Certain embodiments enable a user to designate and store a rank for each seat, seat block, section and\/or other seating areas (e.g., where the user can select a seat displayed in a seat map and enter a ranking code such as a number, or where a formula can be applied for each seat that takes into account seat distance from the performance\/stage, viewing angle relative to the performance\/stage, seat height relative to the floor\/performance\/state, and\/or other factors). The ranking may correspond to an objective or subjective quality ranking (e.g., where a first row, center seat, may have a ranking of one, and where a rearmost seat at the highest seating level may have a ranking of 18,000). This ranking may be used to designate the selling order of seats by the system (e.g., in response to \u201cbest-available\u201d seat requests, where a user requests a ticket to whatever is designated as the best available seat). The seat ranking may also be used for ranked seat auctions, as discussed elsewhere herein.","Further, the system  receives substantially real time ticket sales information for one or more ongoing events, and reports the information to a user (e.g., reports an event ticket sales rate, the number of sold seats, the number of unsold seats, the number of held seats, the percentage of sold seats, a projected sell-out time, event web page visits, event web page conversions to sales, cumulative sales by day as a percent of original net capacity, cumulative audit gross by day, and\/or other information discussed herein). The system  also has access to, and is configured to provide for display historical information for events that have concluded, including some or all of the types of information provided for ongoing events.","The system  optionally utilizes the event seating and ticket pricing information to provide user interfaces for display to ticket purchasers. For example, the user interfaces may display a seating chart color coded, icon coded, and\/or text coded to indicate seat availability, prices, whether the seats are wheelchair accessible, whether a special code is needed to purchase ticket for a seat, whether the user has already purchased a ticket for the seat for the event, etc. The ticket purchaser user interface may provide a control via which the user can specify filtering criteria (e.g., ticket price, viewing quality, whether a special offer is available, whether the a ticket for the seat is held by a friend of the user, etc.), wherein the user interface will highlight individual seats and\/or seating sections that meet the filter criteria. Optionally, the user may select (e.g., by pointing at or clicking on) an individual seat and\/or seating section, and the ticket purchaser user interface will access and display additional information regarding the eat (e.g., whether a special password\/offer code is required to purchase tickets for the seat, a seat number, a seat row number, a seat section number, face price, ticket related fees, combined face and fee prices, view information, whether alcohol is permitted, whether the seat is in the shade, etc.).","Optionally, the system  has permissions stored for various users. The permissions may be specified by an overall system of event manager. The permissions may, for example, specify who is allowed to view certain information (such as some or all of the information discussed herein), who is allowed to change properties of one or more items (e.g., ticket prices, price breaks, holds, seating setups, and\/or other parameters discussed herein), who is allowed to propose changes to a decision maker, and\/or who is allowed to approve changes.","The system  may be connected, via the network, to a social network site system . The social network site system  may include a database storing user information, photos, event information, and user and other pages, and connections between users and items, such as shared content, photograph\/video tags (wherein a tag may be metadata, such as a keyword (e.g., a person's name) or term assigned to an item of information, such as a person in a photograph), friend relationships, etc. The system  may obtain information regarding users from the social network site system . For example, the system  may request and obtain names, photographs, the identifications and photographs of users' friends, information on user social events, postings, etc. The system  may also create events, wherein users may view postings regarding events and receive invitation to the events via the social network site system . In certain embodiments, if a user responds to an invitation or indicates which event seats the user and\/or friends will be sitting in, the system  may construct a post and transmit the post to the social network site system  for display via a webpage or other interface.","Thus, the computer system  enables events to be configured, projections and modeling to be performed, real-time information to be gathered from multiple sources, analyzed and reported, and\/or ticket sales to be managed and made via interactive seat maps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["102","150","152"]},"In an example embodiment, at state , the user may specify price breaks by selecting, using a mouse, touch screen, or other user interface, a section or groups of seats displayed via the seating map, and assign a price break identifier to the section or group. (e.g., group A, group B, or Group 0, Group 1, etc.). Optionally, a user interface is provided via which a user can textually enter seat identifiers (e.g., section identifier, row identifier, individual seat identifier) for a beginning seat and an end seat of a price break to thereby define a price break for the beginning and end seats, and the seats therebetween. Optionally, the user can identify certain seats within or outside of a price break as being \u201chold\u201d seats (not for sale to the general public). Example interfaces for setting price breaks are described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Optionally, a user may assign seat, seat block, section and\/or other seating area rankings, which correspond to relative seat block, section and\/or other seating area quality or anticipated desirability.","At state , event creation is performed. In an example embodiment where multiple price breaks are to be established, an event is defined, in part, via the price breaks, where a given physical section and price break combination is assigned to an individual section. The number of sections (and the number of seats per section) may be used for estimating the available event capacity.","At state , a pricing matrix, setting pricing levels for some or all of the price breaks is generated. The price levels may be manually, automatically, or using a combination of manual and automatic processes, be generated based on preferences, historical information, and\/or other parameters, such as some or all of the following:","artist\/performer preferences\/experiences;","promoter\/manager preferences\/experiences;","ticket seller preferences\/experiences;","ticket media and\/or transferability. For example, some tickets may be transferable and some tickets may not be transmitted. By way of further example, in certain embodiments, a ticket format may be configured to eliminate or restrict resales, such as when the ticket is a virtual\/paperless or electronic ticket (e.g., where an access right is assigned to a pre-existing document, such user credit card a debit card, a driver's license, a passport, and\/or a state issued identification card, and the document is presented in order to gain access to the event by scanning the document and determining whether a right of entry is associated with the document), an emailed ticket or downloadable printable ticket, or may be in the form of a more easily transferred physical ticket, such as a paper or plastic ticket specifically made for providing event access;","current ticket sales information for the event and\/or for similar events; and\/or","historical ticket sales information for past events that have ended.","At state , initial price levels and\/or sell sequence(s) are assigned to the price breaks, and the assignments are stored in memory. The sell order may be used to define the order in which seats\/price breaks are to be offered for sale, where certain price breaks may be offered for sale at the same time, and certain price breaks may be sequentially offered at a latter time(s).","At state , the event setup is optionally transmitted to one or more users for approval prior to offering the tickets for sale (e.g., via an email that contains a link that when activated, causes the recipient's browser or other viewer to display user interfaces displaying the information to be approved). For example, approval may be requested from the artist\/performer and\/or venue operator for review (e.g., so that they can review the price levels, price breaks, specified seating capacities and availabilities, etc.). At state , a determination is made as to whether the requested approval has been received. If not, optionally, a follow-up communication is transmitted to the user(s) asking for approval.","If the reviewing user has responded but has requested modifications to one or more items (e.g., to the price levels, to the price breaks, to the assignment of the price levels to the price breaks, to the sell sequence, etc.), then at state  the various items may be adjusted via the system, and the adjustments stored in memory. Optionally, requests for approval of the adjustments may be transmitted to one or more selected users.","Optionally, certain seats or price breaks may be designated as subject to future pricing modifications even after ticket sales for the event begin, and certain seats or price breaks may be designated as fixed (not subject to change once ticket sales have begun).","At state , event tickets are offered for sale (e.g., via online websites, via mobile apps, via physical outlets, via phone or otherwise) in according with the pricing set as discussed above.","Example interfaces for setting price levels and setting up events are described in greater detail elsewhere herein.","The event setup user interfaces may be used during negotiations between interested parties (e.g., the performer\/team, the promoter, the box office, the ticket seller, etc.) to set up different potential models of event, which may be used to estimate the potential revenues and\/or ticket sales given different set-up parameters (e.g., different number of price levels, different ticket prices, different number of held seats, different number of killed seats, etc.). Once the ticket setup is agreed upon, the setup user interfaces may then be used to provide initial instructions to the venue box office and\/or other entities on what the initial event setup is, and tickets may be sold in accordance with the setup. The event setup user interfaces may also be used after tickets are placed on sale to dynamically change the event setup (e.g., to change which seats are assigned to which price levels, the face value of unsold seat tickets, the number of held seats, etc.). Certain embodiments may include a data interface configured to receive dynamic pricing from a pricing engine and are configured to change the seat ticket pricing accordingly, where the changes may be automatically reflected in the change list.","An example event creation process will now be described in additional detail. Price breaks are set for a given event(s) and\/or venue(s). As similarly discussed above, price breaks relate to setting prices for respective sets of seats, such that prior to the start of ticket sales for those seats, the open seats within a given price break will be priced identically or substantially identically. Optionally, \u201cholds\u201d may be put on one or more seats in a given price break.","Over time, or as the result of initial modeling, the price level associated with a price break may be dynamically changed (e.g., by a user or system authorized to change pricing). For example, the price levels may optionally be increased or decreased based in whole or in part on ticket sales. For example, the price levels may optionally be increased or decreased based on one or more of the following factors:\n\n","At the time of such changes in pricing, unsold ticket inventory associated with a given price break may be shifted to a new price level and its associated pricing. Seats sold prior to such shifts, and optionally available seats in the same row in the same seating section (or other seats designated in a data store with an indication that the price level is not to be changed for the event and\/or as determined via a rule), as this sold inventory may remain at the price level at which they were initially sold (e.g., to facilitate appropriate refunds and\/or for customer relations).","An example graphical tool, illustrated in , is optionally provided via the system for display on a user terminal to enable a user (e.g., an authorized user having appropriate permissions) to view and set such price breaks. The tool may be hosted by the system . The graphical tool provides an interface that eases the definition and viewing of areas of like quality in the venue, using, for example, color coding. Different colors may be used to reflect different price break areas and\/or different price levels applied to such price break areas. A price may be assigned to seats (e.g., via a field that associates a color, individual seats, specified rows, and\/or specified sections\/areas) via one or more fields.","For example, red, olive, green, blue, teal, orange, etc., may be used to indicate different price breaks. Optionally, more muted or pastel colors may be used to indicate relatively low grade\/inferior seats, and brighter or primary colors may be used to indicate relatively higher grade\/superior seats. Other visual indications may be used as well (e.g., flashing seat icons may be used to indicate higher grade\/superior seats).","For many ticketed events, certain tickets are held by the artist, promoter, and\/or venue, and so are not made generally available to the public (at least in conjunction with the initial ticket sales to the public). These tickets are sometimes referred to herein as \u201cholds\u201d. Often held seats are among the more or most expensive and desirable seats.","The management of holds may significantly impact ticket sale revenue. This is because the initial hold setup is often not tightly coupled with event capacity and pricing decisions. Further, the practice of holds often eliminates or reduces public access to the highest priced seats, where on-sale price adjustments tend to be more relevant to meeting demand. Further, while many held seats are eventually released to the public (e.g., because the \u201cholder\u201d of the held seats is not going to use them), conventionally unused holds are often released to the market for purchase by the general public too late in the event life cycle to be consumed by the market place effectively. Thus, many of the valuable released held tickets remain unsold, or have to be sold at a discount relative to the face value or relative to what they could have been sold for at an earlier time. Additionally, because of lack of adequate tools and inefficient, time delayed communication, holds are often placed after capacity and pricing decisions are made, further leading to an inefficient sale of tickets.","In order to overcome some or all of the foregoing challenges, certain embodiments provide modeling tools that enable pricing and capacity decisions to be made with allowances for the number of holds in a given price level so that capacities can be appropriately expanded (e.g., additional seats may be added and\/or certain held seats may be reassigned to be on-sale to the general public) to allow the public to access and purchase seats at more expensive price levels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0131"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0132"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The example yield calculation tool panel enables a user to specify a seat count for a price break, the face value\/price level of a ticket in a given price break, the \u201call in\u201d cost of a ticket in the given price break, and an estimated percentage of tickets that will be sold for the given price break at the given face value\/price level. Some or all of the foregoing values may also be read from a database (e.g., by activating an import control to import a file, such as a CSV (comma separated value) formatted file), or may be calculated (e.g., by a forecasting tool).","The yield calculation tool then calculates (e.g., in response to a user activating a \u201ccalculate\u201d control or automatically in response to a user entering a parameter change) the total dollar value of the tickets that are predicted to be sold for a given price break, a total gross potential based on ticket face values, and a total gross potential based on all-in ticket values (although the tool may provide less or additional information). All-in ticket values or prices relate to the price that would paid by the ticket purchaser (e.g., the ticket face value, facility charge, shipping fee, etc.), or a subset thereof. Generally, although not necessarily, the all-in price will be greater than the face value of a given ticket. The calculated values can be exported to a file (e.g., a CSV file) upon activation of an export control by a user. Optionally, the reported percentage of tickets sold may be adjusted to take into account ticket holds (e.g., where the ticket holds are not included in determining the denomination of the following: (tickets sold for a give price break)\/(total tickets available for the given price break)","Certain embodiments provide tools that shorten the timing gap between capacity decisions and holds management by allowing holds to be placed manually (e.g., wherein a user can click on a set to indicate it is a held seat). Further, such tools enable holds to be transferred from their owners and sold via the ticketing system through to the general public to increase revenue, optionally without the use of ticket brokers or scalpers, which typically buy and resell tickets. For example, certain embodiments provide a user interface via which an authorized user can select held seats via the interactive user interface, and change the designation to an on-sale designation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0137"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Certain embodiments facilitate the processing and display of data for multiple events, as well as the management of ticket pricing, price breaks, and holds for multiple event.

By way of illustration, certain embodiments include a substantially real-time graphical sales report that displays some or all sales on a graphical seat map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0181"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0182"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["2","3"]},"Number of tickets sold, open, and Qopen (qualified open, which may be an attribute applied on base status of seats, to thereby\u2014sub-allocate inventory to public, wherein a user has to enter a promotional code or password, or use a certain brand of credit card in order to be entitled to purchased a qualified open seat;","Number of tickets held, the percent of tickets sold, the time\/date of the last ticket sold;","Sales rate (e.g., tickets per minute), and a report as to whether sale are accelerating, decelerating, steady, etc.;","Projected date\/time of a ticket sellout;","Projected date\/time of ticket sales stagnation (wherein the system may extrapolate from a current rate of sales and a template curve of an expected sales curve (e.g., a decaying curve, which may be selected based on historical sale profiles of similar event), fit curve through event ticket sales data points, and if the sales fall below a certain threshold, project when sales rate will fall below a certain level, such as near zero event ticket sales per day or other relatively low rate that indicates that ticket sales are stagnating);","Event release rate.","In addition, the user interface illustrated in  provides a user-defined watch list, and an \u201call item\u201d information display, as similarly discussed above.","A price break\/price slot detail report, such as that illustrated in , may be generated that provides, for a given price break, price level, and\/or section the percent of tickets sold, open, and\/or held, the rate of ticket sales, the acceleration or deceleration of tickets sales, a projected amount of time the available tickets will be sold out, the sales rate of a price break or section relative to the entire event, etc. In addition, controls are provided via which a user can instruct the system to add a graph to the user interface illustrated in  on the watch list or on particular slot (e.g., where a user can select a price level for which substantially real time sales activity is to be displayed).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0191"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"Other reports (provided in substantially real-time and\/or after a delay, in non-real-time), can include graphs of, for one or more venues and\/or one or more shows at a given venue:\n\n","As similarly discussed above, optionally the graphs can include graphs for multiple venues for events associated with a given performer and\/or for multiple events\/shows at a given venue, enabling a user to visually compare tickets sales for different venues and adjust ticket prices accordingly. For example, the graphs provide metrics to interested parties involved in ticket pricing (e.g., artists, promoters, venues) to provide an understanding of their events' performance and how price changes and inventory management affect sales. Thus, in certain embodiments, a user can simultaneously view sales and\/or other event data for multiple events.","Further, reports can be generated that provide the number of seats sold, the total gross, and the average sold price per ticket, and the number and\/or percentage of tickets resold for given venue section (e.g., floor, box, lower 1, lower 2, upper 1, upper 2, etc.).","Thus, seating pricing and price breaks may be dynamically set using the interfaces discussed above. Optionally, in addition or instead, the following techniques may be used for setting price breaks. In the example embodiment where there are multiple price breaks, an event is created from the price breaks within a given physical section and price break combinations being assigned to an individual seat block. A seat block is a group of seats with certain identical attributes (e.g., the same price level, near the same exit portal, having the same section name, in the same area of venue, in the same row, etc.). Thus, a seat block may be smaller than a physical venue section (e.g., may be smaller than a venue's orchestra, lodge, or balcony sections). Different price levels may be assigned to different seat blocks. Having more seat blocks than physical venue sections enables a higher degree granularity of section pricing, and thereby enables various seat blocks to be more appropriately priced. Seat blocks may optionally be large enough to handle all seats that potentially could be added to the manifest with those seats being in an open status. Thus, for example, if a venue event has about 280 degrees of visibility about the stage, with about 80 degrees behind the stage completely blocked, the seats behind the stage may be marked as unavailable, the seats in front of the stage may be marked as available, and the seats on the border between the available and unavailable areas may be marked a provisionally unavailable or provisionally available, subject to review of an appropriate authorized person (who may verify whether the stage visible or not from the border areas). Thus, there may be enough seat blocks defined to provide for seats in the border areas.","In addition to the process of defining seat attributes (e.g., common attributes, such as price level, venue area, etc.) for a given seat block, the price break identifier may be placed in a sub-price level field (also referred to as a price break field). The price break level field may be used to indicate that specified sections or seating areas at the same price level are to be separately reported with respect to ticket sales and\/or ticket availability. For example, if seats in a balcony area and seats in a floor area are priced identically, a sales report requesting sales information on $100 seats may break out sales for the balcony and sales for the floor area. The count of seat blocks generated is recorded, and this information may be used in estimating the available event capacity of the venue\/event data structure. After initial pricing is established, the sell order of the seat blocks may be determined.","Optionally, the seat blocks are defined or moved so that sequential seat blocks follow the natural or specified selling sequence of the venue. For example, the seat blocks may be assigned numbers sequentially if the corresponding seat blocks are to be put on sale sequentially. Optionally, the process is automated using a pre-existing chart with a given physical section assigned a unique seat block identifier. Additionally seat blocks may be defined in order to provide greater control of the selling order. Optionally, a unique identifier may be assigned to a given seat ticket price including any associated discount, to thereby enable a user to request a report on the given unique identifier, where a report is generated for the actual net pricing. In an example embodiment, once the initial event setup is performed, a pricing matrix may be defined.","A set of price levels is optionally established using event modeling statistics, artist manager\/promoter experience, and\/or other information in combination with the price break setting tool. Optionally, a range of price breaks may be set based at least in part on artist preferences or specifications. Optionally, some or all of the seats and\/or price breaks may be designated for paperless ticketing (e.g., where a paperless ticket is associated, via a database entry, with a user identification item, such as a credit card or driver's license, which may then be used to gain admission at the event venue). For example, certain seats may have a relatively low ticket price set, but may be designated as paperless-only to ensure tickets got in the hands of true fans that will actually attend the ticketed event, rather than ticket brokers or others that purchase tickets with the intention of reselling them. By way of further example, other, more expensive tickets may be designated as paper or paperless, wherein the ticket purchaser can select the ticket format.","For example, as similarly discussed above, the tool user interface illustrated may display, using color coding and\/or other notation to designate price breaks, held seats (e.g., seats held for the artist's use, the promoter's use, for the venue's use, and that are not available for sale to the general public), seats associated with paperless ticketing, etc. The user interface aids the person(s) entering the pricing information to visualize seat grouping and to see gross and\/or net revenue potentials, as calculated by the system.","By way of illustration, the user can instruct the system, via a user interface control, to color seats by price and\/or by price break. The user can instruct the system, via a user interface control, to calculate the average face value\/price, the average all-in value\/price, and the expected number of available seats and\/or the expected number of seat tickets that will be sold. The user can instruct the system, via a user interface control, to calculate the total gross potential value for the sale of the event tickets based on face value of the tickets and\/or the all in value of the tickets (the face value of the ticket plus fees and service charges).","A user editable table is optionally provided for defining a pricing matrix. The table includes rows for a give price break, and columns that include values for the ticket count of the price break, the face value of the price break tickets, the all-in value of the price break tickets, the percent of tickets expected to be sold, and the number of tickets expected to be sold, and the total value of the tickets expected to be sold (e.g., total face value and\/or all in value). The user can change one or more entries (e.g., the face value and\/or the percent of tickets expected to be sold), and the system will calculate the resulting values (e.g., the new total dollar sales for a given price break, the new total gross potential sales for face price and\/or all-in price), etc. Controls are optionally provided via which the user can zoom in or out of a given seating section on the seating diagram.","Optionally, the system stores rules and permissions which are utilized to determine who may change ticket prices for a given event, venue, performer, and\/or promoter, as similarly discussed above For example, in certain cases, price changes from a requester may need to be approved by a venue box office (or other entity). Optionally, a user, such as the artist's manager or promoter, can enter price changes, such as via the visual map. The price changes are automatically converted into an electronic message (optionally after receiving a corresponding instruction from the user). The electronic message is transmitted over a network to the box office system. The message may be stored in memory at the box office system for later retrieval and\/or the message can be displayed via the box office system when it is received. An authorized user at the box office can retrieve and view the message, and can then approve or deny the requested price change. Optionally, a message regarding the approval or denial is automatically transmitted back to the requester.","If the price change is approved, the approval is communicated to the ticket system, and the price change is reflected, optionally substantially immediately (e.g., in less than 15 minutes, less than 10 minutes, less than 5 minutes, less the 15 seconds, less than 5 seconds) online via web pages presented to potential ticket purchasers. Thus, certain embodiments enable rapid approval of ticket price changes and the posting of the same to the ticketing website.","In certain embodiments, prior to final event creation, a matrix, such as the example matrix illustrated in , may be created. The example matrix is configured to indicate which price level may be initially assigned to each price break. Additionally, a list of potential price levels to which a price break could be flexed may be indicated.","The number of possible price level\/price break combinations may optionally be limited by the number of sections in the venue and the average number of price breaks per section. The limitation on a particular event may, in certain circumstances, be difficult to predict prior to actually building the event, so the process is optionally performed iteratively. An estimate can be given based on the count of free seat blocks. Price levels may be assigned to some or all seat blocks.","Optionally, the initial event setup for a venue may need to be reviewed and approved, such as by a performer, event box office, or other entity. The approval may be viewed via a terminal of the approver, and the approval or disapproval of the event setup may be received over a network from the approver's terminal stored in memory in association with the initial event setup.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0179","num":"0212"},"figref":["FIGS. 29A-H","FIG. 29A"]},"The report area (on the left-hand side of the example user interface), displays the following event level summary information and\/or other information:\n\n","The event data area, on the lower left of the user interface, provides a grid that presents, and enables the user to view, detailed statistics and enables the user to decide what data and statistics are to be displayed. For example, a user may utilize column headings to organize and sort the data. By way of illustration, the first column may be used to define the sort basis. By way of example, in user interface illustrated in , the first column lists the price levels (PL) by number (1, 2, 3, etc.), and so the data is sorted in price level order. In certain embodiments, a user may click on a column heading in order for that column's data to be used to determine the sort order.","A user may drag and drop columns in order to organize how the data is represented, and optionally the sort basis. As illustrated in , the first column has been changed to \u201cseat status\u201d, and the data is sorted alphabetically according to the seat status spelling. In addition, the column headings include controls (check boxes) via which the user can specify what data is to be summarized. In the example illustrated in , \u201cseat status\u201d is selected.","Referring back to , the event data displays a listing of price levels, and for respective price levels, the following information is provided in respective columns: seat status (e.g., open, hold, kill, sold, in-cart, etc.) for seats at the respective price level, ticket face values (e.g., the non-discounted ticket prices) for seat tickets at the respective price level, the seat count at the respective price level, the revenue potential at the respective price level, and actual revenue (actual sales) at respective price level. Other example columns may include seat type, price break, description, qualified open seats, etc. The example user interface illustrated in  includes a control box via which columns may be added or deleted from the event data grid.","In certain embodiments, a user may manually enter data into a given field, and the system will calculate the effect on data in other fields, to thereby enable a user to perform a what-if analysis. For example, the user can change the ticket face value, seat count, and\/or number of seats having a specified status (e.g., open, sold, held, killed), and the user interface will be updated to reflect the effect of the change on other types of data, such as on revenue potential.

For example, in certain instances a performer may instruct that tickets for certain seats are to be assigned to the user's mother or father, without the specified seat tickets ever being put on sale.","The management of seat tickets for a given event may be divided up among different entities, wherein different entities manage different subsets of seat tickets for an event. For example, in certain embodiments, the user interface enables the user to select one or more seats (e.g., a subset, but not all of the venue seats) and assign control\/management of the selected seats (which may be initially assigned the status of \u201chold\u201d seats) to a specified authorized entity, wherein the specified authorized entity does not control or manage tickets for other event seats. For example, in certain instances a governmental entity\/city may own a venue, but may lease it to an operator, which still maintaining control over a relatively small subset of seats (e.g., 200 out of 18,000 seats) in order to decide how to allocate the seats (e.g., to visiting dignitaries, honorees, etc.). The governmental entity (or other party) and the venue operator may negotiate which sub-set of seats are to be controlled by the governmental entity, and the agreement may be implemented by an operator selecting seats and allocating management of the selected seats to the governmental entity (or other specified party). By way of further example, in certain jurisdictions, while multiple ticketing service providers may have the right to sell tickets for events at a given venue, the multiple ticketing service providers may divide up the venue seats, wherein a given ticketing service provider is allocated a certain subset of seat tickets to sell. The seating map may be used to allocate management of\/authority to sell tickets for respective subsets of venue seats to different ticketing service providers.","The seat map may be used to assign event alerts and\/or time alarms to individual seats and\/or sets of seats. The event alerts may relate to a change in seat status (e.g., from open to sold, from hold to open, from killed to open, from open to killed, etc.). The event alert may be tied to a time criteria, wherein an alert is only provided if a specified event occurs (or does not occur) by a specified date\/time.","For example, certain embodiments enable a user to assign an alert to one or more selected seats, wherein if a ticket for a seat associated with an alert is sold, an alert is transmitted to one or more specified recipients. By way of further example, certain embodiments enable a user to assign an alert to one or more selected seats, wherein if a ticket for a seat associated with an alert is not sold by a user-specified date (which may be a specified month\/day\/year, or wherein the date may be specified relative to the date of the event or initial offer for sale, such as 15 days before the event or 30 days after the seat ticket is offered for sale) and\/or time, an alert (e.g., in the form of an email, SMS message, MMS message, automated voice call, application notification, or otherwise) is transmitted to one or more specified recipients. The seats may be selected for alerts as the sale of seat tickets for such seats indicate the overall performance of the ticket sales for the event. For example, the sale of tickets for certain seats may indicate that event sales are going well\/satisfactorily, while the failure of such seats to sell by a certain date\/time may indicate that sales are slower than desired. The seat alerts may indicate to the recipients that ticket prices should be raised or lowered in order to enhance revenues.","Further calendar entries, alerts\/warning timers (e.g., with associated expiration times or calendared dates\/times) may be assigned to one or more seats (e.g., a warning that certain seats initially allocated to governmental entity will be re-allocated back to the box office which will have to sell them). A text message may be displayed by the system in association with the alert, the text message optionally identifying one or more seats associated with the alert and\/or a message previously specified by a user (e.g., a text and\/or graphic message including a reminder related to the seats, such as \u201cSeats A-C will be reallocated to the box office today\u201d). The user may specify one or more recipients and\/or device\/email addresses that are to receive the alert and associated message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0245"},"figref":"FIG. 29H"},"Thus, the user can specify certain event changes, see the effect on the event data and reports, and then decide to accept\/implement the change, or reject\/delete the change. The acceptance or rejection of the changes may be stored in memory. The changes may be performed prior to placing tickets on sale for the event and\/or after ticket sales have begun.","While the user interface illustrated in  enables the user to specify changes for user-selected specific seats, the user interface of  lets the user specify change more ambiguously (e.g., via the pop-up dialog box or the event data grid). For example, the user can specify that 25 seats should be moved from one price level to another, without specifying specific seats that are to be moved to a different price level. The system can then calculate the effect on the event data. By way of further example, the user can specify a desired goal (e.g., an increase of $10,000 in gross revenues), and the system will calculate how many seats would have to be moved from a first price level to a second price level (higher than the first price level) in order to achieve the goal. The user may specify any of the event entries as a goal, and the system may calculate one or more ways to achieve the goal by varying one or more parameters, which may be displayed to the user.","An example event setup workflow will now be described. Many entities and people having different roles (e.g., advisor, decision maker, executor, etc.) and responsibilities may be involved in an event setup (e.g., in defining the physical layout of the event, the price structure of the event, in determining the number of held or killed seats, etc.). For example, there may be one or more performers (e.g., musical performer(s), team(s), actor(s), etc.), promoters, venue operators, box office managers, advisors, dynamic pricing generators, assistant managers, etc., involved in setting up a ticketed event. Certain embodiments described herein enable various entities to perform their roles with corresponding rights and abilities to perform setups, modifications, view data, etc.","As discussed above, different users may have different roles. For example, certain users may act as advisors with respect to an event setup. Such advisors may be granted access to view event data, such as that described herein, specify provisional changes (e.g., in ticket prices, the number of price levels, seat statuses, etc., via a change list or otherwise), view the calculated results of such changes prior to the changes being actually implemented, save the changes as one or more proposed event record change files, and\/or designate a change file as a \u201crecommended change\u201d file. The advisor may also recommend what types of tickets should be issued for which seats (e.g., a physical ticket, an electronic ticket, and\/or a virtual ticket). Thus, the advisor may make proposals with respect to changes to an event setup, but does not have the authority to actually instruct that the changes be implemented as an on-sale event. Thus, an advisor may be enabled to perform what-if analyses on various different event setups and provide recommendations on how the event should be setup to a decision maker (e.g., an event promoter) that has the authority to approve such changes, but without such approval, the event is not setup based on the advisor's recommendations or saved change files.","The decision maker may view the proposal file(s) and then approve disapprove such changes and\/or may make further changes, wherein such approval, disapproval, and\/or further changes are stored in memory. The decision maker automatically may be informed of a new or revised proposal from an advisor via an email, an electronic file notation, an alert displayed via one or more of the user interfaces described herein, or otherwise. For example, an advisor may activate a control instructing the system to transmit a proposal to a decision maker, and the system may provide the decision maker with the proposal, which may include one or more of the user interfaces discussed herein.","After viewing a proposal, the decision maker may then instruct an executor (e.g., a box office) to implement the changes (e.g., the change list defined by the advisor, as approved and\/or modified by the decision maker). For example, the instructions may be provided via an email, an electronic file notation, an alert displayed via one or more of the user interfaces described herein, or otherwise. The executor may then implement the specified changes (e.g., using one or more of the user interfaces described herein), and the event will be setup accordingly (e.g., with the specified price levels, seat-to-price level assignments, ticket face values, discounts, and\/or seat statuses, etc.). The executor may be provided with a certain degree of discretion in implementing changes. For example, the decision maker may instruct the executor to move 25 seats from price level  to price level , without specifying which of the seats in price level  are to be moved. The executor may select which 25 seats are to be moved, and then move the executor-selected seats from price level  to price level  accordingly. The decision maker may be automatically information by the system when the executor has implemented a change (e.g., where the system detects that the user has instructed the system to implement the change, and transmits an electronic notification to the appropriate recipients). The tickets may then be offered for sale to purchasers in accordance with the implemented event setup.","By way of further example, as similarly discussed above, certain users\/entities may be provided with the authorization to control tickets and other setup properties for a subset of event seats, but not for all event seats.","The allocation of authority to perform and execute various tasks may be performed by a user that has the authority to assign roles and provides corresponding authority to users to execute those roles, optionally on an event-by-event basis. The foregoing tasks may be performed using one or more user interfaces provided via the ticket system or otherwise. The specified allocation of authority may be stored in memory in respective user and\/or event records or otherwise.","For example, a given user may be provided with a userID and\/or password to access the system, and the system may use the userID and\/or password to identify the user logging in, access a user and\/or event record to determine the user's rights to access certain event data, to create event models, and to implement event changes, and provide the user with corresponding authorized functionality. Of course, other techniques may be used to validate a user and enable the user to login, such as biometrics (e.g., fingerprints), smart identification cards, dongles, etc.","Optionally a given user assigned a corresponding role may be provided with the authority to designate another user or users as having a sub-authority to perform some or all of the tasks the delegating user has the authority to perform. For example, a box office manager may create a tree of authority, where the box office manager may authorize an assistant box office manager to make and\/or implement certain types of changes (e.g., change the status of a seat from held to open), but not others (e.g., the ability to change ticket face values). By way of further example, a decision maker, such as promoter, can delegate decision making authority to other designated users.","Optionally, a given user can instruct the ticket system to enable someone to whom the user has provided such sub-authority to further grant sub-authority to still another user. Optionally, a given user can instruct the ticket system not to permit someone to whom the user has provided such sub-authority to further grant sub-authority to still another user. The system may then provide the user granted sub-authority with the specified degree of rights to view data, experiment with changes, and\/or implement changes.","In certain embodiments, the system may keep records of each proposal and\/or implemented change lists and may generate a report thereof with an associated timeline. The report may note who proposed a given change (e.g., change in price level, price break, face price, seat status), who approved the given change, who implemented the given change, when the foregoing tasks were performed, and what the changes were. The changes may be shown graphical and\/or textually (e.g., beginning with a base event, and subsequent changes). In addition, the history of sales activity may be provided showing which seat tickets were sold when, changes in ticket sales rates, changes in the absolute number and\/or percent of seat tickets sold, etc.","The history may be presented statically, such as using various screen shots, textual tables, graphs, or otherwise in a physical or electronic report. By way of further example, the history may be provided in a dynamic format. By way of illustration, the history may be replayed as a movie (e.g., a time elapsed movie where the user can control the speed of the history playback), with the seat map being sequentially re-colored to reflect the changes in the order made, and the text likewise being continuously updated to reflect the changes. The user may specify start and stop points for the playback by specifying start and stop dates\/times or events (e.g., beginning when a first change in ticket pricing occurred and ending just before a second change is ticket pricing occurred; or beginning when a first specified percentage or number of seat tickets were sold, and ending when a second specified percentage or number of seat tickets were sold) to thereby more quickly focus on areas of interest.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0259"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["3002","3004","3006","3008","3010","3012","3014"]},"At state , once the decision maker approves the changes (wherein the approval may be stored in the event record), the decision maker instructs the executors to make the actual changes to the event (e.g., via an electronic communication transmitted by the system). At state , the event is put on sale in accordance with the event setup (e.g., with tickets offered at the designated prices, using the designated event layout, with held and killed seats not being offered for sale), and the system may process ticket orders and deliver tickets (e.g., physical, electronic, and\/or virtual tickets). At state , the system displays the sales activity graphically (e.g., via seat maps, graphs, etc.) and textually (e.g. via the report and\/or event data areas discussed above), optionally in substantially real-time. Users may setup on or more filters to select what is displayed and reported. At state , based on the sales activity of the active event and\/or other factors, users may generate additional changes reflected in corresponding change lists which executors can post to the ticket system during live sales.","Interactive seat maps will now be discussed in relation to example embodiments illustrated in the figures. As illustrated in FIGS.  and A-Z, interactive seat maps of a venue and\/or event may be provided for display on networked user terminals (e.g., phones, personal computers, interactive televisions, or networked devices, etc.) of potential ticket purchasers.","A system, such as the ticket system discussed above, may access data from a database (such as one or more databases storing venue maps, seating maps and data, pricing data, event data, user account and preference information, social network information, photograph tagging information, event invitation and replies, other data displayed via the user interfaces described herein, and\/or other data) and use such data to populate the user interfaces, including the interactive seat maps. The populated data may be dynamically changed in response to a user's actions (e.g., in response to some or all of the following: user searches, specified preferences, navigation instructions, seat selections, section selections, ticket purchase instructions, tagging instructions, control activations, etc.). The user interfaces, including the interactive seat maps, may be updated in substantially real-time in response to user actions and\/or in response to updated data, such as updates in ticket pricing, seat availability, seat status, etc., as made or detected by the system.","In addition, in certain embodiments, the system will provide for display information as to the distance from the seat to seats of the user's friends who have tickets at the event (e.g., expressed as a number of seats, rows, sections, and\/or in a unit of length, such as feet, meters, or yards).","A given seat may have different types of tickets available (e.g., adult, child, etc.).

Further, certain embodiments may enable a user to select a seat or section, and have a photograph, video, or other representation (in two and\/or three dimensions) of the view from that seat or section displayed to the user.","As illustrated in , the user interface may include a navigation map, and in another area, may include an expanded view of a section of the venue that indicates seats selected by the user, seats purchased by the user, seats that match user search criteria (e.g., price range, seating section(s), seat type, special offer(s) specified by the user, etc.), other seats that are available, seats that are not available.","Controls are provided via which the user can navigate around the map and\/or zoom into a certain section of the map. For example, the map is configured to enable a user to click on an area of a map and drag the map to change the displayed map area. In certain embodiments, even when a user clicks or otherwise selects a particular seating area or section, to thereby expand the view of the selected area, the entire venue is still displayed in an area of the map, with the seat statuses indicated (e.g., via color and\/or text). For example, if a user enters search criteria (e.g., seats having a ticket price between $50-$100), the user interface will highlight (e.g., via color coding or otherwise) the seats and\/or sections that match the search criteria. If the user then selects a given highlighted section, the user interface will zoom in on the selected section, while still displaying an overall view of the venue (which may be reduced in size) in a corner or elsewhere, where the overall view still highlights the seats\/sections matching the user's search criteria (e.g., seats between $50-$100).","Optionally, if the user hovers a pointer (e.g., a cursor) over a certain seat or seating area, or otherwise indicates a seat or seating section (e.g., by clicking on a specific seat or seating area), additional information is provided (e.g., via a pop-up window or overlay) regarding the corresponding seat or seating section. For example, the additional information may include an indication as to whether an offer code is needed, and if so, from which source, the specific seating information (e.g., section, row number, seat number, the ticket price, the type of ticket (e.g., adult-full price, adult-discounted, child, etc.) etc.), an indication as to whether the seating area only has single seats available (and not two or more available adjacent seats). Other information, such as whether the seat is in a covered area or an exposed area, in the shade or in direct sunlight, the distance of the seat to an exit, bathroom, concessions, parking lot, and\/or other destination, how far the seat is from an aisle (e.g., expressed as a number of seats and\/or in a unit of length, such as feet, meters, or yards), expected temperature at the seat during the event, whether there is waiter service to the seat, and\/or other information may be displayed as well.","As illustrated in , the user interface may include a map that graphically (e.g., via a drawing or a photograph) represents a seating chart of the entire venue (optionally with various sections identified graphically, via color coding, and\/or via alphanumeric text), and an expanded view of the venue showing individual seats, wherein the user can move a navigation box over the seating chart of the entire venue to select the area that should be shown in the expanded view. Optionally, corresponding colors are used to indicate seat status with respect to availability (e.g., available, sold, on hold, etc.), but not to indicate price, which may be shown textually. Optionally instead, corresponding colors are used to indicate seat ticket price.","As illustrated in , the user interface may include a map in a one area that graphically depicts a seating chart of the entire venue for navigation purposes (optionally with various sections identified graphically, via color coding, and\/or via alphanumeric text), and in another area, depicts an expanded view of certain of the seating sections showing the certain sections in greater detail, but optionally without showing individual seats. As similarly discussed above, the user can move a navigation box over the seating chart of the entire venue to select the area that should be shown in the expanded view.","In an example embodiment, such as that illustrated in , when the map is zoomed out, displaying the venue map in a main area of the user interface, sections of the venue may be color coded (e.g., gray, light blue, medium blue, and\/or dark blue). For example, gray (or other color) may be used to indicate that a section is either completely sold out or does not contain any seats that match the user's selected price range and\/or ticket options. Blue (or other color) may be used to indicate that there are at least some seats within the section that match the user's selected price range and\/or ticket options. Variations of a color (e.g., the darkness or intensity) may be used to provide additional information. For example, the darker the blue, the more seats within the section that match the user's search criteria.","Depending on the size of the venue, the number of venue seats, and\/or the size and\/or resolution of the user's display, the interactive map may optionally display all of the seats in a venue at the same time, as illustrated in .","Other information may be stored in the system database and included in the interactive map. By way of example and not limitation, seat shape, seat type (e.g., cushioned, non-cushioned, back rest, no back rest, etc.), and\/or seat rotation angle may be included and displayed. Information may be conveyed via a seat icon (or other indicator) using a corresponding interior color, outline color, interior symbol\/text\/character, color of such symbol, one or more orbiting symbols that are optionally color coded, etc.","In certain embodiments, the software application used to configure the interactive seat map intended for display to consumer for the purchase of event tickets is optionally the same or substantially the same software application used for event creation. In certain embodiments, the shading, coding, and behavior of the user interface is controlled by a scripting language which is passed to the map allowing the behavior to be changed dynamically. For example, the scripting language may be used to control polygon rendering for the map (e.g., which may be used to indicate seating areas), seat rendering, hover-over message handling, and user interface control.","The example highly configurable map can be configured as desired. For example, the map can be configured to display a timed entry in a form similar to that of a calendar entry (e.g., a Microsoft Outlook calendar or Google calendar entry).","The map may be configured provide \u201cview from the seat\u201d images (e.g., movies, photographs, graphic renderings, etc.). For example, a user may select\/click-on a seat\/section and\/or an associated icon (e.g., a camera symbol), and the view from the seat or section may be displayed. The image(s) may include one or more static images, a view from the seat, a view to the seat from the performance area, and\/or an immersive virtual reality 360 degree or full sphere view.","Certain embodiments of the map are configured to display dynamic sub-content. For example, the image of the venue may be modified to display ads selected based on user characteristics (e.g., the user's location, the subject matter the user is viewing, etc.) on the map itself (e.g., on a playing field, stage, scoreboard, billboard, etc.). By way of illustration, the content may be a static advertisement including a static image and\/or text, or a movie. The advertisements may be selected and\/or served via an advertisement server operated by the operator of the ticket system, an advertisement trafficker, or otherwise.","Optionally, the map may be hierarchical and may embed hyperlinks. For example, the map may display a campus view, illustrating several buildings at the same time from a bird's eye or oblique view. If it is detected that the user is selecting (e.g., via a hover or click-on operation) a building including a venue used for ticketed events (e.g., an auditorium or sports arena), the map user interface may respond by accessing and displaying a corresponding seating map for the ticketed venue within the selected building.","By way of further example and as illustrated in , with respect to seat colors, dark blue (or other color) may be used to indicate that the seat is available for purchase and matches the user's selected price range and ticket options. Light blue (or other color) may be used to indicate that the seat is available for purchase, but is outside the user's selected price range and\/or ticket options. Gray (or other color) may be used to indicate that the seat is not available for purchase. Orange (or other color) may be used to indicate that the cursor is over that seat or the user has already added the seat to the user's selected seats.","Optionally, in addition or instead of coloring coding, if the map is being viewed via a 3D terminal (e.g., a terminal that requires glasses to view the image in 3D (sometimes referred to as \u201cactive 3D\u201d), or a terminal that does not require glasses to view the image in 3D), the amount of 3D effect may be used to provide information. For example, the closer the match with a user's search criteria, the more the 3D effect may be emphasized. By way of illustration, a matching section or seat may appear to project from the image in an amount corresponding to the degree of match.","As illustrated in , changes to the interactive seat map may optionally be updated in substantially real-time (e.g., in 2 minutes or less). For example, changes in seat availability, seat prices, sources of seat tickets, seat status, and\/or other seat and event related information discussed herein, and so on, may be updated in substantially real-time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0232","num":"0282"},"figref":["FIG. 21E","FIG. 21F","FIG. 21E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0283"},"figref":"FIG. 21G"},"Additionally, certain embodiments will display warnings or other information in certain situations that the user needs to acknowledge viewing before being allowed to purchase a ticket via the map. For example, as illustrated in , if a user hovers a cursor over or clicks on a seat that has an obstructed view, a warning regarding the obstructed view may be provided for display via a pop-up window or otherwise, and the warning may have an associated control (e.g., a \u201ccontinue\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d control) that the user needs to activate before the system or user interface will allow the user to add the seat to the user's seat ticket list and\/or before the user is enabled to purchase a ticket for the seat.","Optionally, as illustrated in , the system or user interface detects if the user's seat selection of one or more seats would leave a \u201cstranded\u201d seat in row (a single available seat, rather than two or more adjacent available seats), where if the user selected a different set, but the same number, of adjacent seats in the row, there would not be a stranded seat, or there would be fewer stranded seats (e.g., one stranded seat instead of two stranded seats). If such a situation occurs, a notification regarding the foregoing may be provided to the user and the notification may inform the user that the user is required to or is asked to select a different set of seats so as to avoid or mitigate the occurrence of stranded seats, as illustrated in . The notification may specify or suggest one or more comparable sets of seats that would eliminate or mitigate the number of stranded seats. The user may be asked to or required to activate a control acknowledging the notification. Optionally, if the user does not select a different set of seats and\/or does not acknowledge the notification, the user may be prevented from proceeding with adding the tickets to the user's selected tickets and\/or is prevented from purchasing the tickets. Optionally, instead, the user may be enabled to continue with the seat selection or purchase, even if a stranded seat results.","By way of further example, as illustrated in , the system or user interface may detect if the user has selected a set of seats (e.g., two or more seats), where two seats are separated by an aisle or barrier (e.g., a pole). The user interface may provide a warning regarding the seat separation. The warning may have an associated control (e.g., a \u201ccontinue\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d control) that the user needs to activate before the system or user interface will allow the user to add the seat to the user's seat ticket list and\/or before the user is enabled to purchase a ticket for the seat.","Optionally, as illustrated in , a user's seat selection is displayed on the same user interface as the map (e.g., directly below the map). Optionally, a control is provided (e.g., a \u201cShow Details\u201d control) to display additional details regarding the selected seats (e.g., price, seat section, row, number, ticket type, total cost), wherein the user can modify the ticket list. The user can then continue browsing the map, or click a \u201cCheckout\u201d control to complete the purchase. Optionally, the selected seats are not reserved until the Checkout control is activated (at which point the tickets may be reserved for a certain period of time). Optionally, if the user does not complete the checkout process within a certain period of time, the checkout process is terminated, and the tickets are no longer designated as reserved (although optionally they may still be in listed in the list of user selected seats), thereby enabling other users to purchase the tickets.","Thus, for example, the user interface may report on the number of seats selected by the user and the subtotal cost (e.g., the total of the face value of the selected tickets, optionally with any discount applied, optionally without any discount applied). Optionally, the total cost, including any discounts, handling fees, venue fees, taxes, and\/or shipping is displayed.","As similarly discussed elsewhere herein, in the illustrated example, a field is provided via which the user may enter an offer code or password. Fields and\/or a slide bar are provided via which the user can set lower and\/or upper bounds for tickets prices the user is interested in. Optionally, if the system determines that an event has only one standard admission price, the system will not offer a slider or other user interface for specifying pricing as a search criteria. A field is provided via which the user can instruct the system to highlight and\/or only display seats that are part of a special offer (e.g., a presale for a credit card holder of a certain company, or a fan club presale).","In certain embodiments, as illustrated in , a user interface may be provided that enables a user to purchase or reserve a right (which may be represented by a physical or electronic ticket) to enter a venue (such as a museum or amusement park ride) at a certain time or to use a facility at a certain time (e.g., a golf course tee time). The user interface may list a plurality of time slots, with an associated \u201cadd\u201d control. If the user activates an add control, the associated time slot is added to the user's list of selected time slots or, in certain embodiments, directly to the user's shopping card. If the user points at or hovers a cursor over a particular time listing, additional related information may be displayed (e.g., via a pop-up or otherwise). For example, the additional information may be an entry time, a price or price range, number of remaining tickets for the corresponding time slot.","As illustrated in , upon detection the a user is hovering a cursor over or has selected a seat that require a special offer code (e.g., from a specific credit card company, from a fan club, etc.), a notice may be presented via the user interface, listing a source of the offer code, a seat location\/identifier, a ticket price and associated fees. as illustrated in , the user interface may indicate, via icons or otherwise, seats that are handicapped accessible.","By way of further example, if no tickets are available in a given sales channel (an initial or primary sales channel) in a section pointed at or clicked on by the user, a notification may be provided as to the availability of tickets in the section via one or more alternate channels (e.g., a resale\/secondary market channel, an auction channel, etc.) as illustrated in . The notification may include a link to a purchase page or other user interface of the alternate channel(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0243","num":"0293"},"figref":"FIGS. 21R-21U"},"If an auction format is used, the system may specify a minimum bid price and\/or a minimum bid increment. Users may then submit bids, which are received by the system. The system may determine the highest bidder for a given ticket, and the highest ticket may then be awarded and delivered to the highest bidder. The winning user may be charged for the ticket at the winning bid amount and the user payment (or an agreed upon portion thereof) may be transferred to the ticket seller.","If the user submitted multiple relative priority order, once the user is awarded tickets through one of the user's relative priority offers, then the rest of the relative priority offers\/seating areas the user made an offer on may be ignored and\/or removed from a ticket request data store so that the user only wins one set of tickets. When determining which user wins which ticket, the relative priority rank the user indicates for the associated seating area will also be taken into consideration.","In certain embodiments, the auction may be a ranked seat auction, where there can be multiple winners within the same auction. By way of illustration, in certain auctions, a user does not bid for tickets to a particular seat. Instead, the user may be simply bidding for tickets to see the event in a seat that will later be determined by comparing the user's bid with other bids that are submitted before the auction ends. The seat tickets within an auction may have been ranked according to what the event providers or the ticket seller have determined to be from greater to lesser desirability and matching it against bids submitted by users optionally while taking into consideration the relative priority rank users associate with the different seating areas. At the end of the auction, tickets may be assigned to winning bidders based on those rankings so that those winning bidders who bid higher than the user are assigned higher ranked seats and those winning bidders who bid lower than the user will be assigned lower ranked seats, with ties optionally broken in favor of those who submit their final bid earlier than other bids.","Optionally, tickets different seats may be made available for purchase using different techniques. For example, some seat tickets may be available at a preset price (e.g., wherein the user simply agrees to purchase the ticket at the preset price and the purchase is automatically processed by the system), some seat ticket may be available via an auction, some tickets may be available where a user makes a purchase offer at a specified price which the current ticket holder may accept or refuse or reply to with a counter-offer. Some seats may be made available using two or techniques. For example, a tickets for a seat may be available at a set price, wherein if a user pays the set price, the purchase will be completed, or the user may make an offer for the set at less than the set price, where the ticket owner may accept or decline the user's offer, and the purchase will not be completed unless the ticket owner accepts the user's offer. The interactive seat map may include coding (e.g., color, icon, and\/or text coding), which indicates the purchasing technique for a given seat, so that a user can decide not just what seats they wish to acquire tickets for, but can also decide what purchase technique is acceptable to the user and make ticket purchase decisions accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0298"},"figref":"FIG. 21R"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0299"},"figref":["FIG. 21S","FIG. 21R"],"b":"100"},"As illustrated in , a chat user interface may be provided enabling a user to textually and\/or via voice chat in substantially real-time with other users\/friends regarding which seats to make an offer on, how much to offer for the seats, sitting together, etc. The selections may then be listed on the user interface, as illustrated in . A priority field may be provided, once the auction or offer period ends, the first highest priority offer will be considered first by the system before the second highest priority offer is considered by the system, and so on, until one of the offers is accepted or until there are no more selections of the user. Optionally, users can tie their ticket offer to that of their friends. As illustrated in , for individual offer line items, the \u201cseat me with\u201d user interface enables the user to select from a list of the user's social networking site friends (e.g., with the user's friends identified as similarly described elsewhere herein) which friend(s) the user wants that specific offer line item to be tied together with. The system determines if both the user's offer and that of the user's selected friends' are accepted. In such instance, the system will not award the user the ticket (the user's offer will not be accepted) unless the selected friend(s) offer(s) are also accepted for that same seating location.","An example embodiment provides user interfaces, illustrated in , that enable a user to make an offer to purchase a ticket from another user that had previously purchased the ticket. For example, the user interface may include a venue map, such as the map illustrated in . The user may select a section or specific seats for which the user wants purchase tickets that may be held or owned by other users. If a determination is made that a ticket holder is willing to accept or entertain ticket purchase offers from other users (e.g., based on an indication provided by the ticket holder to the system via a user interface, wherein the indication is associated with the corresponding seat, where the ticket holder may also specify a minimum price which may likewise be stored), the system may cause the ticket holder's seat icon to include a corresponding indication (e.g., a corresponding icon, border, color, etc.). The system may transmit the offer in an offer notification (e.g., via email, SMS message, MMS message, voice message, seat map, web page, phone app, or otherwise), including a price, submitted by the user to the ticket holder via a purchase offer interface, which may include a field to receive a user specified offer price. The system may receive an acceptance or refusal of the offer from the ticket holder (e.g., wherein the ticket holder activates an access control or refusal control including in the notification or via a page accessed by clicking on a link or other control including in the offer notification), and transmit an indication of such acceptance or refusal to the user (e.g., via email, SMS message, MMS message, voice message, seat map, web page, phone app, or otherwise). If the ticket holder accepts the offer, the system may store an indication corresponding to the acceptance, process the purchase (e.g., charge the user's credit card or other financial instrument, and charge the user and\/or ticket holder a service fee), and transfer the ticket (which may be a physical or electronic ticket) to the user. The system may store an indication in a ticket database that the ticket has been transferred to the user in association with a record for the corresponding seat. The system may cancel or otherwise invalidate the original ticket holder's ticket to prevent use thereof (e.g., by recording in memory an indication that the original ticket holder is invalid, so that if it is used and scanned at the event venue, the admission system will access the ticket database and determine that the original ticket is not valid). Optionally, if the ticket holder refuses an offer, the ticket holder may submit a counteroffer, which the system may communicate to the user, who in turn may accept or refuse the counteroffer, and may couple a refusal with a counter-counter offer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0252","num":"0302"},"figref":"FIG. 21V"},"In addition, the example user interface displays the average ticket prices (or other statistical calculation) for event tickets sold, as calculated by the ticket system or other system. For example, the user interface may display the average price and\/or price range for tickets in a specified period of time, such as the current day. Optionally, the ticket sale price information may be provided for a section or other seating area specified by the user. A control is provided via which the user can instruct the system to provide historical event ticket sale prices for other time periods (e.g., past days or weeks).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0304"},"figref":["FIG. 21W","FIG. 21V"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0255","num":"0305"},"figref":"FIGS. 21X-21Z"},"As illustrated in , a user interface is provided via which the user can select one or more ticket sources, which may include primary and secondary market sellers. The seat map is then updated to highlight the seats whose tickets are available from the selected sources. The seat icons may be coded differently (e.g., different internal graphics, different colors, different borders, etc.) to indicate the source of the ticket for a given seat and\/or an indication as to whether the source is a primary market source or a secondary market source.

For example, in some instances, a ticket holder may not want to sell a ticket to a ticket broker, but is only willing to sell the ticket to someone the ticket holder has designated a friend or that may be a friend of a friend (or that may be a member of a specified group, such as a fan group of the performer performing at the event). The ticket holder can also enter, via an electronic form or otherwise, a requested price per ticket and a reason the ticket holder is not using the ticket. The ticket system may then determine whether a user seeking to purchase tickets fits the ticket holder specified designation, and if not, prevent or inhibit the user from purchasing the ticket. For example, the system may indicate that the seat ticket is not available for purchase to users that do not fit the ticket holder specified designation.","On the buyer side, a seat map may indicate which seat tickets being offered for resale are being offered by a friend of the buyer (which may be determined from information accessed from a social network database). Further, a buying user may specify that the user wants to filter the seat map to indicate which seats tickets being offered for resale are being offered by a friend (or other specified seller-type).  illustrates such an example user interface. In this example, the user has selected, under ticket options, \u201cExclusive from Friends.\u201d The seat map has been updated to indicate via a star which seats are associated with tickets being offered for resale by a friend. If the user hovers the cursor over such a seat, additional information is presented, such as the seat location, the reason provided by the user for selling the ticket, the requested price, and an indication that the ticket holder is only selling the ticket to friends. Controls are provided via which the user can send the ticket holder a message.","In certain embodiments, a ticket may be transferred (e.g., resold), without a ticket seller having to manually send a physical ticket to a ticket buyer, For example, ticket holders can electronically transfer a ticket to recipient via the ticket system. The ticket holder may identify the ticket being sold by selecting the ticket from a menu provided by the ticket system of tickets held by the ticket holder (e.g., based on the ticket holder's account information) or by providing to the system identifying information relating to the ticket (e.g., a unique code printed on the ticket if the ticket is a physical ticket). When the purchase is complete or when otherwise instructed by the ticket holder, the system can then cancel the ticket held by the ticket holder The ticket system can keep a record of each transaction so that the system can track who the current ticket holder is, as well as who has previously held the ticket.","In certain embodiments, the interactive map may disabled if the ticket system is so loaded that it cannot adequately support one or more instances of the interactive map (e.g., where the system cannot provide updates regarding which seats are available quickly enough (e.g., in substantially real time), resulting in seats that have become unavailable still being displayed as available) as illustrated in . For example, if consumer activity on a given event spikes (e.g., during the first hour or other time period event tickets are first put on sale), the system may automatically disable the interactive seat map and users may instead be presented with or directed to an alternative ticket purchase user interface, such as that illustrated in . For example, the alternative user interface may not enable a user to select specific seats. By way of illustration, the alternative user interface may instead enable a user to specify a price level or best available seats, where the system, rather than the user, then selects the specific open seats that match the user's criteria and rankings or quality assignments with respect to the open seats (e.g., the system may locate the seats with the highest ranking or quality assignments that are open and that meet the user's price and\/or section selection criteria). The system then enables the user to purchase the system selected seats via the alternative ticket purchase user interface. A notification may be provided for display to the user regarding the disablement of the interactive map. Optionally, a notification may first be provided indicating that due to detected system loading, the performance of the interactive map may be significantly degraded (e.g., very slow), and the user may be offered the option to continue using the interactive map or to use the alternative user interface. Then, the selected user interface is presented to the user.","By way of example, consumer activity may be measured by one or more of the following factors:","a. the amount of web traffic that is arriving on an event's purchase page;","b. the number of seats that are simultaneously reserved on the ticketing system.","additionally, thresholds for these factors may vary depending on the event lifecycle (e.g. If an on-sale is coming up, the thresholds may be set relatively lower to be more sensitive to traffic and purchase activity.","Example processes for obtaining and utilizing social network data and social network sites will now be discussed in further detail.","As previously discussed, in certain embodiments, the system (e.g., the ticket system) determines (e.g., from information accessed from a social network database and\/or a ticket system database) and provides for display an indication as to which seats are assigned to \u201cfriends\u201d of the user via the interactive map. A friend may be someone that the user has identified as a friend to the system or to a source providing information to the system, or that the system has inferred from data (e.g., the user's contact database) is a friend of the user. A friend may be a personal friend, a business partner, or other person that the user wants to (or, in certain embodiments, that the system infers may want to) share ticket\/seat related information with. This enables a user to determine which friends have purchased tickets for the event, and further enables the user to purchase (or attempt to purchase) tickets for seats next to or close to one or more of the user's friends' seats. For example, event seats for which the user's friends have purchased tickets, or for whom tickets have been purchased, can be colored in green (or other color), designated with a special icon, or otherwise emphasized.","The system may obtain information regarding who the user's friends are using one or more processes. For example, the user may agree (e.g., via an opt-in control) or instruct a social networking site to share information with the ticket system regarding relationship information of the user. The relationship information may identify who the user has indicated are the user's friends and\/or who others have indicated that they are friends of the user. The system may access such relationship information via an application programming interface (API) associated with the social networking site or may access the information from other sources.","In addition to determining who the user's friends are, the system may determine whether the friends have purchased tickets for the event, have received tickets for the event, and\/or have been tagged into a seat for the event. For example, the system may have ticket records indicating the identity of purchasers, ticket holders, and seat tagging information, and may map the names or other identifiers associated with the user's friends (e.g., obtained from the relationship information) to the event venue seats using ticket records identifying the current ticket holder. In cases where the current ticket holder is not the original purchaser of the ticket, the system may use contact information, such as names\/addresses (e.g., email, SMS, MMS, or other address(es)) of those to whom tickets have been electronically or physically sent to), to identify who the current ticket holder is, even if the current ticket holder is not the original ticket purchaser. The relationship information and the ticket holder information may then be used to generate a seat map for the user, indicating where the user's friends are sitting or may be sitting. The seat map may be dynamically updated to include and display the user's friends' comments, photographs, and\/or videos submitted via a ticket system website, a social network site, a computer\/phone application, a short messaging service, or otherwise.","Optionally, the ticket system may receive such relationship information directly from the user instead of or in addition to receiving relationship from a social network site. For example, a form may be presented to the user asking the user to identify other users that the user considers friends. For example, the user may be asked to identify friends by providing the friends' names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone addresses, and\/or unique identifiers assigned by the system or selected by the friend, or otherwise identify the friends. By way of further example, the user may be asked to provide the system with access to the user's contact database, which may be used to determine who the user's friends are or might be.","In an example embodiment, if a user connects to a social network site, the ticket system receives from the social network system a user identifier (user ID) from the social network system. The ticket system may then use the user ID to request and retrieve from the social network system information regarding the user, such as the user's profile and an identification of those that are designated as friends of the user. Some or all of the retrieved information may then be displayed to other users as discussed elsewhere herein.","If a user indicates that the user will be attending an event (e.g., by responding, via an RSVP or otherwise, to an invitation to attend the event from another user or by purchasing a ticket) for which tickets are being sold via the ticket system, the ticket system stores the indication may transmit the indication (e.g., the RSVP) to the social network system, which may post the indication. An event for the ticketed event may then be established on the social network site, wherein selected users or all users may be provided with access to event information via the social network site, as described below.","For example, the event may include a description of the ticketed event, and the date, time, venue, and address of the event. Privacy settings may be set for the event, which specifies who can view the event information, and an invitation list may be defined as well. Invitations to attend the event may be transmitted by the social network system and\/or ticket system to members of the invitation list. An entry regarding the event (including some or all of the foregoing event information) may be displayed on one or more users' pages (e.g., in the form of a wall post), on a page associated with the ticket system operator, and\/or may be otherwise provided for display.","As similarly discussed above, the ticket system may also store user-to-seat information. For example, if a user has opted to tag the user's seats to an event (indicating who will be sitting in the seats purchased by the user), the user-to-seat data may be stored. The stored data may include an account identifier\/userID of the user for an account stored by the ticket system and\/or an account identifier\/userID associated with the user's social network site account, stored in association with seat identifiers for the user's seats. Optionally, such user-to-seat tag data is not transmitted to the social network system, although in certain embodiments, it may be transmitted to the social network system.","When a user accepts an invitation or tags seats and friends to an event, the ticket system may construct a wall post and transmit the wall post to the social network system. In turn, the social network system may return a wall post identifier, which is received by the ticket system and which may be used to track the wall post and to recall or delete the wall post if necessary or if desired.","By way of example, a constructed wall post may include some or all of the following information","1. Event details: name (e.g., performer name), date, time venue, address, webpage\/URL of event page and\/or of performer\/artist page.","2. Names of friends that were tagged for the event (optionally, excluding or including the friends' social network site user IDs).","In an example embodiment, if a user tags her\/his friends to an event, or invites the user's friends to an event, the ticket system constructs a social network site user-to-user application (\u201capp\u201d) request for a social network site app of the ticket system for the appropriate domain or, in addition or instead, the ticket system may construct a social network site user-to-user inbox message or other mechanism to deliver a message to the recipient user. In turn, the social network system returns an app request ID which is received by the ticket system. The ticket system may use the app request ID and\/or inbox message ID to track the request to thereby track individual app request and inbox message statuses and act accordingly, or to recall the app request invitation or inbox message when necessary or desired. The ticket system may store the individual user-to-user app requests or inbox message in a database.","An example app request or inbox message may include some or all of the following information:","1. Event details: name (e.g., performer name), date, time venue, address, webpage\/URL of event page and\/or of performer\/artist page.","2. An identifier (e.g., a userID) of the social network site user initiating or transmitting the request.","An indication that the user has purchased seats for the event and\/or a seat location identifier (e.g., section, row, seat number) may be posted by the ticket system and\/or the social network system for display on the user's social networking site page or other page\/document associated with the user (e.g., the user's own blog or website). This enables other users that have permission to view the user's page and\/or activity updates to view or be notified (by email, SMS message, MMS message, physical mail, automated voice message, or otherwise) of the user's ticket purchase and\/or the seat assigned to the user.","Optionally, a link may be provided on the user's social network site page, which, if activated, will cause a ticket purchase user interface, which enables the viewer to purchase tickets for the event, optionally for seats near the user's seats. Optionally, the system tracks when purchases have been made by users that navigated to the event ticket page via a link associated with another user's page, and made ticket purchases, and provides a benefit (e.g., a discount, a credit, a payment, a free musical item (e.g., a CD, MP3 song, etc.), a article of clothing, etc.) to such user whose page included the link.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0285","num":"0335"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0286","num":"0336"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0287","num":"0337"},"figref":"FIG. 25A"},"Once the user tags other users via the user interface illustrated in , the user activates a \u201cnext\u201d control, and the example user interface illustrated in  is provided for display.

In particular, some or all of the forgoing information may be used to determine the device's pose (position and orientation). For example, GPS information can be used to determine the latitude and longitude location of the user device, and gyroscopic orientation information can be used to determine the lens angle with reference to ground or other reference point or plane. Upon receiving an indication (e.g., via the application) that the device's camera is active (capturing images), and by knowing the user device pose, and the system can determine what is being displayed on the device's display.","The application and\/or server can also obtain seating information (e.g., including identifiers\/names associated with ticket holders) and user friend information (e.g., identifiers\/names associated with the user's friends obtained from the ticket system and\/or a social network system data stores) which may be compared to determine where and in which seats the user's friends are sitting. The server can forward to the application information as to where in the device display such seat and friend information are to be displayed. The application can then overlay onto the image captured by the camera names, photographs, and\/or seat identifiers of the user's friends so that the user can visually see where the user's friends are located. Optionally, the system may receive comments, photographs, and\/or videos posted by event attendees during the event.","For a given user, the system may determine who the user's friends are, and then stream the user's friends' comments, photographs, and\/or videos submitted via the application, a short messaging service interface, a social network interface, or otherwise, (and received by the system) in substantially real-time to the user's device for display via the augmented reality user interface. In addition, other types of information may be overlaid onto the camera view, such as highlights or other emphasis around entrances to bathrooms, concessions, other amenities, exits, the user automobile, etc. The emphasis may be visually coded (e.g., color coded, icon coded, etc.), where different codes may be used to identify different features or types of information (e.g., the type of service provided by an amenity (e.g., food, a bathroom, a water fountain, an automated teller machine).","In addition, the system may determine which of the user's friends have arrived at the venue based on an indication that their ticket (which may be a physical ticket, an electronic ticket in their phone, a credit card used to purchase the right to attend, etc.) has been scanned at the venue, via a presence signal received from the friends' mobile communication devices while at the venue (e.g., GPS information provided via a phone app hosted on the friends mobile communication devices), via an affirmative action by the friend (e.g., by activating an \u201cI have arrived\u201d control via an app hosted on the friend's mobile communication device), or otherwise (the system may similarly determine if the user is at the venue). When the user's device is pointing at a friend's seat, the system may code (e.g., color code, icon code, text code, etc.) the seat to indicate the friend has arrived (or that a friend has not arrived if their presence has not been detected). In addition or instead, a list may be presented to the user via an application or web page indicating which of the user's friends have arrive and which have not yet arrive.","In certain embodiments, the ticket system may determine if the user's view includes a performer, may access information regarding the performer, and cause the accessed information to be displayed via the user's device in association with the image of the performer.","In certain embodiments, the ticket system may determine if the user's view includes seats for which event tickets have not yet been purchased. The system may optionally identify the seats as being available to the user via an augmented reality indication overlaying the view (e.g., textually, graphically, or otherwise). A control may be provided via which the user can purchase at a specified price, via their device, a ticket\/upgrade for the seat, which then may be electronically delivered to their device to be displayed or otherwise communicated to others (e.g., to an usher) to indicate that the user has a right to utilize the seat. Optionally, before indicating to the user that a seat is available, the system may first determine if the seat is a better seat than the user's current seat (e.g., have a better view, is closer to the stage or playing field), based on rankings or other information stored in a database. If the seat is not better (e.g., has a similar, the same, or lower ranking than the user's current seat), optionally the system does not identify the seat as being available to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0311","num":"0361"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["102","2802"]},"The process may cause a field to be presented via which the user may enter an offer code. For example, the offer code may entitle the user to purchase seats that are not available to the general public or to certain people absent the offer code. In addition or instead, the offer code may entitle the user to reduced prices\/discounts on some or all seat tickets and\/or may entitle the user to a package (e.g., a musical recording, food, and\/or an item of clothing, in addition to the event ticket).","If the user has been identified by the system (e.g., via a login process at a ticketing website, a social network website, via a token, a unique user terminal identifier, or otherwise identified), the map may be customized for the user. For example, at state , automatically or in response to a user instruction to show where the user's friends are sitting, the process may identify certain other people as having a social relationship with the user (which, for convenience, will be referred to as \u201cfriends) from information accessed from a social network account of the user. The database may be part of a social network site hosted by the ticketing system or separately hosted and operated. In addition, information regarding such friends (e.g., names, email addresses, wall postings, activities, etc.) may be accessed from the social network account of such people. The process may use identifying information regarding the friends (e.g., their names, emails addresses, etc.) to locate, in a ticketing database, user records that include some or all of such identifying information. A ticketing database user record may indicate which seat tickets for which events are being held by the respective user. The process may then determine which friends are ticket holders for the event and determine for which seats the friends hold tickets. The map may then be generated or modified to include indicators as to where friends of the user are sitting (e.g., at a section level and\/or at a seat level). The indicators may be in the form of color coding, icon, friend name, friend photograph, or otherwise. Different indicators may be used depending on how detailed the map being presented to the user is.","At state , the process receives from the user a selection of a venue section (e.g., by the user clicking on or hovering a cursor over the section in the map) or a modification of the user's search criteria (e.g., by the user specifying or modifying a desired price range, ticket type, package type, seating area, shade seating, seating in the sun, covered seating, aisle seating, bathroom adjacent seating, concession adjacent seating, exit adjacent seating, friends seating, etc.).","At state , the map provided for display to the user is updated, optionally in substantially real-time, to reflect the section selection, the modified search criteria, and\/or system initiated modifications (e.g., to reflect the change in status of seats). For example, if the user selected a section, the process may provide, via the user terminal, a zoomed view of the section so that seats can be individually viewed and selected. If the user modified the search criteria, the map coloring (or other indicator) may indicate which sections and\/or seats match the user's search criteria and\/or the degree to which the sections and\/or seats match the user's search criteria. At state , a user seat selection is received (e.g., by a user clicking on a seat icon in the map or by entering a seat identifier into a field), and the selected seat(s) are added to the user's selected seat list and are assigned a reserved status. In this example embodiment, when the seats are in a reserved state, other users may not purchase the tickets, although optionally they can be wait-listed for the tickets, wherein the wait-listed user may be notified when the reserved seats become available for purchase (and are no longer reserved by another user). In certain embodiments, the reserved seats may be released for others to purchase (wherein the status is changed from reserved to available), if the user does not complete the ticket purchase and\/or certain stages of the ticket purchase, within a specified period of time.","At state , the user activates a checkout control, and the process processes the order (e.g., obtains or retrieves payment information, shipment information, etc.), and causes the ticket(s) to be delivered to the user (e.g., electronically or as a physical ticket) and\/or enables an existing user physical or electronic document (e.g., a credit card, license, membership card, etc.) to be used as a ticket. The user may be automatically be tagged into a seat selected by the user and\/or purchased by the user, or the user may manually instruct the process to tag the user into the seat. Optionally, a user interface is provided via which the user can tag others into one or more seats.","At state , the process may receive an instruction from the user to transmit invitations to attend the event to one or more people and\/or a group of people designated by the user. The process may then transmit such invitations to those so designated directly via the system  or via another system (e.g., via the social network system  illustrated in ). The invitation may indicate by user name and\/or photograph that the user is attending the event (e.g., wherein the invitation includes the event name, date, time, venue, and\/or user seat location), and may provide a control, which when activated will cause a ticketing interface to be presented to the invitation recipient via which the user may purchase a ticket for the event (e.g., using the process illustrated in ).","At state , the process may post to one or more pages (e.g., to a social network wall pages of the user, to an event-specific page for the event, to the user's friend's pages, and\/or other pages), an entry indicating that the user is attending the event, wherein the posting optionally includes some or all of the following information: event name, date, time, venue, user seat location, number of people attending, number of seats available, etc.","Optionally, once at the venue to attend the ticketed event, the system can provide for display on a mobile communications device of the user (or other terminal), a mapping showing where friends of the user have seats, and may further color code (or otherwise indicate) the seats to indicate which friends have already arrived at the venue. For example, seats may be colored green to indicate seats that are assigned to the user's friends, and seats may be colored gold to indicate which seats are assigned to the user's friends that have arrived at the event. The system may determine which friends of the user have arrived via information scanned from physical or electronic tickets of the user's friends upon entry to the venue and\/or via location information provided via a mobile terminal of the user (e.g., a cell phone). For example, a scanner may scan:\n\n","In addition or instead, a gate keeper, attendees, or other person may manually key in, via a terminal, an indication as to who has arrived at the event venue.","The system may store an indication as to who has arrived at the event based at least in part on the scanned information. Then, when a user views a map via a terminal, the system identifies the user (e.g., via log in information, a unique identifier associated with the user's terminal, a unique identifier associated with the user's viewing application, or otherwise), identifies friends of the user that have tickets for the event, identifies which of those friends have arrived, and displays corresponding information on the map. The map may be updated, optionally in substantially real time, to indicate changes in the friends' statuses. For example, when a friend arrives at the venue or purchases a ticket, the map may be accordingly updated to so indicate. The map may indicate (via text or otherwise) at what time a friend arrived, the current location of the friend, and\/or other information.","In certain embodiments, the system may track a user's location at an event venue and\/or outside an event venue to thereby provide location based services. For example, the user's location may be tracked at the venue (e.g., via GPS, cell tower, and\/or WiFi information received by the user's mobile device, and transmitted via a ticket-related application hosted on the mobile device to the system; or via a transceiver that receives information from a near field communication device carried by the user). Such information may be used to determine a user's location at the event venue, and to provide information for display to the user (via a map, text information, and\/or otherwise) that may be of interest to the user related to the user's current location and\/or direction of movement. For example, the system may utilize the user's location information, in conjunction with venue layout information stored in a database, to determine the nearest restrooms, concessions, and\/or exits relative to the user, and to provide directions to such destinations and\/or display a map of such destinations while showing the user's current location on the map.","By way of further example, a map mode may be changed based on the user's location. By way of illustration, a map of a venue may be displayed in a ticket purchase mode or in an at-the-venue mode, wherein different information may be displayed depending on the mode. For example, when in a ticket purchase mode, a venue event map may display information on ticket pricing and seat availability, and may provide ticket purchase controls, as discussed above. Optionally information regarding the location of concessions, bathrooms, etc., is not displayed or is hidden (although optionally such may still be accessible if the user activates a corresponding control). When in an at-the-venue mode, the ticket pricing and seat availability information and\/or the provide ticket purchase controls may be removed or not displayed (although optionally they may still be accessible if the user activates a corresponding control). However, in the at-the-venue mode, information as to who has arrived may be displayed and other information of interest to an attendee may be displayed (e.g., locations of exits, concessions, bathrooms, etc.). Optionally, the mode is automatically switched from ticket purchase mode to at-the-venue mode when the user enters the venue on the day of the event (as detected when the user's physical or electronic ticket is scanned or via information transmitted from the user's terminal, such as GPS or WiFi location information).","Optionally, when the user is at the venue for an event (as may be determined using one or more of the location determination techniques described herein), an application installed on the user's terminal will automatically display the venue map for the event, without requiring the user to manually select the specific map for the venue (although the user may need to open initiate the application and\/or may need to indicate that the user wants to view a venue map without having to name the venue or select the specific venue from a list of venue\u2014such as by activating a \u201cshow current venue\u201d control). The map may be transmitted to the user terminal via a ticket system.","In addition, such user location information may be used to determine line lengths\/wait times at concessions, bathrooms, exits, or other locations\/destinations selected by the user and\/or the system. For example, if the system determines, from user location information and a venue layout, that a user is standing within a certain distance of a facility (e.g., a bathroom, concession stand, or exit) and appears to be moving in the direction of the facility within a certain speed range (e.g., slower than 0.2 feet\/second), the system may infer that the user is waiting in line for the facility. The system may further use the foregoing location and movement information to estimate the length of the line, as expressed in time (e.g., a 4-5 minute wait) and\/or distance (e.g., a 20 foot line). Such line length information can be transmitted for display on the user's terminal (e.g., via a map, textually, and\/or via an email, SMS, MMS message(s)) and\/or on other users' terminals. A map and\/or text listing may be provided for display via a user terminal, providing line wait information for a plurality of destinations of a given type (e.g., bathrooms), so that the user can select a destination with an acceptable or shortest line length. Optionally, the system determines from the line lengths, a user's current location and\/or movement information, and the locations of destinations of a given type, which of the destinations of the given type the user will likely reach\/be able to utilize the quickest, and may so identify the corresponding destination to the user as being the fastest available.","For example, if a bathroom within 100 feet of a user has a 5 minute line, and a bathroom within 200 feet of the user has a 1 minute line, the system may determine that the bathroom located 200 feet from the user will be usable by the user quicker than the closer bathroom. The system may transmit for display to the user such time information (via a map and\/or text listing) for a plurality of destinations of the given type and may rank and\/or list the destinations in order of the estimated relative speed the destinations may be reached or usable.","In addition, communications may be transmitted to a given event attendee before, during, and\/or after an event, requesting information and\/or offering goods and services. For example, the communication may be transmitted to a terminal (e.g., computer, phone, television) of an attendee the same day or the day after the event, while the event is still fresh in the attendee's mind, asking the attendee to submit a review of the event, which may then be posted online in association with an offer to sell tickets to another event by the same performer. In addition or instead, the communication may offer musical recordings (e.g., in the form of a CD, DVD, Blu-ray disk or digital download) of the performer (e.g., a live recording of the concert event the attendee attended or another recording of the performer) for sale or at no charge to the user.","While certain embodiments may be illustrated or discussed as having certain example components, additional, fewer, or different components may be used. Process described as being performed by a ticket system may be performed by a user terminal or other system or systems. Processes described as being performed by a user terminal may be performed by a ticket system or other system or systems. Data described as being accessed from a given source, such as a ticket system database, may be stored by and accessed from other sources, such as a user terminal or social network database. Further, with respect to the processes discussed herein, various states may be performed in a different order, not all states are required to be reached, and fewer, additional, or different states may be utilized. While certain embodiments may refer to coding certain information (e.g., information regarding seats on a seating chart) using a particular technique, other techniques, including color, textual, graphical, animations, video, audio, and\/or other indicators may be used instead or in addition. User interfaces described herein are optionally presented (and user instructions may be received) via a user computing device using a browser, other network resource viewer, or otherwise. For example, the user interfaces may be presented (and user instructions received) via an application (sometimes referred to as an \u201capp\u201d), such as an app configured specifically for ticket-related activities, installed on the user's mobile phone, laptop, pad, desktop, television, set top box, or other terminal. Various features described or illustrated as being present in different embodiments or user interfaces may be combined into the same embodiment or user interface.","While the disclosure may reference to a user hovering over or pointing at a particular item, such as a section or seat, other techniques may be used to detect an item of user interest. For example, the user may click on such an item to show interest, touch the item via a touch screen, or otherwise indicate an interest.","Various aspects and advantages of the embodiments have been described where appropriate.
